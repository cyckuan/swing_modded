<HEADLINE>  Hockey Player Steve Chiasson Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Hours after his team was eliminated from  
the Stanley Cup playoffs, Carolina Hurricanes defenseman Steve 
Chiasson was killed when his pickup truck flipped on a dark, lonely 
road. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old player was found about 4:15 a.m. EDT Monday in  
north Raleigh, and the State Highway Patrol says he might have been 
speeding after drinking alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the truck rolled and ejected Chiasson, who  
was not wearing a seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tragedy that is impossible to put into words,'' said  
Jim Rutherford, Carolina president and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours earlier in Boston, the Bruins ended the Hurricanes' season  
with a 2-0 victory in Game 6. On Friday night, Chiasson scored the 
first goal in a 4-3 double-overtime loss to the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you work together in our environment, you have a family  
among players and an extended family among wives and children that 
go to school together and play on sports teams together,'' Carolina 
coach Paul Maurice said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really an environment unlike any other,'' Maurice said.  
``When a tragedy like this has happened, unfortunately ... there's 
no other way to put it except for we've lost a member of our 
family. It's a very painful time for all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added NHL commissioner Gary Bettman: ``When a young life ends  
prematurely, when a young family loses a husband and a father, 
words cannot begin to express our sorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team spokesman Chris Brown said two cases of beer and water,  
sports drinks, milk and vegetable juice were served on the team's 
charter flight to Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't know how much beer, if any, Chiasson drank. After the  
plane landed about 1 a.m. at Raleigh-Durham International Airport, 
the players got into their vehicles and left. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get on the plane, you're pretty disappointed,'' said  
Brown, fighting tears. ``We lost a playoff series, but you figure 
out that it doesn't really matter. You get a dose of reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson spent eight years with the Detroit Red Wings, was  
traded to the Calgary Flames in 1994 and in 1997 to what then was 
the Hartford Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was drafted by Detroit in 1985 and played his first NHL game  
the following year. In 1988-89, he led all Red Wings' defensemen 
with 47 points. In 1989-90, he scored a career-high 14 goals and 
again led all Detroit defensemen in scoring with 42 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve was a member of the Red Wings' family for several years  
and continued to be a close friend to individual players and staff, 
as well as the organization. We are deeply saddened by this tragic 
loss,'' the Red Wings said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson played in his first NHL All-Star game in 1993. At  
Calgary, he was rated second among Flames' defensemen in scoring in 
1995-96 with 33 points and notched his 300th NHL career point on 
Nov. 29, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson is survived by his wife, Susan, two sons and a  
daughter.

<HEADLINE> Fatal Tornado Hits Oklahoma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- A half-mile wide tornado tore through the  
central part of the state tonight, wiping out whole neighborhoods, 
killing at least four people and injuring hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard it, the house started shaking and then the big  
rumble,'' said 74-year-old Katherine Burch, who hid in the bathroom 
of her southwest Oklahoma City during the storm. ``Glass and 
everything flew in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police and emergency workers combed through the debris as  
darkness fell, searching for survivors. Crumpled cars littered two 
highways. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are getting so many injuries we are just tagging them and  
bringing them in,'' said Shara Findley, a spokeswoman for Hillcrest 
Health Center in Oklahoma City. ``We're getting everything you can 
think of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four persons were killed in Midwest City, just southeast of  
Oklahoma City, according to Ben Frizzell, spokesman for the state 
Office of Emergency Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Midwest Regional Medical Center said it was treating at least  
100 injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are coming in all the doors,'' said spokeswoman Jill  
Fraim. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado was one of several that formed over a 5-hour period,  
beginning in southwest Oklahoma and stretching northeast. Damage 
was reported with some of the storms, but none were as devastating 
as the one that tore through the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
	Television reports showed hundreds of destroyed homes. Heavy  
damage was reported in Moore, east of Oklahoma City, where rows of 
houses were destroyed and scores of trucks overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas leaked from several locations Monday night. Power  
lines and piles of carpet were everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's gone,'' LeeAnn Richardson said as she looked toward where  
her home once stood. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Richardson said she and others were watching the weather on  
television when they decided to run into the storm cellar after 
clouds rolled in and rain poured down. Sixteen people and four pets 
were in there with her. 
</P>
<P>
	All survived without injury, but: ``We opened up and everything  
was gone,'' Ms. Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The twister was first reported about 5:50 p.m., but had not  
caused significant damage to homes until moving closer to Oklahoma 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Power lines popped and debris flew as the twister moved along  
from Chickasha, about 35 miles southwest of Oklahoma City, and cut 
through the heavily populated Oklahoma City metro area. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth Seymore sat on the tailgate of a pickup truck being used as  
a treatment center by a Red Cross volunteer. Injured people waited 
for ambulances. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just demolished,'' Ms. Seymore said of her home in  
Moore. ``Everything fell in on me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she hid in a closet and became trapped by the debris.  
</P>
<P>
	``They couldn't hardly get me out of there. I couldn't get  
anybody to find me. I kept hollering `Help!' ''

	Clinton Says Bombing Will Continue  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite the release of three American POWs,  
President Clinton said today the U.S.-led NATO campaign against 
Yugoslavia will not end until Slobodan Milosevic ``shows he is 
ready to end the nightmare for the people of Kosovo.'' As Jesse 
Jackson's plane touched down at a nearby Air Force base, returning 
the civil rights leader from his mission to free the three 
soldiers, Clinton thanked him for the free-lance diplomatic effort. 
But he said the United States cannot forget the plight of Kosovo 
refugees. ``When will these people see their home again, with the 
safety and rights Mr. Milosevic has often pledged but never 
delivered?'' Clinton said in a joint news conference with Japanese 
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.

	Clinton Warns Japan on Trade  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Bill Clinton warned Japan today to  
reduce its steel imports ``on a consistent basis'' or the United 
States will act to block those imports. During a news conference, 
Clinton said he reiterated to Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi 
that the United States would act to keep Japanese steel out of U.S. 
markets if those imports continue to exceed levels prior to the 
Asian economic crisis.

<P>
	LANDSTUHL, Germany (AP) -- Doctors examining the three U.S.  
soldiers freed yesterday have found injuries that may raise 
questions about their treatment in Yugoslavia. Staff Sgt. Andrew 
Ramirez had two fractured ribs, and Staff Sgt. Christopher Stone 
had a broken nose. But the men enjoyed their first full day of 
freedom today as they were reunited with their families.

	BRAZDA, Macedonia (AP) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair said  
today he will double aid for Kosovo Albanians and will not be 
swayed from efforts to ``defeat the policies of ethnic cleansing.'' 
Blair visited Macedonia's largest refugee camp and said Britain 
would increase its refugee aid contributions to $64 million, and 
take in more ethnic Albanians fleeing the southern Yugoslav 
province. More than 170,000 refugees are presently in Macedonia, 
according to U.N. officials.

</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Chatfield High School welcomed students  
today from former rival Columbine High School, who returned to 
class for the first time since a deadly rampage nearly two weeks 
ago. Chatfield students had morning classes. The roughly 2,000 
Columbine students, whose school is still a police crime scene, are 
attending afternoon sessions. Three large banners adorned 
Chatfield, one reading: ``Welcome Columbine.'' The schools are 
about three miles apart. ``They've been really nice, very 
supportive,'' one Columbine student said of the Chatfield students 
and staff. ``I didn't think they would want us here.''

	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Charles Ng should be put to death for  
murdering 11 people in the mid-1980s, a jury recommended today. The 
recommendation may be accepted by Orange County Superior Court 
Judge John J. Ryan or reduced to life in prison without parole. The 
jury deliberated for 15 hours over three days. Ng showed no 
reaction as the jury's verdict was read and the jurors were somber 
and calm as they were polled individually. Each responded, ``Yes,'' 
when asked if it was his verdict.

	US Scientists Study Malaysia Virus  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- U.S. scientists are probing a mysterious  
microscopic enemy that has killed more than 100 people in Malaysia 
in seven months. Researchers are baffled about the origin and mode 
of transmission of the rare form of viral encephalitis, which 
spread from pigs to humans. It first surfaced last year near the 
northern city of Ipoh. It has since sickened more than 250 
Malaysians, mostly pig farmers. Soldiers have killed almost 1 
million pigs and some stray dogs to try to curb the virus. Medical 
authorities named the new virus Nipah, after the village where it 
was first isolated.

	Scientists Spot Possible Moon Bases  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers say three sites located near the  
Moon's south pole provide nearly constant sunlight and could be 
ideal for future bases. Having nearly constant light means the 
bases could use solar energy, reducing or eliminating the need for 
other energy sources, according to the team lead by D. Ben J. 
Bussey of the European Space Agency in Noordwijk, Netherlands. The 
temperature at the suggested sites is relatively constant because 
of the steady light and was estimated at about -64 degrees 
Fahrenheit.

Baltimore playing in Havana. It is the first game ever between a 
Cuban team and a major league team in the United States. The 
Orioles defeated the Cubans 3-2 in 11 innings on March 28. Cuban

<HEADLINE> AOL Unlikely Comcast Buyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It looks less likely that Microsoft or America  
Online will take on AT&AMP;T Corp. in the bidding for MediaOne's 
coveted cable systems, a battle that might have been the 
highest-profile duel on Wall Street since RJR Nabisco. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing that's certain: Monday wasn't an encouraging day for  
Comcast, the cable company that's been trumped in its bid to buy 
MediaOne. 
</P>
<P>
	First, MediaOne announced that it has ditched their merger  
agreement in favor of AT&AMP;T's sweeter offer. Then, AOL reportedly 
pulled out as a possible Comcast partner. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no word, meanwhile, from Microsoft, the other company  
examining MediaOne's books, about whether the software giant is 
really intent on helping resurrect the Comcast bid. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL declined to comment Monday on a CNBC report saying it won't  
be joining the fray. The company's chairman, Steve Case, speculated 
last week that his company might be interested working with 
MediaOne. 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast, which also had nothing to say Monday, still has until  
Thursday night to cobble together a better offer than AT&AMP;T's. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite fears that AT&AMP;T will dominate the potential online  
and telephone riches to be mined from cable TV wires, analysts were 
growing less optimistic that a competing offer would emerge. For 
one thing, Microsoft and AOL simply may not want to become cable 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think (Comcast's) partners want to be as deeply into  
cable as some people are assuming they do,'' said Tom Vanderslice, 
managing director for media corporate finance at CIBC Oppenheimer. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, however, has already committed itself to the cable  
business though its purchase of TCI, the nation's second biggest 
system, and an alliance with Time Warner, the biggest. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft and AOL don't have the same incentive. If the goal of  
buying MediaOne is to use cable TV wires for Internet access and 
phone calls, what good does it do to own the nation's fourth 
largest cable company if it means alienating AT&AMP;T, which already 
has access to the two biggest? 
</P>
<P>
	``AT&AMP;T needs MediaOne more than Comcast does and more than  
Microsoft does,'' Thomas Eagan, a cable industry for PaineWebber 
Group, who also expressed doubt that Comcast, Microsoft and AOL 
have enough in common to join forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's impossible for all these companies to get along. Although  
they have interests in common, they also have interests that 
compete with each other,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's bad news for those who were relishing the thought of  
high-powered struggle among some of the most influential companies 
and executives in corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
	A bidding war pitting AT&AMP;T Chairman C. Michael Armstrong against  
AOL's Case and Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates might have been the 
most captivating on Wall Street since the battle for RJR Nabisco in 
1989 -- or, more recently, the battle that Viacom's Sumner Redstone 
won over QVC's Barry Diller for Paramount in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	If AT&AMP;T wins, the No. 1 long-distance company will also be the  
No. 1 cable company, having access to 60 percent of the U.S. homes 
wired for cable. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, MediaOne said its board of directors felt the AT&AMP;T  
offer, initially valued at $55.8 billion in stock and cash, was a 
``superior proposal'' to Comcast's bid, which was worth about $48 
billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has structured the deal so that if its share price drops as  
much as 10 percent below $57, the amount paid MediaOne shareholders 
-- equivalent to about $85 a share -- would not decline. 
</P>
<P>
	In Monday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, MediaOne  
fell $1.93 3/4, or 2.3 percent, to $79.68 3/4 per share, while AT&AMP;T rose 
56 1/4 cents to $51.06 1/4. On the Nasdaq Stock Market, Comcast's class A 
common stock rose $3.06 1/4, or nearly 5 percent, to $65.93 3/4 a share.

<HEADLINE> Grissom's Widow Laments Capsule Find </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The salvagers who found Gus  
Grissom's 38-year-old Mercury space capsule are eager to go back 
and raise it from the ocean floor. But the astronaut's widow 
lamented the discovery and called it ``a sad day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It brings back memories and there's nothing good,'' Betty  
Grissom said from her Houston home Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband's capsule, the only U.S. manned spacecraft ever lost  
after a successful mission, was discovered Saturday night 300 miles 
southeast of Cape Canaveral, three miles beneath the surface of the 
Atlantic. It was remarkably well-preserved. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at this,'' expedition leader Curt Newport gushed as he  
showed a video of the capsule to reporters. ``You can see the 
lettering, United States, on the side of it. It's clear. Look at 
the periscope. The periscope is still extended. You can see the 
periscope flap sticking out. Look at the landing bag straps. 
They're still shiny. I mean, is that the most amazing thing you've 
seen or what?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newport and his team had to leave Liberty Bell 7 where it was.  
The robotic rover that was used to identify and photograph the 
spacecraft, and also would have been used to recover it, sank in 
rough seas just four hours after the discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport figures it will take at least three to four weeks for  
his team to obtain another recovery vessel. (The Discovery Channel, 
which funded the expedition, is picking up the entire tab.) 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, he plans to review his sonar charts to  
determine whether one of the 87 other targets in the area might be 
the missing hatch. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Bell 7 sank on July 21, 1961, just after Grissom  
splashed down. The explosive bolts for blowing open the hatch 
detonated prematurely, and the spacecraft filled with so much water 
that helicopter rescuers could not pull it from the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	The mishap forever marred Grissom's otherwise successful  
15-minute suborbital flight. Some speculated -- and still do -- that 
Grissom may have bumped something or panicked, as was suggested in 
Tom Wolfe's 1979 book, ``The Right Stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASA exonerated Grissom and he went on to fly in the Gemini  
project, but died in the 1967 Apollo launch pad fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gus is not here anymore and he cannot say anything,'' Mrs.  
Grissom said. ``But as far as I'm concerned about Liberty Bell at 
this point, NASA is going to have to take control of it and do a 
thorough investigation because of all the rumors and lay some of 
those rumors to rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want the experts at the cape'' when the capsule is brought  
back, she added. ``I want every little scratch on there and I want 
it reported.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Grissom opposes having the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space  
Center restore Liberty Bell 7, as is the plan. ``Clean it up and 
that's it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport said the hatch may hold the answer to the mystery. But  
he stressed: ``It makes no difference to me why it sank. It's not 
my intention to drag up that controversy.''

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested In Colo. Shooting Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A 22-year-old man was arrested today on  
suspicion of supplying the Columbine High School gunmen with a 
semiautomatic handgun, one of four weapons used in their rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Manes was booked for investigation of providing a handgun  
to a minor, a charge that carries a maximum six years in prison. He 
was released on bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they do not know if Manes knew what the guns would  
be used for, but an attorney for Manes said his client knew nothing 
of the impending massacre that left 15 dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was horrified when it happened,'' attorney Robert Ransome  
said. ``I would like to say he has followed the path of integrity 
from the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manes is the first person since the April 20 shootings to be  
arrested on charges of helping Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 
17, arm themselves and assemble more than 50 bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other arrest in the case is that of a man accused of  
lying about the two teens having bought possible bomb supplies at a 
hardware store. Police are still trying to determine if others had 
a hand in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've always, from day one, had a feeling that there had to  
be some people who had some knowledge or helped them plan or build 
some of these bombs,'' Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman Steve 
Davis said. ``I think they're still leaning that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said an employee at the pizza parlor where Harris  
and Klebold worked put the two teen-agers in touch with Manes and a 
TEC DC-9 semiautomatic pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the last person who had it before it was supplied to  
one of our gunmen,'' said Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear which gunman obtained the weapon or  
when, Davis said, or whether it was sold, traded or given to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes' first court hearing was scheduled for Tuesday morning.  
</P>
<P>
	Columbine students returned to classes at Chatfield High School  
on Monday. But administrators decided it would be best if friends 
of Harris and Klebold were taught at home for the rest of the year. 
The parents agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Primarily, for their well-being, and because it's a very  
uncomfortable and difficult time for everyone involved,'' said Rick 
Kaufman, a spokesman for the school district. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaufman declined to say how many students were affected,  
although Davis put the number at eight to 10. He said he did not 
know whether they were associated with the gunmen's clique known as 
the Trenchcoat Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators also have banned trench coats at every school in  
Jefferson County, which has 89,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
	Students at Chatfield, which has a sports rivalry with  
Columbine, went out of their way to welcome the 1,900 Columbine 
students. The Chatfield students tacked up banners in hallways and 
outside the school and distributed ribbons that blended their 
school's burgundy with Columbine's navy blue. 
</P>
<P>
	They also handed out T-shirts that bore a ``C,'' with clasped  
hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can do anything to help them, we're happy to do it,''  
said Amber Mancuso, 17, a Chatfield junior. ``I think it's hit all 
of us hard, all of us have friends there. When we found out, 
probably half the school was crying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uniformed sheriff's deputies, police officers and five guards  
patrolled the school grounds, and students had to show 
identification before filing into Chatfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be nice to see the other kids and get back in  
the classroom, not necessarily to learn, but to see people and get 
back into the routine of things,'' said senior Nathan Montgomery, 
19. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Columbine students were apprehensive about returning to  
classes while their own school remained a massive crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really nervous about it,'' said sophomore Krysti DeHoff,  
16. ``I don't really want to go back because I keep feeling like 
something's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Klebold killed 12 schoolmates and a teacher before  
they killed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have said that Robyn Anderson, Klebold's girlfriend,  
purchased the other three weapons used, two rifles and a shotgun 
and has been interviewed as a witness. Under Colorado law, an 
18-year old without a felony record can furnish minors with rifles 
and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson has made no public comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Five of the 23 students who were wounded at Columbine remained  
hospitalized Monday, two in serious condition and three in fair

<HEADLINE> Student View on Colo. Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDITOR'S NOTE -- Kim Blair, 17, is a junior at Columbine High  
School and a reporter for the school newspaper, The Courier.	
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- There was a lot of sadness among the  
students and teachers as we all returned to school today, but 
everyone also was really happy to see each other again after all 
we've been through. 
</P>
<P>
	The students missed their classmates. I did. There were empty  
desks in a few of my classes. It was sad seeing them, but it was 
hopeful, too, because some of the seats would be filled next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, you could walk up to someone you didn't know and just  
give them a big hug and say, ``I'm glad you're OK. How are you? And 
where were you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	I was outside Columbine High School two weeks ago when the  
shooting began. I saw the two students take their guns out of black 
duffel bags, nod to each other, and then the shooting began outside 
the school next to the library. 
</P>
<P>
	I ran inside the school after Ann Marie Hochhalter, 17, was shot  
in the chest. She is in the hospital and missed school today. 
</P>
<P>
	She was right next to me, maybe just two feet away, when it  
happened. I went inside to call for help. Then I ran out when my 
boyfriend, Jason Autenrieth, said he would help Ann Marie. 
</P>
<P>
	At our first day of classes at Chatfield Senior High School, I  
saw the memorials they dedicated to us. It was really comforting, 
knowing that we have been rivals for so many years and that they 
care so much. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really nervous to be back at school, but I'm glad that we  
all have come together like we have,'' said junior Sarah Slater, 
16. ``To have that reassurance will get me through the rest of the 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though the homework will be stacking up again, I'm  
anxious to see my classmates,'' my friend, Melinda Fenimore, 16, a 
junior, told me as we were getting ready for a special assembly in 
the gym. 
</P>
<P>
	No one did any lessons on today. We'll start that on tomorrow.  
Some of the teachers talked about how they didn't know what we were 
going to do the rest of the semester. They said that our grades 
probably will be determined from the last report card we got three 
or four weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The teachers also talked to us about their feelings, and how if  
we ever needed them, their doors would be open for us. Other 
teachers talked about the students that were injured and weren't in 
class today. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, before classes began, the students greeted each other  
with smiles and many embraced. They laughed and talked about not 
being in school for so long. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a lot of pride, too. A majority of the students and  
faculty wore their ``We Are Columbine'' T-shirts that were given to 
us when we picked up our schedules Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a brand new school for us, but there were banners and  
posters throughout. Many said, ``CSH (Chatfield Senior High) and 
CHS (Columbine High School) unite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another said, ``With helping hands and open hearts, we welcome  
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the assembly, the students gave Principal Frank DeAngelis a  
standing ovation because he has shown a lot of strength and 
leadership. We wanted to thank him for that. He's always been there 
for us. 
</P>
<P>
	Students meandered through the halls, searching for their  
classes, for much of the day. But it was good seeing everybody back 
in school. And nobody wore a trench coat.

<HEADLINE> March Amtrak Wreck Links Strangers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Bob Curwick crouched in the crumpled,  
burning dining car, in heat so intense that his rubber gloves 
started to melt. 
</P>
<P>
	A few feet away, barely lighted by the flickering orange glow of  
the flames, he could see panic in the faces of Susan Falls and her 
teen-age daughter, Jennifer. 
</P>
<P>
	They had been strangers only moments before. Now, as they talked  
about their homes and their families, they shared the same fearful 
question: Were their lives about to end? 
</P>
<P>
	``If you die, I'm going to die with you,'' Curwick told the  
women, ``and I'm too ornery to die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Susan and Jennifer were there by chance, passengers on Amtrak's  
City of New Orleans when it slammed into a steel-laden semitrailer. 
Curwick was there by choice -- one of 30 steelworkers at a nearby 
factory who heard the crash and came running to help. 
</P>
<P>
	In this terrifying moment, a friendship was born.  
</P>
<P>
	``Whether you like it or not, you're family now,'' Susan Falls  
would tell Curwick later, when he visited mother and daughter in 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	It is that way for the survivors of the wreck, and for the  
people of this place that calls itself ``The Friendly Village.'' In 
the weeks since they were brought together so abruptly, it has 
become clear: They are joined forever. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amtrak train's 200 passengers never meant to stop here; had  
the truck not driven into the train's path, they would have whizzed 
by this once-rural village of 16,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But at 9:47 p.m., March 15, their voyage ended here. Eleven  
died, more than 100 were injured, and Bourbonnais became a place of 
refuge and succor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Farm and Fleet store manager cleared space for a makeshift  
triage room, right next to the lawn mowers and the customer service 
desk. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotel managers turned away business to take in passengers; one  
drove an elderly couple to Wal-Mart to buy shoes, toothbrushes and 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	A teacher comforted a man desperately searching for his mother.  
The coroner learned to recognize the voice on the phone of a father 
whose two daughters died in the sleeping car. A pastor found an 
example of true faith in a family he was supposed to counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	And a photographer's wife made a connection with a dazed,  
injured woman -- even if she will never know her name. Lori Ann 
Grzelak cannot stop thinking of the elderly woman with a back 
injury, a pink blanket draped around her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wondered who she was? What happened to her? Did she lose  
somebody? Was she able to go home?'' Mrs. Grzelak said. ``Her eyes. 
I'll never forget this hurting -- like watching a zombie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cindy and Rich McBarnes, along with their 24-year-old daughter  
Erin, set up cots, poured coffee and wrote down names at the school 
where passengers were brought from the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich remembers a couple who came in wearing hospital scrubs and  
booties, holding three children wrapped in blankets. Each child had 
been stitched up. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindy was struck by the plight of a woman with an injured back  
who snuggled with her two little boys. Eventually, the woman had to 
go to the hospital and trust a volunteer to care for her sons at a 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	And Erin remembers the man who was desperately searching for his  
mother, first calling Amtrak, then the hotels, then the hospitals, 
repeating the routine all night. The next day, Erin, a teacher like 
her parents, learned his mother had died in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``You remember those people, and there are faces you'll never  
forget. Those frantic faces,'' Erin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Orrison deals with death every day as the Kankakee County  
coroner and a former funeral director. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I started seeing their pictures on television, I started  
having more of a realization that these were real people,'' Orrison 
said. ``I've dealt with death all my adult life. These people were 
strangers to me until I started seeing their pictures. That kind of 
puts it home to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's so close to the victims' families that they're on a  
first-name basis when they call to check on the status of the 
coroner's inquest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Paul Mount of the Bethel Baptist Church in Bourbonnais  
helped counsel families of those who died. 
</P>
<P>
	He was awed by the faith of the Lipscomb family, who lost two  
young daughters, a family friend and the friend's granddaughter. 
Rather than talk about anger at God, the Lipscombs discussed their 
belief that God will see them through the dark days and months 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``To see people like that -- their faith is really not just for  
the good times but faith for all time. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't mean they don't hurt. That doesn't mean they  
don't grieve. That doesn't mean they're not going to have hard days 
ahead. That doesn't mean they will go around with a smile on their 
face all the time,'' Mount said. ``It does mean they go around with 
peace in their heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the weeks since the crash, life has mostly returned to normal  
here. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents are curious as to whether the driver of the truck will  
be charged with any crime, but there is no thirst for vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Falls invited Bob Curwick to visit the family in  
Mississippi this summer, and he's considering it. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Grzelak has signed up to take training in emergency medical  
treatment. ``I never want to feel that helpless again,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A monument to those who died and those who aided in the rescue  
is planned for a park in the center of town. It will probably be 
dedicated next year, on the anniversary of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	And connections are still being made.  
</P>
<P>
	In a first-grade classroom at St. Joseph's school, where  
Curwick's son Andy is a pupil, children in plaid uniforms scurry 
around making decorations and cards for the hospital rooms of Susan 
and Jennifer Falls. 
</P>
<P>
	Photos of the Fallses rest on the blackboard and a prayer table,  
and the children have written to tell them about the chicks they 
hatched, the play they performed and their classroom pet, a guinea 
pig. 
</P>
<P>
	The parish priest came to class when the children started asking  
some tough questions -- like why people have to die, how train 
crashes occur and why God did not prevent the collision. 
</P>
<P>
	Dana Belske works on a card twice as tall as she is, white  
butcher paper with ``Get Well Soon!'' written with bright-colored 
markers. 
</P>
<P>
	The children have pasted their photos on the card and framed  
them with drawings of ladybugs, rainbows, suns and hearts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were in a train accident,'' Dana explains, a blue crayon  
clenched in her small hand as she writes her name. ``This might 
make them feel better.''

<HEADLINE>  Moscoso Wins Panama Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -- Mireya Moscoso took her place in  
Panamanian history today, winning election as the nation's first 
woman president and tasting sweet revenge as she beat the son of 
the man who overthrew her husband years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscoso, the widow of an ousted president, will also get to  
preside over another historic moment in her nation's history: the 
handover of the Panama Canal. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscoso's supporters drove through Panama City's streets late  
Sunday after the election, honking and waving her party's yellow, 
red and purple flags. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a fabulous result. A woman who is dedicated to the  
people, in sync with the people, has triumphed. She has won in a 
decisive manner,'' Guillermo Endara, a former Panamanian president 
from Moscoso's Arnulfista Party, told The Associated Press after 
Sunday's vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidential election is only the second since U.S. forces  
invaded Panama to eject military strongman Manuel Noriega, who had 
canceled 1989 election results won by Endara. After the invasion, 
Endara assumed the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscoso will take office on Sept. 1 and take control of the  
canal Dec. 31. She beat Martin Torrijos, the son of military 
strongman Gen. Omar Torrijos, who had helped depose Moscoso's late 
husband Arnulfo Arias from the presidency and went on to sign the 
1977 Canal Treaties with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the accords, the United States must handover control of  
the canal, withdraw the last of its military forces and cede 
control of 40,000 acres surrounding the 85-year-old shipping route. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old Moscoso, a coffee company owner, will be the  
first woman to lead the nation of 2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	With 72 percent of ballots counted, Moscoso had 44 percent of  
the vote to Torrijos' 38 percent. A third candidate, banker Alberto 
Vallarino, who bolted from Moscoso's party after losing the 
nomination to her, won 18 percent of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't Mireya who won, it was the Panamanian people,'' a  
hoarse Moscoso told supporters at her campaign headquarters Sunday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	During the campaign, Moscoso promised to keep politics or  
corruption from undermining administration of the canal as well as 
to protect the water basin needed to operate the canal lock system. 
She said canal workers and ship companies would be involved in 
decisions about the 50-mile waterway, which handles an average of 
35 ships a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscoso's late husband was three times Panama's president before  
his final term was cut short in 1968. A year later, the 22-year-old 
Moscoso married the 67-year-old Arias. He died in exile in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscoso was born to a lower-class family in the provincial town  
of Pedasi, in the southern Azuero Peninsula. Her father, a school 
teacher and principal, died when she was a child. 
</P>
<P>
	During her campaign, Moscoso also pledged to slow the  
privatization of state enterprises initiated by outgoing President 
Ernesto Perez Balladares, who was constitutionally forbidden from 
seeking another term. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez Balladares, one of the first to vote Sunday, said the  
election was evidence that ``democracy is gaining strength'' in 
Panama, which separated from Colombia in 1903.

<HEADLINE> Wohlers Rejoins Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Reliever Mark Wohlers rejoined the Cincinnati  
Reds on Monday, a day after he lost control of his fastball and 
walked five of the seven batters his faced in a minor league 
outing. 
</P>
<P>
	The poor showing in his first appearance for Triple-A  
Indianapolis prompted a change of plans. He'll remain with the Reds 
for the next two weeks and try to work out his problems by throwing 
batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing is just getting out there and having success  
-- whether it's throwing on the side or in a simulated game -- and 
getting my confidence built up to where it was,'' Wohlers said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been nearly a year since Wohlers had full confidence that  
he could throw strikes with his 90 mph fastball. He pulled a muscle 
in his left side early last season with Atlanta and lost his 
control when he returned to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers, who set a Braves record with 39 saves in 1996, never  
regained his control last season despite two stints in the minors. 
He did much better in spring training, but regressed when the 
season started. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to go down to the minors again, prompting the Braves  
to trade him to the Reds on April 16 for reliever John Hudek. 
Wohlers, who is on the disabled list with an anxiety disorder, 
worked out with the Reds for two weeks and was eager to start a 
rehab assignment in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him deep down in my heart I didn't think he was ready  
to go down there, but he had his mind set on it,'' Gullett said. 
``It wasn't really a surprise to me that he had problems because I 
felt he wasn't over the hump.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gullett was right. Wohlers got only one out against Toledo,  
walking five of the seven batters he faced while giving up four 
runs. He threw four wild pitches and 22 of his 31 pitches were 
balls. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers was upbeat when he returned Monday. He sat in the dugout  
with Gullett and general manager Jim Bowden for nearly half of an 
hour rehashing his appearance for Indianapolis and figuring out his 
next step. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us came to the conclusion that I may have jumped the  
gun too much and headed out there too early,'' Wohlers said. 
``Yesterday might have been a little step back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of me just felt obligated to get in a game, to do  
something. I think I've got to get it through my thick skull that 
time is going to dictate it rather than forcing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers' best pitch was his main problem. He consistently  
bounced his fastball, allowing batters to watch and draw walks. 
</P>
<P>
	Gullett has been trying to get Wohlers to change his delivery so  
his weight is going toward home plate instead of away from it when 
he releases the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was jerking the ball at the end. That's what we've got to  
get him out of,'' Gullett said. ``It's all up to him to get it. 
It's going to take a lot of work and discipline on his part.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lauds Japan Economic Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi is  
telling President Clinton what he wants to hear -- that the world's 
second largest economy is poised to make a ``major turnaround'' 
that will provide relief for a troubled global economy and the 
soaring U.S. trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the United States and Japan announced a flurry of  
trade deals during Obuchi's meetings Monday with Clinton, the 
president and others in his administration pointedly warned that 
Japan must address a host of other irritants, including, most 
importantly, rising steel shipments to the United states. 
</P>
<P>
	A flood of cheap steel from Japan and other countries has  
resulted in thousands of layoffs in the American industry, raising 
a protectionist clamor in Congress as America's trade deficit hit a 
record $169 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The warnings of the widening U.S. deficit with Japan, which  
climbed to a near-record $64 billion last year, was expected to be 
delivered even more forcefully today during Obuchi meetings with 
members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The rising trade deficit has battered American manufacturers in  
steel and other industries, who have seen their overseas markets 
shrink because of spreading recessions in other nations, and have 
had to compete against rising imports pouring into the United 
States, the only major economy doing well. 
</P>
<P>
	The House has already passed a bill that would impose global  
quotas on steel imports even though the administration has said the 
measure is clearly in violation of U.S. commitments to the World 
Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	While steel shipments from Japan are running below last year's  
levels, Clinton said he impressed on Obuchi the need to make sure 
they remain low. The administration has been pushing Japan to boost 
its own economy to help lift its Asian neighbors out of recession 
and take pressure off the U.S. trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	On that score, Obuchi brought an optimistic forecast, saying  
massive amounts of government spending and serious efforts to deal 
with Japan's banking crisis should soon begin to bear fruit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I explained to the president that Japan is swiftly and boldly  
taking every measure in order to address the difficulties we are 
facing,'' Obuchi said at a joint news conference with Clinton on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi predicted his government's effort would result in a  
``major turnaround'' that will pull Japan out of its worst 
recession in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Obuchi both welcomed a new package of trade  
agreements announced Monday that are designed to help narrow the 
U.S.-Japan trade gap by boosting American exports to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan pledged to take a series of actions, including reducing  
hookup charges for foreign telephone companies seeking to crack 
Japan's vast telecommunications market, revising regulations that 
have prohibited sale of American lumber for homes and apartments 
and shortening the approval time for new drugs offered by U.S. 
pharmaceutical companies. 
</P>
<P>
	These measures were follow-ups to an initial package announced  
by the two countries at last year's Group of Seven economic summit 
in Birmingham, England. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to measures benefiting specific industries, the  
administration struck deals it said would expand opportunities for 
American businesses to make foreign investments in Japan and 
strengthen Japan's antitrust enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	As evidence of what one U.S. official called a ``sea change'' in  
Japan's approach to economic issues, the administration pointed to 
a column Obuchi wrote last week in The New York Times in which he 
said, ``Unless we adopt a more flexible economy driven by the 
market, Japan is doomed to economic and technological decline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But private analysts said the structural problems Japan is  
facing are so severe that it is far from clear that Japan is 
willing to go far enough in changing its society. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Japanese economy is so over-regulated and structurally  
distorted that the normal economic tools don't work,'' said Clyde 
Prestowitz, head of the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington 
think tank devoted to trade issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi offered Clinton support on the administration's efforts  
to deal with the Kosovo crisis and pledged $200 million in 
financial aid to help affected nations in the region. The two 
leaders also pledged continued cooperation in dealing with nuclear 
and missile threats posed by North Korea.

corruption from undermining administration of the canal as well as 
to protect the water basin needed to operate the canal lock system. 
She said canal workers and ship companies would be involved in 
decisions about the 50-mile waterway, which handles an average of 
35 ships a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscoso's late husband was three times Panama's president before  
his final term was cut short in 1968. A year later, the 22-year-old 
Moscoso married the 67-year-old Arias. He died in exile in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscoso was born to a lower-class family in the provincial town  
of Pedasi, in the southern Azuero Peninsula. Her father, a school 
teacher and principal, died when she was a child. 
</P>
<P>
	During her campaign, Moscoso also pledged to slow the  
privatization of state enterprises initiated by outgoing President 
Ernesto Perez Balladares, who was constitutionally forbidden from 
seeking another term. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez Balladares, one of the first to vote Sunday, said the  
election was evidence that ``democracy is gaining strength'' in 
Panama, which separated from Colombia in 1903.

<HEADLINE> Seattle Loses Two Pitchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Butch Henry and Mark Leiter, who were counted on  
this spring being key members of the Seattle Mariners' pitching 
staff, will undergo surgery on their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	Both probably will miss the rest of the season.  
</P>
<P>
	The team announced on Monday that Henry, their No. 4 starter  
with a 2-0 and a 4.63 ERA, has a torn labrum in his left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners said Leiter, a setup man in their bullpen this  
season, has a torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry, 30, will undergo arthroscopic surgery on Thursday that  
will cause him to miss 4-6 months. He could possibly rejoin the 
Mariners' staff in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry started Seattle's 22-6 victory over Detroit Thursday, but  
came out in the fifth inning with tightness in his left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Leiter, 36, will have surgery next week, causing him to be  
sidelined for 9-12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Leiter was placed on the 15-day disabled list Sunday with what  
was diagnosed as a strained right shoulder. In two appearances this 
season, Leiter pitched 1 1-3 innings and had a 6.75 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	He had to leave Saturday night's game against Toronto.  
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners will transfer Leiter from the 15-day to the 60-day  
disabled list, put Henry on the 15-day disabled list and purchase 
the contract of left-hander Sean Spencer from Triple-A Tacoma on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At Tacoma, Spencer was 0-0 with a save and an 0.73 ERA in eight  
games and 12 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry was signed by the Mariners as a free agent Dec. 16 after  
pitching briefly in Boston last season. He was on the disabled list 
most of last season while recovering from surgery for a torn 
anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, he missed the entire season while recovering from  
ligament replacement surgery on his left elbow, Tommy John surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Leiter came to the Mariners Nov. 9 in a trade with Philadelphia  
for left-hander Paul Spoljaric. Last season, Leiter was 7-5 with a 
3.55 ERA in 69 relief appearances with the Phillies.

<HEADLINE> Can Cops Stop Someone Who Runs Off? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court will try to decide whether  
people who run away after seeing a police officer can be chased, 
stopped and questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices agreed Monday to use a case from a Chicago  
high-crime neighborhood to clarify on-the-street police powers vs. 
individual rights. 
</P>
<P>
	While many Americans might assume police have the power to chase  
and question someone who flees at the sight of them, lower courts 
have been deeply divided on the issue. The justices' decision, 
expected sometime in 2000, could resolve that split. 
</P>
<P>
	At the heart of the dispute is the Fourth Amendment protection  
against unreasonable searches and seizures. Courts long have 
interpreted that protection to mean police without court warrants 
cannot stop and question someone without a ``reasonable suspicion'' 
of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	State courts in Alaska, California, Colorado, Maryland,  
Michigan, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey and Utah have said police 
generally cannot make investigative stops after pursuing someone 
who flees after seeing them. 
</P>
<P>
	But state courts in Connecticut, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota,  
North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin have ruled that fleeing from 
police can create a reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct and 
justify a police stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal courts also have disagreed on the issue.  
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois Supreme Court used the Chicago case to bar police  
most often from making such investigative stops. 
</P>
<P>
	In appealing that ruling, state prosecutors said a definitive  
ruling is needed. ``Every single day, law enforcement officers at 
all levels throughout our country are confronted with ... whether 
to chase and temporarily stop a person in a high-crime area who 
runs away at the mere sight of the police,'' the appeal said. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's highest court twice before had the opportunity to  
consider the issue in criminal cases, but left it undecided when in 
1988 and 1991 it chose instead to focus on whether police seizures 
had occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Wardlow was convicted of a weapons violation after he was  
arrested on a Chicago street in 1995 while carrying a loaded 
handgun in a bag. 
</P>
<P>
	Police officers in a patrol car had seen Wardlow spot them and  
take off running. They pursued and eventually cornered him, and 
found the gun after a patdown search. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred in the 4000 block of West Van Buren  
Street, described by state prosecutors as an area of ``high 
narcotics traffic'' at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	Wardlow challenged his conviction for unlawful use of a weapon  
by a felon and the two-year prison sentence it carried. He said he 
had been subjected to an unlawful stop. His appeal in an Illinois 
court raised the issue of whether his running away from police was 
enough to create a reasonable suspicion to justify the stop and 
patdown search. 
</P>
<P>
	A state appeals court threw out his conviction, and the Illinois  
Supreme Court upheld that decision last September after saying 
``such flight alone is insufficient to create a reasonable 
suspicion of involvement in criminal conduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police had acted on ``nothing more than a hunch,'' the state  
court said, and in so doing violated Wardlow's constitutional 
rights.

<HEADLINE> Server Outage Halts eBay Auctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- All auctions on eBay were temporarily suspended  
Monday after the popular Internet site experienced a server outage 
and wasn't able to process any bids or accept new listings. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction company said the troubles began around 8:30 a.m. EDT  
and lasted until just before 2 p.m. EDT, although there were 
earlier reports of problems from some users. 
</P>
<P>
	Due to the outage, eBay couldn't host auctions of just-released  
merchandise tied to ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.'' 
By midday Monday, rival Amazon.com had more than 15 auctions of new 
toys and other products based on the much-awaited movie. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay said that all auctions that were scheduled to end during  
the shutdown or for one hour afterwards will be extended by 24 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are always concerned when we have any downtime on the  
site,'' said Kevin Pursglove, senior director for communications at 
eBay. ``We are trying to respond as quickly as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On its online announcement board, eBay told customers who felt  
their auctions were ``materially impacted'' as a result of the 
outage to contact the company to get their fees refunded.

<HEADLINE> Buffett Wary of Internet Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- For years, multibillionaire investor Warren  
Buffett has shied away from computer companies, saying he invests 
only in companies he understands. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as the Internet becomes more dominant in the U.S. economy,  
the Berkshire Hathaway Inc. chairman is waiting to see how 
businesses that catch his eye find their conventional ways of doing 
business challenged by the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime we buy a business we look at what it will be like in  
five to 10 years,'' Buffett told 15,000 shareholders Monday at the 
investment company's annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some cases, the Internet is such a threat we wouldn't want  
to get into it,'' he said. He noted that the automobile retailing 
will change dramatically as more people go online. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffett also forecast that businesses with trusted brand names,  
such as Berkshire-owned Borsheim's jewelry, should benefit from the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brand names are going to mean very, very much to people among  
the thousands of names offered on the Internet,'' Buffett said. ``I 
don't see them going for Brand X and buying fine jewelry over the 
Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger fielded  
dozens of questions ranging from accounting practices to investment 
strategies of Berkshire-owned insurance companies General Re and 
Geico. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 14,000 shareholders packed the AKsarben coliseum for  
the annual meeting, which features a six-hour-long 
question-and-answer session with Buffett and Munger. Still more 
stockholders listened to Buffett's comments via a large-screen 
television set up at a local hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	In the halls surrounding the coliseum, Buffett-owned businesses  
sold candy, Dairy Queen ice cream and Geico agents even issued 
insurance rate quotes for those interested. 
</P>
<P>
	Berkshire, which had $2.8 billion in net earnings last year,  
needs large investments if they are to have any impact on earnings 
growth for the company, Buffett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for investing in companies he likes and holding the stock  
indefinitely, Buffett's estimated wealth of more than $29.4 billion 
makes him the second-richest man in America behind Microsoft Corp. 
chairman Bill Gates at $58 billion.

<HEADLINE> Playboy Logo Banned on Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A judge ordered an Internet Web site design company  
Monday to stop using the Playboy name and logo on its sites, which 
offered hopes of future money and fame to women who sent in sexy 
videos and photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	Playboy Enterprises International Inc., based in Chicago, had  
filed a federal complaint against Global Site Designs Inc. for 
``usurping and misappropriating (Playboy's) reputation and 
goodwill'' for financial gain. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Edward B. Davis entered a temporary  
restraining order against Global and two employees on Monday, and 
set another hearing for May 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Playboy did not return a call for comment; Bob  
Webb, an officer at Global and a defendant in the trademark 
infringement lawsuit, also did not immediately return a call. 
</P>
<P>
	Playboy claimed two sites set up by Global --  
www.playboyonline.net and www.playmatesearch.net -- were rip-offs of 
Playboy's own Web site, www.playboy.com, which prominently displays 
the trademark Playboy Online, and of Playboy's recent search for a 
Playmate for the Year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people we select, in addition to receiving international  
recognition, will have a chance at great cash and prizes,'' the 
Global sites say under the headings ``Search 4 Sexy'' and $100,000. 
It also promised the winner would drive away in a Stingray 
Corvette. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also alleged Global already has made money off the  
site, by charging $20 for each photograph or video entry. It was 
not known how many people had entered the contest advertised on 
both Global sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Playboy said in its lawsuit that Global had been served a  
cease-and-desist letter on April 22 but ignored it. Even after the 
judge signed the temporary restraining order Monday, both Global 
sites remained online.

<HEADLINE> MediaOne To Accept AT&AMP;T Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MediaOne Group Inc. plans to accept an offer to  
be acquired by AT&AMP;T Corp., abandoning a previous deal with Comcast 
Corp. and setting the stage for a bidding war over the cable 
television company. 
</P>
<P>
	MediaOne said today its board felt the AT&AMP;T offer valued at  
$55.8 billion in stock and cash was a ``superior proposal'' to 
Comcast's bid which was worth about $48 billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	But under terms of its deal with Comcast, the Philadelphia-based  
cable company has until Thursday to make a better offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast declined to comment on today's announcement.  
</P>
<P>
	The fight over MediaOne is attracting some of the biggest names  
in the cable, telephone, computer and Internet industries. 
Microsoft Corp. and America Online Inc., for example, may join 
Comcast to help the company beat AT&AMP;T's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake are MediaOne's 5 million U.S. cable TV subscribers and  
8.9 million overseas subscribers, who could be converted into 
lucrative, high-speed Internet subscribers. Cable access to the 
Internet is expected to replace telephone access because 
higher-capacity cable wires can carry voices, video and data 
faster. 
</P>
<P>
	So whoever controls MediaOne could have more control over the  
potential riches of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	On one side: AT&AMP;T chairman C. Michael Armstong has joined forces  
with the co-founder of Continental Cablevision (which later became 
MediaOne), Amos Hostetter. 
</P>
<P>
	On the opposite side: Comcast president Brian Roberts is trying  
to forge a stronger bid, together or separately, with Microsoft 
Chairman Bill Gates, America Online Chairman Steve Case, and Paul 
Allen, the Microsoft co-founder who left the software company in 
1983 and recently has been building a mini-empire of cable assets. 
</P>
<P>
	If the AT&AMP;T team wins, the No. 1 long-distance company will also  
be the No. 1 cable company, having access to 60 percent of the U.S. 
homes wired for cable. Hostetter would be the nonexecutive chairman 
in charge of cable assets, in effect retaking the helm of his 
former company. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Comcast team wins, Comcast will be a stronger No. 3 in  
the cable business, while America Online, the largest Internet 
service provider, could have guaranteed high-speed Internet links 
to millions of homes. Meanwhile, Microsoft could sell the software 
that makes it all happen. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, MediaOne confirmed that it had signed confidentiality  
agreements with America Online and Microsoft to allow the two 
companies access to MediaOne's internal financial information as 
part of their review before entering into a possible deal. Several 
press reports said Allen also was interested in saving Comcast's 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	But with so many industry icons involved, putting a deal  
together may be tricky, one banker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast, Microsoft and AOL ``are in three different businesses  
and have at least two different reasons for wanting to own 
(MediaOne),'' said Tom Vanderslice, managing director for media 
corporate finance at CIBC Oppenheimer. ``They're not on the same 
page. It would have to be a very complex agreement if there was 
going to be a partnership with three very powerful constituents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast, based in Philadelphia, originally offered to use its  
stock to buy MediaOne, but AT&AMP;T trumped that bid with a superior 
cash and stock offer. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's offer, however, lost $1.7 billion of its value last week  
as the company's stock price slid from $59.50 to $50.50 on investor 
concerns that staid Ma Bell was becoming Ma Cable and diluting the 
value of its shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the deal, the decline in share price means that  
AT&AMP;T will have to spend $36.55 in cash and $47.975 in stock for 
each MediaOne share, a marked difference from the $30.85 in cash 
and the $56.525 in stock it originally offered. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online could help strengthen Comcast's hand. But with  
only $1.8 billion in cash, AOL is in a better position to lend its 
high-flying stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, which is sitting on $22 billion in cash, could give  
Comcast's side several billion dollars to tempt MediaOne executives 
and shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Seattle-based software company declined  
comment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	MediaOne's shares were off 75 cents to $80.75 1/2 in early morning  
trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. AT&AMP;T's shares were 
up $1.43 3/4 at $51.93 3/4 on the NYSE. Comcast's class A special common 
stock was up $1.28 1/8 at $66.96 7/8 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

	Dow Closes Above 11,000  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two more reports of an ebullient economy pushed  
the Dow Jones industrial average past 11,000 today. The index of 30 
blue chip stocks closed at 11,014.69, up 225.65 for the session and 
marking its fourth new high in five trading sessions. The Standard 
&AMP; Poor's 500 composite rose, but the Nasdaq composite declined 7.27 
points to 2,535.58 as investors continued to shed technology 
shares. Even by the compressed standards of the modern stock 
market, the latest Dow milestone arrived with remarkable speed. The 
index closed at 10,000 on March 29, making Monday's close the 
fastest rise between 1,000-point markers in history. The Dow was 
pushed higher by manufacturing and industrial shares after 
investors got two fresh reminders that the economy is strong, but 
not inflationary.

	Personal Income, Spending Rise  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Showing confidence in the economy's strength,  
Americans continue to spend as fast as their incomes are growing. 
They are even dipping into savings. Personal income increased a 
seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent in March, the Commerce Department 
reported today. Consumers matched that income growth with a 0.4 
percent rise in spending. Overall, spending has outpaced income 
growth, leaving the nation's personal savings rate -- savings as a 
percentage of after-tax income -- at a record low of minus 0.6 
percent in March.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The nation's manufacturing sector continued to  
expand for the third straight month in April, but the growth was 
less robust than in the previous month, corporate purchasing 
executives said in a survey released today. The National 
Association of Purchasing Management reported its monthly index of 
business activity fell to 52.8 percent, down 1.5 percentage points 
from its March level. The NAPM considers any reading above 50 
percent as a sign of growth in the industrial sector.

	Japan Warned to Reduce Steel Imports  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton warned Japan today to reduce  
its steel imports ``on a consistent basis'' or the United States 
will act to block those imports. Following a meeting with Japanese 
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, Clinton said the United States would 
act to keep Japanese steel out of U.S. markets if those imports 
continue to exceed the levels existing prior to the Asian economic 
crisis. The Commerce Department said last week it had determined 
that Japanese steel companies were engaging in illegal steel 
dumping -- selling abroad at less than home-market prices -- and that 
tariffs of up to 67 percent could be imposed on hot-rolled carbon 
steel, a widely used product.

	FTC Leads Crackdown on Credit Scams  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A team of federal, state and local law  
enforcement agencies has filed 16 complaints against companies that 
claim they can help consumers get new credit histories with fake 
Social Security numbers. In the complaints, the agencies ask 
federal judges to permanently enjoin illegal claims and impose 
civil penalties. Anyone who applies for credit with a false 
identification number is breaking federal law, said Jodie 
Bernstein, director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of 
Consumer Protection. Bernstein said these scams are ``spreading 
like wildfire'' on the Internet and in junk e-mail.

day-trading companies as they consider drafting new rules for the 
fast-growing electronic trading business. The government's top 
securities regulator is expected to announce a new initiative 
tomorrow. The investigation by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers, a 
self-policing brokers' group, has been conducted over the past two 
months or so. The auditors are looking for possible violations of 
securities laws as well as examining how well the firms execute 
customers' orders and warn them of trading risks.

	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Multibillionaire investor Warren Buffett has  
previously shied away from computer companies, saying he invests 
only in companies he understands. Now, as the Internet becomes more 
dominant in the U.S. economy, the Berkshire Hathaway Inc. chairman 
is waiting to see how businesses that catch his eye find their 
conventional ways of doing business challenged by the Web. ``In 
some cases, the Internet is such a threat we wouldn't want to get 
into it,'' Buffett told 15,000 shareholders today at the investment 
company's annual meeting. Buffett also forecast that businesses 
with trusted brand names, such as Berkshire-owned Borsheim's 
jewelry, should benefit from the Internet.

take the stand during the trial's rebuttal phase, an important

billion purchase of one of Microsoft's chief software rivals.

	RealNetworks Offers Music Software

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leading Internet audio software company

music piracy with its creation of a product designed to make it 
easier to download and play music on a computer. Mark Hardie, a 
senior analyst with Forrester Research, Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., 
estimated 10 million people will be using RealJukebox by July. 
RealJukebox will contain an anti-piracy device that limits a 
consumer to making a single copy of a music file for their own use. 
However, consumers will be able to easily disable the device to 
send music via e-mail. Also today, Thomson Consumer Electronic Inc. 
announced that it will market a portable device under the RCA brand 
for playing music downloaded from a computer.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Projects Record Debt Payoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government will pay off a record $116  
billion of the $5.5 trillion national debt in the April-June 
quarter, the Treasury Department said in revised projections 
released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	That's higher than the $105 billion to $110 billion payoff  
predicted in February. It would beat the previous record of $97.9 
billion set in April-June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The department attributed its more optimistic prediction to  
higher-than-expected tax receipts and lower-than-expected 
government spending. 
</P>
<P>
	However, during the January-March quarter, net government  
borrowing was $5.8 billion, reversing what had been a prediction of 
$5 billion in debt reduction. Bigger-than-expected expenses and tax 
refunds were to blame, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
	From October to March, the first quarter of the government's  
fiscal year 1999, net government borrowing was $24 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Once rare, reductions in federal debt are becoming increasingly  
common as a result of the return of annual federal budget surpluses 
after 28 consecutive years of deficit, 1969 through 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, in its fiscal 2000 budget, projected  
that the surplus will grow from $69.2 billion in 1998 to $80 
billion in 1999 and $117 billion in 2000.

<HEADLINE> No Ban on Castro-Covered Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Miami International Airport officials reversed  
their decision to ban a magazine with Fidel Castro on the cover 
after receiving complaints from the mayor and civil liberties 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Airport officials banned the June issue of Cigar Aficionado on  
Thursday, saying the cover with Castro was flattering to the 
communist leader. The issue contained a travel guide to Cuba. U.S. 
policy prohibits Americans tourists from traveling to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban was lifted Sunday, and the magazine should be on sale at  
airport newsstands soon, said Gary Dellapa, director of the 
Miami-Dade Aviation Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though we have to be sensitive to the Cuban exile  
community here, in the end, we have to come down on the side of 
what has been the tradition in the United States of freedom of 
expression and freedom of the press,'' Dellapa said. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union threatened a lawsuit. The  
magazine's managing editor, Gordon Mott, said that by seeking to 
silence alternative opinions about Cuba, the county was acting like 
Castro's regime. Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas said the ban 
could constitute censorship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took personal offense to the false depiction of reality in  
the pictures, images and information in the article,'' Penelas, who 
is of Cuban descent, said in a memo sent Sunday to the county 
manager and aviation officials urging them to lift the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, ... censorship is wrong across the board, even when  
it involves issues and subjects we strongly disapprove of,'' he 
wrote.

<HEADLINE> Aetna Selling Plan For Uninsured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Aetna Inc. is launching a no-frills health  
insurance policy geared to help the 25 million working Americans 
who are uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
	The program, called Affordable HealthChoices, will be sold to  
employers who can't afford to offer a policy to their workers or 
have had to drop the insurance benefit because of higher premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna's new policy will cost as little as $46 per person, or  
$156 per family, per month. The employer can elect to pay all or 
part of the premium. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the new program has been approved in Texas, Connecticut  
and the District of Columbia. Aetna hopes to soon get approval by 
regulators in 25 other states. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Aetna's health maintenance organization, which has a  
prescription drug benefit and pays for most hospital and physician 
services, the new plan will only have minimal coverage. For 
instance, one new option would only offer hospital coverage of $500 
a day for the first three days and $200 days for the next four to 
10 days. Hospital bills typically can reach thousands of dollars 
even for short visits. 
</P>
<P>
	Giant health insurers such as Aetna have been criticized for  
charging expensive premiums, which has contributed to the number of 
uninsured rising from 38 million in 1992 to 43 million in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Workplaces must employ a minimum of two employees to be  
eligible. The new program will not be sold directly to individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna hopes employers which presently do not offer health  
insurance coverage will sign up. Still, one concern is some 
employers might drop the more extensive policy and fall back to the 
new less expensive option. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a very tight job market that is unlikely to happen,'' said  
Aetna spokeswoman Jill Griffiths. ``We think employers will want to 
offer the most comprehensive benefit package they can.''

<HEADLINE> Jackson Revels in Release of POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a city under U.S. bombardment for six  
weeks, the Rev. Jesse Jackson picked up a telephone and called 
President Clinton to report some good news. ``I've received the 
prisoners and we're departing Belgrade,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president thanked Jackson. It was after midnight Saturday,  
so they didn't discuss the letter the civil rights leader was 
bringing from President Slobodan Milosevic, or Jackson's desire for 
Clinton to acknowledge Milosevic's peace overture. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview Sunday, Jackson said Clinton didn't  
really need to say much more at that point. ``Clearly, he is 
delighted,'' Jackson said. ``Now he has to determine the worth and 
weight of a diplomatic gesture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Escorting three American prisoners of war out of Yugoslavia was  
quite a coup for Jackson, who has flitted from cause to cause in 
recent years and is seen as something of a gadfly at the White 
House. It had frowned upon his mission to Belgrade from the 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	Thinking of his own five children, Jackson said, ``I could not  
stand to walk way. ... I kept arguing the case about they have no 
currency in jail, they are just war bait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Interviewed today on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' Jackson  
said Milosevic eventually suggested he might free one soldier -- the 
oldest, who has a wife and child. Jackson said he pointed out that 
that soldier -- Staff Sgt. Christopher Stone -- is white and the 
other two are Hispanic, and said releasing only Stone would ``send 
a very ugly signal back home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said he eventually was able to persuade Milosevic that  
since the three had been captured together, they should be released 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who headed an ecumenical religious delegation on his  
mission, lingered at Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany to await 
the arrival of the soldiers' families before returning to 
Washington today. 
</P>
<P>
	He wouldn't talk about the letter he had for Clinton; ``It's his  
letter,'' Jackson said. White House spokesman David Leavy also 
declined to comment on the letter, saying the president had not 
seen it. 
</P>
<P>
	The journey to Yugoslavia was Jackson's fourth trip to a foreign  
land to retrieve captive Americans. In 1984, he went to Syria and 
won the release of Navy Lt. Robert O. Goodman Jr., whose jet bomber 
was shot down during a raid over Syrian anti-aircraft positions in 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	Several months later, Jackson was in Cuba, talking Fidel Castro  
into releasing 48 American and Cuban political prisoners. In 1990, 
he helped win the release from Iraq of more than 700 foreign women 
and children detained as human shields against an American military 
attack following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson reveled in his success Sunday, saying this latest foray  
into hostile territory as a freelance negotiator was the riskiest 
of them all. 
</P>
<P>
	``This mission was more volatile, and more violent,'' he said.  
``We saw bombs exploding. The night we got there was the heaviest 
bombing. But it was worth the risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And with the success came criticisms -- that Jackson let himself  
be used by Milosevic, that he boosted the Yugoslav leader by 
praying with him, that he was meddling by urging Clinton and NATO 
to talk to Milosevic out of goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jackson made no apologies for putting pressure on NATO,  
saying ``there are certain crises that deserve the highest level of 
presidential attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless you talk, you cannot determine at what point your bombs  
are leading to the end,'' he said. ``We must look forward to a 
meeting, whether it's President Clinton or (British Prime Minister) 
Tony Blair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said experience has taught him that freeing prisoners  
can open doors. He recalled that then-President Reagan called 
Syrian President Haifez Assad after Goodman's release. 
</P>
<P>
	``It led to a greater ability to deal with Lebanon and Syria and  
the ... (Palestine Liberation Organization) at the time,'' Jackson 
said. ``So I certainly hope there is a courteous response to 
(Milosevic) setting our prisoners free. He had the power not to do 
it. But he did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his session with Milosevic, Jackson said he laid out this  
option: Milosevic could stubbornly keep the prisoners and watch 
NATO bombs make rubble of his nation. Or he could set them free and 
``build a diplomatic bridge'' so that Yugoslavia would not become a 
permanent pariah. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to convince him of what his options were,'' Jackson  
said. He held Milosevic's hand and prayed with him. The preacher's 
persuasion worked on the Serb leader eager to change his image as a 
war criminal. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Jackson told CNN he felt there was nothing wrong with  
praying with Milosevic even though some critics viewed it as 
inappropriate. ``You should pray for sinners and victims, not just 
pray for and with friends,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After signing documents, Jackson told the soldiers they were  
free, and they headed by bus for Croatia. They walked across the 
border together, hand in hand, chanting the phrase that Jackson's 
mentor, Martin Luther King Jr., used to close his 1963 march on 
Washington: ``Free at last, free at last, thank God Almighty we are 
free at last.''

<HEADLINE> White House Welcoming Japanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- He threw out the ceremonial first pitch at a  
Cubs game and played tourist on his way to Washington, but visiting 
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi went the cultural route today 
with a personal tutorial on the history of the Bonsai and a dinner 
graced by piano virtuoso Van Cliburn. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton was playing host to the Japanese leader in a  
pavilion on the White House South Lawn replete with its own garden 
entrance. Shrubbery lined the light jade-colored walls of the 
pavilion, with some greenery even delicately interwoven in the 
chandeliers. 
</P>
<P>
	The two leaders received a tutorial in horticulture earlier in  
the day from Saburo Kato, chairman of the Nippon Bonsai 
Association. In the White House Blue Room, adorned for the occasion 
by Bonsai trees brought in from the National Arboretum, Clinton 
presented Obuchi with a 300-year-old tree as a gift. The pair 
listened attentively as Kato then explained the way the roots grow 
and the trees curve. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were absolutely fascinated by this,'' said White House  
Social Secretary Capricia Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi played high-level tourist over the weekend, throwing the  
first pitch to Sammy Sosa at a Cub's game and ringing the bell to 
close floor trade at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Obuchi was 
just as excited to hear that piano legend Van Cliburn would perform 
for the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	``The members of the delegation were ecstatic,'' Marshall said.  
``Prime Minister Obuchi loves the classics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cliburn, who has performed for every president since Harry  
Truman, made his own selections for the evening, which included 
pieces by Chopin, Brahms and Rachmaninoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Author Arthur Golden, who penned the popular ``Memoirs of a  
Geisha,'' and Sidney Poitier were joining more than 300 guests at 
the official dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Park Service, along with the White House staff,  
assisted in creating the garden and floral arrangements around the 
pavilion. Azaleas and lugustrums bedecked the sides of the tent, 
while fresh lilacs and white peonies topped the tables. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar pavilion style set-up welcomed Emperor Akihito of  
Japan when he visited the Clintons nearly five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Even White House dessert chef Ronald Messnier got in on the  
garden theme, preparing a plate set with a Bonsai tree of green and 
brown chocolate sitting along a bridge over a river of green kiwi 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
	The dinner menu celebrated the season, with such specialties as  
chilled green pea and zucchini soup. Ginger and black bean 
marinated salmon with jasmine rice and herbed lamb over potatoes 
starred in a dinner filled with unusual combination of vegetables 
and greens. 
</P>
<P>
	White House chef Walter Scheib brought in honshimeji mushrooms,  
a delicate Japanese mushroom for the dinner, and created purees of 
artichoke and eggplant for the dishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold base plates and cream china were set on dark celadon table  
cloths with green satin stripes.

<HEADLINE>  Hockey Player Steve Chiasson Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Carolina Hurricanes defenseman Steve  
Chiasson was killed early today when his pickup truck overturned 
hours after his team was eliminated from the playoffs in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson, a 32-year-old native of Barrie, Ontario, died about  
4:15 a.m. EDT in the accident in north Raleigh, Trooper K.L. Horn 
of the State Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tragedy that is impossible to put into words,'' said  
Jim Rutherford, the Hurricanes' president and general manager 
</P>
<P>
	Horn said Chiasson was thrown from the pickup after it ran off  
the road and flipped. Highway Patrol Sgt. Jeff Winstead said 
evidence at the scene and interviews suggested Chiasson might have 
been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricanes spokesman Chris Brown said the team's charter arrived  
at Raleigh-Durham International Airport about 1 a.m. The players 
got in their vehicles at the airport and left. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said beer was among the beverages served on the plane, but  
he didn't know if Chiasson had any alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes lost 2-0 to Boston in Game 6. On Friday night,  
Chiasson scored the first goal in a 4-3 double-overtime loss to the 
Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you work together and been in our environment, you have a  
family,'' coach Paul Maurice said at a news conference. ``There's 
no other way to put it, and we lost a member of our family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson spent eight years with the Detroit Red Wings, was  
traded to the Calgary Flames in 1994 and in 1997 to what then was 
the Hartford Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was drafted by Detroit in 1985 and played his first NHL game  
the following year. In 1988-89, he led all Red Wings' defensemen 
with 47 points. In 1989-90, he scored a career-high 14 goals and 
again led all Detroit defensemen in scoring with 42 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson played in his first NHL All-Star game in 1993. At  
Calgary, he was rated second among Flames' defensemen in scoring in 
1995-96 with 33 points and notched his 300th NHL career point on 
Nov. 29, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson is survived by his wife, Susan, two sons and a  
daughter.

<HEADLINE> Duke Not Ready To Throw in Towel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- David Duke lost again, though he did  
surprisingly well and wasn't ready to write his own political 
obituary. 
</P>
<P>
	After placing third in Saturday's election to replace Bob  
Livingston in Congress, the former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard backed 
off earlier statements that this would probably be his last race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not ruling anything out for the rest of my life,'' Duke  
told about 150 supporters in his Saturday night concession speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Gov. Dave Treen placed first but did not get the majority  
needed for outright victory. State Rep. David Vitter was second and 
will face Treen in a May 29 runoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke, a Republican, was only three percentage points behind  
Vitter, despite having sharpened his racial rhetoric in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke's relatively strong showing was better than pollsters had  
predicted and it surprised Louisiana State University political 
scientist Wayne Parent. 
</P>
<P>
	``One fifth of that district voted for someone who wrote a book  
as radical as `My Awakening,''' Parent noted Sunday, a reference to 
Duke's recently released 700 page autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
	In the book, Duke promotes theories of black people's  
genetically inferior mental abilities, calls for a separate 
homeland for blacks and suggests an ``Aryan'' revolution may be 
needed in the future ``to free our people and secure our 
survival.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Complete but unofficial returns showed Treen with 36,547 votes,  
or 25 percent and Vitter with 31,652 votes, or 22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke had 27,967 votes, or 19 percent. Ophthalmologist Monica  
Monica, also a Republican, received 22,855 votes, or 16 percent. 
State Rep. Bill Strain, a Democrat, received 16,372 votes, or 11 
percent. Four other candidates split the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Most polls had shown Duke, who served a partial term in the  
state Legislature from 1989-91, with no more than 10 percent 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Duke's best showing since the 1991 governor's race, when  
he displaced faltering incumbent Buddy Roemer, then lost a runoff 
spot against former Gov. Edwin Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke benefited Saturday from a relatively light turnout of about  
36 percent and a splintered vote among the seven Republicans and 
two Democrats, all conservatives who ran on Louisiana's ``open 
primary'' ballot. His candidacy also was buoyed by the continued 
angst of white middle class voters feeling threatened by 
affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
	The race was proof of Duke's oft-repeated campaign mantra: ``I  
fly under radar,'' meaning his supporters are reluctant to 
acknowledge their choice to pollsters. 
</P>
<P>
	That was evidenced even by one of those who attended his  
would-be victory party Saturday night in the suburb of Metairie. 
Sharon, who would not give her last name, confessed to some 
discomfort with Duke's KKK history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do disapprove of that and I think he might still have those  
ties,'' she said. ``I don't entirely trust him, but a lot of the 
things he says I do support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had run a campaign denouncing affirmative action, welfare  
queens, and the New Orleans school system's removal of George 
Washington's name from a school because he was a former slave 
holder. 
</P>
<P>
	Parent said he doubts Duke will ever make it to Congress.  
However, his strong showing means he will not fade away. ``I do see 
this keeping him around for another day, where he can stay around 
and shake up another race,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-POWs Reunited With Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANDSTUHL, Germany (AP) -- Upbeat and safe at a U.S. military  
hospital in Germany, three servicemen released by Yugoslavia were 
joyfully reunited with their families on their first full day of 
freedom today. 
</P>
<P>
	Army doctors pronounced the soldiers in generally good shape,  
but checkups also revealed fractured ribs and a broken nose, 
raising questions about how they were treated during their capture 
and month in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army declined to comment on how the injuries were sustained,  
citing the ongoing examinations and investigation into the 
circumstances of their March 31 capture on the Yugoslav-Macedonia 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	Before arriving at the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center on  
Sunday, the soldiers told reporters that their scars and bruises 
stemmed from their capture, but said they were generally treated 
well after that. Their commander, Maj. David Grange of the 1st 
Infantry division, was skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it might have been they were poorly treated at the  
beginning, but that'll be determined,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the three soldiers would  
undergo further debriefings in Germany for two or three more days. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial debriefings have reaffirmed U.S. officials' belief  
that the soldiers were captured inside Macedonia, Bacon said. Serb 
authorities have claimed the three were in Serb territory when 
captured. 
</P>
<P>
	After taking 30 days of leave, the soldiers were likely to  
return to their units, which are based in Germany, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Mack Blanton, chief of clinical services at the hospital,  
said all three were in good spirits and excited about seeing their 
loved ones again. 
</P>
<P>
	Each had a private reunion with family members who had arrived  
in Germany on overnight flights from the United States. A few hours 
later, they stepped onto a hospital balcony together, beaming and 
holding on to each other. They waved briefly to reporters and 
camera crews kept across the street by military police. 
</P>
<P>
	Grange said the parents were ``very upbeat, very positive and  
proud of their sons. Just like their units are in Germany.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The family members, suffering from jet lag, were not expected to  
talk with reporters on Monday, officials said. They were to remain 
in Germany for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	That raised the possibility of a meeting with President Clinton,  
who was expected Wednesday in Germany for a previously planned 
visit to U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton would like to  
meet with the three servicemen, but that the president did not want 
to delay their return home. 
</P>
<P>
	After being released in Belgrade on Sunday, the soldiers  
traveled by bus to Croatia and then were flown to Germany, 
accompanied by civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, who had 
negotiated their release with Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson hoped Clinton would reciprocate by offering a respite  
from airstrikes, now in their sixth week. But NATO refused to 
reward the gesture and the alliance continued to pound Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers spent Sunday evening on the telephone, watching  
television and relaxing, then had a good night's sleep, hospital 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical tests on Monday revealed that Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez,  
24, of Los Angeles, had two fractured ribs, one on each side, and 
Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich. had a 
fractured nose. 
</P>
<P>
	Blanton said the fractures were already starting to heal and  
required no treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez had a small cut on the top of his head that was stitched  
while he was in captivity and swelling on his right lower leg that 
will require further X-rays, Blanton said. Ramirez could not 
remember how the injury to his leg occurred, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone's broken nose was discovered after a CT scan run on his  
head to examine the bruises and abrasions on his face. ``In general 
his condition is good,'' Blanton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spec. Steven Gonzales, 22, of Huntsville, Texas, ``turned out  
fine'' in initial checkups and has no further medical tests 
scheduled for the time being, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unit ``buddies'' were assigned to each soldier ``to help them  
repatriate,'' a process that normally lasts three days and includes 
checkups, debriefings, decompression and family reunions, said Lt. 
Col. Sharon DeRuvo, the hospital's nursing chief. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the three soldiers ``took excellent care of  
themselves'' while in captivity, doing push-ups and sit-ups to stay 
fit. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, meanwhile, flew to Washington Monday to meet Clinton  
and deliver a letter from Milosevic with proposals to end the NATO 
air campaign and resolve the crisis over Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton expressed his gratitude to Jackson and said he was  
pleased at the soldiers' release, but said the United States cannot 
forget the plight of Kosovo refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``When will these people see their home again, with the safety  
and rights Mr. Milosevic has often pledged but never delivered?'' 
Clinton said in a joint news conference with Japanese Prime 
Minister Keizo Obuchi.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Teams Get Luxury Tax Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Major league teams finally received their  
estimated luxury tax bills Monday, and the Los Angeles Dodgers had 
the highest projected payment at $5.15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees were No. 2 at $4.25 million, followed by  
Baltimore at $4.07 million, Atlanta at $772,000 and the New York 
Mets at $525,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Projections were based on opening-day payrolls and already have  
changed significantly. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles cut its tax by about $1.84 million with the April 16  
trade of Dave Mlicki and Mel Rojas to Detroit for three minor 
league pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta cut its bill to zero that same day by trading Mark  
Wohlers to Cincinnati for John Hudek, a deal that pushed the Boston 
Red Sox into tax territory. 
</P>
<P>
	The luxury tax, agreed to in the settlement of the 1994-95  
strike and scheduled to go out of existence after this season, was 
designed to slow spending by the high-revenue teams but has had 
only a slight effect, prompting renewed calls for a salary cap by 
some low- and mid-revenue teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax is assessed on the teams with the five highest payrolls at a  
rate of 34 percent on the amount above the midpoint between 
payrolls Nos. 5 and 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on opening-day rosters, the threshold for the tax taking  
effect was $81,898,568, up more than $11 million from last year's 
threshold of $70,501,185. Owners originally hoped the threshold 
would be $55 million last year and $58.9 million this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Baltimore had the highest tax ($3,138,621), followed  
by Boston ($2,184,734), the Yankees ($684,390), Atlanta ($495,625) 
and Los Angeles ($49,593). 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the first year of the tax, the Yankees made the highest  
payment ($4,431,180), followed by Baltimore ($4,030,228), Cleveland 
($2,065,496), Atlanta ($1,299,957) and Florida ($139,607). 
</P>
<P>
	It is estimated teams will pay $14.8 million in tax this year,  
up from $6,552,963 last year and $11,966,468 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike conventional payrolls, luxury tax figures are computed by  
using the average annual value of contracts instead of salaries for 
single seasons. They also include the entire 40-man roster plus 
$5,737,269 per team in benefits paid to players, up 2.9 percent 
from $5,576,415 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The actual luxury tax will be based on final payrolls computed  
in December, with the payments due by Jan. 31. The money goes to 
baseball's industry growth fund.

<HEADLINE> Movie Planned for Theater, Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A personal computer and an Internet connection  
will get you into the movie premiere of ``Dead Broke,'' a dark 
comedy starring Paul Sorvino. 
</P>
<P>
	The film is believed to be the first to debut simultaneously on  
the Internet and the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
	The film's executives and cast members, which include John  
Glover, Tony Roberts and Jill Hennessy, will be seeing a digital 
version, too. The Tribeca Film Center will download the feed and 
route it through a digital projector, USA Today reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Edward Vilga-directed ``Dead Broke'' is the first of a  
four-film series that iFilm Network, in conjunction with Globix, 
Microsoft and the Tribeca Film Center, will premiere on the 
Internet. IFilm is an online community of independent filmmakers 
and fans. 
</P>
<P>
	PC users will need an ultrafast T-1 connection to watch the  
movie ``seamlessly,'' but iFilm founder Rodger Raderman said that a 
fast connection will provide decent images and sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers will not have to wait for the entire film to download  
before seeing it. It takes only a few seconds for the movie to 
begin to play, Raderman explained. As the movie is being viewed, 
the rest of it is streaming behind it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dead Broke'' can be seen at http://www.ifilm.net at 2 p.m. EDT on  
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Four Arrested at Cuba-O's Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Four people were arrested for running onto the  
field during the baseball game between the Baltimore Orioles and a 
Cuban all-star team Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters, one juvenile and three adults, were charged with  
trespassing, said Baltimore police spokesman Rob Weinhold. Their 
identities were not released. 
</P>
<P>
	The first three arrests occurred in the middle of the fourth  
inning. The last violation, which occurred with one out in the 
fifth, escalated into a wild scene in center field. 
</P>
<P>
	The protester ran onto the field carrying a sign that said:  
``Freedom -- Strike out against Castro.'' He was tackled and thrown 
to the ground by second base umpire Cesar Valdez, who is from Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Valdez also punched the man before being pulled away by  
Baltimore outfielder B.J. Surhoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Police then restored order and took the man off the field.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the men arrested during the fourth inning was taken away  
almost immediately by security officials. Another was tackled but 
wriggled out of his jacket and ran around the bewildered Cuban 
players before he was caught again. 
</P>
<P>
	As he was led past the Cuban dugout and the Cuban delegation, he  
yelled at them while the Cubans booed and gave him the thumbs-down 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one of the protesters wore a T-shirt that said ``40  
years is too much,'' in an apparent reference to Fidel Castro's 
leadership of Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Rolando Suarez Cobian, director of Caritas Cubana, a Roman  
Catholic relief agency, said the Cuban delegation was not insulted 
by the protest, but was only interested in watching the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are merely slowing the game down,'' he said. ``This is a  
joke.''

<HEADLINE> Nets sign Muresan for Two Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gheorghe Muresan, the tallest player in NBA  
history, was back on the court in the nation's capital Monday night 
-- wearing the other team's uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, the New Jersey Nets signed the 7-foot-7 former  
Washington center for the final two games of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to be with a team,'' Muresan said during pregame  
warmups before the Nets-Wizards game at MCI Center. ``It feels 
good. It helps me be more comfortable for next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Muresan, who hasn't played in nearly two full seasons due to  
injuries, did not take a physical and isn't expected to play in the 
final two games. The Nets made the move so they would have an 
inside track at signing him for next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our interest is sincere,'' said Nets general manager John  
Nash, who used to have the same job with the Wizards. ``I know what 
he can do. The last time he played for the Wizards, they were in 
the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Muresan was Washington's second-round pick in 1993. He played  
four seasons for the team, averaging 10.6 points and 6.8 rebounds 
per game. 
</P>
<P>
	But he missed the entire 1997-98 season because of a suspected  
stretched tendon in his right leg. The problem was later diagnosed 
as compressed nerves in his back, requiring surgery that caused him 
to write off this season as well. Muresan also recently sprained 
his left ankle, slowing his rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	By signing him before the end of this season, the Nets can  
re-sign Muresan without salary cap restrictions. Nash said he 
expects serious negotiations to begin Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey concludes its season Wednesday against Milwaukee.

<HEADLINE> Hi Ho Pimlico, Here Comes Lukas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Bring on the Preakness. Trainer D. Wayne  
Lukas may be ready for another Triple Crown roll. 
</P>
<P>
	The newest member of thoroughbred racing's Hall of Fame won his  
fourth Kentucky Derby on Saturday with Charismatic, giving him 11 
victories in Triple Crown races. 
</P>
<P>
	At Pimlico on May 15, Lukas will try for his fifth Preakness win  
with Charismatic and Cat Thief, who finished third behind Menifee 
in the 125th Derby at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Charismatic will go forward another notch,'' Lukas  
said Sunday morning. ``I think Charismatic has a few good ones 
left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, with Chris Antley aboard for the first time, took  
the lead from stablemate Cat Thief with less than a 16th-of-a-mile 
to go, then held off a furious rush by Menifee for a neck victory. 
</P>
<P>
	An early celebration by Antley nearly doomed Charismatic,  
though. 
</P>
<P>
	About three jumps from the finish line, and with Menifee flying  
down the stretch, Antley began shaking his right index finger 
toward the Churchill Downs grandstand. He never saw Menifee coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got excited and gave the No. 1 sign,'' Lukas said, able to  
joke about the incident to a large crowd gathered outside his barn. 
``If Menifee had caught us, that finger would be in glass in 
formaldehyde in the barn right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, whose horses won six Triple Crown races in a row,  
starting with the 1994 Preakness and ending with the 1996 Kentucky 
Derby, said his colts would arrive at Pimlico sometime next week, 
perhaps May 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cat Thief fits Baltimore well,'' Lukas said. ``Even in defeat,  
he ran his best race for me. He'll make it interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the most bruising Derbys on record, Charismatic weaved  
his way around the track and avoided the bumps and bruises 
sustained by most of the horses -- and jockey Gary Stevens -- in the 
field of 19 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the roughest Derby I've ever ridden in,'' Stevens  
said after his 11th-place finish aboard General Challenge, one of 
three horses sent out by Bob Baffert in his quest for an 
unprecedented Derby three-peat. 
</P>
<P>
	``At one point, Charismatic and Prime Timber came together, put  
the squeeze on me, picked me up and carried me about four strides. 
I don't know how I didn't fall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens apparently developed painful stomach cramps during the  
race as he attempted to keep his gelding out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The filly Excellent Meeting, who with General Challenge were  
sent off as the 9-2 favorite by the crowd of 151,051, second 
largest in Derby history, finished fifth after moving up from 15th 
place with a quarter-mile left. Prime Timber, Baffert's other Derby 
entry, was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	``General Challenge got the worst of it,'' Baffert said. ``It  
looked like he was dragging his right leg, but he's OK today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas' colts will have plenty of company in the 1 3-16th-mile  
Preakness, which has a 14-horse limit compared to the Derby's 20. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the top four Derby finishers -- Charismatic,  
Menifee, Cat Thief and Prime Timber -- Baffert said his other star 
filly Silverbulletday, winner of the Kentucky Oaks, is being 
pointed to the Preakness. Excellent Meeting and General Challenge 
will get a rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Others heading to the Preakness from the Derby field include:  
trainer Nick Zito's duo of Stephen Got Even and Adonis, 14th and 
17th, respectively; Kimberlite Pipe (sixth); and Lemon Drop Kid 
(ninth). 
</P>
<P>
	Possibles include Vicar (18th) and Worldly Manner, who was  
seventh in his first official start as a 3-year-old after only a 
trial race in Dubai. The colt was purchased for $5 million by the 
Maktoum family's Godolphin Racing stable after he won the Del Mar 
Futurity on Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Non-Derby starters set for the Preakness include Derby Trial  
winner Patience Game, Federico Tessio winner Talks Cheap and 
Millions. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, went off at 31-1  
and returned $64.60 on a $2 win ticket -- third highest in Derby 
history behind Donerail's $184.90 in 1913 and Gallahadion's $72.40 
in 1940. The winner paid $27.80 for place and $14.40 for show. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee returned $8.40 and $5.80, and Cat Thief paid $5.80 to  
show. 
</P>
<P>
	The Derby had a record purse of $1,186,200, with the winner's  
share another record $886,200. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, the most seasoned horse in the field with 15  
starts, gave owners Bob and Beverly Lewis their second Derby 
victory in three years. The Lewises' Silver Charm -- trained by 
Baffert -- won in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first time I ever rooted for a Lukas horse that last  
50 yards,'' Baffert said. ``When I knew I was out of it, I thought 
Charismatic. It was neat for the Lewises. They were in shock. I had 
fun watching them in the winner's circle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Baffert reloads, Menifee's trainer Elliott Walden ended up  
just like last year -- second. In 1998, his Victory Gallop was 
runner-up to Real Quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I know what the Buffalo Bills feel like,'' Walden said.  
``But he's a strong horse, he seized the opportunity, turned for 
home and was right there. I thought it was a good race, and we'll 
try again in Baltimore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The filly Three Ring finished last after her saddle slipped at  
the start and she was quickly out of contention. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, Baffert and Zito were vying for the unofficial title as  
``Trainer of the Decade,'' since each entered the Derby with two 
wins each in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the trainer of the '90s,'' Baffert said. ``He's in the  
Hall of Fame and I'm not. He should have been in there a long time 
ago. Like Gretzky, they should have waived the (eligibility) rule 
and put him right in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And by the time the Hall of Fame inductions ceremonies take  
place in August at Saratoga, Lukas may have added a few more Triple 
Crown race titles to his resume.

<HEADLINE> Jagr Seeks Game 7 Miracle / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Limping onto the ice and breathing  
life into the bankrupt Pittsburgh Penguins for a couple of extra 
days enhanced Jaromir Jagr's new status as the NHL torchbearer 
successor to Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the Penguins to a first-round upset of New Jersey in the  
Eastern Conference playoffs is going to be a lot tougher. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we play our best and they play their best, I think we'd  
win,'' said Devils defenseman Ken Daneyko, one of a number of New 
Jersey players who expressed confidence heading into the Tuesday's 
deciding Game 7 at the Continental Airlines Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel we're the better team,'' he added. ``They've got some  
individuals who have better individual skills that can win a game 
for them, but overall as a team we're better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, that was the case Sunday as the Devils tried  
to clinch the series in Game 6 at Pittsburgh. They dominated play 
for long stretches -- until a sub-par Jagr took over late in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL's leading scorer, who had missed the previous four games  
with a groin injury, tied the game late in the third period and 
then won it in overtime with his first goals since he spoiled the 
end of Gretzky's going-away party two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	After skating lightly for about 15 minutes on Monday, Jagr said  
that he felt surprisingly good for someone who had played almost 30 
minutes the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad (the Devils) are so confident,'' Jagr said when told  
the New Jersey players believed they could win Game 7. ``I'm not 
going to tell you we're going to win Game 7 ... but I'm very 
confident in our team. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I can promise you one thing. We're going to go there and  
play our best. That's what we can give you, but I don't know if 
that's going to be enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams come into Game 7 somewhat at a crossroads.  
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins are not only fighting elimination, but also  
extinction. Hall of Famer Mario Lemieux is trying to win control of 
the franchise in ongoing bankruptcy court hearings, but there is a 
chance the team may be moved if a new owner cannot be found. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devils, who won the Stanley Cup in 1995, have been the best  
regular-season team in the Eastern Conference the past three 
seasons, but one of its worst in the playoffs. They were ousted in 
the second round two years ago by the New York Rangers and then 
stunned in the first round last year by Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first round would be a big step, and that's what we have  
to accomplish tomorrow,'' Devils captain Scott Stevens said Monday. 
``There is no question about that. It's getting frustrating. Game 7 
will be the big crunch for a lot of us. I think it's a monumental 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game 7 will also determine what happens in the second round of  
the playoffs. If the Devils win, they will go against Buffalo and 
Dominik Hasek. Toronto would play Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Penguins win, Toronto will play Pittsburgh and Boston  
will play Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came into this playoff (series) as a big-time underdog, and  
we're playing the best team in our conference,'' Jagr said. ``Now 
it's tied 3-3 and whoever wins goes to the second round. So, it's 
very exciting for everybody, and for the hockey players. That's 
what we play for.''

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldier Killed in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TYRE, Lebanon (AP) -- Guerrillas detonated a roadside bomb in  
southern Lebanon on Monday as an Israeli patrol passed, killing one 
soldier and wounding another. 
</P>
<P>
	In an earlier attack, the same Hezbollah guerrilla group wounded  
a pro-Israeli militiaman in the Israeli-occupied zone. 
</P>
<P>
	An Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem said an Israeli soldier  
was killed and another was moderately wounded in the roadside 
bombing, and a militiaman of the South Lebanon Army was slightly 
wounded in a mortar and rocket attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Lebanese officials said the bomb was detonated by remote control  
as Israeli infantrymen were walking along a coastal road at 
Bayadah, a small village in the occupied zone. The village is 12 
miles south of the port of Tyre and about six miles north of the 
Israeli border. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iranian-backed Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the  
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly an hour earlier, Hezbollah guerrillas fired mortar shells  
and rockets at a militia outpost overlooking the Kfar Tibnit 
crossing between the occupied zone and Lebanese 
government-controlled territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's fatality brought to nine the number of Israeli soldiers  
killed in southern Lebanon this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mounting casualties have prompted calls in Israel for an end to  
the occupation of southern Lebanon. The calls have increased as 
Israel prepares for general elections on May 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war to oust some 1,500 Israeli  
troops and 2,500 members of the pro-Israel South Lebanon Army 
militia from the occupied zone. 
</P>
<P>
	The 440-square-mile zone was set up by Israel in 1985 in a bid  
to shield its northern towns from cross-border guerrilla attacks.

<HEADLINE> Reggie Lewis Suit Goes to Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- When Boston Celtics captain Reggie Lewis collapsed  
and died while practicing jump shots in 1993, he left a pregnant 
wife, thousands of fans and a team of doctors wondering what went 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	In the years since, a battle of reputations has been waged  
between Lewis' family and some of the city's most prominent 
physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, they started fighting it out before a jury.  
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' widow says the doctors who treated her husband in his  
last months misdiagnosed and mistreated a fatal heart condition. 
The doctors contend Lewis used cocaine and lied about it, making an 
accurate diagnosis impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to everyone finally hearing the truth  
about Reggie and how his life could have been saved,'' Donna 
Harris-Lewis said in a statement released just before the trial 
began. ``When this is over, I hope and pray justice will finally be 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The malpractice suit pits Harris-Lewis against Dr. Gilbert  
Mudge, who led the specialists, and Drs. Mark Creager and Peter 
Friedman, who were consultants. 
</P>
<P>
	A third consultant, Dr. John Rutherford, recently reached a  
settlement with Harris-Lewis, the terms of which have not been 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith imposed a gag order  
and none of the main players in the case would comment publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	But the story of Lewis' death and the finger-pointing that  
followed has played itself out very publicly in a city that loved 
the Celtics and adored the team's brightest star when he died at 
27. 
</P>
<P>
	It all began April 29, 1993, when Lewis collapsed during a  
playoff game against the Charlotte Hornets. A ``Dream Team'' of New 
England Baptist Hospital doctors assembled by the Celtics diagnosed 
him with arrhythmia, a potentially life-threatening, career-ending 
heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The grim conclusion led Lewis to seek a second opinion from Dr.  
Mudge, of Brigham and Women's Hospital, one of Boston's most 
respected cardiologists. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge reported that Lewis suffered from a neurological disorder  
that causes fainting spells. With proper treatment, he said, Lewis 
could return to professional basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months later, on July 27, Lewis died while shooting hoops  
in the off-season at Brandeis University in Waltham. 
</P>
<P>
	The state medical examiner listed the cause of death as  
adenovirus 2, a common virus that could have led to inflammation of 
the heart, widespread scarring of tissue and, ultimately, a fatal 
cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Autopsy consultants later said Lewis had ``athlete's heart'' -- a  
left ventricle enlarged from pumping massive amounts of blood. 
Examinations of Lewis' body showed no evidence of cocaine use, 
which could have been an explanation for the scarring. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiff attorney Robert Harley said in opening statements that  
Lewis died because his heart arrhythmia was misdiagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the proper treatment had been given, Reggie Lewis would be  
here today,'' Harley said. ``In all likelihood (he) would be 
playing for the Celtics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Mudge later said that two weeks before Lewis died, he  
acknowledged using cocaine in the past, but said he had stopped. 
The lack of full disclosure early in the treatment process made it 
impossible to make a proper diagnosis, Mudge has claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis has vehemently denied her husband ever used  
cocaine. In the last several months, the two sides have sparred 
over the right to bring up the alleged drug use at trial. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 21, Fremont-Smith ruled that jurors can hear the  
accusations -- if the doctors' lawyers can prove cocaine was a 
factor in misdiagnosing Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a person uses cocaine, it can cause structural damage to  
the heart,'' Fremont-Smith said. ``It does become relevant, in my 
mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis, who still lives in the Boston area with her son,  
7-year-old Reggie Jr., and daughter, 5-year-old Reggiena, has 
maintained she tried to get evidence of alleged drug use excluded 
because the charges only ``sensationalize and hide the true 
issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And she has said she brought the lawsuit only to restore her  
husband's name.

<HEADLINE> Oil Refinery Calls For 200 Layoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) -- The Hovensa oil  
refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands will postpone several capital 
and maintenance projects and ask contractors to reduce their work 
force by 200 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm -- a joint venture between Amerada Hess of New York and  
Petroleos de Venezuela -- announced the cuts Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The job furloughs will be ``across the board'' from pipefitters  
to heavy equipment operators, said Alex Moorhead, vice president of 
human resources. 
</P>
<P>
	Moorhead said most of the employees will probably be rehired  
next year, after the company secures a loan to build $500 million 
coker plant to process heavy Venezuelan crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Hovensa's refinery on the island of St. Croix employs 900 of its  
own workers and about 1,300 contract workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce officials on the island said they worried retailers and  
the government would be affected as the layoffs began. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people who would have spent, will no longer spend,'' said  
Senate President Hargrave Richards. ``Secondly, the government 
that's already struggling to make ends meet loses income tax 
revenue.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Jones Ends Above 11,000 Points / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average sped past  
11,000 Monday, shattering the record for the fastest rise between 
1,000-point milestones. 
</P>
<P>
	The index of 30 blue chip stocks rose 225.65 to close at  
11,014.69. It took just 24 trading days for the Dow to move from 
10,000 to 11,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Even by the compressed standards of the modern stock market, the  
latest milestone arrived with remarkable speed. The previous record 
for 1,000-point gains -- from 6,000 to 7,000 -- was 89 trading days 
from October 1996 to February 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's close was also Dow's fourth record high in the last  
five trading sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more reports of an ebullient economy -- showing consumer  
spending up and manufacturing continuing to grow -- pushed the 
stocks of big corporate names higher. That aided the Dow and the 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index, which also recorded a healthy 
gain of 19.45 to 1,354.63. But investors continued to dump Internet 
shares, pushing the Nasdaq composite index down 7.27 to 2,535.58. 
</P>
<P>
	On a percentage basis, Monday's Dow speed record is not  
comparable to the previous mark. The move from 6,000 to 7,000 was a 
16 percent rise, while the move from 10,000 to 11,000 was only 10 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Dow's rise above 11,000 ``is truly remarkable; it's  
breathtaking,'' said Hugh Johnson, market strategist at First 
Albany Corp. ``I didn't suspect that I would be talking about Dow 
11,000 this year, let alone at the beginning of May.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Acampora, director of technical research at Prudential  
Securities, said the market was much stronger now than it was five 
weeks ago. When the Dow passed 10,000, investors were excited, but 
also wary because the advance was made on just a few stocks in the 
technology, telecommunications and pharmaceutical sectors, and a 
few other industries. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past five weeks, the market's roster of leaders has  
broadened to include manufacturing and basic-materials companies 
that had been out of favor for years. 
</P>
<P>
	That means the market -- and the economy -- are much stronger than  
they were a short month ago, Acampora said. ``It's like driving a 
brand new car out of the showroom, and this thing doesn't have a 
nick on it. That's a real move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturing and industrial shares rose Monday after investors  
got two fresh reminders that the economy is strong, but not 
inflationary. The National Association of Purchasing Management's 
index of manufacturing activity declined 1.5 percentage points, to 
52.8 percent, in April. That indicated that the manufacturing 
sector is still expanding, but at a slower rate than before. 
Analysts had expected the index to rise 2.2 percent. The slower 
rate quelled fears of inflation among some traders. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Commerce Department reported that Americans' personal  
income rose 0.4 percent in March, but their spending kept pace, 
leaving the nation's savings rate at a record low. 
</P>
<P>
	After the purchasing managers' report, bond prices erased early  
losses. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which moves in the 
opposite direction from price, closed at 5.65 percent, down from 
5.66 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Influenced by the rise in bond prices, financial stocks  
recovered from a weak opening to end higher. Dow component J.P. 
Morgan added 2 5/8 to 137 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was also led higher by such industrial stalwarts as  
Minnesota Mining &AMP; Manufacturing, up 4 7/8 to 93 7/8; United 
Technologies, up 3 1/2 to 148 3/8; and Goodyear Tire and Rubber, up 3 5/8 to 
60 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks, which have benefited lately from strong oil prices,  
were also big winners. Exxon gained 3 to 86 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Internet and some technology stocks took a drubbing  
as investors continued last week's strategy of taking profits. 
America Online slid 9 5/8 to 133 1.7 in leading volume on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Microsoft shed 1 5/8 to 79 11/16 in leading Nasdaq 
volume. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a strong 2-to-1 margin  
on the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated NYSE volume came to 
985.58 million shares, down from Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 9.88 to 644.18, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 9.70 to 786.67. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.47 to 433.28. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign stock markets, the Tokyo exchange was closed for the  
first day of a 3-day holiday and will resume trading on Thursday. 
The London market was closed for the May Day holiday. In Paris, the 
CAC index rose 0.85 percent, while the DAX in Frankfurt added 0.4 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Rates Rise in Treasury Auction / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities rose in Monday's auction to the highest level since 
early March. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $7.52 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.480 percent, up from 4.335 percent last 
week. An additional $7.50 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.495 percent, up from 4.410 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the highest since March 8, when the  
bills sold for 4.510 percent. The six-month rate was the highest 
since March 15, when the rate was 4.530. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.605 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,886.80 and 4.675 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,772.80. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 4.73 
percent last week from 4.70 percent the previous week.

	Colo. Students To Return to Class  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Chatfield High School welcomed students  
today from former rival Columbine High School, who will return to 
class for the first time since a deadly rampage nearly two weeks 
ago. Chatfield students will have morning classes. The roughly 
2,000 Columbine students, whose school is still a police crime 
scene, will attend afternoon sessions. Three large banners adorned 
Chatfield, one reading: ``Welcome Columbine.'' The schools are 
about three miles apart. But some Columbine students are eager to 
return to the scene of the shooting that left 15 people dead. ``I'd 
rather go back to Columbine, just to have closure,'' 18-year-old 
senior Tiffany Typher said.

15-year-old boy later admitted being responsible for both, 
authorities said. LaVista Junior High was evacuated and the Omaha 
Police bomb squad was called in after the bottle with flammable 
liquid was found in a restroom around 9:15 a.m. The bomb squad 
removed it and detonated it outside the school building. The 
teen-ager was suspended indefinitely and turned over to police. 
Classes were allowed to resume.

been treated as well as first thought. Army doctors say the 
soldiers, for the most part, are in good shape, but checkups 
revealed fractured ribs and a broken nose. The men also have scars 
and bruises from their capture. The cause of the injuries wasn't 
revealed. But the soldiers enjoyed their first full day of freedom 
today as they were reunited with their families.

reports of a noontime airstrike on a bus traveling from the western 
Kosovo city of Pec to Rozaje in neighboring Montenegro. A news

purchasers' attempt to revive their accusations that Volvo 
illegally schemed to overcharge them. About 9,000 individuals and 
corporations who bought Volvos in Puerto Rico between 1983 and 1993 
sued the car manufacturer and the local companies that imported and 
sold the cars. The defendants were accused under the federal

<HEADLINE> 'Entrapment' Nabs Top Film Spot / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Armed with Sean Connery's roguish charm, the  
high-stakes caper ``Entrapment'' slipped atop the weekend box 
office, earning $20.7 million in its debut, according to industry 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The film featuring Catherine Zeta-Jones as a seductress  
targeting Connery's art thief easily knocked ``The Matrix'' down to 
No. 2. The science-fiction thriller starring Keanu Reeves took in 
$8.7 million in its fifth week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Entrapment'' benefited from advertising in which a  
leotard-clad Zeta-Jones slinks through a web of laser beams and a 
performance from Connery that was reminiscent of his stunt-filled 
days as James Bond, said Robert Bucksbaum, a movie analyst with 
Reel Source Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sean Connery has been around forever and has a lot of star  
power. Adult women wanted to see him, and young men wanted to see 
her,'' Bucksbaum said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The horror-comedy ``Idle Hands,'' the only other film opening in  
wide release over the weekend, brought in just $1.8 million, tying 
for sixth place with ``10 Things I Hate About You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The story of a pot-smoking teen who slays his friends because a  
demon has possessed his hand may have suffered from macabre 
comparisons to the recent Colorado high school killings, Bucksbaum 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They may have backed off a little on their marketing campaign  
because teen-agers killing other teens would have turned off a lot 
of people,'' he said. ``People didn't feel like seeing a movie like 
this so close to that incident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Comedies dominated the rest of the top 10, with the Eddie  
Murphy-Martin Lawrence prison movie ``Life'' earning $6.4 million 
for third place. 
</P>
<P>
	The Drew Barrymore high school comedy ``Never Been Kissed''  
dropped to fourth place with $4.2 million, while ``Analyze This'' 
fell to fifth with $2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	With $98.5 million in ticket sales, ``Analyze This'' was inching  
toward becoming the second film of 1999 to cross the $100 million 
mark. The first was ``The Matrix,'' which has earned $129.7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	After disappointing openings, two other comedies plummeted to  
the bottom of the top 10 in only their second week of release.

<HEADLINE> Columbia/HCA Executives Go On Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Four executives of the giant Columbia/HCA  
Healthcare Corp. went on trial today on charges they plotted to 
bilk the government of $2.8 million by submitting false health care 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges, the first from a wide-ranging FBI probe of the  
nation's largest hospital chain, allege the four midlevel managers 
tried to cheat government health care programs by overbilling for 
services, then tried to cover up the inflated costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection began this morning. Fifty prospective jurors were  
called for a case that prosecutors expect to take two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors allege that the defendants claimed expenses at  
Fawcett Memorial Hospital in Port Charlotte, Fla., were ``capital 
outlays'' when they knew some charges should have been listed as 
administrative and general expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The government reimburses capital outlays at a higher rate than  
administrative expenses. The programs prosecutors say were targeted 
were Medicare, Medicaid, and health insurance for the military. 
</P>
<P>
	The executives were accused of misleading Columbia's own  
lawyers, setting up a reserve bank account to pay back the money if 
the disguised claims were exposed, and trying to come up with ways 
to throw an auditor off track -- even if it meant offering the 
auditor a job. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is the first to reach trial in a wide-ranging FBI  
investigation of Nashville, Tenn.-based Columbia. The investigation 
led to raids on Columbia facilities in seven states in 1997 and a 
management shakeup. In terms of scope and amount of money, it is 
the largest health care investigation in agency history, said FBI 
spokesman Brian Kensel. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants are Robert Whiteside of Brentwood, Tenn., a  
senior executive in the reimbursement department; Jay Jarrell of 
Fort Myers, chief executive officer of the southwest Florida 
division, Michael Neeb of Jacksonville, chief financial officer of 
Columbia's northern Florida operations, and Carl Lynn Dick of 
Orlando, chief financial officer at Columbia's central Florida 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	Whiteside, Jarrell and Neeb are charged with conspiracy to  
defraud, making false statements and planning to deceive or 
obstruct a federal auditor. Dick is charged with conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Each count carries a penalty of up to five years in prison and a  
maximum fine of $250,000.

<HEADLINE> Hi Ho Pimlico, Here Comes Lukas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Bring on the Preakness. Trainer D. Wayne  
Lukas may be ready for another Triple Crown roll. 
</P>
<P>
	The newest member of thoroughbred racing's Hall of Fame won his  
fourth Kentucky Derby on Saturday with Charismatic, giving him 11 
victories in Triple Crown races. 
</P>
<P>
	At Pimlico on May 15, Lukas will try for his fifth Preakness win  
with Charismatic and Cat Thief, who finished third behind Menifee 
in the 125th Derby at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Charismatic will go forward another notch,'' Lukas  
said Sunday morning. ``I think Charismatic has a few good ones 
left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, with Chris Antley aboard for the first time, took  
the lead from stablemate Cat Thief with less than a 16th-of-a-mile 
to go, then held off a furious rush by Menifee for a neck victory. 
</P>
<P>
	An early celebration by Antley nearly doomed Charismatic,  
though. 
</P>
<P>
	About three jumps from the finish line, and with Menifee flying  
down the stretch, Antley began shaking his right index finger 
toward the Churchill Downs grandstand. He never saw Menifee coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got excited and gave the No. 1 sign,'' Lukas said, able to  
joke about the incident to a large crowd gathered outside his barn. 
``If Menifee had caught us, that finger would be in glass in 
formaldehyde in the barn right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, whose horses won six Triple Crown races in a row,  
starting with the 1994 Preakness and ending with the 1996 Kentucky 
Derby, said his colts would arrive at Pimlico sometime next week, 
perhaps May 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cat Thief fits Baltimore well,'' Lukas said. ``Even in defeat,  
he ran his best race for me. He'll make it interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the most bruising Derbys on record, Charismatic weaved  
his way around the track and avoided the bumps and bruises 
sustained by most of the horses -- and jockey Gary Stevens -- in the 
field of 19 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the roughest Derby I've ever ridden in,'' Stevens  
said after his 11th-place finish aboard General Challenge, one of 
three horses sent out by Bob Baffert in his quest for an 
unprecedented Derby three-peat. 
</P>
<P>
	``At one point, Charismatic and Prime Timber came together, put  
the squeeze on me, picked me up and carried me about four strides. 
I don't know how I didn't fall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens apparently developed painful stomach cramps during the  
race as he attempted to keep his gelding out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The filly Excellent Meeting, who with General Challenge were  
sent off as the 9-2 favorite by the crowd of 151,051, second 
largest in Derby history, finished fifth after moving up from 15th 
place with a quarter-mile left. Prime Timber, Baffert's other Derby 
entry, was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	``General Challenge got the worst of it,'' Baffert said. ``It  
looked like he was dragging his right leg, but he's OK today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas' colts will have plenty of company in the 1 3-16th-mile  
Preakness, which has a 14-horse limit compared to the Derby's 20. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the top four Derby finishers -- Charismatic,  
Menifee, Cat Thief and Prime Timber -- Baffert said his other star 
filly Silverbulletday, winner of the Kentucky Oaks, is being 
pointed to the Preakness. Excellent Meeting and General Challenge 
will get a rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Others heading to the Preakness from the Derby field include:  
trainer Nick Zito's duo of Stephen Got Even and Adonis, 14th and 
17th, respectively; Kimberlite Pipe (sixth); and Lemon Drop Kid 
(ninth). 
</P>
<P>
	Possibles include Vicar (18th) and Worldly Manner, who was  
seventh in his first official start as a 3-year-old after only a 
trial race in Dubai. The colt was purchased for $5 million by the 
Maktoum family's Godolphin Racing stable after he won the Del Mar 
Futurity on Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Non-Derby starters set for the Preakness include Derby Trial  
winner Patience Game, Federico Tessio winner Talks Cheap and 
Millions. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, went off at 31-1  
and returned $64.60 on a $2 win ticket -- third highest in Derby 
history behind Donerail's $184.90 in 1913 and Gallahadion's $72.40 
in 1940. The winner paid $27.80 for place and $14.40 for show. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee returned $8.40 and $5.80, and Cat Thief paid $5.80 to  
show. 
</P>
<P>
	The Derby had a record purse of $1,186,200, with the winner's  
share another record $886,200. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, the most seasoned horse in the field with 15  
starts, gave owners Bob and Beverly Lewis their second Derby 
victory in three years. The Lewises' Silver Charm -- trained by 
Baffert -- won in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first time I ever rooted for a Lukas horse that last  
50 yards,'' Baffert said. ``When I knew I was out of it, I thought 
Charismatic. It was neat for the Lewises. They were in shock. I had 
fun watching them in the winner's circle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Baffert reloads, Menifee's trainer Elliott Walden ended up  
just like last year -- second. In 1998, his Victory Gallop was 
runner-up to Real Quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I know what the Buffalo Bills feel like,'' Walden said.  
``But he's a strong horse, he seized the opportunity, turned for 
home and was right there. I thought it was a good race, and we'll 
try again in Baltimore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The filly Three Ring finished last after her saddle slipped at  
the start and she was quickly out of contention. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, Baffert and Zito were vying for the unofficial title as  
``Trainer of the Decade,'' since each entered the Derby with two 
wins each in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the trainer of the '90s,'' Baffert said. ``He's in the  
Hall of Fame and I'm not. He should have been in there a long time 
ago. Like Gretzky, they should have waived the (eligibility) rule 
and put him right in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And by the time the Hall of Fame inductions ceremonies take  
place in August at Saratoga, Lukas may have added a few more Triple 
Crown race titles to his resume.

<HEADLINE> Elway Makes Retirement Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- The quarterback known for being so cool  
in the final minutes of a game showed plenty of emotion this time. 
</P>
<P>
	John Elway had shown the natural poise that made him one of the  
NFL's greatest quarterbacks. Standing in a crowded conference room 
where his family, friends and fans waited for official word of his 
retirement, Elway joked about having his car towed the night before 
and prepared to reflect upon his remarkable 16 years with the 
Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when the enormity of it all blindsided him. Elway's husky  
voice started to crack and his eyes welled up with tears. Taking a 
final knee was not going to be so easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't look at it as retirement,'' the 38-year-old  
Elway said Sunday during an emotional news conference. ``I look at 
it as graduation. We graduate from high school. We graduate from 
college. I'm just graduating from football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With that, Elway paused for the second time in two minutes,  
choking back tears and trying to regain his composure. His wife 
Janet cried as she sat in the front row with their four children 
and John's father, Jack. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Janet walked up to the podium and handed her  
husband a box of tissues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It chokes you up,'' Jack Elway said. ``I've got a lot of  
friends. I like people, but that's my best friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway has been Denver's adopted son since the Broncos acquired  
him from the Baltimore Colts on May 2, 1983. It was fitting that he 
would walk away from football exactly 16 years later. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't have an over-40 league or an over-50 league,''  
Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe said. ``This is it. It's hard. To 
thank all the people who have been a part of his career and helped 
him get to this point, it's a very emotional time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe was one of several teammates who showed up on Elway Day.  
Running back Terrell Davis, defensive end Neil Smith and Elway's 
heir apparent, Bubby Brister, also listened intently as Elway 
explained that he could no longer endure the rigors of NFL life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time for me to move on,'' Elway said, breaking up again.  
``I can't do it physically anymore, and that's really hard for me 
to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his career, Elway's play often left opponents speechless.  
</P>
<P>
	He guided his team to more victories (148) than any other  
quarterback in NFL history. He threw for 51,475 yards and accounted 
for 54,882 total yards -- second only to Miami's Dan Marino. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway also rallied his team to 47 game-saving drives -- more than  
any other quarterback. He was selected to nine Pro Bowls and was 
named the NFL's MVP in 1987. He holds 55 Broncos' regular-season or 
postseason records. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I've ever been around a guy that has had  
expectations as high as John Elway,'' Denver coach Mike Shanahan 
said. ``Everybody has expected him to be the best on the football 
field. He's exceeded those expectations.' 
</P>
<P>
	For years, the only thing missing from Elway's resume was a  
Super Bowl title, and he took care of that by winning two straight. 
In his final game, he was voted Super Bowl MVP in a 34-19 win over 
Atlanta last January. 
</P>
<P>
	He becomes the only quarterback to retire after winning a Super  
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing harder than losing a Super Bowl when you work  
that hard to get there,'' Elway said. ``Heck, after 14 years I was 
wondering if we'd ever get it done. If we hadn't have won a Super 
Bowl, the chances are I'd be back next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Elway joins Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky as the  
third superstar to leave his sport since January. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's ceremony was anti-climatic because Elway's intentions  
had been known for more than a week. He delayed his announcement 
out of respect for the deadly shooting at nearby Columbine High 
School in Littleton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Elway family, Shanahan and Broncos owner Pat Bowlen wore  
blue-and-silver ribbons in memory the shooting victims and a moment 
of silence was held before the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The slayings helped Elway put his retirement decision in  
perspective, and he emphasized family while pondering his immediate 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been great for 16 years,'' Elway said. ``Since the  
kids have been born, the family life has focused around me and 
football. It's time that it focuses around them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to taking his turn in the family car pool, Elway  
will fill his days playing golf and exploring business 
opportunities -- possibly as a broadcaster or a minority owner with 
the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing, however, will be the same on Sunday afternoons.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll never be able fill the void of playing a football game,''  
Elway said. ``I'll never fill that. That will be the biggest part 
that I miss.''

<HEADLINE> Phillies' Brantley Seeks Opinion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Phillies closer Jeff Brantley  
got a third opinion on his injured right shoulder Monday, hearing 
for the first time that he might not need surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Brantley visited Dr. James Andrews, who performed surgery on the  
shoulder in 1997, after having been told he needed surgery by team 
physician Dr. Phillip Marone and orthopedic physician Dr. Craig 
Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Andrews gave him a cortisone shot and said that we should  
wait for 10 days to see what happens,'' said manager Terry 
Francona. ``Jeff will be back tomorrow and will do some throwing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brantley, who missed 11 days earlier this season, left the game  
on Wednesday with what has been diagnosed as a torn labrum. He 
decided to go to Birmingham for a final opinion from Dr. Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Andrews is the only one to have seen the inside of his  
shoulder. He isn't saying that there is not a tear -- just that 
there is a chance that there may not be,'' Francona said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have nothing to lose,'' Francona said. ``If he has to have  
the surgery, he'll be out for the year anyway.''

<HEADLINE>  Star Wars: May the Toys Be With You </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After months of waiting and anticipation,  
anxious ``Star Wars'' fans braved the dead of night to get first 
dibs on the most-hyped line of movie-themed merchandise in history. 
</P>
<P>
	The extensive line of toys and other products-- for the still  
unreleased ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' -- went on 
sale early today on a studio-imposed schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Avid fans around the nation lined up hours in advance.  
</P>
<P>
	``I left my wife and baby across town at a hotel,'' said Paul  
Rockswold, 29, an Evangelical Lutheran pastor who drove 2 1/2 hours 
from rural Creston, Neb., to be first in line at an Omaha Toys R 
Us. 
</P>
<P>
	Many fans could barely contain themselves once the doors opened  
right after midnight Sunday, dashing to the ``Star Wars'' displays 
and scooping up armfuls of toys and other goods. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a ``Star Wars'' maniac,'' said Millie Gonzalez, as she was  
leaving a Toys R Us store in Yonkers, N.Y., with two shopping carts 
filled with merchandise. ``I was first on line and I bought two of 
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans had been waiting for months to get a glimpse of the vast  
array of goodies -- from action figures to wigs to body lotion to 
snack food -- tied to the movie, which opens May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	But LucasFilm Ltd. had signed strict licensing deals that  
prevented manufacturers from releasing virtually any information 
about their products ahead of 12:01 a.m. on May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Anticipating huge demand, Toys R Us stores around the country  
decided to open their doors just after midnight today for an 
all-night selling marathon. Some FAO Schwarz and K-B Toys stores 
were also open after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart and Kmart called in extra staff for their 24-hour  
stores to handle the post-midnight crowds. Many stores limited the 
number of items a customer could buy to prevent immediate 
sell-outs. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the virtual stores were ready for middle-of-the-night  
surfers with an itch to buy. Internet merchants Amazon.com and 
eToys also opened their ``Star Wars'' stores after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I personally haven't ever seen anything like this,'' said  
Ratana Oleczak, store manager at a Toys R Us in Milwaukee. ``I've 
heard of things that are hot before, like people standing in line 
for Furbies and for the Tickle Me Elmo and things like that, but as 
far as this caliber, no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the FAO Schwartz store in Boston, store employees cheered and  
waved laser wands as shoppers rushed in. The original ``Star Wars'' 
theme song blared in the background. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fans waited as much as six hours at stores in West Virginia  
while the Toys R Us in Lawrence Township, N.J., anticipated being 
open all night long with a steady stream of customers. The Toys R 
Us in Cary, N.C., served breakfast to children who shopped before 
heading to school. 
</P>
<P>
	In Columbus, Ohio, Matt Brown and friend Jeff Haggard worked as  
a team to quickly find all of the action figures, dolls and space 
ships they wanted at the local Toys R Us store. In the same store, 
Greg Lawhun stood in awe over the huge -- and aggressive -- crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't expect this,'' Lawhun said. ``It's like Cabbage  
Patch mania. It's like a feeding frenzy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Roper of Boise, anticipating a long night, had relatives  
bring him snacks and coffee while he waited. Roper estimates he 
already has sunk about $2,500 into 300 Star Wars action figures he 
displays in his house, and was primed to spend more. 
</P>
<P>
	The big seller of the night was the line of 12-inch dolls, which  
include characters such as villain Darth Maul and space creature 
Jar Jar Binks.

	In Columbus, Ohio, Matt Brown and friend Jeff Haggard worked as

ships they wanted at the local Toys R Us store. In the same store,

<HEADLINE> Race Deaths Raise Safety Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- It was planned as a big opening act for the  
83rd Indianapolis 500. It turned instead into another deadly 
reminder of the dangers of being a spectator at auto races. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to go on,'' Indy Racing League founder Tony George  
said Sunday as authorities tried to piece together evidence from an 
accident in the VisionAire 500 that killed three spectators in the 
grandstands. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight other spectators were injured, including a 9-year-old girl  
who was in critical condition, when debris from a three-car wreck 
flew into the seats near the exit of the fourth turn at Lowe's 
Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night's race marked the first time in the four-year  
history of the IRL that a second event was scheduled for the month 
of May, which had been reserved exclusively for the circuit's 
marquee race, the Indianapolis 500. IRL officials thought holding a 
race in the cradle of stock-car country would help boost interest 
in their open-wheel series leading up to the May 30 event at Indy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a business for us,'' George said. ``It's also a sport  
and a livelihood, and our fans who support us would want us to go 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 50,000 people were on hand at the suburban Charlotte  
track when the force of the crash at speeds near 215 mph rocketed a 
wheel and suspension parts over a 15-foot-high catch fence. The 
debris flew into the grandstands and slammed into spectators, some 
of them seated as high as 39 rows above the 1.5-mile, high-banked 
superspeedway. 
</P>
<P>
	As shrieking spectators sought help, rescue workers converged on  
the bloody area in a scenario eerily similar to that at Michigan 
Speedway last July 26, when three spectators were killed in a Champ 
Car race. The cause in that event also was a broken wheel and 
suspension parts that hurdled a catch fence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every once in a while, unfortunately, auto racing raises the  
black side of itself,'' Lowe's Motor Speedway president H.A. 
``Humpy'' Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
	George, whose circuit has been fighting to overcome a thin  
schedule and a lack of high-dollar sponsors and big-name drivers, 
said the IRL has made big gains in safety and will keep trying to 
improve. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't plan for every possible scenario,'' he said. ``We  
just do our level best, and unfortunately, sometimes that may not 
be enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Concord police said that because the accident occurred on  
private property and there didn't appear to be any criminal intent 
by anyone, they didn't plan any investigation but would assist if 
asked. Wheeler said the IRL and the speedway planned their own 
probes to augment the efforts of their insurers, ``to make sure 
that this never happens again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to keep wheels from flying off at impact, the  
Formula One circuit this year began requiring its teams to use 
tethers designed to keep the wheels and suspension connected to the 
main body of the machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Such tethers are not required on either Champ Cars or IRL  
machines, in part because some racing authorities think the devices 
may solve one problem while creating another. 
</P>
<P>
	Leo Mehl, executive director of the IRL, said there is concern  
that while tethers may prevent parts from flying off cars and 
hitting fans, they also may put drivers in greater danger because 
the parts could snap back and hit them instead. A tethered wheel 
also could be especially dangerous if it is launched into the 
stands in a slingshot fashion, Mehl said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL wants to study the issue more, Mehl said.  
</P>
<P>
	``You must be very cautious that you don't make regulations that  
will make things worse,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The height of Charlotte's catch fence conforms to industry  
standards, but it was difficult to tell how much higher the fence 
would have had to be to keep the debris from reaching the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have very little direct film of the accident,'' Mehl said.  
</P>
<P>
	The three people killed were Randy D. Pyatte, 21, and Jeff  
Patton, no age available, both of Connelly Springs, and Dexter B. 
Mobley, 41, of Statesville. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the eight people hospitalized were released by Sunday  
night. The lone exception was Hailey McGee, 9, of Conover, who was 
in critical condition at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte with 
bruises to her brain and lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident occurred in the last race of a three-year  
sanctioning agreement between the IRL and the speedway, prompting 
questions about whether the track might not seek to renew its 
agreement with the circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Further clouding the issue is the fact that the Charlotte track  
is owned by Speedway Motorsports Inc., which controls tracks that 
hold five of the 11 races on this year's IRL schedule. Should the 
IRL lose the support of SMI, it could spell serious trouble for the 
fledgling circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wheeler, who in addition to running the Charlotte track also  
serves as SMI's president, said the company remains committed to 
helping the IRL establish itself as a low-cost alternative to the 
Champ Car circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have pretty strong feelings about the IRL,'' he said.  
``They're trying to do the right thing.''

<HEADLINE> Jury Recommends Death for Charles Ng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A jury recommended the death penalty  
today for a man convicted of killing 11 people in a sex-and-torture 
spree at a mountain cabin in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury deliberated 15 hours over three days before announcing  
its verdict in the case against Charles Ng, 38, the subject of one 
of the longest and costliest homicide prosecutions in California 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng showed no reaction as the verdict was read.  
</P>
<P>
	Judge John J. Ryan will decide at Ng's sentencing June 29  
whether to accept the jury's recommendation or order Ng to serve 
life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng, a former U.S. Marine from Hong Kong, was convicted in  
February of murdering six men, three women and two baby boys in 
1984 and 1985. Prosecutors said the women were imprisoned, tortured 
and raped after being lured to a cabin belonging to Ng's 
accomplice, Leonard Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Charred human remains and the victims' belongings were found at  
the cabin in the Sierra Nevada foothills 150 miles east of San 
Francisco. Lake, a survivalist, lived there and had built a bunker 
with a prisoner's cell. He killed himself after a shoplifting 
arrest in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng (pronounced ``ing'') was arrested later that year in Canada,  
where he fought extradition for five years. The trial was 
transferred to Southern California because of pretrial publicity, 
and the case dragged on as Ng hired and fired attorneys. The cost 
of the case has been estimated at $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng denied killing anyone and said he didn't know Lake planned to  
kill either. But jurors watched graphic videotapes in which Lake 
and Ng were seen tormenting bound women. In one of them, a woman 
pleads for her baby and Ng coldly replies that the baby is 
``sleeping like a rock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the penalty phase, Ng's parents flew in from Hong Kong and  
tearfully testified that he had been abused as a child. Several 
people also testified about Ng's good character, including former 
Marines, prison guards and a 66-year-old woman who was briefly Ng's 
lover.

<HEADLINE>  Turkish Premier To Form New Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's president chose the incumbent  
premier today to form the country's next government, a development 
sure to please the pro-secular military. 
</P>
<P>
	Premier Bulent Ecevit's Democratic Left Party won the largest  
number of parliament seats -- 136 -- with 22 percent of the vote in 
the April 18 election. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will seek a coalition government which will work in  
harmony,'' Ecevit said after meeting with President Suleyman 
Demirel. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecevit, 73, needs the support of at least two other parties to  
gain a majority in parliament. The constitution allow 45 days for 
the formation of a new government. If the deadline isn't met, the 
president has the authority to form an interim government and 
declare new elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecevit is expected to join forces with the far-right Nationalist  
Movement Party, which became the second-largest party in parliament 
with 129 seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic Left Party and the Nationalist Movement Party  
share similar views on foreign affairs, the country's Kurdish 
rebellion and the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecevit is also expected to invite the center-right Motherland  
Party to join a coalition. His party worked successfully with 
Motherland for almost a year in a coalition government until 
shortly before the elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecevit said he planned to begin talks with party leaders by  
Wednesday after conferring with his own lawmakers Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He made it clear that he would not ask the Islamic Virtue Party  
to share power. ``It is out of the question for us to make any 
compromises from the country's basic principal of a secular 
republic,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtue lost 33 seats to take 111 in the elections. It is opposed  
by the military, which has led a campaign against the Islamic 
movement since its strong showing in the 1995 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	During the swearing-in ceremony on Sunday, one of Virtue's  
female deputies, Merve Kavakci, attempted to take the oath with her 
head covered in Islamic fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecevit broke off the ceremony in protest and forced the speaker  
to call for a recess. Kavakci left the session without being sworn 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, prosecutor's office launched an inquiry into possible  
charges of inciting hatred based on religious differences, the 
Anatolia news agency said. If tried and convicted, Kavakci could 
receive up to three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey's establishment sees the scarves as a political statement  
challenging this overwhelmingly Muslim nation's secular system. 
Parliament rules do not specifically ban Islamic headscarves, but 
civil servants are forbidden to wear them. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecevit became a national hero for ordering the invasion of  
Cyprus 25 years ago. The capture of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah 
Ocalan in February was another victory.

<HEADLINE> Church Quits Southern Baptist Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- A church that helped found the Southern  
Baptist Convention in 1845 has quit the denomination over its 
fundamentalist stand on such issues as the role of women. 
</P>
<P>
	First Baptist Church of Greenville voted 500-47 Sunday to sever  
its affiliation with the nation's largest Protestant denomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``This vote is about integrity,'' the Rev. Hardy Clemons said in  
a sermon before the vote. ``Our call is to be honest about who we 
are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First Baptist, with about 2,500 members, had already stopped  
contributing to the convention in 1993. Then, last summer, the 
convention declared that women should ``submit graciously'' to 
their husbands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a struggle with that statement over the submission of  
women,'' said Louise Stanford, a leader of the breakaway movement. 
``But it was really the culmination of 20 years of frustration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First Baptist also expressed concern about what it considers a  
lack of academic freedom in seminaries controlled by the 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wish them well,'' said Herb Hollinger, a spokesman for the  
convention in Nashville. ``This church has had unhappiness with us 
for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The convention channels money for missions, publishes Sunday  
school materials and oversees its seminaries but has no direct 
power over local churches. 
</P>
<P>
	It reported more than 15 million members in 1998, a decline of 1  
percent from the previous year. It was the first membership decline 
since 1926.

<HEADLINE> Buffett Won't Bet on Computer Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Multibillionaire investor Warren Buffett  
stresses sticking with businesses he trusts and understands. That, 
at least for now, doesn't include a number of companies affected by 
the enigmatic Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the annual Berkshire Hathaway Inc. shareholders  
meeting, chairman Buffett said he is waiting to see how businesses 
that catch his eye succeed as their conventional ways of doing 
business are challenged by e-commerce and the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime we buy a business we look at what it will be like in  
five to 10 years,'' Buffett told the 15,000 shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some cases, the Internet is such a threat we wouldn't want  
to get into it,'' he said. He noted that automobile retailing will 
change dramatically as more people go online. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffett also forecast that businesses with trusted brand names,  
such as Berkshire-owned Borsheim's jewelry, should benefit from the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brand names are going to mean very, very much to people among  
the thousands of names offered on the Internet,'' Buffett said. ``I 
don't see them going for Brand X and buying fine jewelry over the 
Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 14,000 shareholders packed the AKsarben coliseum for  
the annual meeting, which features a six-hour-long 
question-and-answer session with Buffett and Munger. Still more 
stockholders listened to Buffett's comments via a large-screen 
television set up at a local hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffett and Berkshire vice chairman Charlie Munger fielded  
dozens of questions ranging from accounting practices to investment 
strategies of Berkshire-owned insurance companies General Re and 
Geico. 
</P>
<P>
	Berkshire, which had $2.8 billion in net earnings last year,  
needs large investments if they are to have any impact on earnings 
growth for the company, Buffett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for investing in companies he likes and holding the stock  
indefinitely, Buffett's estimated wealth of more than $29.4 billion 
makes him the second-richest man in America behind Microsoft Corp. 
chairman Bill Gates at $58 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffett, who owns stock in companies like Coca-Cola and  
Gillette, also said he would not invest in computer companies, 
including Microsoft, because he cannot comfortably predict where 
they will be in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's much easier to predict the relative strength that  
Coke will have in the soft drink world than Microsoft will in the 
software world,'' Buffett said. ``That's not to knock Microsoft. If 
I had to bet on anyone, I'd bet on Microsoft. But I don't have to 
bet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While both Gillette and Coca-Cola have stumbled in the past,  
Buffett said he's sticking with them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see nothing that's happened that would change my long-term  
view of the blade and razor or Coke business,'' Buffett said. 
``Coke and Gillette both anticipated lower earnings, but that will 
happen from time to time.''

<HEADLINE> Gumbel Set To Return to Morning TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bryant Gumbel is about to get back into the  
morning television game. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS has called a news conference for Tuesday, where it is  
expected to announce that Gumbel will take over as host of its 
beleagured morning show, network executives speaking on condition 
of anonymity said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The network will also unveil plans to build a new storefront  
studio for ``This Morning'' that will be similar to the Rockefeller 
Center studio used by Gumbel's former employers on NBC's ``Today'' 
show, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gumbel has largely been off the air since the cancellation of  
his newsmagazine, ``Public Eye with Bryant Gumbel,'' last year. He 
left ``Today'' after 15 years in 1997 to sign a lucrative contract 
with CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	His agent, Ed Hookstratten, did not immediately return a call  
for comment on Monday. CBS would not discuss its news conference 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Morning'' has run a consistent third in the ratings  
behind ``Today'' and ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' The ABC show 
raised the stakes in the morning news competition earlier this year 
when it brought Charles Gibson and Diane Sawyer in as temporary 
hosts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratings for ``Today'' blossomed after it began televising from a  
studio with a window to the street in Rockefeller Center. ABC 
subsequently began building a Times Square studio, and CBS hopes to 
use space on Fifth Avenue near Central Park. It is expected to be 
ready in late fall or early winter. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS is not expected to reveal Gumbel's co-host on Tuesday.  
Network executives have reportedly considered ABC's Elizabeth 
Vargas and Deborah Norville, who was briefly Gumbel's partner on 
``Today.''

<HEADLINE> New Blitz of Travel Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Never mind the first robin of spring, the annual blitz of travel  
software is a more certain indication that winter is history. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since CD-ROM drives made storing large amounts of PC data  
cheap and convenient, trip-planning software has blossomed. As 
Americans hit the road, beginning in May, to haul back vacationing 
college students or to take family vacations, the manufacturers 
promise instant, accurate trip planning and bountiful information 
on conveniences and attractions along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	And they will customize a trip for your driving style and  
preferences -- quickest route, preferred route, scenic route. 
Packages range from $30 to $50 and include a GPS interface. 
</P>
<P>
	GPS -- Global Positioning System -- is a series of satellites that  
can send signals telling a hand-held widget where it is on the 
earth, at least within a few score feet. 
</P>
<P>
	When hooked to a laptop computer running the appropriate  
software, it can tell you your position, heading and speed. What it 
can't tell you is why you would want to spend a couple of hundred 
dollars for information that, in most cases, may also be obtained 
by glancing at the speedometer and the highway signs. 
</P>
<P>
	May is when we retrieve our daughter from William and Mary  
college in Williamsburg, Va., about 380 miles south of Summit, 
N.J., a suburb of New York City. Most of the journey is on I-95, 
which, between New York City and Washington, D.C., does double duty 
as the circle of hell used to punish those who sinned in 
automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Delorme's AAA Map'n Go version 5.0 had just arrived for review,  
so I installed it to review alternatives. The installation program 
thoughtfully advised a ``typical'' installation requiring 50 
megabytes of hard disk space and keeping the CD-ROM in the drive 
when the program runs. 
</P>
<P>
	The user interface and tutorials are first-rate, as are the  
on-screen and printed maps. And when asked, the software coughed up 
lists of restaurants and lodging that are sortable by price and AAA 
Diamond rating and type. It will also tell you about radio stations 
along the way, including coverage area and format. And it can help 
you find ARMs, law enforcement and auto repair at highway exits. 
</P>
<P>
	All of which is nifty, but the heart of the idea here is  
directions. And those can bear some watching. 
</P>
<P>
	On the I-95 version of the Williamsburg trip, for example, the  
software suggested a route covering 373 miles in six hours and 54 
minutes. But that included cutting across Washington, D.C., on city 
streets -- perfect sense to a computer and insanity if it's anywhere 
near the morning or evening rush. 
</P>

	The package did better on an alternative route down to Cape May,  
N.J., across on a ferry boat and then south on U.S. 13, Ocean 
Highway, duplicating exactly a route doped out earlier with a road

<HEADLINE> Personal Income, Spending Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Showing confidence in the economy's strength,  
Americans continue to spend as fast as their incomes are growing. 
They are even dipping into savings. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal income increased a seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent in  
March, following slightly smaller increases in January and 
February, the Commerce Department reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	And consumers matched that income growth with a 0.4 percent rise  
in spending, more moderate than February's 0.8 percent rise but 
nevertheless extending the increase streak to eight months. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, spending has outpaced income growth, leaving the  
nation's personal savings rate -- savings as a percentage of 
after-tax income -- at a record low of minus 0.6 percent in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Although analysts are vigilant for signs of an economic  
slowdown, ``The fact that consumers are willing to bring the 
savings rate into the negative territory indicates that they're not 
concerned about their income and jobs,'' said economist Sung Won 
Sohn, of Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors pushed the Dow Jones average of industrial stocks up  
226 points on Monday to close for the first time above 
11,000-points -- just over a month after breaking the 
once-unthinkable 10,000-point mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Avid consumer spending helped keep the U.S. economy growing at a  
robust 4.5 percent annual rate during the first three months of 
this year, despite analysts' expectations that overseas economic 
turmoil would take more of a toll. 
</P>
<P>
	Low interest and mortgage rates have also fueled spending on  
construction projects, which rose 0.5 percent in March, despite a 
decline in commercial building, the department said in a separate 
report today. That came on top of four previous months of 
increases, including a big 2 percent jump in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction spending for the first three months of 1999 was 10  
percent higher than in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the National Association of Purchasing Management  
said in a third report released Monday that the nation's 
manufacturing sector continued to expand for the third straight 
month in April. But the growth was less robust than in the previous 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	That, combined with more moderate spending growth, could be  
among the first signs of an expected economic slowdown, some 
analysts speculated. 
</P>
<P>
	``This situation is not sustainable in the long run,'' said  
Gordon Richards, an economist with the National Association of 
Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, with the nation's unemployment rate holding near a  
29-year low, demand for labor is strong and wages have continued to 
rise -- by 0.3 percent in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing solid stock market gains are also lining many  
people's pockets. Interest and dividend income rose in March, along 
with rental incomes and business owners' incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	In yet another report out Monday, the Commerce Department said  
that in 1998 spending on work on existing residential properties 
rose 0.8 percent, with two-thirds of a total $119.5 billion spent 
on home improvements, rather than maintenance and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending on commercial construction fell 2.1 percent in March, a  
large drop, but not enough to wipe out the huge 4.0 percent 
increase the month before. Spending on office building projects was 
up slightly, but was more than offset by declines in industrial, 
hotel and retail construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Government construction spending rose 0.3 percent, with  
highways, sewer systems and water supply facilities leading the 
way.

<TEXT>
<P>
	With an awesome display of pressure pitching, Curt Schilling  
lived up to his end of the pitchers' duel with Kevin Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling got out of a bases-loaded jam with no outs in the  
sixth inning to protect a one-run lead, and the Philadelphia 
Phillies went on to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 12-3 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't give up until they take the ball out of my hand,''  
Schilling said. ``I don't give up, give in, anything. I don't ever 
concede a run, because nothing happens until I throw the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With 34,608 fans on their feet in the sixth, Schilling put on an  
overwhelming escape act -- going 3-0 on two hitters with the bases 
loaded but getting three straight outs without giving up a run. 
</P>
<P>
	``It works both ways,'' Schilling said. ``When a crowd is into  
the game, they get me going. It also gets the hitter anxious. 
You've got to feed off that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling (4-1) allowed three runs and six hits, including Todd  
Hundley's two-run homer. He struck out eight and had a season-high 
four walks. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown (2-2) allowed a season-high six runs in six innings and  
could not get out of a bases-loaded jam in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just one of those days where nothing went right,'' Brown said.  
</P>
<P>
	In other games it was, Atlanta 5, Cincinnati 3; Milwaukee 6,  
Arizona 5; St. Louis 8, Montreal 7 in 10 innings; New York 2, San 
Francisco 0; Pittsburgh 8, Colorado 5; Chicago 3, San Diego 2; and 
Houston 3, Florida 2. 
</P>
<P>
	At Philadelphia, Doug Glanville homered and drove in three runs  
as the Phillies ended a four-game losing streak, stopped the 
Dodgers' five-game winning streak and denied manager Davey Johnson 
his 1,000th career victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Sheffield led off the sixth with a walk, Raul Mondesi  
singled and Dave Hansen walked, loading the bases with the Phillies 
leading 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	With the count 3-0 on Hundley, Schilling stepped off the mound  
to tie his shoe and went back to work as the crowd stood and 
cheered. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundley fouled off three pitches, then struck out swinging at a  
split-fingered fastball for the first out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gutsy pitch,'' Phillies manager Terry Francona said. ``He  
probably had to throw it, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling then went 3-0 on Todd Hollandsworth, but got a called  
strike, two foul balls and a swinging strike on a rising fastball 
for the second out. Adrian Beltre hit a smash to Marlon Anderson at 
second to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies scored three runs in the bottom half to put the  
game away. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Braves 5, Reds 3    	
</P>
<P>
	At Atlanta, Javy Lopez had a pair of run-scoring doubles as the  
Braves knocked out former teammate Denny Neagle (0-1) after 2 1-3 
innings to win their fifth straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hopped up, but that had nothing with the way I pitched.  
It would have been the same way against anybody,'' said Neagle, who 
gave up four runs and seven hits in his shortest start since July 
15, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Williams hit a solo homer and rookie Odalis Perez (1-1)  
got his first regular-season career win. 
</P>
<P>
                      *Brewers 6, Diamondbacks 5    	
</P>
<P>
	At Milwaukee, pinch-hitter Marquis Grissom had a three-run homer  
in the eighth inning off Gregg Olson (0-2), who blew a save for the 
fourth time in eight chances this season. Milwaukee stopped a 
five-game home losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Williams homered twice for Arizona, raising his total to a  
league-leading 10. 
</P>
<P>
	David Weathers (2-0) took the loss.  
</P>
<P>
                   *Cardinals 8, Expos 7, 10 innings    	
</P>
<P>
	At Montreal, Fernando Tatis, who hit a three-run homer in the  
first inning, slid home to break a 6-all tie in the 10th. Willie 
McGee then scored on a wild pitch by Ugueth Urbina (2-3). 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Widger homered for the Expos in the bottom of the 10th  
against Juan Acevedo (2-1), who blew his first save in four chances 
when Jose Vidro tied it with a three-run homer. Scott Radinsky got 
his second save. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Mets 2, Giants 0    	
</P>
<P>
	At New York, Dennis Cook (5-0) became the NL's first five-game  
winner when shortstop Ramon Martinez dropped Rickey Henderson's 
eighth-inning fly ball, allowing Matt Franco to score the game's 
first run off John Johnstone (3-1). 
</P>
<P>
	John Olerud followed with an RBI single as the Mets extended  
their winning streak to five. John Franco earned his ninth save. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Pirates 8, Rockies 5    	
</P>
<P>
	At Pittsburgh, Mike Benjamin hit a two-run triple in a four-run  
fifth as Pittsburgh took two of three games from Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Pirates starter Jason Schmidt (4-1) was knocked out after  
allowing five runs and six hits in five innings. Mike Williams 
pitched the ninth for his fourth save. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Walker hit his sixth homer in 15 at-bats. John Thompson  
(0-3) took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Cubs 3, Padres 2    	
</P>
<P>
	At Chicago, Gary Gaetti hit a go-ahead two-run single in the  
eighth as San Diego was swept for the first time in 74 series. 
</P>
<P>
	Their streak of 73 series without a sweep was the fourth-longest  
this century, and the longest in more than 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodney Myers (2-0) got one out for the win, and Rod Beck earned  
his sixth save. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Rivera (1-2) took the loss.  
</P>
<P>
                         *Astros 3, Marlins 2    	
</P>
<P>
	At Miami, Shane Reynolds (5-1) became the first NL starter with  
five wins and Carl Everett drove in two runs as Houston won its 
fourth straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds limited the Marlins to eight hits in 7 2-3 innings.  
Billy Wagner pitched the ninth for his ninth save. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Fernandez (1-2) had another setback as he tries to come  
back from shoulder surgery. He left in the second with a pulled 
right groin and was put on the disabled list.

<HEADLINE> 'Entrapment' Snares Big Audience / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Entrapment,'' starring Sean Connery and  
Catherine Zeta-Jones in a slick tale of thievery and duplicity, 
opened with a strong $20.1 million at the North American box 
office, final figures showed today. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``Idle Hands,'' the comic-horror story of a teen whose hand  
has a murderous mind of its own, debuted with a paltry $1.8 million 
for seventh place. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Matrix'' fell to second place with $8.7 million, followed  
by ``Life'' in third with $6.5 million, ``Never Been Kissed'' in 
fourth with $4.1 million, ``Analyze This'' in fifth with $2.2 
million and ``10 Things I Hate About You'' in sixth with $1.81 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by ``The Matrix,'' April ended up as the first  
record-breaking month this year in box office take with more than 
$448.2 million. But the milestone was due to ticket price 
inflation, since admissions were actually down 2 percent from last 
year, when ``Titanic'' was still hot. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the duds were ``Lost and Found,'' which plummeted 59  
percent in its second week to finish eighth with $1.3 million, and 
``Pushing Tin,'' which suffered an even steeper 65 percent drop to 
finish ninth with $1.25 million.

<HEADLINE> Case Slain Toddlers Unfold in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It took Texas authorities two days to identify the little bodies  
found April 19 by a couple out for a walk. Dead just a few hours, 
the girl and boy lay in 6 inches of creekbed water. 
</P>
<P>
	No one had reported two children missing.  
</P>
<P>
	Workers at an Austin daycare center recognized them from a  
police artist's drawings: 3-year-old Amanda Lee Miller and 
2-year-old Dominick Logan Cornelius. 
</P>
<P>
	It took much longer to find the toddlers' mother. After more  
than a week, authorities traced Tina Marie Cornelius to an 
apartment in Corpus Christi, nearly 200 miles away from where her 
two children were found in Brushy Creek south of Hutto. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, as Amanda and Dominick were buried, their mother  
was arrested and charged with felony child abandonment. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the arrest warrant, she told detectives ``that she  
left the children in the creekbed or ditch and thought they were 
alive when she left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She indicated she did not go back to help them,'' the warrant  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has yet been charged with killing the children.  
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say Amanda died of suffocation and Dominick died  
from a cracked skull. They had been missing five days before being 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	The children have different fathers who live out of state, said  
Tom Vinger of the Texas Department of Public Safety. He said the 
fathers didn't figure into the probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cornelius, a topless dancer, had dropped from sight at the  
Austin club where she had worked for about three weeks. ``She said 
she was going away and was going to leave her kids with some 
friends for the weekend,'' one dancer said on the condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were tight-lipped about their investigation,  
including whether they think Ms. Cornelius had a role in the 
slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a serious crime, and it needs to be thoroughly  
investigated, so that if any additional charges are filed, that 
they will stand up in court,'' said Williamson County District 
Attorney Ken Anderson. ``There is no time now to be rushing into 
judgment or making snap decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cornelius remains in the Williamson County jail on $200,000  
bond. If convicted of the endangerment charges, she could get up to 
20 years in prison for each charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The county grand jury is scheduled to review the case May 18.  
</P>
<P>
	About 70 relatives, family friends and daycare workers attended  
Thursday's funeral in Austin of the two children. Ms. Cornelius' 
mother had delayed the funeral while her daughter was missing, 
hoping she would appear and attend the service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amanda and Dominick deserve to have their mommy there -- you  
deserve to be there,'' said Jean Slater of Cedar Park, an Austin 
suburb. Ms. Cornelius remained in jail during the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral home was decorated with the children's artwork and  
photos of them splashing in a pool and tearing open Christmas 
presents. A choir sang ``Jesus Loves Me'' and ``Mr. Golden Sun,'' 
two of the children's favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies lay in identical white coffins covered with pale  
roses and baby's breath. ``We must remember them as they were,'' 
said the Rev. Phil Ware, ``alive and vibrant and full of joy.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lauds Japan Economic Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping Japan can quickly re-establish itself  
as Asia's economic anchor, President Clinton today praised Japanese 
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi for acting quickly to address his 
nation's many economic woes. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcoming Obuchi to the White House for the first official visit  
of a Japanese prime minister in 12 years, Clinton said the fact 
that Obuchi went to work on economic problems immediately after 
taking office last July was a positive indication that Japan will 
weather its woes. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have been in office less than a year, but already you have  
taken important steps in meeting the challenges that face you, and 
reaching the goals that unite us,'' Clinton said. ``With the right 
choices, Japan and Asia will emerge stronger, more open, more 
democratic, better adapted to meet the 21st century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the two leaders met in the White House, the administration  
announced a package of new trade agreements in which Japan pledged 
greater efforts to expand sales opportunities for U.S. 
telecommunications companies, drug manufacturers, lumber companies, 
banks and brokerage firms and energy companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreements were part of a two-year effort by the  
administration to force Japan to deregulate its economy by removing 
trade barriers. The United States maintains the barriers are a 
major reason for America's trade deficit with Japan, which climbed 
to $64 billion last year, part of a record overall imbalance of 
$169 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the deregulation measures, Deputy U.S. Trade  
Representative Richard Fisher said it will be important for Japan 
to follow through on its commitments, not only for American 
business interests but if Japan is to succeed in ending an 
eight-year period of stagnant economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The emphasis in this is to help Japan turn its economy around  
and pull up its socks,'' Fisher told reporters. ``To do that, 
significant deregulation is mandatory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House arrival ceremony, Obuchi said Japan's  
businesses and industries are now starting to shake off ``an 
overhanging stagnant mood'' and said he would continue to take 
steps to keep that momentum going. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our economy is showing an emerging sign of change for the  
better,'' Obuchi said. ``I am determined to ensure a successful 
revitalization of the Japanese economy, through overcoming with 
unwavering resolve any obstacle we may encounter in the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Obuchi then adjourned to their meeting, with trade,  
the U.S.-Japanese military relationship and the pace of economic 
reform on the agenda. A joint news conference was to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Clinton would stress to Obuchi that although the  
measures he implemented last year are showing some encouraging 
results, he must do more to open the Japanese market to speed the 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japan has taken some constructive steps on banking and fiscal  
matters,'' said White House spokesman Jake Siewert. ``But it's 
important that they continue to implement those policies in a 
sustained way and do more to open and deregulate their economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi, who acknowledges joblessness in Japan is likely to  
deepen, says he is doing all he can but that it will take time to 
reverse the worst recession his country has experienced in 50 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have boldly implemented every kind of measure aimed at  
achieving Japan's economic recovery,'' Obuchi said Saturday in a 
speech in Chicago, the second stop on his U.S. tour. ``At present, 
the United States is perfectly healthy and never catches a cold, 
but on the other hand, Japan has been ailing and losing its vigor 
for the last 10 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his efforts, Obuchi said, the unemployment rate in Japan  
is 4.8 percent -- twice the rate to which it is accustomed -- and 
Japanese companies can be expected to cut more jobs, a sobering 
thought for workers in a land once proud of its promise of lifetime 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
	Taichi Sakaiya, Japan's minister of economic planning, said last  
week that the country is content to ``achieve growth in a timely 
and flexible manner'' under the strategy Obuchi now is pursuing, 
``and then see if anything else needs to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials are worried that Japan cannot achieve the growth  
rate of 0.5 percent that Obuchi's government is predicting this 
year, since some Japanese and international forecasters say there 
will be negative growth well into next year. 
</P>
<P>
	They also note that Japan still lacks a plan for the economic  
recovery's second phase, several months after Obuchi took office 
and immediately began pumping billions of dollars into the economy 
to try to end the recession.

	Twister Kills 10 in Midwest  
</P>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- A tornado that witnesses said was at least  
a half-mile wide tore through Oklahoma Monday night killing at 
least four people, while a Wichita, Kan., tornado killed at least 
six. In Oklahoma City, power lines popped and debris flew as the 
twister moved along from Chickasha, about 35 miles southwest of 
Oklahoma City, and cut through the heavily populated Oklahoma City 
metro area. TV reports showed hundreds of homes destroyed east of 
Oklahoma City. ``We are getting so many injuries we are just 
tagging them and bringing them in,'' said Shara Findley, a 
spokeswoman for Hillcrest Health Center in Oklahoma City. Midwest 
Regional Medical Center said it was treating at least 100 injured.

	Clinton: NATO Terms Must Be Met  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic will  
accept NATO's demands for the withdrawal of his troops, the return 
of refugees and the deployment of an international security force, 
then a halt to NATO bombing is possible, President Clinton said. 
Clinton also said Monday that ``there's plenty to talk about'' 
within the terms set by NATO, which require ``at least the 
beginning of withdrawal of Serb forces.'' After a news conference, 
Clinton conferred with Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin, who 
reported on his talks with Milosevic last Friday. Chernomyrdin said 
after the meeting, ``We got closer to a diplomatic solution.''

	Jackson: Don't Demonize Milosevic

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson returned from  
Yugoslavia Monday and urged President Clinton to call Slobodan 
Milosevic and release two Yugoslav prisoners of war as a goodwill 
gesture that can lead to peace. A senior administration official 
said there are no plans to meet Jackson's two requests. But Jackson 
said Clinton did not reject his appeal outright, so he remains 
hopeful he president will respond. Jackson gave Clinton the letter 
Jackson received from Milosevic in Belgrade.

	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The attorney for the man arrested on  
suspicion of supplying the Columbine High School gunmen with a 
semiautomatic handgun said his client knew nothing of the impending 
massacre. Mark Manes ``was horrified when it happened,'' said 
attorney Robert Ransome. Manes, 22, of Littleton, was booked for 
investigation of providing a handgun to a minor, a charges that 
carries a maximum six years in prison. He was released on bond. 
Manes, who once attended Columbine, was the first person since the 
April 20 shootings to be arrested on charges of helping Eric 
Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, arm themselves.

	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Relations with Israel will not suffer as  
Jordan patches up ties with its Arab neighbors, King Abdullah said 
Tuesday. However, he expressed a thinly veiled impatience with 
Israeli peace policies. The Jordanian monarch made the comments in 
his first television interview since ascending to the throne in 
February after the death of his father, King Hussein. He spoke to 
CNN in a broadcast aired late Monday. Meetings with Israeli 
government officials and goodwill gestures common under Hussein

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Aetna Inc. is launching a no-frills health  
insurance policy to help the 25 million working Americans who are 
uninsured. The program, called Affordable HealthChoices, will be 
sold to employers who can't afford policies for their workers or 
have had to drop insurance benefits because of higher premiums. 
Aetna's policy will cost as little as $46 per person, or $156 per 
family, per month. The program has been approved in Texas, 
Connecticut and the District of Columbia. Aetna hopes to soon get 
approval by regulators in 25 other states.

	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Four people were arrested for running onto the  
field during the baseball game between the Baltimore Orioles and a 
Cuban all-star team Monday night. The protesters, who were not 
immediately identified, were charged with trespassing, said 
Baltimore police spokesman Rob Weinhold. The first three arrests 
occurred in the middle of the fourth inning. The last violation, 
which occurred with one out in the fifth, escalated into a wild 
scene in center field. The protester ran onto the field carrying a 
sign that said: ``Freedom -- Strike out against Castro.'' He was 
tackled and thrown to the ground by second base umpire Cesar 
Valdez, who is from Cuba.

<HEADLINE> 'Entrapment' Snares Big Audience / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Moviegoers were lured by Sean Connery's  
``Entrapment'' over the weekend, making it the No. 1 film in North 
America with box office receipts of $20.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie, which also stars Catherine Zeta-Jones, appealed to  
theatergoers with a plot about thievery and duplicity. 
</P>
<P>
	At the other end of the spectrum, ``Idle Hands,'' the only other  
new movie release, sat idly in movie theaters as it was ignored by 
droves. The comic-horror story of a teen whose hand has a murderous 
mind of its own debuted with a measly $1.8 million for seventh 
place 
</P>
<P>
	``The Matrix'' fell to second place with $8.7 million, followed  
by ``Life'' in third with $6.5 million, ``Never Been Kissed'' in 
fourth with $4.1 million, ``Analyze This'' in fifth with $2.2 
million and ``10 Things I Hate About You'' in sixth with $1.81 
million, industry figures released Monday showed. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by ``The Matrix,'' April ended up as the first  
record-breaking month this year in box office take with more than 
$448.2 million. But the milestone was due to ticket price 
inflation, since admissions were actually down 2 percent from last 
year, when ``Titanic'' was still hot. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the duds were ``Lost and Found,'' which plummeted 59  
percent in its second week to finish eighth with $1.3 million, and 
``Pushing Tin,'' which suffered an even steeper 65 percent drop to 
finish ninth with $1.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Go,'' another disappointment, rounded out the Top 10 with $1.2  
million.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 62.42 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in late morning, with the Dow  
Jones industrials at record highs amid strength in manufacturers' 
shares, but the Nasdaq composite lower as investors continued to 
sell technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 62.42 at 10,851.46. On Friday the Dow ended 32 points higher to 
close at its fourth consecutive record high, after coming very 
close to 11,000 at one point in the session. 
</P>
<P>
	But broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was up 3.98 at 1,339.16, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was off 4.63 at 2,538.22. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturing shares took off, pushing the Dow higher, after a  
report from the National Association of Purchasing Management 
showed that its index of manufacturing activity declined 1.5 
percentage points, to 52.8 percent, in April. The survey indicated 
the manufacturing sector is expanding, but at a slower rate. 
Analysts had expected the index to rise 2.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAPM report followed an earlier report from the Commerce  
Department that showed Americans' personal income rose 0.4 percent 
in March, but their spending kept pace, leaving the nation's 
savings rate at a record low. 
</P>
<P>
	After the purchasing managers' report, bond prices erased early  
losses. The 30-year Treasury bond was up 5/32, yielding 5.66 
percent. The strength in the bond market helped push manufacturing 
stocks higher, said William Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor 
Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got a nice bounce off the (manufacturing) report, which  
came in a little bit weaker than expected,'' Meehan said. ``We're 
being carried by the economically sensitive stocks again. You'd 
have a difficult time moving cyclicals, or anything else, if you 
continued to see the bond market going lower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues led decliners by 4 to 3 on the New York Stock  
Exchange, where volume came to 229.9 million shares, down from 
Friday's pace.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed at midday, with the Dow Jones  
industrials at record highs amid strength in manufacturers' shares, 
but the Nasdaq composite lower as investors continued to sell 
technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
97.65 at 10,886.69. On Friday the Dow ended 89.34 lower at 
10,789.04, after coming within 39 points of 11,000 and setting 
three record highs last week. The Dow closed at a record 10,878.38 
last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed today. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was up 7.66 at 1,342.84, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was off 3.95 at 2,538.90.

International Paper, up 2 1/4 at 55 5/8; and DuPont, up 2 7/16 at 73 1/8. 
Oil stocks, which have benefitted lately from strong oil prices, 
were higher again today. Dow component Exxon was up 1 13/16 at 84 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial shares improved with bond prices. American Express was  
up 1 3/8 at 132 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks, however, were lower, as investors continued  
last week's strategy of taking profits in them. Dow member IBM was 
down 1 7/8 at 207 5/16. Microsoft was down 2 1/8 at 80 3/16 in leading 
volume in Nasdaq trading.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules Against Indian Courts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal courts, not Indian tribal courts, get  
to decide whether federal limits apply to claims that 
nuclear-industry activities caused harm on Indian land, the Supreme 
Court said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruling unanimously in a case involving uranium mining on the  
Navajo reservation in Arizona, the court said federal law pre-empts 
tribal courts from ruling on such cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involves the 1988 Price-Anderson Act, which limits the  
liability of companies involved in the nuclear industry. When 
companies are sued in state court, they are allowed to have the 
case moved to federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress thus expressed an unmistakable preference for a  
federal forum, at the behest of the defending party,'' for deciding 
such cases, Justice David H. Souter wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	The law does not mention a right to move similar cases from  
tribal courts, Souter said. ``We are at a loss to think of any 
reason that Congress would have favored'' having such cases handled 
in tribal courts first, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inadvertence seems the most likely'' explanation why tribal  
courts were not mentioned, Souter wrote. Since there are no nuclear 
reactors or testing laboratories on Indian territory, Congress may 
have thought such cases would not arise, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ordinarily, federal Indian law gives tribal courts the authority  
to handle lawsuits against non-Indians over events occurring on 
Indian land. However, the government argued that the Price-Anderson 
law fully pre-empted state and tribal laws involving injury claims 
against the nuclear industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's case began with two lawsuits filed in Navajo tribal  
court in 1995 against companies that operated uranium mines on the 
reservation during the 1950s and 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura and Arlinda Neztsosie sued El Paso Natural Gas Co.,  
alleging they had been harmed by water contaminated by radioactive 
waste from the El Paso mine. 
</P>
<P>
	Zonnie Richards sued Cyprus Foote Mineral Co. and Cyprus Amax  
Minerals Co. She said her husband's death resulted from exposure to 
radioactive materials and wastes. 
</P>
<P>
	El Paso Natural Gas and Cyprus went to federal court, seeking to  
bar the tribal courts from hearing the lawsuits. The companies said 
all of the nuclear-related claims were covered by the 1988 law and 
must be handled in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled that the tribal courts could decide issues  
based on tribal law, but that they could not hear claims based on 
the federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that all of the  
Indians' claims must be addressed first in tribal court before the 
companies could challenge the tribal jurisdiction in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Supreme Court set aside the 9th Circuit court's  
ruling and ordered the federal judge to determine whether the 
Price-Anderson Act's limits apply to the two lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is El Paso Natural Gas vs. Neztsosie, 98-6.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Brave Joe Adcock Dies at 71 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Joe Adcock, the Milwaukee Braves' star who broke up baseball's  
longest no-hitter and once hit four home runs in a game, died 
Monday at his home in Coushatta, La. He was 71 and had Alzheimer's 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Adcock, first baseman for the 1950s Braves championship teams,  
hit 336 homers in his career, but he probably will be remembered 
more for a home run that didn't count as one. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 26, 1959, Pittsburgh's Harvey Haddix retired the first 36  
Braves he faced -- pitching 12 perfect innings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 13th, the Braves' Felix Mantilla reached on an error and  
moved to second on a sacrifice by Eddie Mathews. After Hank Aaron 
was walked intentionally, Adcock hit the ball out of Milwaukee's 
County Stadium to end the no-hitter and win the game. 
</P>
<P>
	But the score was listed as 1-0 because Adcock inadvertently  
passed Aaron on the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a homer, Adcock was credited with a one-run double.  
</P>
<P>
	Adcock recalled the game when Haddix died in January 1994.  
</P>
<P>
	``He knew what he had in mind when he let the ball loose,''  
Adcock said. ``The wind had been blowing in all night and maybe it 
was a freak because when I came to bat, the flag in center field 
was still. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was thinking he'd been keeping the ball away from me all  
night and maybe he'd do it again, and he did and I hit it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adcock came to the majors in 1950 with Cincinnati and was traded  
to the Braves in 1953, the team's first year in Milwaukee. He 
played on the Braves' World Series championship team in 1957 and 
National League pennant winner in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
	His best season was 1956 when he hit 38 home runs and batted  
.291. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had the pleasure of knowing Joe as a teammate and a friend  
for many years,'' Aaron said. ``I learned a lot from him as a 
player, but as good a player as he was, he was an even-better human 
being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On July 31, 1954, Adcock had the most productive game in  
history, hitting a record-tying four homers and adding a double for 
a record 18 total bases as the Braves beat the Brooklyn Dodgers at 
Ebbets Field. At the time, Adcock was the fifth player in the 
modern era to homer four times in a game. Five players have done so 
since. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 29, 1953, Adcock became the only player during the New  
York Giants' stay of more than a half-century at the Polo Grounds 
to hit a home run into the distant center-field bleachers. He 
connected off New York's Jim Hearn. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine years later, during the New York Mets' temporary stay in  
the Polo Grounds, Lou Brock of the Chicago Cubs and Aaron, still a 
teammate of Adcock, performed the feat on consecutive days. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1963, Adcock moved to the Cleveland Indians and finished his  
playing career after three seasons with the California Angels. He 
had a .277 lifetime batting average to go with his 336 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Adcock managed the Indians in 1967, finishing eighth in the  
American League with a 75-87 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Adcock was born on Oct. 30, 1927, in Coushatta and graduated  
from Coushatta High School. A stint on a basketball scholarship to 
Louisiana State ended when he was signed by the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	During his offseasons, Adcock started breeding thoroughbreds and  
developed Red River Farms, which he continued running after his 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``He bred thoroughbred race horses and enjoyed his  
grandchildren,'' daughter Jan Adams said of her father's life after 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Adams, Adcock is survived by his widow, Joan; a  
son, Jay, who runs the horse business his father founded; daughters 
Jill Kennedy and Jeannie Worsham; his sister, Mary Ann Brown; and 
eight grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Ex-POWs Reunited With Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANDSTUHL, Germany (AP) -- Three U.S. servicemen released by  
Yugoslavia celebrated their first full day of freedom today after 
more than a month in custody and were reunited with their families 
at a U.S. base in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army flew the soldiers' families to Germany, where they met  
privately with the former captives at a U.S. base. No details of 
the reunions were made public immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers spent Sunday evening on the telephone and watching  
television before having a good night's sleep at Landstuhl Regional 
Medical Center, a U.S. military hospital, chief of clinical 
services Col. Mack Blanton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They rested, woke up this morning very well and are in good  
spirits,'' said Lt. Col. Sharon DeRubo, chief of clinical nursing 
at Landstuhl. 
</P>
<P>
	Blanton said initial tests showed the soldiers were ``reasonably  
healthy'' and had ``only minor injuries in their captivity from 
handcuffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers were flown from Croatia to a U.S. Air Force base in  
Ramstein on Sunday, where they were greeted with salutes from their 
Army buddies and wild cheers from a flag-waving crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Their arrival capped an emotional, daylong journey by land and  
air from Yugoslavia's capital with civil rights leader Jesse 
Jackson, who successfully appealed to Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic to release them. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson hoped President Clinton would reciprocate by offering a  
respite from airstrikes, now in their sixth week. However, NATO 
refused to reward the gesture and the alliance continued to pound 
Yugoslavia, delivering more than 600 bombing runs Sunday over a 
24-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
	The freed soldiers, dressed in Army fatigues, were exuberant and  
appeared healthy, standing tall and walking briskly Sunday. But 
they showed signs of the cuts and bruises they suffered when 
captured March 31 on a patrol mission along the Macedonia-Yugoslav 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great relief to be free,'' said Staff Sgt. Christopher  
J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were treated very well,'' said Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez,  
24, of Los Angeles. ``We're doing good, we're healthy. As you can 
see we're very happy. Mostly happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First medical tests showed Ramirez had ``a little bit of  
swelling on his right lower leg'' that required X-rays, Blanton 
told reporters today. Ramirez also had a small cut on the top of 
his head that was stitched while he was in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone underwent a CAT scan to check for internal damage, but  
``in general his condition is good,'' said Blanton. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Spec. Steven Gonzales, 22, of Huntsville, Texas,  
``turned out fine'' in initial checkups and has no further medical 
tests scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	DeRubo put it more directly. ``They look good, they feel good,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the three soldiers ``took excellent care of  
themselves'' in captivity, doing pushups and sit-ups to stay fit 
and drinking and eating ``at the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson flew to Washington today to meet with Clinton and  
deliver a letter from Milosevic with the Yugoslav president's 
proposals to resolve the Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Clinton expressed his gratitude to Jackson and  
said he was pleased at the soldiers' release. ``All of America is 
anticipating their safe return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton did not immediately comment on the proposal to meet with  
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we welcome our soldiers home, our thoughts also turn to the  
over 1 million Kosovars who are unable to go home because of the 
policies of the regime in Belgrade,'' Clinton said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Stone, Ramirez and Gonzales left the Army's 1st  
Infantry division base in Schweinfurt, 50 miles southwest of 
Frankfurt, for Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	They were taken captive while patrolling the Yugoslav-Macedonia  
border as part of a peacekeeping mission, seven days after NATO 
launched its bombing campaign in Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Most MVP Votes Already Cast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- No matter what Tim Duncan, Karl Malone or Alonzo  
Mourning do in the final three days of the season, it won't change 
many MVP votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the voters have already cast their ballots.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's tough. I really didn't know it was like that,'' San  
Antonio's Tim Duncan said after believing he might have changed a 
few voters' minds Sunday by outplaying Malone down the stretch of a 
critical victory by the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballots for MVP, Rookie of the Year, Coach of the Year and other  
awards were mailed almost two weeks ago to 118 voters -- three from 
each NBA city and 31 members of the national media. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA told voters to return their ballots by Sunday, May 2,  
although they could wait until the end of the regular season 
Wednesday night if they felt it was necessary to take the final 
three days into account. 
</P>
<P>
	A league spokesman refused to say Monday exactly how many  
ballots had been returned so far. 
</P>
<P>
	The Deseret News in Salt Lake City reported Sunday that based  
upon a survey of more than 50 voters, Malone is the likely winner. 
Mourning will finish second and Duncan third. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have an idea which way it's going to go, but I'm not  
saying,'' Malone said. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice of mailing and collecting ballots before the season  
is over is a longstanding one, and a sampling of several voters by 
the Associated Press found no one who felt any undue pressure to 
cast a vote too early. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan, however, was very surprised to hear that many ballots  
had already been cast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought they did actually (vote at the end of the season),  
but whatever happens happens,'' said Duncan, whose teammates also 
were under the impression that the Spurs' recent success could 
translate into a few changed MVP votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds pretty stupid, really,'' San Antonio's Steve Kerr  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The question of whether ballots were collected too early also  
came up at the 1996 All-Star game, when Michael Jordan was selected 
the MVP. Shaquille O'Neal finished that game with a flourish, but 
ballots were collected before the final buzzer. When the result was 
announced, Jordan was booed. 
</P>
<P>
	This season's individual awards will be announced during the  
playoffs, and the winner of the MVP traditionally is announced late 
in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honestly, it wasn't even that close for me,'' said Mavericks  
broadcaster Matt Pinto, who voted for Mourning. ``The way he has 
dominated over the course of the season while his team was missing 
two starters, it was clear cut for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackie MacMullan of Sports Illustrated cast her ballot Saturday  
night, choosing Malone over Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the closest ones I can remember, and I was back  
and forth all the way,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	SI's Phil Taylor cast his ballot Sunday morning, choosing Allen  
Iverson of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking at how bad Philadelphia had been for so long, I had to  
give it to Allen. He really fit the definition of most valuable,'' 
Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Rogers of the San Antonio Express-News, who covers Duncan  
on a regular basis, submitted his ballot Monday afternoon and 
picked Malone. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still the main man, the premiere power forward, with  
Duncan close to edging him out of there,'' Rogers said.

<HEADLINE> Reggie Lewis Lawsuit Goes to Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- When Celtics captain Reggie Lewis collapsed and  
died while practicing jump shots in 1993, he left a pregnant wife, 
thousands of fans and a star team of doctors wondering what went 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	In the years since, a battle of reputations has been waged  
between Lewis' family and some of the city's most prominent 
physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	They start fighting it out before a jury today.  
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' widow says the doctors who treated her husband in his  
last months misdiagnosed and mistreated a fatal heart condition. 
The doctors contend Lewis used cocaine and lied about it, making an 
accurate diagnosis impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	The malpractice suit pits Donna Harris-Lewis against Dr. Gilbert  
H. Mudge, who led the specialists, and Drs. Mark Creager and Peter 
Friedman, who were consultants. 
</P>
<P>
	A third consultant, Dr. John Rutherford, recently reached a  
settlement with Harris-Lewis, the terms of which have not been 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith imposed a gag order  
and none of the main players in the case would comment publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	But the story of Lewis' death and the finger-pointing that  
followed has played itself out very publicly in a city that loved 
its Celtics and adored the team's brightest star when he died at 
27. 
</P>
<P>
	It all began April 29, 1993, when Lewis collapsed during a  
playoff game against the Charlotte Hornets. A ``Dream Team'' of New 
England Baptist Hospital doctors assembled by the Celtics diagnosed 
him with arrhythmia, a potentially life-threatening, career-ending 
heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The grim conclusion led Lewis to seek a second opinion from one  
of Boston's most respected cardiologists, Dr. Mudge of Brigham and 
Women's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge reported that Lewis suffered from a neurological disorder  
that causes fainting spells. With proper treatment, he said, Lewis 
could return to professional basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months later, on July 27, Lewis died while shooting hoops  
in the off-season at Brandeis University in Waltham. 
</P>
<P>
	The state medical examiner listed the cause of death as  
adenovirus 2, a common virus that could have led to inflammation of 
the heart, widespread scarring of tissue and, ultimately, a fatal 
cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Autopsy consultants later said Lewis had ``athlete's heart'' -- a  
left ventricle that has become enlarged from pumping massive 
amounts of blood. Everyone who examined Lewis' body agreed there 
was no evidence of cocaine use, which could be an explanation for 
the scarring. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mudge later said that two weeks before Lewis died, the  
player admitting using cocaine in the past but said he had stopped. 
The lack of full disclosure early in the treatment process made it 
impossible to make a proper diagnosis, Mudge has claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis has vehemently denied her husband ever used  
cocaine. In the last several months, the two sides have sparred 
over the right to bring up the alleged drug use at trial. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 21, Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith ruled that jurors can  
hear the accusations -- if the doctors' lawyers can prove cocaine 
was a factor in misdiagnosing Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a person uses cocaine, it can cause structural damage to  
the heart,'' Fremont-Smith said. ``It does become relevant, in my 
mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis, who still lives in the Boston area with her son,  
7-year-old Reggie Jr., and daughter, 5-year-old Reggiena, has 
maintained she tried to get evidence of alleged drug use excluded 
because the charges only ``sensationalize and hide the true 
issue.'' And she has said she brought the lawsuit only to restore 
her husband's name. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is very important that our children understand what  
happened to their father,'' Harris-Lewis told the Boston Herald in 
a recent interview. ``I have waited for three years for this day to 
come, and I'm looking forward to the truth.''

<HEADLINE> Exxon Appeals Valdez $5.3B Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Nearly five years after an Alaska jury awarded  
$5.3 billion in punitive and compensatory damages to those hurt by 
the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, Exxon has yet to pay a single 
dollar to the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Exxon lawyers told a three-judge panel of the 9th  
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the award was not be justified 
considering what it had already paid. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, a federal court jury in Anchorage issued the damages to  
35,000 fishermen, Native Americans, cannery workers and landowners 
for the destruction caused by the spill in Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon appealed, contending it had paid enough: $2.2 billion for  
the cleanup, $1 billion to settle state and federal lawsuits and 
$300 million for lost wages to 11,000 fishermen and business 
operators. 
</P>
<P>
	``The grounding of the Exxon Valdez and the resulting oil spill  
was a terrible accident which Exxon deeply regrets,'' John Daum, a 
lawyer for Exxon, told the judges in a standing-room-only 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	But Daum added, ``Piling on an additional $5 billion in damages  
will not achieve anything not already achieved long before this 
trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to contesting the size of the punitive damages,  
Exxon is appealing the way the $287 million compensatory damage 
award was calculated. 
</P>
<P>
	But lawyers for the plaintiffs argue the award is appropriate  
considering the type and amount of damage caused by the oil. They 
also argue it takes an amount as large as $5 billion to punish a 
company as wealthy as Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
	``The punishment fits the crime,'' said Brian O'Neill, a lawyer  
for the plaintiffs. ``It's one year's income for them, and most 
fisheries lost one year's income'' due to the spill. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Charles E. Wiggins questioned whether the plaintiffs had  
even proven Exxon's liability for the spill. O'Neill said the 
company admitted liability in a stipulation to the jury, which made 
it unnecessary to prove it in court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Putting a drinking alcoholic in charge of a supertanker is  
inherently negligent conduct,'' O'Neill said, referring to skipper 
Joseph Hazelwood, who admitting drinking alcohol and leaving the 
bridge the night of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
	On that night, Hazelwood ordered the 984-foot-long tanker to  
shift position to avoid icebergs in Valdez Arm. Hazelwood then went 
below to his cabin, leaving 3rd Mate Gregory Cousins in control of 
the vessel. Cousins ran the vessel onto Bligh Reef just after 
midnight on March 24, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The resulting 11 million gallon spill, which remains the  
nation's worst, polluted more than 1,000 miles of Alaska shoreline, 
killed tens of thousands of birds and marine mammals and disrupted 
fishing. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, four people testified the accident wouldn't  
have happened if Hazelwood had been on the bridge instead of 
relinquishing it to Cousins, O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A sober Cousins wasn't as good as a drunk Capt. Hazelwood,''  
O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the oil giant also asked the appeals court to order a  
new trial, alleging one juror was intimidated and threatened by 
other jurors and the court bailiff during the 1994 trial in 
Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge H. Russel Holland previously rejected that  
allegation, writing in his ruling that the juror's memory was not 
credible. The plaintiffs want the appeals court to affirm Holland's 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs argued that bailiff Don Warrick was joking when  
he brandished his gun to juror Doug Graham, took out a bullet and 
suggested Graham put another juror ``out of her misery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham said he didn't take the comment seriously, O'Neill said.  
</P>
<P>
	Warrick initially lied about the incident, but later admitted it  
to U.S. marshals and was fired from his job. 
</P>
<P>
	A third appeal filed by Exxon involved the issue of whether a  
group of Seattle seafood processors known as the ``Seattle Seven'' 
is entitled to a share of the $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the start of the 1994 trial, the processors reached a  
$70 million settlement with Exxon. The confidential settlement 
agreement required the seafood processors to pursue their share of 
any punitive damages at trial and then turn the proceeds over to 
Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Seven's share comes to more than $700 million. The  
plaintiffs contend Exxon would hardly be punished if it could pay a 
share of the damages to itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Holland agreed in 1996 and rejected Exxon's claim to the money,  
calling the maneuver an ``astonishing ruse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A ruling by the appeals panel was expected to take at least six  
months.

<HEADLINE> 7 Die in Church Bus Crash in N.M. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARTESIA, N.M. (AP) -- Six girls traveling home after a weekend  
retreat with fellow churchgoers were killed when a camper broke 
away from a pickup truck and struck the bus in which they were 
riding. 
</P>
<P>
	A man driving a pickup truck behind the church bus also was  
killed in Sunday's accident on mountainous terrain on U.S. Route 82 
west of Artesia. 
</P>
<P>
	The westbound pickup truck swerved and a section of the camper  
being towed by the pickup ``tore along the side of the bus,'' state 
police Capt. John Balderston said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It cut through the left passenger side of the bus; it appears  
that the children that were seated next to the windows were the 
ones that were the victims,'' Balderston said. The girls, ages 
about 12 to 17, were killed instantly. 
</P>
<P>
	Balderston said it wasn't known why the pickup truck swerved,  
but investigators were interviewing the driver, a 75-year-old man. 
</P>
<P>
	The pin used to secure the trailer hitch to the truck was  
broken, Balderston said, but he couldn't say whether the break 
caused the accident or was a result. 
</P>
<P>
	High wind might have been a factor in the crash, too, Balderston  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The young victims were among about 80 people from Green Lawn  
Church of Christ in Lubbock, Texas, who had spent the weekend at 
Pine Springs Summer Camp, an isolated, mountainous retreat in 
Lincoln National Forest. The camp near Mayhill is about 150 miles 
southwest of Lubbock. 
</P>
<P>
	Back at Green Lawn Church, hundreds of teen-agers and parents  
sobbed, held hands and sang hymns after word spread of the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you do in the midst of a tragedy like this?'' minister  
Dale Mannon said in a prayer. ``There is nothing pretty about 
death. We don't pretend to know why these things happen. But we do 
know that you, Father, know what it is like to watch a child die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dead girls were identified as Talitha Beaman, 17; Sara  
English, 15; Sara Johnson, 13; Megan Flynn, 15; Heather Dauman; and 
Ashton Qutby. The last two girls' ages were not available. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim in the third vehicle was identified today as William  
Libby, 60, of Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were in serious condition today at University  
Hospital in Albuquerque. Three others were in stable condition and 
a fourth was awaiting discharge today from an Alamogordo hospital. 
Twenty-one others people were treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
	Congregant Sarah Johnson said her daughter was on the trip but  
escaped injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every one of those kids is mine, just as if I had them  
myself,'' she said. ``There are no words .... Right now, we just 
need to pray. We know that they are in a better place and it's up 
to us to be there for the parents.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Securities regulators have been fanning out  
across the country investigating online brokerage firms and 
day-trading companies as they consider drafting new rules for the 
fast-growing electronic trading business. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's top securities regulator is expected to  
announce a new initiative on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  
and the National Association of Securities Dealers, a self-policing 
brokers' group, has been conducted over the past two months or so. 
The auditors are looking for possible violations of securities laws 
as well as examining how well the firms execute customers' orders 
and warn them of trading risks. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC ``has been reviewing the policies and practices of  
day-trading and online trading firms over the past few months for 
compliance with the securities laws,'' agency spokesman Duncan King 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the areas of inquiry include trade execution issues as  
well as the disclosure of risk. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, who warned investors early this year  
to use caution in electronic trading, plans to announce Tuesday a 
new related move by the agency, according to two regulatory 
sources. They spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the NASD declined to comment on the investigation.  
</P>
<P>
	Details of the probe were first reported by The Washington Post  
in Saturday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came in here and very thoroughly reviewed us,'' said  
James Lee, head of Momentum Securities Inc., a day-trading company 
based in Houston with 11 offices nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the auditors have visited ``every day-trading firm  
I know'' in recent weeks, said Lee, who also is chairman and 
president of the Electronic Traders Association. That would mean 
about 15 firms. 
</P>
<P>
	By year's end, an estimated 10 million amateur investors will be  
doing at least occasional trading over the Internet, and online 
brokerage accounts will represent about a quarter of all retail 
stock trades. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest online brokerages include Charles Schwab,  
Ameritrade, Datek Online, DLJdirect, Discover Brokerage and E Trade 
Securities. Spokesmen for some of them declined comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In an inquiry sparked by investors' complaints about recent  
computer system crashes at online firms that caused trading delays, 
New York state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer's office has asked 
several firms to provide reports on their services. 
</P>
<P>
	The world of electronic day trading is much smaller but also  
growing. Day traders seek out stocks, especially of high-tech 
companies, solely for sharp price swings and buy and sell them 
quickly to profit from short-term movements in price. 
</P>
<P>
	Day-trading companies sell training courses and special software  
programs to ordinary investors who want to try the risky, 
lightning-speed practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Walker, the SEC's enforcement director, said in March  
that the agency was, among other things, examining the 
advertisements of day-trading firms to see if they make unrealistic 
promises to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	State securities regulators also have been scrutinizing  
day-trading firms and a handful of them, particularly in 
Massachusetts, have filed fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Operators of the day-trading firms acknowledge they're not for  
everyone, but they contend state regulators are unfairly tarnishing 
the industry because of a few rogue firms that may have misled 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, of the electronic traders' group, said he believed the  
purpose of the investigation was ``as much information-gathering as 
they are going after people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at this as (the regulators) trying to understand what's  
going on,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NASD, which operates the Nasdaq Stock Market, has been  
considering since March a new rule that would require day-trading 
firms to screen investors and warn them in writing of the risks. 
</P>
<P>
	In related moves Monday, state securities regulators announced  
they have formed a task force to examine online trading issues such 
as advertising and customer order processing. And the Securities 
Industry Association issued a brochure for investors titled 
``Online Investing Tips.'' It is available on the trade group's Web 
site at www.sia.com.

<HEADLINE> Metropolitan Tapped For Match Play  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Metropolitan Golf Club, the host  
course for 26 Australian tournaments during its 108-year history, 
was selected Monday night as the site of the Match Play 
Championship in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Federation of PGA Tours said in December the  
Match Play would be in Victoria. The other finalists were said to 
be Kingston Heath and Royal Melbourne, site of the Presidents Cup 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 64 players from the world ranking qualify for the Match  
Play. Jeff Maggert won the inaugural event, beating Andrew Magee in 
38 holes at La Costa Resort in Carlsbad, Calif., to claim the $1 
million first prize from a $5 million purse. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2001 tournament will be played Jan. 3-7, the first official  
event of the year. The Mercedes Championship, limited to only PGA 
Tour winners from the previous season, will be the following week 
in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Metropolitan is regarded as the one of the toughest and  
best-conditioned courses in Australia. The club dates to 1891 and 
moved to Oakleigh, a southeastern suburb of Melbourne, in 1908. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1930, Metropolitan has played host to eight Victoria  
Opens, seven Australian Opens, five Australian PGA Championships, 
four Australian Men's Amateurs and two Ladies Amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Its last tournament was the 1997 Australian Open, where Lee  
Westwood beat Greg Norman on the fourth hole of a sudden-death 
playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The Match Play will be at La Costa in February, and return to La  
Costa in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The other WGC events are the NEC Invitational in August, which  
is limited to Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup players and will be 
played at Firestone Country Club in Akron, Ohio; and the Stroke 
Play Championship, to be played in November in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Cup Team championship will begin in 2000 in South  
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Spot Possible Moon Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On Earth, the south pole may well be the worst  
place to live, but that region of the Moon could be the best choice 
for future bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Three sites, located near the Moon's south pole, provide nearly  
constant sunlight, the researchers report in the May 1 edition of 
Geophysical Research Letters. 
</P>
<P>
	Having nearly constant light means the bases could use solar  
energy, reducing or eliminating the need for other energy sources, 
according to the team lead by D. Ben J. Bussey of the European 
Space Agency in Noordwijk, Netherlands. They used data collected by 
the Clementine spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the energy potential of the sites in the sun,  
there are nearby sites that are in constant darkness, the 
researchers added. There is the possibility that water ice could be 
hidden in such locations, they reported. 
</P>
<P>
	While the location of any Moon base would depend to a great  
extent on the purpose of the base, the researchers found three 
strong candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Site A is on the rim of Shakleton crater, and B is about six  
miles away on a ridge originating from that rim. Site C is on the 
rim of another nearby crater. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Moon's 708-hour day, A is in sunlight 80 percent of  
the time, B is lighted 70 percent of the time and C about 65 
percent of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is only a period of 10 hours when neither A nor B are in  
sunlight,'' the researchers added. ``Therefore if solar arrays were 
placed in both areas and connected by a link (either microwave or 
cable) then a base at either site would receive near constant solar 
energy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The temperature at the suggested sites is relatively constant  
because of the steady light and was estimated at about -64 degrees 
Fahrenheit. Engineers say it is easier to deal with a constant 
extreme temperature than one that is changing regularly, as would 
happen elsewhere on the moon with the regular changes from daylight 
to darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Bussey the research team included Paul D. Spudis  
of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Texas, and Mark S. 
Robinson of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.

<HEADLINE>  Hockey Player Steve Chiasson Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Hours after his team was eliminated from  
the Stanley Cup playoffs, Carolina Hurricanes defenseman Steve 
Chiasson was killed when his pickup truck flipped on a dark, lonely 
road. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old player was found early Monday morning in north  
Raleigh, and the State Highway Patrol says he might have been 
speeding after drinking alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck rolled and ejected Chiasson, who was not wearing a  
seat belt and had been driving alone, investigators said. Weather 
was not a factor and no other vehicles were believed to have been 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tragedy that is impossible to put into words,'' said  
Jim Rutherford, Carolina president and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours earlier in Boston, the Bruins ended the Hurricanes' season  
with a 2-0 victory in Game 6. On Friday night, Chiasson scored the 
first goal in a 4-3 double-overtime loss to the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you work together in our environment, you have a family  
among players and an extended family among wives and children that 
go to school together and play on sports teams together,'' Carolina 
coach Paul Maurice said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really an environment unlike any other. When a tragedy  
like this has happened, unfortunately ... there's no other way to 
put it except for we've lost a member of our family. It's a very 
painful time for all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added NHL commissioner Gary Bettman: ``When a young life ends  
prematurely, when a young family loses a husband and a father, 
words cannot begin to express our sorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team spokesman Chris Brown said two cases of beer and water,  
sports drinks, milk and vegetable juice were served on the team's 
charter flight to Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't know how much beer, if any, Chiasson drank. After the  
plane landed about 1 a.m. at Raleigh-Durham International Airport, 
the players got into their vehicles and left. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get on the plane, you're pretty disappointed,'' said  
Brown, fighting tears. ``We lost a playoff series, but you figure 
out that it doesn't really matter. You get a dose of reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson spent eight years with the Detroit Red Wings, was  
traded to the Calgary Flames in 1994 and in 1997 to what then was 
the Hartford Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was drafted by Detroit in 1985 and played his first NHL game  
the following year. In 1988-89, he led all Red Wings' defensemen 
with 47 points. In 1989-90, he scored a career-high 14 goals and 
again led all Detroit defensemen in scoring with 42 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve was a member of the Red Wings' family for several years  
and continued to be a close friend to individual players and staff, 
as well as the organization. We are deeply saddened by this tragic 
loss,'' the Red Wings said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson had shoulder surgery in January and played in only 28  
out of 82 regular season games, scoring once and adding eight 
assists. The surgery was expected to end his season. Chiasson 
returned in time to play all six playoff games for the Hurricanes, 
which struggled all season with injuries to its defensemen, and had 
a goal and two assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson played in his first NHL All-Star game in 1993. At  
Calgary, he was rated second among Flames' defensemen in scoring in 
1995-96 with 33 points and notched his 300th NHL career point on 
Nov. 29, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The wreck came two years after another tragic accident involving  
Chiasson's former Red Wings teammate Vladamir Konstantinov, 
Detroit's Vyacheslav Fetisov and the team massuer. A limo carrying 
the three crashed into a tree in June 1997 after a celebration of 
the Red Wings first Stanley Cup in 42 years, won six days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Konstantinov sustained severe head injuries that ended his  
career, while the masseur, Sergei Mnatsakanov, also was seriously 
injured. Fetisov had minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson is survived by his wife, Susan, two sons and a  
daughter.

<HEADLINE> Fatal Tornado Hits Oklahoma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- A tornado that witnesses said was at least  
a half-mile wide tore through the central part of the state 
tonight, wiping out neighborhoods and causing an unknown number of 
fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a few fatalities,'' Oklahoma City police dispatcher  
John Zondol said. ``It's the worse I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zondol said at least 400 houses had been destroyed.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are getting so many injuries we are just tagging them and  
bringing them in,'' said Shara Findley, a spokeswoman for Hillcrest 
Health Center in Oklahoma City. ``We're getting everything you can 
think of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said the tornado would register as an F-5, the  
strongest classifications for twisters. 
</P>
<P>
	Television reports showed hundreds of homes destroyed east of  
Oklahoma City. Heavy damage also was reported in Moore, east of 
Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	The twister was first reported about 5:50 p.m., but had not  
caused significant damage to homes until moving closer to Oklahoma 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Power lines popped and debris flew as the twister moved along.  
It formed near Chickasha, about 35 miles southwest of Oklahoma 
City, and tracked through the heavily populated Oklahoma City metro 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	In southwest Oklahoma City, 74-year-old Katherine Burch surveyed  
the damage after the storm destroyed about half the house where she 
has lived for 20 years. She waited it out in the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was coming because I could hear it and it kept  
getting closer,'' she said. ``I heard it, the house started shaking 
and then the big rumble. Glass and everything flew.''

<HEADLINE> Corn, Soybeans Gain; Wheat Sinks / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Corn and soybean futures advanced Monday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, while wheat retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans gained after private forecasters said a wet  
weather system heading for Midwest growing regions could linger 
through part of next week, significantly slowing farmer fieldwork. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally was muted, however, amid continued conflicting views  
on the extent of the rain system, including how much precipitation 
will fall and over how large an area. Prices also were pressured 
amid expectations the government would report improved planting 
occurred in the past week as dry weather returned to growing areas 
during the latter part of last week and into the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were pressured by expectations a crop tour of  
winter wheat growing regions this week will find above-average 
yields that could lead to increased estimates for the early summer 
harvest. A bumper crop would come at a time when there still is 
plenty of last year's crop in storage amid a period of relatively 
weak export demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 4 cents to $2.64 a bushel; July  
corn rose 1 3/4 cents to $2.20 1/2 a bushel; July oats fell 1/2 cent to 
$1.17 3/4 a bushel; July soybeans rose 2 3/4 cents to $4.89 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mostly lower on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle fell .10 cent to 62.72 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle rose .02 cent to 71.17 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell .50 cent to 58.57 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose .17 
cent to 59.17 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lauds Japan Economic Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping Japan can quickly re-establish itself  
as Asia's economic anchor, President Clinton today praised Japanese 
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi for acting quickly to address his 
nation's many economic woes. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcoming Obuchi to the White House for the first official visit  
of a Japanese prime minister in 12 years, Clinton said the fact 
that Obuchi went to work on economic problems immediately after 
taking office last July was a positive indication that Japan will 
weather its woes. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have been in office less than a year, but already you have  
taken important steps in meeting the challenges that face you, and 
reaching the goals that unite us,'' Clinton said. ``With the right 
choices, Japan and Asia will emerge stronger, more open, more 
democratic, better adapted to meet the 21st century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the two leaders met in the White House, the administration  
announced a package of new trade agreements in which Japan pledged 
greater efforts to expand sales opportunities for U.S. 
telecommunications companies, drug manufacturers, lumber companies, 
banks and brokerage firms and energy companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreements were part of a two-year effort by the  
administration to force Japan to deregulate its economy by removing 
trade barriers. The United States maintains the barriers are a 
major reason for America's trade deficit with Japan, which climbed 
to $64 billion last year, part of a record overall imbalance of 
$169 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the deregulation measures, Deputy U.S. Trade  
Representative Richard Fisher said it will be important for Japan 
to follow through on its commitments, not only for American 
business interests but if Japan is to succeed in ending an 
eight-year period of stagnant economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The emphasis in this is to help Japan turn its economy around  
and pull up its socks,'' Fisher told reporters. ``To do that, 
significant deregulation is mandatory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House arrival ceremony, Obuchi said Japan's  
businesses and industries are now starting to shake off ``an 
overhanging stagnant mood'' and said he would continue to take 
steps to keep that momentum going. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our economy is showing an emerging sign of change for the  
better,'' Obuchi said. ``I am determined to ensure a successful 
revitalization of the Japanese economy, through overcoming with 
unwavering resolve any obstacle we may encounter in the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Obuchi then adjourned to their meeting, with trade,  
the U.S.-Japanese military relationship and the pace of economic 
reform on the agenda. A joint news conference was to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Clinton would stress to Obuchi that although the  
measures he implemented last year are showing some encouraging 
results, he must do more to open the Japanese market to speed the 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japan has taken some constructive steps on banking and fiscal  
matters,'' said White House spokesman Jake Siewert. ``But it's 
important that they continue to implement those policies in a 
sustained way and do more to open and deregulate their economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi, who acknowledges joblessness in Japan is likely to  
deepen, says he is doing all he can but that it will take time to 
reverse the worst recession his country has experienced in 50 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have boldly implemented every kind of measure aimed at  
achieving Japan's economic recovery,'' Obuchi said Saturday in a 
speech in Chicago, the second stop on his U.S. tour. ``At present, 
the United States is perfectly healthy and never catches a cold, 
but on the other hand, Japan has been ailing and losing its vigor 
for the last 10 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his efforts, Obuchi said, the unemployment rate in Japan  
is 4.8 percent -- twice the rate to which it is accustomed -- and 
Japanese companies can be expected to cut more jobs, a sobering 
thought for workers in a land once proud of its promise of lifetime 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
	Taichi Sakaiya, Japan's minister of economic planning, said last  
week that the country is content to ``achieve growth in a timely 
and flexible manner'' under the strategy Obuchi now is pursuing, 
``and then see if anything else needs to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials are worried that Japan cannot achieve the growth  
rate of 0.5 percent that Obuchi's government is predicting this 
year, since some Japanese and international forecasters say there 
will be negative growth well into next year. 
</P>
<P>
	They also note that Japan still lacks a plan for the economic  
recovery's second phase, several months after Obuchi took office 
and immediately began pumping billions of dollars into the economy 
to try to end the recession.

<HEADLINE>  Elway Makes Retirement Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- The quarterback known for being so cool  
in the final minutes of a game showed plenty of emotion this time. 
</P>
<P>
	John Elway had shown the natural poise that made him one of the  
NFL's greatest quarterbacks. Standing in a crowded conference room 
where his family, friends and fans waited for official word of his 
retirement, Elway joked about having his car towed the night before 
and prepared to reflect upon his remarkable 16 years with the 
Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when the enormity of it all blindsided him. Elway's husky  
voice started to crack and his eyes welled up with tears. Taking a 
final knee was not going to be so easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't look at it as retirement,'' the 38-year-old  
Elway said Sunday during an emotional news conference. ``I look at 
it as graduation. We graduate from high school. We graduate from 
college. I'm just graduating from football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With that, Elway paused for the second time in two minutes,  
choking back tears and trying to regain his composure. His wife 
Janet cried as she sat in the front row with their four children 
and John's father, Jack. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Janet walked up to the podium and handed her  
husband a box of tissues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It chokes you up,'' Jack Elway said. ``I've got a lot of  
friends. I like people, but that's my best friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway has been Denver's adopted son since the Broncos acquired  
him from the Baltimore Colts on May 2, 1983. It was fitting that he 
would walk away from football exactly 16 years later. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't have an over-40 league or an over-50 league,''  
Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe said. ``This is it. It's hard. To 
thank all the people who have been a part of his career and helped 
him get to this point, it's a very emotional time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe was one of several teammates who showed up on Elway Day.  
Running back Terrell Davis, defensive end Neil Smith and Elway's 
heir apparent, Bubby Brister, also listened intently as Elway 
explained that he could no longer endure the rigors of NFL life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time for me to move on,'' Elway said, breaking up again.  
``I can't do it physically anymore, and that's really hard for me 
to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his career, Elway's play often left opponents speechless.  
</P>
<P>
	He guided his team to more victories (148) than any other  
quarterback in NFL history. He threw for 51,475 yards and accounted 
for 54,882 total yards -- second only to Miami's Dan Marino. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway also rallied his team to 47 game-saving drives -- more than  
any other quarterback. He was selected to nine Pro Bowls and was 
named the NFL's MVP in 1987. He holds 55 Broncos' regular-season or 
postseason records. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I've ever been around a guy that has had  
expectations as high as John Elway,'' Denver coach Mike Shanahan 
said. ``Everybody has expected him to be the best on the football 
field. He's exceeded those expectations.' 
</P>
<P>
	For years, the only thing missing from Elway's resume was a  
Super Bowl title, and he took care of that by winning two straight. 
In his final game, he was voted Super Bowl MVP in a 34-19 win over 
Atlanta last January. 
</P>
<P>
	He becomes the only quarterback to retire after winning a Super  
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing harder than losing a Super Bowl when you work  
that hard to get there,'' Elway said. ``Heck, after 14 years I was 
wondering if we'd ever get it done. If we hadn't have won a Super 
Bowl, the chances are I'd be back next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Elway joins Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky as the  
third superstar to leave his sport since January. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's ceremony was anti-climatic because Elway's intentions  
had been known for more than a week. He delayed his announcement 
out of respect for the deadly shooting at nearby Columbine High 
School in Littleton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Elway family, Shanahan and Broncos owner Pat Bowlen wore  
blue-and-silver ribbons in memory the shooting victims and a moment 
of silence was held before the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The slayings helped Elway put his retirement decision in  
perspective, and he emphasized family while pondering his immediate 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been great for 16 years,'' Elway said. ``Since the  
kids have been born, the family life has focused around me and 
football. It's time that it focuses around them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to taking his turn in the family car pool, Elway  
will fill his days playing golf and exploring business 
opportunities -- possibly as a broadcaster or a minority owner with 
the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing, however, will be the same on Sunday afternoons.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll never be able fill the void of playing a football game,''  
Elway said. ``I'll never fill that. That will be the biggest part 
that I miss.''

<HEADLINE>  Hockey Player Steve Chiasson Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Hours after his team was eliminated from  
the Stanley Cup playoffs, Carolina Hurricanes defenseman Steve 
Chiasson was killed when his pickup truck flipped on a dark, lonely 
road. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old player was found early Monday morning in north  
Raleigh, and the State Highway Patrol says he might have been 
speeding after drinking alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck rolled and ejected Chiasson, who was not wearing a  
seat belt and had been driving alone, investigators said. Weather 
was not a factor and no other vehicles were believed to have been 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tragedy that is impossible to put into words,'' said  
Jim Rutherford, Carolina president and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours earlier in Boston, the Bruins ended the Hurricanes' season  
with a 2-0 victory in Game 6. On Friday night, Chiasson scored the 
first goal in a 4-3 double-overtime loss to the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you work together in our environment, you have a family  
among players and an extended family among wives and children that 
go to school together and play on sports teams together,'' Carolina 
coach Paul Maurice said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really an environment unlike any other. When a tragedy  
like this has happened, unfortunately ... there's no other way to 
put it except for we've lost a member of our family. It's a very 
painful time for all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added NHL commissioner Gary Bettman: ``When a young life ends  
prematurely, when a young family loses a husband and a father, 
words cannot begin to express our sorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team spokesman Chris Brown said two cases of beer and water,  
sports drinks, milk and vegetable juice were served on the team's 
charter flight to Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't know how much beer, if any, Chiasson drank. After the  
plane landed about 1 a.m. at Raleigh-Durham International Airport, 
the players got into their vehicles and left. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get on the plane, you're pretty disappointed,'' said  
Brown, fighting tears. ``We lost a playoff series, but you figure 
out that it doesn't really matter. You get a dose of reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson spent eight years with the Detroit Red Wings, was  
traded to the Calgary Flames in 1994 and in 1997 to what then was 
the Hartford Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was drafted by Detroit in 1985 and played his first NHL game  
the following year. In 1988-89, he led all Red Wings' defensemen 
with 47 points. In 1989-90, he scored a career-high 14 goals and 
again led all Detroit defensemen in scoring with 42 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve was a member of the Red Wings' family for several years  
and continued to be a close friend to individual players and staff, 
as well as the organization. We are deeply saddened by this tragic 
loss,'' the Red Wings said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson had shoulder surgery in January and played in only 28  
out of 82 regular season games, scoring once and adding eight 
assists. The surgery was expected to end his season. Chiasson 
returned in time to play all six playoff games for the Hurricanes, 
which struggled all season with injuries to its defensemen, and had 
a goal and two assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson played in his first NHL All-Star game in 1993. At  
Calgary, he was rated second among Flames' defensemen in scoring in 
1995-96 with 33 points and notched his 300th NHL career point on 
Nov. 29, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The wreck came two years after another tragic accident involving  
Chiasson's former Red Wings teammate Vladamir Konstantinov, 
Detroit's Vyacheslav Fetisov and the team massuer. A limo carrying 
the three crashed into a tree in June 1997 after a celebration of 
the Red Wings first Stanley Cup in 42 years, won six days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Konstantinov sustained severe head injuries that ended his  
career, while the masseur, Sergei Mnatsakanov, also was seriously 
injured. Fetisov had minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson is survived by his wife, Susan, two sons and a  
daughter.

<HEADLINE> US Soldiers Celebrate Their Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMSTEIN, Germany (AP) -- Three U.S. servicemen celebrated their  
freedom today after more than a month in Yugoslav custody, happily 
awaiting the arrival of their families at a U.S. base in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers spent Sunday evening calling families and friends,  
watching television and relaxing before having a good night's sleep 
at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, a U.S. military hospital, 
chief of clinical services Col. Mack Blanton said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``They rested, woke up this morning very well and are in good  
spirits, eager to be reunited with their families,'' said Lt. Col. 
Sharon DeRubo, chief of clinical nursing at Landstuhl. 
</P>
<P>
	Blanton said initial tests showed the soldiers were ``reasonably  
healthy'' and had ``only minor injuries in their captivity from 
handcuffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers were flown from Croatia to a U.S. Air Force base in  
Ramstein on Sunday, where they were greeted with salutes from their 
Army buddies and wild cheers from a flag-waving crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Their arrival capped an emotional, daylong journey by land and  
air from Yugoslavia's capital with civil rights leader Jesse 
Jackson, who had successfully appealed to Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic to release them. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson hoped President Clinton would reciprocate by offering a  
respite from airstrikes, now in their sixth week. However, NATO 
refused to reward the gesture and the alliance continued to pound 
Yugoslavia, delivering more than 600 bombing run Sunday over a 
24-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
	The freed soldiers, dressed in Army fatigues, were exuberant and  
appeared healthy, standing tall and walking briskly. But they still 
showed signs of the cuts and bruises they suffered when captured 
March 31 on a patrol mission along the Macedonia-Yugoslav border. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members were arriving at Landstuhl later today to reunite  
with their loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great relief to be free,'' Staff Sgt. Christopher J.  
Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were treated very well,'' Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, 24, of  
Los Angeles. ``We're doing good, we're healthy. As you can see 
we're very happy. Mostly happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First medical tests showed Ramirez had ``a little bit of  
swelling on his right lower leg'' that required further X-rays, 
Blanton told a news conference today. He also had a small cut on 
the top of his head that was stitched while he was in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone underwent a CAT scan to check for internal damage, but  
``in general his condition is good,'' said Blanton. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Spec. Steven Gonzales, 22, of Huntsville, Texas,  
``turned out fine'' in initial checkups and has no further medical 
tests scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	DeRubo put it more directly. ``They look good, they feel good,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the three soldiers ``took excellent care of  
themselves'' while in captivity, doing pushups and sit-ups to stay 
fit and drinking and eating ``at the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who accompanied the soldiers out of Yugoslavia, flew  
onto Washington today to meet with Clinton and deliver a letter 
from Milosevic with the Yugoslav president's proposals to resolve 
the crisis over Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Clinton expressed his gratitude to Jackson and  
said he was pleased at the soldiers' release. ``All of America is 
anticipating their safe return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton did not immediately comment on the proposal to meet with  
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we welcome our soldiers home, our thoughts also turn to the  
over 1 million Kosovars who are unable to go home because of the 
policies of the regime in Belgrade,'' Clinton said in a White House 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone, Ramirez, and had left the Army's 1st Infantry division  
base in Schweinfurt, 50 miles southwest of Frankfurt, in March for 
Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	They were taken captive while patrolling the Yugoslav-Macedonia  
border as part of a peacekeeping mission, seven days after NATO 
launched its bombing campaign in Yugoslavia.

                            *Joe Adcock    	
</P>
<P>
	COUSHATTA, La. (AP) -- Joe Adcock, who broke up baseball's  
longest no-hitter and shares the major league record of four homers 
in one game, died Monday at age 71. 
</P>
<P>
	The first baseman came to the majors in 1950 with Cincinnati,  
and was traded to the Milwaukee Braves in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 31, 1954, Adcock had the most productive game in  
history, hitting four homers and a double for a record 18 total 
bases as the Braves beat the Brooklyn Dodgers at Ebbets Field. At 
the time, he was the fifth player in the modern era to homer four 
times in a game. Five players have done so since. 
</P>
<P>
	Adcock played on the Braves' World Series championship team in  
1957 and National League pennant winner in 1958. His best season 
was 1956, when he hit 38 of his 336 career homers. 
</P>
<P>
	Adcock was perhaps best known for turning a perfect game into a  
loss for Pittsburgh's Harvey Haddix on May 26, 1959, at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Haddix retired the first 36 batters he faced -- 12 perfect  
innings. In the 13th, Adcock homered with two players on base to 
end the no-hitter and win the game. The score was listed as 1-0 
because Adcock inadvertently passed Hank Aaron on the base paths. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1963, Adcock moved to the Cleveland Indians and finished his  
playing career with the California Angels. He managed the Indians 
in 1967.

<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Steve Chiasson, a hockey player for the  
Carolina Hurricanes, died Monday when his truck flipped over, hours 
after his team was eliminated from the Stanley Cup playoffs. He was 
32. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck rolled and ejected Chiasson, who was not wearing a  
seat belt and had been driving alone, investigators said. He was 
found in north Raleigh, and the State Highway Patrol says he might 
have been speeding after drinking alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours earlier in Boston, the Bruins ended the Hurricanes' season  
with a 2-0 victory in Game 6. On Friday night, Chiasson scored the 
first goal in a 4-3 double-overtime loss to the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent eight years with the Detroit Red Wings, was traded to  
the Calgary Flames in 1994 and in 1997 to what then was the 
Hartford Whalers. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Claudette Henry, who was state treasurer  
when a multimillion-dollar scandal rocked her office in the early 
1990s, died Sunday of scleroderma. She was 52. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal involved $6.7 million in overcharges and kickbacks  
on the trading of nearly $1.7 billion in U.S. securities. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges were filed against Ms. Henry, who was defeated in the  
1994 Republican primary in a bid for re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	Patricia Whitehead, the treasurer's chief trader, and William  
Pretty, a Norman businessman, were convicted on federal charges of 
conspiracy, bribery and money laundering. Mrs. Whitehead was given 
a nine-year sentence. Pretty was sentenced to eight years and one 
month in 1995. Both are serving their time in federal prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Kuhse, a Planners associate, fled to Costa Rica shortly  
before a federal grand jury indicted him in September 1994. He was 
returned to Oklahoma in 1997 and last year was sentenced to a 
71-month prison term. He was also was ordered to repay $3.9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Whitehead was accused of funneling state investments to  
Kuhse's San Diego, Calif., firm in 1991 and 1992 so the broker 
could collect nearly $4 million in commissions. Kuhse then paid 
more than $1 million to Pretty and Mrs. Whitehead. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Henry, a Republican from Oklahoma City, was elected to the  
Oklahoma House of Representatives in 1986. She was elected 
treasurer in 1990.

	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Richard Frank ``Red'' Pittman Jr., whose  
44-year career at The Tampa Tribune began as a $50-a-week assistant 
controller and ended as publisher in 1990, died Saturday. He was 
76. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was unknown.  
</P>
<P>
	As publisher, Pittman made it a point to know the full names of  
everyone who worked for him -- from the pressroom to the newsroom to 
the boardroom. His recognizable Southern greeting was: ``How you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pittman once said that the toughest call of his career was  
closing The Tampa Times, the city's afternoon newspaper owned by 
the Tribune Co. 
</P>
<P>
	He left the newspaper in 1990.

</P>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Joseph Rosenblatt, a Utah philanthropist  
who was decorated by the French government, died Sunday at age 96. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenblatt served on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of  
San Francisco from 1965 to 1974, which made him the longest-serving 
director in the U.S. Federal Reserve System from the corporate 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenblatt became director of Eimco Corp. in the 1930s and  
turned the Salt Lake company into the largest manufacturer of rock 
loaders for underground mining. Before he resigned in 1964, he 
expanded Eimco into a leading maker of processing equipment for 
metallurgical, chemical, food, paper and wastewater-treatment 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving Eimco, he dedicated much of his life to  
philanthropic works, focusing on higher-education programs at the 
University of Utah and in Israel, and Holy Cross and University 
Hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1955, he received the prestigious Knight of the French Legion  
of Honor for his contributions to mechanized mining. The following 
year, he was given the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor for 
promoting trade relations between France and the United States.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Joyce Anderson Valdez, an ardent supporter  
and fund-raiser for the Republican party, died Wednesday after a 
long illness. She was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Valdez, who once served as state GOP finance director,  
organized events from the early 1960s to the mid-1980s that raised 
more than $100 million for Republican candidates, including 
Presidents Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford and George Bush, Governors 
Pete Wilson and George Deukmejian, and Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Valdez often used celebrities to draw supporters to events,  
including Frank Sinatra and Wayne Newton. When he was governor, 
Reagan appointed Ms. Valdez commissioner of the state's Industrial 
Welfare Board. 
</P>
<P>
	She also was an avid golfer and became a nationally top-ranked  
amateur in the sport.

<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- James H. Whittam, president and chief  
executive of Shaklee Companies, died April 15 of cancer. He was 49. 
</P>
<P>

Shaklee Pharma, the pharmaceutical division of Shaklee Corp., to 
develop drug delivery systems. He has served as CEO of Shaklee for 
10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Whittam joined Shaklee in 1978, serving as manager of several  
research divisions and director of research until he left the 
company in 1984. He then worked at Procter &AMP; Gamble, overseeing the 
transition of Vidal Sassoon products into a separate division. 
</P>
<P>
	Whittam returned to San Francisco-based Shaklee in 1987 as  
senior vice president for research and development of new products. 
When the Japanese firm Yamanouchi acquired Shaklee, he was named

	LONDON (AP) -- The dollar was mixed against other major  
currencies in European trading today. Gold also was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	The big currency markets in London were closed for a holiday.

<HEADLINE> Government Photos Capture Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Through 100 years of upheaval and creation,  
the handheld camera has recorded the contrasting moods of the 20th 
century in billions of photographs, from generation-spanning family 
albums to images of indelible graphic power. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government has been taking and collecting  
photographs from the century's beginning, using the camera to 
document, investigate, advocate, promote, propagandize and just 
show the look and feel of everyday America. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Archives holds more than 8 million photographic  
prints, negatives and slides and transparencies in one gigantic 
American family album. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, curators have culled the collection for the best, choosing  
190 images to reflect the energy, achievement, tragedy and humor of 
the century as seen through the purposes of government. The show, 
``Picturing the Century,'' runs through July 4, 2001 at the 
archives. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last half of the 19th century photography was important,  
but bulky and slow. American photographers preserved Abraham 
Lincoln's weary profile, showed the horror of Civil War 
battlefields and convinced Congress with their images that the 
natural glories of the American West were treasures worth 
preserving. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything sped up in the 20th century, and the government's use  
of photography was no exception. There was fast film, fast 
developing, small cameras and, towards century's end, digital 
photography to select and transmit images by computer almost as 
fast as snapping a shutter. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the photographers in the archives show are unknown,  
including those who recorded the Easter Parade on Fifth Avenue in 
New York in 1900 or hardscrabble Steadman Avenue in Nome, Alaska, 
in July of that year with prospectors standing near the Horse Shoe 
Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
	Some are famous:  
</P>
<P>
	--Lewis Hine, documenting child labor in American industry  
recording or, in the signature image of the show, a powerhouse 
mechanic working with an outsized wrench, the arch of his back 
mirroring the curve of the steam pump he is working on. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dorthea Lange, recording the bread lines, work camps and  
migrants of the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ansel Adams, whose photograph of the silver curve of the Snake  
River below the Grand Tetons is in the archives because the 
Interior Department commissioned Adams in 1941 to install a series 
of photo murals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Photographs are created deliberately; they seek to convey  
meaning and suggest an interpretation of a particular moment in 
history,'' says Bruce I. Bustard, the National Archives curator who 
assembled the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``Old pictures are time machines,'' he wrote in the catalog of  
the show. ``They allow us to look back in history, freeze a moment

<HEADLINE> Foreign Auto Sales Rise in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG and Japan's Big Three  
automakers reported another month of stronger U.S. sales Monday as 
the latest boom in vehicle demand entered its second year. 
</P>
<P>
	Monthly year-to-year sales comparisons have been up for the past  
year except July and August, when total sales were artificially 
depressed as two strikes against General Motors Corp. severely 
restricted its supply. 
</P>
<P>
	The reasons for April's strong numbers were familiar: a robust  
economy and consumers confident enough about the future to take on 
the increased debt of a new car or truck. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy has the legs of a marathon runner,'' said Yale  
Gieszl, a vice president of Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. ``Consumers 
look at interest rates, inflation, Wall Street and the job market 
and have every reason to be confident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Barring any surprises from GM or Ford, it looks like another  
gangbuster month,'' said analyst David Healy of Burnham Securities 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	GM will report its results Tuesday; Ford Motor Co. was scheduled  
to report late Monday. Analysts expected GM's sales to be flat to 
slightly down, while Ford was anticipated to show about a 4 percent 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a somewhat unusual month at DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler  
unit, in that its biggest improvement came in car sales. Total 
sales improved 2 percent compared with April 1998; cars were up 6 
percent while truck sales were flat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chrysler unit sells more than twice as many light trucks as  
cars. But its minivan sales fell 19 percent just as the spring 
buying season was heating up, and pickup sales were flat. Healy 
said April's minivan performance was the ``hangover'' of 
incentive-driven sales in March that depleted inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Jameson, vice president of sales and marketing, said truck  
sales also suffered from a tough comparison to April 1998, when 
sales were boosted by a coupon war launched by GM. 
</P>
<P>
	The German-American automaker posted an 18 percent gain in sales  
of highly profitable sport utility vehicles. In fact, SUV sales at 
the former Chrysler Corp. have set monthly records in 17 of the 
last 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota Motor Corp. posted its best April ever in the United  
States, with sales up nearly 10 percent. Its 7 percent rise in car 
sales was led once again by the Camry, the nation's bestseller, 
with sales up 21 percent for its best April ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest Japanese automaker also was boosted by a 13.5  
percent rise in truck sales: The hot-selling Lexus RX300 SUV was up 
78 percent, while the Sienna minivan had its best month ever with a 
25 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda Motor Co. also benefitted from improved truck sales, up 53  
percent. Overall sales improved 4 percent, dragged down by a 3 
percent decline in car sales. Honda's new Odyssey minivan posted a 
211 percent gain, while sales of the CR-V compact SUV improved 41 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Honda's top-seller, the Accord sedan, were flat while  
sales of the Civic subcompact were off 7 percent. But buyers 
flocked to the Acura TL luxury sedan, whose sales nearly doubled. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan Motor Co. had its biggest improvement in months: Total  
sales were up 21 percent, led by a 26 percent gain in trucks. Its 
redesigned Quest minivan, for example, nearly doubled sales over 
April 1998. Car sales were up nearly 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Volkswagen AG said it has its best April in the United States in  
19 years, with sales up 29.5 percent on the strength of a new 
product lineup. Its redesigned Jetta sedan led the sales drive, 
with its best single month since the original version was 
introduced in 1980.

<HEADLINE> 6 Reported Dead in Wichita Tornado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Tornadoes ripped through south Wichita on  
Monday night, tossing mobile homes into a lake and damaging homes. 
At least six people were killed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	One person died when a building collapsed in Wichita, the  
MidAmerica News Network reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Irvin of the Sedgwick County Emergency Preparedness Office  
said multiple injuries were reported in Wichita and nearby 
Haysville. Irvin said six people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Several mobile homes in south Wichita were blown into a lake and  
several other homes were damaged, Irvin said. At least one of the 
fatalities was in the mobile home park, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen-year-old Courtney Karr said she saw the bay windows in  
her house cave in and the tornado swirling inside the house. She 
and her 15-year-old sister Jessie were trapped in the basement when 
their house was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got hit in the head by a lawn chair,'' said Jessie.  
</P>
<P>
	Irvin said the storms, which included high winds and heavy  
rains, hit the area about 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems as if more than one tornado touched down,'' Irvin  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The county declared a state of local emergency disaster. Power  
lines and trees were reported down throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
	A mobile home owned by Chad Harris was rolled over by the  
tornado with eight people inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no trailer,'' Harris said. ``We all rolled in it. It  
was the worst experience in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two people in the trailer were in critical condition.

<HEADLINE> Do We Thrive Today by New Rules? / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It was only a short while ago that the economic  
world was much, much different from what it is today. In fact, no 
more than perhaps five or six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It was all very understandable too. Everyone knew that inflation  
was a constant threat and that there was a natural level of 
unemployment, perhaps 6 percent, below which inflation would ignite 
due to labor shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan was among those who worried  
most about the inflation threat. He and insightful economists at 
big-name schools could even explain the threat by means of 
equations. 
</P>
<P>
	It went like this:  
</P>
<P>
	You can push the jobless rate to a level beyond which it just  
doesn't pay off. That is, a paucity of job seekers means the least 
productive workers hold jobs, and skilled workers demand more 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, output per staff-hour slows and may even turn  
negative. Costs rise and so do prices. Rising prices lead to higher 
interest rates. And then to layoffs. And then recession. 
</P>
<P>
	That was then. Not today. Today, we have low unemployment, low  
costs, low prices and no great threat of inflation or recession. 
And, you might add, growing disrespect for the old notions. 
</P>
<P>
	Do these curious commandments from the early 1990s that were  
supposed to be good for all time -- do they apply anymore? 
</P>
<P>
	Ah, that's the question. Really, lots of questions. For example,  
can we maintain a savings rate below 5 percent without running into 
trouble? Well, consider: We now have a zero rate. Worse, below 
zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Below zero means we not only spend our paychecks, but borrow to  
spend more. And we defend the new way; learned theses explain that 
we know we'll earn more next year so why not spend it today? 
</P>
<P>
	Not long ago we believed that federal budget deficits were  
perhaps eternal. We had reason to think so after 25 straight years 
that the government spent more than its revenues. But now we have 
surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	What happened? Lots of ex-post facto explanations are offered,  
but almost noone anticipated surpluses even a year before they 
arrived. And the reasons why they developed are still disputed. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade imbalance continues. A few years ago we were warned  
that imbalances could bring down the economy. Now, creative 
academics defend the swell of cheaper imports as anti-inflationary. 
</P>
<P>
	So much has changed in a few years. Economic theory, financial  
behavior, shopping habits, workplace goals, the stock market, 
communications, entertainment, college courses, sports, values..... 
</P>
<P>
	Okay, economists, you who were so quick and smart with your  
answers just a decade ago: Let's see you mold this into one 
credible, understandable theory that will last into the new 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Or at least tell us: Are we living well with reality? Is our  
behavior aberrant? Are the old rules of the game about to come down 
on our heads with a wallop that will send us back to the past?

<HEADLINE> Kiwi-FAA Deal Gets Court Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Kiwi International Air Lines took another  
step Monday to returning to the skies. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rosemary Gambardella approved a deal  
struck last month between the carrier and the Federal Aviation 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the court's approval in hand, we can now begin the  
process to work with the FAA which will lead to the restart of 
service,'' said Charles Stanziale, Kiwi's court-appointed trustee. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline, in debt and without planes or permission to fly,  
will soon meet with FAA officials to begin a review process. 
Stanziale did not specify a date. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi, based in Newark, N.J., has been grounded since March 24, a  
day after Kiwi entered bankruptcy for the second time in its 
seven-year history. The FAA suddenly pulled Kiwi's license, 
asserting that the carrier was unable to fly its six-city schedule 
safely. Thousands of travelers were left without flights or 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	The revocation derailed Kiwi's plans to be acquired for $3  
million by Pan Am Airways, a former commercial airliner that flies 
charters out of Portsmouth, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi laid off nearly all of its 500 workers and surrendered its  
four leased jets, but won permission from the bankruptcy judge to 
keep a skeleton staff in place to press its appeal of the 
revocation. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 17, just days before the appeal was to be heard by the  
National Transportation Safety Board, the FAA changed the 
revocation to a suspension and said it would assess no fines or 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension could last up to four months while the FAA  
completes a review, Kiwi has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before being grounded, Kiwi served just Newark; Miami, Orlando  
and Palm Beach, Fla.; and San Juan and Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. It 
recently relinquished routes to Atlanta and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak in the mid-'90s, Kiwi had 1,200 workers, and they  
owned a controlling share of the airline, which had 15 leased jets. 
</P>
<P>
	The founding pilots and flight attendants named Kiwi for a  
flightless bird to symbolize how they had lost their wings -- and 
jobs -- when Eastern and other carriers failed. 
</P>
<P>
	The employees lost their ownership stake when a Baltimore  
surgeon, Dr. Charles C. Edwards, rescued Kiwi from its first 
bankruptcy in July 1997 and invested a reported $21 million.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Group Wins Philippine Bidding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A consortium including Glencore  
International AG of Switzerland won the bid Monday for Philippine 
Associated Smelting and Refining Corp., which is being privatized 
by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale of PASAR, one of the largest copper smelting plants in  
Asia, marks the first stab at privatization by the administration 
of Philippine President Joseph Estrada. 
</P>
<P>
	Glencore is a global trading and marketing concern with  
interests in various commodities. It came up with the highest bid 
of 3.232 billion pesos ($85 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Glencore, through its subsidiary Copper Smelting Investments  
Ltd., holds a 40 percent stake in the winning consortium. A 
Philippine group, led by former Agriculture Secretary Carlos 
Dominguez, holds a 60 percent stake. Dominguez is chairman of 
Copper Smelting Investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Glencore group bested three other bidders, the government  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its dominance in copper smelting, PASAR has not had  
sufficient capital to maintain its 16-year-old plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37.8 percent government stake in PASAR being sold represents  
90 percent of the government's holding in the copper smelting 
company. The rest will be sold to smaller investors in an initial 
public offering.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Texas AG Probed in Tobacco Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Investigators are looking into whether former  
Texas Attorney General Dan Morales improperly tried to help a 
lawyer friend win a half-billion-dollar share of the state's 
tobacco settlement, The Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	Morales' successor, Attorney General John Cornyn, said both his  
office and the FBI are investigating Morales' actions regarding 
Houston attorney Marc D. Murr, a 20-year Morales friend and former 
colleague at a law firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Murr originally asked for $520 million of the $17.3 billion  
settlement, even though other attorneys who worked on the case say 
Murr did little to help. A state arbitration board cut the amount 
to $260 million, but that figure is being disputed, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Two sources close to the attorney general's office said the FBI  
is examining computer files and paper documents to determine 
whether Morales backdated four contracts and letters in an attempt 
to make it appear that Murr was involved in the case longer than he 
really was. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has alleged that Morales benefited financially. And  
Morales has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that once all of the facts and circumstances have been  
reviewed, there's no doubt in my mind the conclusion will be 
evident that no unethical or improper activity on the part of any 
of the lawyers occurred, including my office,'' Morales told the 
AP. 
</P>
<P>
	Murr did not return calls for comment but has said he spent  
2,000 hours working with Morales on strategy and the settlement. 
His attorney, Roy G. Minton, said that he has cooperated with 
Cornyn's investigation but that the FBI has never approached him. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI did not return telephone messages.  
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge David Folsom in Texarkana scheduled a  
hearing for Thursday to look into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Morales led Texas' effort to sue the tobacco industry in 1996  
for reimbursement of Medicaid funds spent on Texans' 
smoking-related illnesses. The tobacco companies settled with Texas 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal with Texas was separate from the $206 billion  
settlement the tobacco industry reached with 46 states in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Five private attorneys who helped represent the state in the  
Texas settlement were eventually awarded a total of $3.3 billion in 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Murr asked for $520 million for his role as an adviser to  
Morales. Last fall, a state arbitration panel approved $260 million 
for Murr even though some people involved in the tobacco lawsuit 
said they had never even heard his name. 
</P>
<P>
	A national arbitration panel set up to handle lawyer fee  
requests nationwide recommended in December that Murr get only $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``People act as though this would be OK as long as Dan Morales  
doesn't get any money out of it,'' said Pete Schenkkan, a lawyer 
who represents six legislators trying to block payment to Murr. 
``Two hundred and sixty million for doing nothing, without proving 
you did anything, on the say-so of your personal friend, is 
outrageous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The amount Murr gets is subject to approval by Folsom, who said  
he wants to know why Morales and Murr chose all three retired 
judges who recommended the $260 million. Murr's attorney said there 
was nothing wrong in doing that. 
</P>
<P>
	Morales, a Democrat, said the state investigation led by Cornyn,  
a Republican, is politically motivated against plaintiffs' 
attorneys like Murr. 
</P>
<P>
	Murr made no courtroom appearances and his name was on none of  
the hundreds of court documents filed before the lawsuit was 
settled. But Morales said Murr's assistance was ``critical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pair met two decades ago while both were at Houston's  
Bracewell &AMP; Patterson law firm. Murr also represented Morales in a 
1990 libel suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Morales decided in 1997 not to run for a third term. He had said  
he would go into investment banking, but has not announced he has 
joined any firms.

<HEADLINE>  Cuban Team Prepares for Orioles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- With the wrangling over visas and flight delays  
behind them, Cuba's national baseball team is ready to play ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban team arrived in Baltimore Sunday night after visa  
delays caused them to missed a scheduled workout and reception at 
Camden Yards. At one point during the weekend, the Cuban government 
threatened to cancel the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	But Orioles owner Peter Angelos, Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke  
and baseball commissioner Bud Selig greeted the team at 
Baltimore-Washington International Airport where they will play the 
Orioles tonight in an historic double-play combining sports and 
diplomacy on the diamond. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked on his way to the meeting who would win the game, Angelos  
said, ``Well, we'll see tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations about every aspect of the game were tense. Felix  
Wilson, deputy chief of the Cuban Interest Section, which serves as 
an unofficial embassy in Washington, was upset that Angelos met 
with the players while local Cuban officials were kept away from 
the group until after the team cleared customs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you imagine we cannot meet the Cuban delegation?'' he  
said. ``This is unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the excitement about fielding the first game between  
Cubans and a major league team in the United States, the event also 
raised the prospect of defections. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Joe Cubas, who signed pitcher Orlando ``El Duque''  
Hernandez to a contract with the New York Yankees after he 
defected, is in Baltimore for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Gus Dominguez, who represents players Rene Arocha and  
Ariel Prieto, said he will also be at tonight's game, but refused 
to say whether he has been in contact with any of the Cuban 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very personal decision and obviously they have to make  
those decisions themselves. We can't ask them, we can't pressure, 
but they know we are here to help,'' Dominguez said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban team is expected to be stronger than the squad that  
lost to the Orioles 3-2 in 11 innings in Havana on March 28. That 
team was missing some of Cuba's best players, who were 
participating in the island's national championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those making the trip who did not play in the first game  
are sluggers Orestes Kindelan, Antonio Pacheco and Gabriel Pierre. 
</P>
<P>
	The lineup announced this weekend by the Cuban government,  
however, does not include two stars many had expected to play: 
outfielder Victor Mesa and flashy shortstop German Mesa, the hero 
in Cuba's win over the United States during the 1991 Pan American 
Games held in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	The pitchers include three of Cuba's best -- Jose Ariel  
Contreras, Jose Ibar and Pedro Luis Lazo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles have struggled mightily since beating Cuba in March.  
The team is in last place, the players are being booed at Camden 
Yards and manager Ray Miller might not have his job by the end of 
the 12-game homestand Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	So the Orioles can be forgiven if they don't regard the game  
with great anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, you'd like the club to have a day off,'' Miller  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's much the same attitude the Orioles carried into the first  
exhibition. But shortly after the playing of both country's 
national anthems, their attitude changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot more comes into it than just you or your team. Even  
though we weren't really representing the U.S., we were in a way,'' 
outfielder B.J. Surhoff said Sunday. ``We were one team but we were 
representing a whole lot of people. They looked at it as their 
national team representing them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Down there I knew it would be really intense and they'd be  
into it. I'm kind of curious to see how it's all going to play out 
tomorrow night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller hoped to rest his starters after six innings of that  
game, but the close score and high intensity caused him to stick 
with most of his stars for the entire contest. He will use his 
regular lineup Monday with the exception of his starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Kamieniecki, who is on the disabled list, will start for  
Baltimore. The Orioles can only hope the Cubans don't counter with 
Jose Contreras, who allowed two hits over eight shutout innings and 
struck out 10 in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
	While many of the Orioles consider the game a distraction, they  
realize the prestige associated with representing their country. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of pride taken over in Cuba. We did everything  
we could to win that game and I'm sure it will be no different over 
here,'' backup catcher Lenny Webster said. ``We hope to enjoy it, 
but at the same time we're going to try and beat them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost 300 Cubans were to travel to Baltimore for the game,  
including reporters, retired players, members of youth groups and 
outstanding students. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the better-known athletes in the delegation were former  
boxer Teofilo Stevenson, high jump world record-holder Javier 
Sotomayor and Connie Marrero, who once played with the Washington 
Senators and threw out the ceremonial first pitch in the first 
game.

	Twenty-five school-age Cubans, accompanied by a group of

<HEADLINE>  Cuban Team Prepares for Orioles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- With the wrangling over visas and flight delays  
behind them, Cuba's national baseball team is ready to play ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban team arrived in Baltimore Sunday night after visa  
delays caused them to missed a scheduled workout and reception at 
Camden Yards. At one point during the weekend, the Cuban government 
threatened to cancel the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	But Orioles owner Peter Angelos, Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke  
and baseball commissioner Bud Selig greeted the team at 
Baltimore-Washington International Airport where they will play the 
Orioles tonight in an historic double-play combining sports and 
diplomacy on the diamond. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked on his way to the meeting who would win the game, Angelos  
said, ``Well, we'll see tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations about every aspect of the game were tense. Felix  
Wilson, deputy chief of the Cuban Interest Section, which serves as 
an unofficial embassy in Washington, was upset that Angelos met 
with the players while local Cuban officials were kept away from 
the group until after the team cleared customs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you imagine we cannot meet the Cuban delegation?'' he  
said. ``This is unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the excitement about fielding the first game between  
Cubans and a major league team in the United States, the event also 
raised the prospect of defections. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Joe Cubas, who signed pitcher Orlando ``El Duque''  
Hernandez to a contract with the New York Yankees after he 
defected, is in Baltimore for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Gus Dominguez, who represents players Rene Arocha and  
Ariel Prieto, said he will also be at tonight's game, but refused 
to say whether he has been in contact with any of the Cuban 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very personal decision and obviously they have to make  
those decisions themselves. We can't ask them, we can't pressure, 
but they know we are here to help,'' Dominguez said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban team is expected to be stronger than the squad that  
lost to the Orioles 3-2 in 11 innings in Havana on March 28. That 
team was missing some of Cuba's best players, who were 
participating in the island's national championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those making the trip who did not play in the first game  
are sluggers Orestes Kindelan, Antonio Pacheco and Gabriel Pierre. 
</P>
<P>
	The lineup announced this weekend by the Cuban government,  
however, does not include two stars many had expected to play: 
outfielder Victor Mesa and flashy shortstop German Mesa, the hero 
in Cuba's win over the United States during the 1991 Pan American 
Games held in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	The pitchers include three of Cuba's best -- Jose Ariel  
Contreras, Jose Ibar and Pedro Luis Lazo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles have struggled mightily since beating Cuba in March.  
The team is in last place, the players are being booed at Camden 
Yards and manager Ray Miller might not have his job by the end of 
the 12-game homestand Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	So the Orioles can be forgiven if they don't regard the game  
with great anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, you'd like the club to have a day off,'' Miller  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's much the same attitude the Orioles carried into the first  
exhibition. But shortly after the playing of both country's 
national anthems, their attitude changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot more comes into it than just you or your team. Even  
though we weren't really representing the U.S., we were in a way,'' 
outfielder B.J. Surhoff said Sunday. ``We were one team but we were 
representing a whole lot of people. They looked at it as their 
national team representing them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Down there I knew it would be really intense and they'd be  
into it. I'm kind of curious to see how it's all going to play out 
tomorrow night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller hoped to rest his starters after six innings of that  
game, but the close score and high intensity caused him to stick 
with most of his stars for the entire contest. He will use his 
regular lineup Monday with the exception of his starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Kamieniecki, who is on the disabled list, will start for  
Baltimore. The Orioles can only hope the Cubans don't counter with 
Jose Contreras, who allowed two hits over eight shutout innings and 
struck out 10 in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
	While many of the Orioles consider the game a distraction, they  
realize the prestige associated with representing their country. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of pride taken over in Cuba. We did everything  
we could to win that game and I'm sure it will be no different over 
here,'' backup catcher Lenny Webster said. ``We hope to enjoy it, 
but at the same time we're going to try and beat them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost 300 Cubans were to travel to Baltimore for the game,  
including reporters, retired players, members of youth groups and 
outstanding students. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the better-known athletes in the delegation were former  
boxer Teofilo Stevenson, high jump world record-holder Javier 
Sotomayor and Connie Marrero, who once played with the Washington 
Senators and threw out the ceremonial first pitch in the first 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five school-age Cubans, accompanied by a group of  
parents, are scheduled to play a game Tuesday against a group of 
Baltimore-area Little Leaguers -- just as a group of American 
youngsters played Cuban children during their visit to Havana last

<HEADLINE> Russia Pursues Kosovo Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Whoever emerges victorious from the Kosovo  
conflict, Russia is hoping that its efforts to find a diplomatic 
solution will also boost its attempt to reassert itself as a world 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	With both NATO and Yugoslavia looking to Russia for possible  
ways out of the conflict, Moscow is relishing the chance to once 
again play a major role on the international stage -- and dent the 
power and prestige of the West. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we succeed in preventing a humanitarian catastrophe in a  
place where the United States and NATO were unable to do so, it 
will colossally raise the authority and role of Russia,'' said 
Andrei Pionkovsky, a political analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is still seen as one of the best hopes for finding a  
political solution and Moscow is doing its best to broker a deal 
while pursuing its own goals, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Moscow's ideas on ending the war hinge on NATO making the  
initial concession by stopping its airstrikes, a position that 
partly reflects Russia's own fear of the alliance, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The optimism that followed the end of the Cold War has been  
replaced by fears in Moscow of what officials call the ``unipolar 
world'' -- a code word for U.S. global domination. With its economy 
and military in shambles, Russia feels increasingly vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the Cold War hangover, many Russians see NATO as a  
hostile force and believe the alliance is trying to conquer 
Yugoslavia. No matter how improbable it may seem in the West, 
Russians fear they could be bombed next. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's recent inclusion of three former Soviet satellites --  
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic -- is cited as a direct 
threat to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's happening now is a classic example of a unipolar world  
leading to aggression (by the Americans),'' said Vladimir Volkov, 
head of the Institute for Slavic Studies in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	While President Boris Yeltsin remains essentially pro-Western,  
he and other top officials are increasingly concerned about growing 
Western power at a time when Russia is getting weaker and weaker. 
There is a longing for the days when, before the Soviet collapse, 
Moscow was still a superpower. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Moscow is interested in alliances with other nations, such  
as China and India, to counter U.S. power. Prime Minister Yevgeny 
Primakov has tilted foreign policy increasingly against the West. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an effort ... to make the world unipolar'' and  
centering around the United States, he wrote in a 1996 article when 
he was foreign minister and starting to shift policy. ``The world 
should be based on the interests of many states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow would love to boost its global standing by finding a  
diplomatic solution for Kosovo and embarrassing the United States 
and NATO, whose military strategy would then be seen as a failure, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's loss of global power has made the need to find some  
kind of major international role all the more pressing. With so 
many problems at home, Yeltsin and his aides have almost welcomed 
the Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it retains a huge nuclear force, the military's  
conventional forces are in appalling condition. The air force has 
not purchased a new plane since 1992, warships rarely leave port 
because they don't have any food, and the army has only a handful 
of combat-ready units. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO's expansion to the East and its transformation into a  
dominant military-political force in Europe has created the danger 
of a new split of the continent,'' stated a military doctrine 
approved by Yeltsin in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	While Yeltsin sees NATO as a threat, he shows no desire to  
return to the days of Cold War confrontation. But the increasingly 
powerful communist and nationalist factions in parliament want an 
anti-Western policy and demand that Moscow back Yugoslavia with 
weapons and an alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin has toned down Moscow's initially strident anti-Western  
rhetoric in recent weeks, seeking to assure NATO that Russia can 
play a constructive role in finding a solution for Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Bausch &AMP; Lomb Responds to FDA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Bausch &AMP; Lomb has asked to meet with  
federal regulators over a warning letter regarding the advertising 
and promotion of its new soft contact lenses. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the company said Monday that it would stop  
distributing materials containing the claims questioned by the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter dated April 23, the FDA objected to certain claims  
Bausch &AMP; Lomb made in its advertising and promotional literature 
about its PureVision soft contacts, which it began marking 
nationwide last month, including: 
</P>
<P>
	-- that PureVision lenses provided ``a new level of ocular  
health.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- that the lenses are for ``continuous wear;'' they are approved  
and categorized for 7-day ``extended wear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- that ``continuous wear'' lenses are superior to ``extended  
wear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA's letter asked the company to stop making the claims and  
to submit information supporting its claims. The FDA did not 
challenge the safety of the lenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Bausch &AMP; Lomb has submitted a detailed response to the FDA's  
letter, said President and Chief Operating Officer Carl Sassano.

<HEADLINE>  Elway Makes Retirement Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- The quarterback known for being so cool  
in the final minutes of a game showed plenty of emotion this time. 
</P>
<P>
	John Elway had shown the natural poise that made him one of the  
NFL's greatest quarterbacks. Standing in a crowded conference room 
where his family, friends and fans waited for official word of his 
retirement, Elway joked about having his car towed the night before 
and prepared to reflect upon his remarkable 16 years with the 
Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when the enormity of it all blindsided him. Elway's husky  
voice started to crack and his eyes welled up with tears. Taking a 
final knee was not going to be so easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't look at it as retirement,'' the 38-year-old  
Elway said Sunday during an emotional news conference. ``I look at 
it as graduation. We graduate from high school. We graduate from 
college. I'm just graduating from football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With that, Elway paused for the second time in two minutes,  
choking back tears and trying to regain his composure. His wife 
Janet cried as she sat in the front row with their four children 
and John's father, Jack. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Janet walked up to the podium and handed her  
husband a box of tissues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It chokes you up,'' Jack Elway said. ``I've got a lot of  
friends. I like people, but that's my best friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway has been Denver's adopted son since the Broncos acquired  
him from the Baltimore Colts on May 2, 1983. It was fitting that he 
would walk away from football exactly 16 years later. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't have an over-40 league or an over-50 league,''  
Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe said. ``This is it. It's hard. To 
thank all the people who have been a part of his career and helped 
him get to this point, it's a very emotional time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe was one of several teammates who showed up on Elway Day.  
Running back Terrell Davis, defensive end Neil Smith and Elway's 
heir apparent, Bubby Brister, also listened intently as Elway 
explained that he could no longer endure the rigors of NFL life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time for me to move on,'' Elway said, breaking up again.  
``I can't do it physically anymore, and that's really hard for me 
to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his career, Elway's play often left opponents speechless.  
</P>
<P>
	He guided his team to more victories (148) than any other  
quarterback in NFL history. He threw for 51,475 yards and accounted 
for 54,882 total yards -- second only to Miami's Dan Marino. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway also rallied his team to 47 game-saving drives -- more than  
any other quarterback. He was selected to nine Pro Bowls and was 
named the NFL's MVP in 1987. He holds 55 Broncos' regular-season or 
postseason records. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I've ever been around a guy that has had  
expectations as high as John Elway,'' Denver coach Mike Shanahan 
said. ``Everybody has expected him to be the best on the football 
field. He's exceeded those expectations.' 
</P>
<P>
	For years, the only thing missing from Elway's resume was a  
Super Bowl title, and he took care of that by winning two straight. 
In his final game, he was voted Super Bowl MVP in a 34-19 win over 
Atlanta last January. 
</P>
<P>
	He becomes the only quarterback to retire after winning a Super  
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing harder than losing a Super Bowl when you work  
that hard to get there,'' Elway said. ``Heck, after 14 years I was 
wondering if we'd ever get it done. If we hadn't have won a Super 
Bowl, the chances are I'd be back next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Elway joins Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky as the  
third superstar to leave his sport since January. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's ceremony was anti-climatic because Elway's intentions  
had been known for more than a week. He delayed his announcement 
out of respect for the deadly shooting at nearby Columbine High 
School in Littleton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Elway family, Shanahan and Broncos owner Pat Bowlen wore  
blue-and-silver ribbons in memory the shooting victims and a moment 
of silence was held before the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The slayings helped Elway put his retirement decision in  
perspective, and he emphasized family while pondering his immediate 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been great for 16 years,'' Elway said. ``Since the  
kids have been born, the family life has focused around me and 
football. It's time that it focuses around them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to taking his turn in the family car pool, Elway  
will fill his days playing golf and exploring business 
opportunities -- possibly as a broadcaster or a minority owner with 
the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing, however, will be the same on Sunday afternoons.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll never be able fill the void of playing a football game,''  
Elway said. ``I'll never fill that. That will be the biggest part 
that I miss.''

<HEADLINE> Tough Guy John Elway Walks Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	He didn't look nearly as tough as we remembered him.  
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it was because John Elway was wearing a suit instead of a  
mud-stained jersey. Or because he was peering into television 
lights at a roomful of reporters, instead of into driving snow with 
a clock ticking down somewhere in the background and a toothless 
linebacker snarling back at him. 
</P>
<P>
	But maybe, just maybe, it was because Elway, after 16 years of  
absorbing beatings, isn't as tough as we remember him. That was his 
take on retirement, too. You just hope he knows there is no shame 
in that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't do it physically anymore,'' Elway said, ``and that's  
really hard for me to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's funny the things we learn about our athletes when the games  
are no longer in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
	At the January news conference in Chicago making his retirement  
official, Michael Jordan showed flashes of both the predator's calm 
and the contrary nature that made him the deadliest closer sport 
had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's words said he was gone. But he took great pains to let  
everybody know he could change out of his suit any time the mood 
struck him and still own any basketball court he stepped on. 
</P>
<P>
	Weeks later, Wayne Gretzky unlaced his skates for the last time  
and sat down on a podium in New York still wearing his uniform. The 
night before, he had called a half-dozen reporters who covered him 
for most of his career to say thanks. Someone asked at the news 
conference following the game whether he was finding it difficult 
to take his jersey off. 
</P>
<P>
	The question assumed Gretzky felt he hadn't played out the  
string. That wasn't it at all. It was just the child prodigy aiming 
to please his audience one final time. ``They told me,'' Gretzky 
explained through an embarrassed grin, ``that you guys were 
waiting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday in Denver, Elway fought harder to keep his composure  
than he ever had to in a football game. Every time he said he was 
ready to turn the corner, another memory would pounce and the tears 
would well up at the corner of his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Jordan, he couldn't come back without an unacceptable  
drop in the level of his play. But unlike Gretzky, he didn't seem 
to be at peace with his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never want to stop competing,'' he said. ``I just can't  
compete at this level anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the stories are true, the organization Elway rewarded with  
his loyalty and countless sacrifices was willing to pay him back in 
kind. The Broncos kept his spot open until he told them ``no'' more 
than once. They left the team as is. Owner Pat Bowlen didn't 
rearrange the furniture by making trades or mortgage the future to 
draft any of the handful of promising quarterbacks dispersed in 
this year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Shanahan even offered to let Elway skip training  
camp. And the first half of the season, if that was what it was 
going to take. Elway told them no again: ``I'm all in ... or I'm 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is out, finally, because of chronic problems with his left  
knee, which first surfaced his senior year at Granada Hills High in 
1978. He underwent surgery that year to repair torn cartilage and 
threw off that knee without an anterior cruciate ligament in the 
joint ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Elway's back and his hamstrings served notice that  
the rest of his 38-year-old body was joining the rebellion. At some 
point after he won his second Super Bowl in January, Elway was 
forced to admit it was better to remember the pain than endure it. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Sunday, Elway sat for an interview with ESPN's Roy  
Firestone, the master of the schmaltzy interview. The funny thing 
is that he was more composed than anybody had seen him all day. 
Asked how he wanted to be remembered, Elway didn't hesitate. He 
wanted to be remembered as a tough guy. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why he recalled a play from the third quarter of the 1998  
Super Bowl against Green Bay. The score was 17-17 and Terrell 
Davis, the running back who may have extended Elway's career by two 
seasons, was still woozy from a hit. Denver's offense had only 
managed one first down since the first quarter. And so, on 
third-and-6 from the Packers' 12-yard-line, Elway couldn't find 
anyone open and took off to his right. 
</P>
<P>
	When he got to the 6, three Packer defenders -- linebacker Brian  
Lewis, safeties LeRoy Butler and Mike Prior, a combined 650 pounds 
of stopping power -- had set up a roadblock. Elway set an example by 
trying to vault over the top. He didn't get to the end zone, but 
soon after the Broncos did. Not long after that, they won. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always hated that (insult) about making quarterbacks wear  
dresses. That was the play that made me a football player,'' he 
said, ``instead of a quarterback.''

<HEADLINE> Giants' Kent Hits for Cycle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Jeff Kent hit for the cycle in his first four  
at-bats against Pittsburgh on Monday night, becoming the first San 
Francisco Giants player to do so since Robby Thompson on April 22, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent is the 19th player in Giants' history to hit a single,  
double, triple and homer in the same game -- something Giants star 
Barry Bonds has never done. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent singled in the first inning before hitting a three-run  
homer in the third for his first RBIs since April 20. He tripled to 
center field in the fifth and doubled down the left-field line in 
the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	His first three at-bats came against Pirates starter Chris  
Peters and the double came off Marc Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent is only the second player to hit for the cycle since Three  
Rivers Stadium opened in July 1970. Joe Torre, now the New York 
Yankees' manager, hit for the cycle on June 27, 1973 for the St. 
Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The last player to hit for the cycle was Colorado's Neifi Perez,  
who did it last July 25 against St. Louis.

<HEADLINE> Tough Guy John Elway Walks Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	He didn't look nearly as tough as we remembered him.  
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it was because John Elway was wearing a suit instead of a  
mud-stained jersey. Or because he was peering into television 
lights at a roomful of reporters, instead of into driving snow with 
a clock ticking down somewhere in the background and a toothless 
linebacker snarling back at him. 
</P>
<P>
	But maybe, just maybe, it was because Elway, after 16 years of  
absorbing beatings, isn't as tough as we remember him. That was his 
take on retirement, too. You just hope he knows there is no shame 
in that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't do it physically anymore,'' Elway said, ``and that's  
really hard for me to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's funny the things we learn about our athletes when the games  
are no longer in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
	At the January news conference in Chicago making his retirement  
official, Michael Jordan showed flashes of both the predator's calm 
and the contrary nature that made him the deadliest closer sport 
had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's words said he was gone. But he took great pains to let  
everybody know he could change out of his suit any time the mood 
struck him and still own any basketball court he stepped on. 
</P>
<P>
	Weeks later, Wayne Gretzky unlaced his skates for the last time  
and sat down on a podium in New York still wearing his uniform. The 
night before, he had called a half-dozen reporters who covered him 
for most of his career to say thanks. Someone asked at the news 
conference following the game whether he was finding it difficult 
to take his jersey off. 
</P>
<P>
	The question assumed Gretzky felt he hadn't played out the  
string. That wasn't it at all. It was just the child prodigy aiming 
to please his audience one final time. ``They told me,'' Gretzky 
explained through an embarrassed grin, ``that you guys were

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybean Futures Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed early  
today on the Chicago Board of Trade as weather forecasts provided 
conflicting views on crop outlooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices found support from forecasts that a slow-moving weather  
pattern will bring showers and thunderstorms to Midwest growing 
areas over the next five days, delaying fieldwork. But corn and 
soybeans also were pressured by the view that mild temperatures and 
clear skies over the weekend had allowed farmers to make 
significant gains on planting. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were pressured by expectations that a tour of  
fields this week will show yields are well above average, which 
could lead to a bumper harvest at a time when export demand is 
relatively weak. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 2 1/4 cents to $2.65 3/4 a bushel; July  
corn fell 1/4 cent to $2.18 1/2 a bushel; July oats fell 1 1/4 cents to 
$1.17 a bushel; July soybeans rose 1/4 cent to $4.86 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and pork bellies futures advanced on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while feeder cattle and lean hogs were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .18 cent to 63 cents a pound; May feeder  
cattle was unchanged at 71.15 cents a pound; June lean hogs rose 
.28 cent to 59.35 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose .85 cent to 
59.85 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Team Advances at World Hockey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Brian Smolinski scored two goals to lead the  
United States to a 5-2 victory over winless Austria in the World 
Hockey Championships on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S., which improved to 2-0 in the tournament, advanced to  
the quarterfinal round where they will face the Czech Republic 
Wednesday in the Group C final game. 
</P>
<P>
	Team's USA's showing was a vast improvement from last year in  
Switzerland. The Americans missed the second round and eventually 
finished 12th, forcing them to enter a qualifying tournament in 
order to play in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Donato, Chris Tamer and Barry Richter scored the other goals  
for Team USA, which led Austria 4-0 after two periods. 
</P>
<P>
	Smolinski notched his first at 8:36 in the second period, when  
the Austrians were two men short. Donato made it 2-0 four minutes 
later with another power-play goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominic Lavoie and Matthias Trattnig scored for Austria.  
</P>
<P>
	``We felt that the competition would be much higher tonight,''  
Team USA coach Terry Murray said. ``We knew the Austrians wanted to 
bounce back from the game against the Czechs. But we got a couple 
of breaks. We scored a couple of power-play goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Rucinsky had a goal and four assists as the Czech  
Republic routed Japan 12-2 in the early Group C game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czechs, who have 10 players from the squad that won the 1998  
Olympic title but are without standout goaltender Dominik Hasek, 
have outscored the opposition 19-2 in their first two games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese took the lead just 1:23 into the game on Shin  
Yahata's goal, but trailed 4-2 after the first period. Then the 
Czechs scored seven goals in the second period to put the game 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	At Hamar, Slovakia kept alive its hopes of advancing to the  
quarterfinal round, posting a 7-4 victory over Italy in Group A. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other Group A game, Scott Thornton and Rob Blake each  
scored second-period goals to give Canada a 4-2 victory over 
Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada (2-0) is assured of advancing to the second round with  
the win. The Canadians are two points ahead of Norway and Slovakia 
with the top two teams from each of the four pools reaching the 
second round. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephane Quintal and Adam Graves also scored for Canada, which  
outshot Norway 42-31. Tommy Jacobsen and Sjur Nielsen scored 
Norway's goals.

<HEADLINE> Fatal Tornados Hit Midwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Tornadoes tore through Oklahoma and Kansas  
on Monday night, wiping out whole neighborhoods, killing at least 
10 people and injuring hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard it, the house started shaking and then the big  
rumble,'' said 74-year-old Katherine Burch, who hid in the bathroom 
of her southwest Oklahoma City home during the storm. ``Glass and 
everything flew in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police and emergency workers combed through the debris as  
darkness fell, searching for survivors. Crumpled cars littered two 
highways. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are getting so many injuries we are just tagging them and  
bringing them in,'' said Shara Findley, a spokeswoman for Hillcrest 
Health Center in Oklahoma City. ``We're getting everything you can 
think of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four people were killed in Midwest City, just southeast of  
Oklahoma City, according to Ben Frizzell, spokesman for the state 
Office of Emergency Management. Six were reported dead in Kansas, 
according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma, Midwest Regional Medical Center said it was  
treating at least 100 injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are coming in all the doors,'' said spokeswoman Jill  
Fraim. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado was one of several that formed over a five-hour  
period, beginning in southwest Oklahoma and stretching northeast. 
Damage was reported with some of the storms, which were part of a 
storm system over the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Severe Storms Lab in Norman said the tornado may  
have been a mile wide at times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is just the perfect type of atmosphere, very unstable and  
with wind shear, to create supercells,'' said National Weather 
Service forecaster David Andra. ``That is what this is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said forecasters expected the Oklahoma City twister to be  
categorized as at least F-4, the second-strongest tornado 
classification. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado was one of several that formed during the night,  
beginning in southwest Oklahoma and stretching northeast. There 
were at least three tornado warnings still in effect at 10:30 p.m., 
including one about 25 miles west of Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornadoes that ripped through south Wichita in Kansas on  
Monday night damaged dozens of homes and killed at least six 
people, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several mobile homes in south Wichita were blown into a lake and  
several other homes were damaged, said Fred Irvin of the Sedgwick 
County Emergency Preparedness Office. Irvin said multiple injuries 
were reported in both Wichita and Haysville. 
</P>
<P>
	The storms, which included high winds and heavy rains, hit the  
area about 8:30 p.m., Irvin said. Power lines and trees were 
reported down throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems as if more than one tornado touched down,'' Irvin  
said. ``They seemed to have hit in spotted areas in south and 
southwest Wichita.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Television reports in Oklahoma City showed hundreds of destroyed  
homes. Heavy damage was reported in Moore, south of Oklahoma City, 
where rows of houses were destroyed and scores of trucks 
overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas leaked from several locations Monday night. Power  
lines and piles of carpet were everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's gone,'' LeeAnn Richardson said as she looked toward where  
her home once stood. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Richardson said she and others were watching the weather on  
television when they decided to run into the storm cellar after 
clouds rolled in and rain poured down. Sixteen people and four pets 
were in there with her. 
</P>
<P>
	All survived without injury, but: ``We opened up and everything  
was gone,'' Ms. Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The twister was first reported about 5:50 p.m., but had not  
caused significant damage to homes until moving closer to Oklahoma 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Power lines popped and debris flew as the twister moved along  
from Chickasha, about 35 miles southwest of Oklahoma City, and cut 
through about eight miles of the heavily populated Oklahoma City 
metro area. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth Seymore sat on the tailgate of a pickup truck being used as  
a treatment center by a Red Cross volunteer. Injured people waited 
for ambulances. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just demolished,'' Ms. Seymore said of her home in  
Moore. ``Everything fell in on me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she hid in a closet and became trapped by the debris.  
</P>
<P>
	``They couldn't hardly get me out of there. I couldn't get  
anybody to find me. I kept hollering `Help!' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Loretta and Theresa Jones said they survived the storm by hiding  
in their closet in their home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We heard it coming and -- Whoa, Whoa, Jesus -- we called on his  
name and I felt his arms come around us and saved us from that 
tornado. And I thank God for that,'' Theresa Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Del City, a suburb of Oklahoma City, Mary Pat Faris wore a  
nightgown at the high school where she waited for word about 
missing family members. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard it. I heard the popping and then I heard the trees  
crunching and then my house was gone,'' said Ms. Faris, who 
weathered the storm in her bathtub.

<HEADLINE> Thompson Presidential Hopes Fizzle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Gov. Tommy Thompson all but said Monday he  
will not seek the Republican presidential nomination next year. 
</P>
<P>
	He said if his campaign is not over, ``it's on life support.''  
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, in his fourth term as governor, said earlier this year  
that the chances were 50-50 that he would seek the nomination. 
Since then, he has been gradually backing off that forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	``My quest never really started,'' he said. ``I haven't done  
anything to promote my candidacy, and I don't intend to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who made his name nationally with welfare and  
education reforms, called Texas Gov. George W. Bush the ``odds-on 
favorite'' to win the nomination and said there is little chance he 
could mount a reasonable challenge.

<HEADLINE> UN Panel Moves on Domain Name Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A United Nations organization has recommended  
steps to effectively ban speculating and pirating of Internet 
addresses, a practice known as cybersquatting. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendations by the World Intellectual Property  
Organization mark the first effort by an official governing body to 
set international rules for registering Internet domain names. 
</P>
<P>
	The WIPO also outlined provisions that could allow owners of  
internationally known trademarks the ability to claim first rights 
to Internet domains bearing their names, the New York Times 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was issued Friday to the Internet Corporation for  
Assigned Names and Numbers, an international nonprofit organization 
that will oversee the Internet's addressing system. ICANN is 
opening the business of registering domain names to competition and 
plans to expand the number of so-called top level domains beyond 
the current .com, .net and .org. 
</P>
<P>
	The WIPO report recommends the ICANN require anyone who  
registers a domain name to first sign a contract that would bar 
``abusive'' registration practices, defined as registering names 
that are identical or misleadingly similar to a trade or service 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract would also bar selling, renting or otherwise  
transferring the domain name to the owner of the trade or service 
mark, or to a competitor of the owner of the trade or service mark. 
</P>
<P>
	If cybersquatters were deemed to break the rules following a  
mandatory arbitration process, they could lose their domain names 
and be required to pay the bill for resolving the disputes, the 
Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Cases between companies or people with similar names or claims  
to the same domain would go either to voluntary arbitration or to 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed rules, ICANN would establish a list of  
protected ``famous or well-known marks'' that would not be 
available for registration to the average Internet user.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers Accused of Cuba Recruiting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers said Monday they are  
looking into allegations that they illegally signed two Cuban minor 
leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe quoted first baseman Juan Carlos Diaz and  
outfielder Josue Perez as saying the Dodgers held secret tryouts 
for them in their homeland, arranged their escapes and then ordered 
them to lie about it. 
</P>
<P>
	If the allegations are true, the Dodgers' actions would violate  
baseball rules prohibiting scouting in Cuba. They also may violate 
the U.S. trade embargo against the communist nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz, 23, and Perez, 21, have asked the commissioner's office to  
declare them free agents on grounds they were signed illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	``We learned on Friday that Mr. Gus Dominguez has written a  
letter to major league baseball requesting an inquiry into the 
circumstances under which the two players were signed in 1996 and 
1998,'' the Dodgers said. ``We have not received a copy of the 
letter and therefore cannot comment on its contents. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, we have commenced our review of the allegations  
published in the Boston Globe article this past weekend and are

	The commissioner's office has said teams breaking rules against  
scouting in Cuba face fines, suspensions or loss of amateur draft

	If the Dodgers did recruit players from Cuba, they could be in  
violation of the 36-year trade embargo prohibiting American

$250,000.

<HEADLINE> Newsmagazines a Dominant News Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The SWAT team hadn't left Columbine High School  
when executive producer Neal Shapiro scrapped that evening's 
``Dateline NBC,'' shelving an investigation into falsified reports 
at a crime lab. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, NBC went on the air with a minute-by-minute account of  
the school shooting, a report on how teens get guns and a Tom 
Brokaw interview with a psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro's quick change act -- and the deluge of newsmagazine  
reports on Columbine that followed -- illustrated the changed 
landscape of network TV news like no other story before it. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime-time magazines are covering breaking news more  
aggressively and, together with CNN, MSNBC and Fox News Channel, 
are where more Americans turn to get their news fix. 
</P>
<P>
	The nightly news shows, home of potentates Brokaw, Dan Rather  
and Peter Jennings, continue to see their dominant role -- as well 
as their viewership -- shrink. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone are the days when TV magazines were often a repository for  
canned stories with little relation to the day's headlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each and every one of these newsmagazines have set themselves  
up to be fire stations -- they've got the equipment, they're ready 
to respond, they're just waiting for the next disaster to happen,'' 
said Russ Ptacek, publisher of NewsTV Report, which monitors the 
content of news shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dateline NBC'' and ABC's ``20/20'' have a greater opportunity  
to track breaking stories because, just like the evening news, 
they're on five times a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people who work on `Dateline' rose up through the  
breaking news ranks,'' Shapiro said. ``We like it. We're interested 
in it. For some people who work on the magazines there's a culture 
not to respond to it. They're not used to it and scared by it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newsmagazines aren't interested in every breaking story.  
Important ones like the economy or Yugoslavia don't get much 
attention because they don't lend themselves to a heart-tugging, 
narrative style. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine was the perfect story, however. It had harrowing  
survivors' tales, the heart-rending stories of innocent victims and 
it touched on hot-button societal issues like guns and violence in 
the media. 
</P>
<P>
	By Ptacek's count, prime-time newsmagazines on ABC, CBS, NBC and  
Fox ran 43 separate stories on Columbine High in the 10 days 
following the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dateline NBC'' alone did stories on school pressures, ways to  
improve school security, the SWAT officers who were first on the 
scene, victims of previous school shootings, gun laws and the 
dreams that died with the Columbine victims. 
</P>
<P>
	With the proliferation of newsmagazines on the air these days,  
``you're getting the kind of competition for stories and the kind 
of coverage that you've never had before,'' said Jeff Fager, 
executive producer of CBS's ``60 Minutes II.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers clearly responded: Six of the 12 top-rated prime-time  
shows in the week after the shooting were newsmagazines that 
reported on Columbine. Only the Monica Lewinsky interview scored 
higher ratings for ``20/20'' this year than its edition the day 
after Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	Such success virtually guarantees the trend will continue.  
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the expectation that the magazines should be a vehicle  
for following big stories is such that CBS was criticized -- and 
admitted its mistake -- for not devoting a prime-time hour to 
Columbine the day after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Nightly news ratings were up in the wake of the massacre, too.  
This season, 48 percent of television sets in use at the time are 
tuned to the NBC, ABC or CBS half-hour news summaries when they're 
on -- no small accomplishment at a time of dwindling viewership. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet over the long haul, the shows are leaking viewers. In 1980,  
the three shows had an audience share of 72. The shows have an 
average of 23.6 million households watching this year, down from 
26.8 million 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say fewer Americans are home in time to watch the  
evening news than in the days Walter Cronkite summed up the world. 
TV viewers also have the option of getting their news elsewhere 
whenever they want, or simply watching something else. 
</P>
<P>
	That's driven the efforts to deliver the news in other ways.  
CBS's Rather has lobbied to have a later evening news broadcast, 
and ABC News President David Westin has talked of incorporating a 
regular news update into the newsmagazines. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC touts its all-day machine of outlets: ``Today'' in the  
morning, MSNBC all the time, and the nightly news at ``Dateline'' 
in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro said he speaks frequently with David Doss, his  
counterpart on the ``NBC Nightly News,'' and the two horse-trade 
for stories. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsmagazine take on stories, however, is usually far  
different than on a straight broadcast: human dramas are played up 
and storytelling techniques used. Since they are in prime-time, 
they have greater entertainment value. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have more time to do it -- more time to put the stories  
together and more time to devote to the topic,'' Shapiro said.

<HEADLINE> US Scientists Study Malaysia Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- In a quarantined laboratory, U.S. scientists  
outfitted in plastic biohazard spacesuits and breathing through air 
tubes are probing a killer that has struck on the other side of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	The mysterious microscopic enemy has killed more than 100 people  
in Malaysia in seven months, and scientists are baffled about its 
origin and mode of transmission. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every couple of years something like this comes along,'' says  
Dr. C.J. Peters, head of the special pathogens branch at the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ``We don't know how 
this stuff spreads, how far it's going to go. We really don't know 
what's at the end of the tunnel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rare form of viral encephalitis, which spread from pigs to  
humans, first surfaced last year near the northern city of Ipoh. It 
has since sickened more than 250 Malaysians, mostly pig farmers. 
Many of their herds also fell ill, and some pigs died. A similar 
illness afflicted 11 slaughterhouse workers in Singapore, one 
fatally, who butchered pigs imported from Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldiers have killed almost 1 million pigs and some stray dogs  
to try to curb the virus. On Monday, pet owners in Malaysia's 
high-risk areas were told to get their animals checked immediately 
after new tests confirmed house pets could transmit the disease to 
humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical authorities named the new virus Nipah, after the village  
where it was first isolated. 
</P>
<P>
	As remote as the Nipah virus may seem, controlling and  
understanding it are a concern of epidemiologists around the globe 
because of fear it could spread quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``In today's world, it's not unrealistic to think of the  
possibility that someone could get on a plane and land in San 
Francisco with it,'' says Dr. Duane Gubler, director of the CDC's 
Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases at Fort Collins, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	For months, Malaysian health officials were certain the killer  
was Japanese encephalitis, a mosquito-borne virus common to the 
area. The two pathogens cause similar symptoms -- high fever, aches, 
eventual coma and, often, death. 
</P>
<P>
	But most people in the region had been vaccinated for JE as  
children. Additionally, it doesn't usually kill adult pigs. 
</P>
<P>
	The government declared a state of emergency in three Malaysian  
states and launched fogging and vaccination campaigns, to no avail. 
The Nipah virus raged on. And despite no proof that Nipah can 
infect people who eat or handle pork, the epidemic has wreaked 
havoc on Malaysia's nearly $400 million pork industry. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 7, baffled Malaysian researchers sought help from their  
counterparts at Gubler's CDC office in Fort Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was quite fortuitous that when I sent him an offer to help,  
he was in the process of sending a note to the CDC asking for 
help,'' Gubler says. 
</P>
<P>
	The following Saturday morning, a Malaysian researcher arrived  
in Fort Collins with slides of cells infected with the mysterious 
virus. The researchers worked through the weekend, screening the 
sample against dozens of known viruses. All were negative. 
</P>
<P>
	When they tried to isolate Nipah, it formed giant cells with  
multiple nuclei -- epidemiological patterns not at all like JE. By 
Sunday, a red flag had gone up: The Nipah virus fit in none of the 
three virus families studied at Fort Collins and was actually a 
previously unknown paramyxovirus. This family includes measles and 
mumps, but one of the last new paramyxoviruses discovered was the 
especially virulent Hendra virus. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was when we packed it up and sent it to Atlanta,'' Gubler  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	The samples were taken to the CDC's Level 4 biocontainment lab,  
which houses deadly microbes that have no vaccine or cure, such as 
the Ebola virus that killed 245 Zaireans in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC's medical detectives quickly identified the culprit as  
related to but far deadlier than the very rare Hendra virus. Hendra 
was first detected in 1994 in Australia, where it killed 15 
racehorses and two trainers. 
</P>
<P>
	But they know little else.  
</P>
<P>
	``That indicated right away that this was something big. We knew  
it was a new virus and we knew it was related to a virus that kills 
people,'' Peters says. ``We're not talking about an outbreak of 
colds that's going to run through and everybody's going to get over 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In late March, a team of eight CDC epidemiologists and two  
Australian researchers packed questionnaires, protective gear, 
needles and vials and headed for Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing gloves, rubber coveralls, boots and battery-operated  
respirators, the disease detectives began combing through animal 
feed and trapping rodents. They have spent weeks tramping through 
pig pens and farming villages in the worst-hit areas. They are 
interviewing victims and their families and friends: What did they 
eat? What did they drink? Where did they go? What did they do? It's 
all to form a hypothesis about how the virus is transmitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Blood samples have been taken from birds, turkeys, goats,  
horses, cattle and wild animals. With the Hendra virus, the 
culprits were fruit bats. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no idea what the natural reservoir of this virus is,''  
Gubler says. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC's next step is to try to develop a genetically  
engineered vaccine using mice, rats and guinea pigs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Peters hopes the vaccine isn't needed. Killing hundreds of  
thousands of pigs seems to have helped -- as of last week, the 
number of new cases appeared to be declining, and the disease may 
ease naturally. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're lucky,'' Peters says, ``in two or three months the  
outbreak will come under control and we'll never have to make a 
vaccine.''

<HEADLINE> Nomo Makes Minor League Appearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- Hideo Nomo earned his way back to the  
major leagues by pitching seven scoreless innings Sunday for 
Double-A Huntsville. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo was signed to a minor league contract Thursday by the  
Milwaukee Brewers. He will be called up Friday, given a $250,000, 
one-year contract, and start that night at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a very good atmosphere for me today,'' Nomo said  
through a translator. ``I was very comfortable throwing the ball. I 
am looking forward to going back to the major leagues, and I hope 
to do well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo allowed five hits, one walk and struck out seven in  
Huntsville's 6-0 win against Greenville. 
</P>
<P>
	``He mixed his pitches up very well this afternoon,'' said Mike  
Caldwell, roving pitching instructor for the Brewers. ``His 
velocity was as high when he came out as when he started. He 
certainly knows how to pitch. If he can put the ball where he wants 
it he can be effective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo even went 2-for-3 at the plate with two RBIs.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was good to hit well today but honestly it was  
accidental,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo is trying to resurrect a career that began with him winning  
the National League Rookie of the Year award with the Los Angeles 
Dodgers in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He was traded to the New York Mets last season and released this  
spring. He then signed a minor league deal with the Chicago Cubs 
and was released after three straight bad outings at Triple-A Iowa.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Leader Says Game Not Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cuba has no hidden political agenda connected  
to Monday night's game between the Baltimore Orioles and Cuba's 
national team, the communist country's minister of sports said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a sports exchange, a peaceful exchange between our two  
peoples,'' Humberto Rodriguez Gonzalez said at a news conference 
before the second matchup Monday night between the Orioles and 
Cuban players. ``It is a friendly gesture ... and a peaceful 
gesture. We will be watching two marvelous teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez said people protesting the game are misguided. ``I  
believe sincerely they are wrong,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He brushed off questions about opposition to the game by Cuban  
exiles, saying, ``We are not concerned about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Cuban team in Baltimore is much better than the one  
that lost to the Orioles 3-2 in Havana on March 28. He reiterated 
that several top players who didn't play in the first game because 
they were involved in national playoffs will be in the lineup this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	But German Mesa, the hero in Cuba's win over the United States  
during the 1991 Pan American Games held in Havana, will not be. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if Mesa were under restrictions, Gonzalez said he  
trained hard but didn't make the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The big salaries made by some major league players in the United  
States is not an incentive for Cuban players to defect because they 
play for love of the sport and their country, Gonzalez said. Those 
players who have defected are looked down upon by their countrymen, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not a source of inspiration for our people,''  
Gonzalez said. ``There is no money in the world able to move 
feelings when you are true to them.''

<HEADLINE> Creditors' Bankruptcy Rights Helped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today strengthened  
creditors' rights against those of shareholders in some bankruptcy 
cases in which an insolvent firm is being reorganized. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled in a Chicago case that unsecured creditors can  
bar shareholders from putting up new money to retain ownership of a 
reorganized firm, if no one else was given a chance to come up with 
an alternative plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's 8-1 ruling reverses a lower court decision that let a  
Chicago real estate partnership's shareholders provide new capital 
to keep their ownership over the objections of unsecured creditors. 
Other federal courts had refused to allow similar arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice David H. Souter wrote for the court that the plan ``is  
doomed'' because it let the shareholders retain ownership ``without 
extending an opportunity to anyone else either to compete for that 
equity or to propose a competing reorganization plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case involved the 203 North LaSalle Street Partnership, a  
real estate limited partnership whose main asset is 15 floors of a 
downtown Chicago office building. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership owes Bank of America National Trust and Savings  
Association, a subsidiary of BankAmerica Corp., more than $93 
million secured by a mortgage on the property that was due in 
January 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	When the partnership could not pay off the loan, the bank began  
foreclosure proceedings. The partnership then filed for 
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law, 
which halted the foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
	A bankruptcy judge valued the office building property at $54.5  
million, leaving the bank with an unsecured claim of $38.5 million. 
The judge estimated the bank would get only 16 percent of the 
unsecured amount. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankruptcy judge approved a reorganization plan that let the  
shareholders retain their ownership by providing new capital, 
rejecting objections by the bank, which wanted to foreclose on the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judge's  
decision, saying such plans can be approved when shareholders 
provide ``new value'' to a reorganized company. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Supreme Court did not say whether bankruptcy law  
allows such a ``new value'' rule. But the justices said the plan in 
today's case could not be approved because the investment 
opportunity was provided exclusively to the old shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given that the opportunity is property of some value, the  
question arises why old equity (the shareholders) alone should 
obtain it, not to mention at no cost whatever,'' Souter wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	His opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and  
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia joined the result in  
a separate opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissenting was Justice John Paul Stevens, who said he believed  
the appeals court correctly approved the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Bank of America National Trust and Savings  
Association vs. 203 North LaSalle Street Partnership, 97-1418.

<HEADLINE> Prostate Blood Test in Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A new blood test under development could help  
doctors better assess a man's risk of prostate cancer without the 
use of a biopsy, according to a study released today. 
</P>
<P>
	The test, used with one that is already in wide use, could catch  
the cancer earlier. As with many cancers, earlier detection 
improves the likelihood of survival. 
</P>
<P>
	Men 40 and older and those at a high risk have received annual  
Tandem free prostate-specific antigen tests since the early 1990s. 
The test shows when protein levels rise in the bloodstream, an 
indicator of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The new test, known as hK2, measures the human kallikrein 2  
enzyme. Both hK2 and the older test were developed by Hybritech 
Inc. of San Diego, which funded the study. 
</P>
<P>
	A study of 937 men showed that the two tests used together  
identified 91 percent of the men who were cancer-free and 40 
percent of those who had prostate cancer and needed further 
evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of tests can help catch 95 percent of prostate  
cancers and reduce needless biopsies in the group by 20 percent, 
the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a need to catch cancer at a more curable level,''  
said lead researcher Dr. William J. Catalona, a professor of 
urologic surgery at Washington University School of Medicine in St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Catalona presented his findings to a meeting of the American  
Urological Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Prostate trouble is a common problem for aging men. The  
walnut-sized gland, which is involved in semen production, 
frequently becomes enlarged in older men and is susceptible to 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Every year, an estimated 184,500 American men develop prostate  
cancer and more than 41,000 die from it, according to the American 
Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Used in combination, the two tests could help patients because  
doctors are cautious about ordering biopsies -- which often cost 
$1,200 or more -- on the roughly 17 percent of men who have 
intermediate levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the 
bloodstream, Catalona said. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert not involved in the study said the PSA ranges are not  
an absolute guide to who needs biopsies but are instead a 
weathervane. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John Whitesel, chief of urology at the University of  
Colorado, said an additional test ``certainly would help us 
diagnose sooner. The earlier we can diagnose, the better chance we 
have to cure the disease.''

<HEADLINE> White House Welcoming Japanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- He threw out the ceremonial first pitch at a  
Chicago Cubs game and played tourist on his way to Washington, but 
visiting Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi went the cultural 
route Monday with a personal tutorial on the history of the Bonsai 
and a dinner entertained by piano virtuoso Van Cliburn. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton feted the Japanese leader in a pavilion on the  
White House South Lawn replete with its own garden entrance. 
Shrubbery lined the light jade-colored walls of the pavilion, with 
some greenery even delicately interwoven in the chandeliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi sat at a table with Ethel Kennedy, a touching reminder of  
his trip to the United States as a graduate student in 1963 when he 
was granted a meeting with her husband, then-Attorney General 
Robert F. Kennedy. Obuchi described the meeting as having a major 
impact on his decision to launch a political career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only wonder at the inexplicable manner in which destiny  
plays out,'' Obuchi said through a translator. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in his official toast, said the graciousness Obuchi saw  
in Kennedy had indeed made a lasting impression. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see it today reflected in your own decency and  
generosity,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	During that visit to Washington 36 years ago, Obuchi stayed at  
the YMCA, which charged $1.50 a night. But things have changed, he 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, this time no charge,'' the Japanese leader quipped in  
English. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Ambassador to Japan Tom Foley said that when Obuchi took  
office it was clear he was a ``nice guy,'' yet some questioned 
whether that was what Japan really needed. But the prime minister 
soon proved his political mettle. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doing very well,'' Foley said. ``He's enjoying the esteem  
of his own citizens as well as of Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As evidence of that, about 340 guests turned out for the event,  
enjoying cocktails in the East Room before packing into red 
trolleys that cruised down a back driveway of the White House to 
the dinner pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
	First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton greeted guests in a black and  
white sash presented to her by Mrs. Chizuko Obuchi over a 
floor-length black sequin Donna Karan gown. 
</P>
<P>
	The two leaders received a tutorial in horticulture earlier in  
the day from Saburo Kato, chairman of the Nippon Bonsai 
Association. In the White House Blue Room, adorned for the occasion 
by Bonsai trees brought in from the National Arboretum, Clinton 
presented Obuchi with a 300-year-old tree as a gift. The pair 
listened attentively as Kato then explained the way the roots grow 
and the trees curve. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were absolutely fascinated by this,'' said White House  
Social Secretary Capricia Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi played high-level tourist over the weekend, throwing the  
first pitch to Sammy Sosa at a Cubs game and ringing the bell to 
close floor trade at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Obuchi was 
just as excited to hear that Cliburn would perform for the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	``The members of the delegation were ecstatic,'' Marshall said.  
``Prime Minister Obuchi loves the classics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cliburn, who has performed for every president since Harry  
Truman, made his own selections for the evening, which included 
pieces by Chopin, Brahms and Rachmaninoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Park Service, along with the White House staff,  
assisted in creating the garden and floral arrangements around the 
pavilion. Azaleas and lugustrums bedecked the sides of the tent, 
while fresh lilacs and white peonies topped the tables. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar pavilion style set-up welcomed Emperor Akihito of  
Japan when he visited the Clintons nearly five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Even White House dessert chef Ronald Messnier got in on the  
garden theme, preparing a plate set with a Bonsai tree of green and 
brown chocolate sitting along a bridge over a river of green kiwi 
sauce.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Revises Economic Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- The future of Singapore's economy depends on a  
recovery in the global electronics sector and the strength of 
industrial and Asian countries, the Monetary Authority of Singapore 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's central bank noted Singapore's forecast for  
economic growth in 1999 has been revised upward to a range of zero 
to 2 percent. The new forecast -- up from an earlier forecast of 
between 1 percent contraction and 1 percent growth -- was announced 
over the weekend by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. 
</P>
<P>
	``The actual outcome hinges critically on a recovery in the  
global electronics industry and strength of the industrial and 
Asian economies, which of late have shown significant signs of 
improvement,'' the Monetary Authority said in the first issue of 
its on-line Quarterly Bulletin. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulletin also said that ``inflation is expected to remain  
negative in the first half of the year and return to positive 
territory in the second half in line with an expected recovery in 
the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bank noted that manufacturing output was dragged down in  
1998 because of a long slump in the global electronics sector. It 
said that in the first two months of 1999, output rose 6.1 percent 
and electronics output was up 14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nevertheless, prospects for the (electronics) industry remain  
uncertain,'' it said. ``While inventory levels have declined 
steadily since May last year, the trends in shipments are less 
clear.''

<HEADLINE>  Racing Track Offering Counseling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- The track where three fans were killed by  
flying debris is offering counseling for other spectators, and has 
set up a trust fund for the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight other fans were injured Saturday night when parts from a  
three-car wreck at more than 200 mph during an Indy Racing League 
event flew over a safety fence and into the grandstand. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe's Motor Speedway officials also said Monday that they  
probably would increase the height of the safety fences surrounding 
the 1 1/2-mile superspeedway in response to the crash during the 
VisionAire 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to Saturday night, no spectators had died at the track,  
which opened in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on everything that's happened in our 40-year history  
this is certainly an isolated event, but we need to keep it that 
way,'' track spokesman Jerry Gappens said Monday. ``The fans need 
reassurance that we're going to keep working to make it a safe 
place for them, and we're very committed to doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The speedway scheduled three counseling sessions Tuesday at a  
clinic in nearby Charlotte to help spectators cope with their 
grief. The track is paying for the sessions, and depending on the 
response, officials said more sessions could be arranged. 
</P>
<P>
	The speedway also established a trust fund designed to help the  
families of those who were injured and killed. The fund will be 
administered by First Union, which will appoint a board of trustees 
to distribute the funds as the members see fit. The track will not 
be represented on the board. 
</P>
<P>
	Early indications were that the trust fund will be a popular way  
for people to express their support for the victims. The speedway 
canceled the race shortly after the crash and offered to refund the 
total cost of the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	But within minutes spectators began leaving telephone messages  
at the track office offering to target their refunds for a trust 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
	When the speedway reopened for business Monday morning, it was  
more of the same. By the time the business day ended, track 
officials said about 80 percent of the people who called about 
refunds wanted to know how they could earmark that money for the 
victims and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	The track also got calls from people who didn't attend the race  
but wanted to make donations to a trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets for the race, which drew almost 50,000, cost $15, $30  
and $45. 
</P>
<P>
	The event was barely one-fourth complete when a three-car crash  
at speeds near 215 mph launched a wheel and suspension parts over a 
fence and into a crowded grandstand near the exit of the fourth 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
	The catch fence where the accident occurred rises 15 feet above  
the racing surface, a height that is standard for most 
superspeedways. The fence is topped off with a 35-inch overhang 
that leans out over the track at a 45-degree angle. 
</P>
<P>
	The track, until this season known as Charlotte Motor Speedway,  
spent more than $1 million on various safety improvements in the 
months leading up to its first IRL race in 1997. Those upgrades 
included raising the height of the fence. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gappens said Monday that the speedway's engineers and  
architects were studying the possibility of raising the fence again 
as well as extending the length of the overhang. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has evolved to where it is today, and I would think it  
would continue to evolve,'' he said. ``That's one of the things 
we're looking into right now. We don't know for sure what we're 
going to do, but that's one thing we're considering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Track president H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler and a speedway chaplain  
drove to Connelly Springs on Monday morning to visit the families 
of Randy Pyatte and Jeff Patton, two of the spectators who were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of Dexter B. Mobley, the other spectator who died,  
arrived from Georgia on Monday and came to the speedway. Doug 
Stafford, the track's senior vice president, met with the family 
members and, at their request, took them out to see where Mobley 
was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, a 9-year-old girl remained in critical condition at  
Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte with brain and lung bruises. 
Hailey McGee of Conover is the only one of the eight injured people 
still in a hospital.

<HEADLINE> Some 'Reality Shows' May Be Staged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Fox network promised today to clearly  
explain to viewers when its ``reality'' shows don't depict reality, 
following a report that alleged a chase shown on ``World's Wildest 
Police Videos'' was staged. 
</P>
<P>
	The syndicated newsmagazine ``Inside Edition'' said a segment  
that aired March 25 allegedly showed a felon using pepper spray on 
an officer and taking off on a high-speed car chase before being 
apprehended by police with guns and a dog. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident happened in Lowndes County, Georgia. The show's  
host, former Oregon Sheriff John Bunnell, told viewers that ``our 
cameras were there when the call came in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But ``Inside Edition'' quotes Sgt. J.D. Yeager of the Lowndes  
County Sheriff's Department as saying the tape was a staged 
re-creation of a chase that took place nearly 10 years earlier. The 
woman portraying the felon was actually a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Another segment depicting a suspect beaching a boat and then  
being tackled by pursuing police officers was actually a police 
training video, the newsmagazine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Stajonovich, who produces the ``World's Wildest Police  
Videos'' series of specials for Fox, did not immediately return a 
telephone call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox said that in the future, any video that does not reflect  
reality would be clearly identified as such by a text message 
appearing on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Network policy remains to clearly identify all re-creations,  
re-enactments and training video within any reality program,'' Fox 
said in a statement. ``Producers must adhere to this policy, as Fox 
does not intend to mislead its viewers or misrepresent footage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Fox spokeswoman could not say whether that policy had been  
followed during ``World's Wildest Police Videos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox has been a leader in developing reality shows, which have  
attracted big ratings as well as controversy. Other networks have 
tried their own versions. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsmagazine also alleges that a video of a rampaging  
elephant shown in a 1997 special, ``When Animals Attack,'' actually 
depicted an actor and trained elephant recreating an earlier 
attack. Viewers were not told it was a recreation, the show said. 
</P>
<P>
	Producers of Fox's ``Busted on the Job'' series routinely make  
up stories to go along with some of its tapes, such as one that 
shows a woman urinating on her boss's furniture, the show said. 
</P>
<P>
	Erick Nelson, who produces ``Busted on the Job,'' said he makes  
a comedy show and occasionally changes details to protect people 
caught in embarrassing acts. 
</P>
<P>
	``My feeling is it's the Christian thing to do to change some  
details so people who see it can't say, `was that you I saw on 
television?''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his show never airs doctored videos.

<HEADLINE> Heston: Gun Laws Not the Answer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government should do a better job  
of sending gun violators to prison rather than coming up with new 
gun control laws, National Rifle Association President Charlton 
Heston says. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics who link the school shootings in Littleton, Colo., to  
the NRA's success in stopping new gun restrictions should look 
instead to the government's failure to enforce the 2,000 gun laws 
already on the books, Heston said Sunday on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder, appearing on the same show,  
said laws enacted during the Clinton administration have kept 
firearms out of the hands of criminals and contributed to a drop in 
gun violence without imposing on the rights of law-abiding 
citizens. ``How has the universe changed for people who have a 
legitimate right to have a gun?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	A scaled-back NRA convention in Denver on Saturday drew 8,000  
protesters, many saying the NRA's hardline opposition to gun 
control was one reason the two youths who killed 12 of their fellow 
students and a teacher in suburban Littleton, Colo., had such easy 
access to powerful firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is not the availability of arms,'' but the  
government's poor record in prosecuting both juveniles and adults 
for gun violations, Heston said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the NRA did support trigger locks, didn't oppose bans on  
some ammunition clips and favored instant criminal checks on buyers 
at gun shows, as long as files were not kept on American citizens. 
``That smells of tyranny,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the veteran film actor opposed an administration proposal to  
extend the waiting period for background checks under the Brady law 
to prevent felons from buying handguns. ``I'm not interested in 
seeing them denied purchase,'' he said. ``I'm interested in seeing 
them imprisoned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heston said that if invited, he would attend a proposed White  
House summit on juvenile violence. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, seizing the initiative as the nation recoiled  
from the Colorado shootings, last week introduced a broad 
gun-control measure that would raise the legal age for handgun 
possession from 18 to 21, hold negligent parents liable, halt 
imports of all high-capacity ammunition clips and limit handgun 
purchases to one a month. 
</P>
<P>
	His bill also would require child-safety locks on all guns sold,  
impose background checks on buyers for all gun-show sales and 
require a three-day waiting period for all handgun purchases. 
Today, most checks to verify a would-be purchaser doesn't have a 
criminal record are done instantaneously. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the  
Republican-led Congress was willing to look at steps to tighten 
existing laws, but he agreed with Heston that the real need was for 
more aggressive prosecution. The two suspects in Littleton broke at 
least 17 laws in their assault, Lott said on CNN's ``Late 
Edition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, interviewed on  
``Fox News Sunday,'' said that since Clinton took office gun 
violation prosecutions have been cut in half. ``This administration 
hasn't been very serious about guns,'' the Utah Republican said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a leading advocate of gun control,  
praised the Clinton package but acknowledged that enacting even 
modest new laws will be tough. One survey found that only 4 percent 
of Americans think new gun control laws aren't needed, he said, and 
``I think that 4 percent is all in the Congress.''

        Baseball payrolls by average annual value as of opening day,  
compiled by the commissioner's office for luxury tax purposes, as obtained 
by The Associated Press: 
</P>
<P>
        Payrolls are for 40-man rosters and include averages of multiyear

<HEADLINE> Gumbel Set To Return to Morning TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bryant Gumbel's farewell to morning television  
was apparently short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years after leaving as co-host of NBC's ``Today'' show,  
Gumbel is expected to take the helm of CBS's last-place morning 
show, ``This Morning.'' The network plans to announce the decision 
at a news conference later today, network executives speaking on 
condition of anonymity said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS is not likely to reveal a co-host for Gumbel. Network  
executives have reportedly considered ABC's Elizabeth Vargas and 
Deborah Norville, who was briefly Gumbel's partner on ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gumbel has largely been off the air since the cancellation of  
his newsmagazine, ``Public Eye with Bryant Gumbel,'' last year. He 
left ``Today'' after 15 years in 1997 to sign a lucrative contract 
with CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	His agent, Ed Hookstratten, did not immediately return a call  
for comment on Monday. CBS would not discuss its news conference 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Morning'' has run a consistent third in the ratings  
behind ``Today'' and ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' The ABC show 
raised the stakes in the morning news competition earlier this year 
when it brought Charles Gibson and Diane Sawyer in as temporary 
hosts. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS also intends to unveil plans today to build a new storefront  
studio for ``This Morning.'' It will be similar to the Rockefeller 
Center studio used by ``Today,'' the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratings for ``Today'' blossomed after it began televising from a  
studio with a window to the street in Rockefeller Center. ABC 
subsequently began building a Times Square studio, and CBS hopes to 
use space on Fifth Avenue near Central Park. It is expected to be 
ready in late fall or early winter.

<HEADLINE> Crunch 20, Ambush 9 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Hector Marinaro scored five goals, good for 11  
points, leading the Cleveland Crunch past the St. Louis Ambush 20-9 
Monday in Game 1 of the best-of-5 National Professional Soccer 
League finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Marinaro opened the scoring with a 3-point goal 3:02 into the  
game and had nine first-half points as Cleveland took a 16-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambush player-coach Daryl Doran replaced veteran goalkeeper  
Jamie Swanner with rookie Nando Hernandez 4:05 into the second 
half. St. Louis tightened its defense, scoing the only goal of the 
third quarter, a 2-pointer by Ian Carter at 11:54. 
</P>
<P>
	Marinaro, the NPSL's career scoring leader and league scoring  
champion six of the last seven seasons, then got his fifth goal of 
the game 13 seconds into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning goalkeeper Otto Orf concluded the scoring by throwing  
the ball into the St. Louis goal for a 2-point goal with 1:28 to 
play after the Ambush turned to a sixth attacker. 
</P>
<P>
	Orf made 18 saves and the Crunch defense 30 blocked shots.  
Cleveland, which had the best regular-season record at 26-14, 
ousted Montreal and Philadelphia in the American Conference 
playoffs to gain the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Swanner had 13 saves and Hernandez four for the Ambush, which  
was led offensively by Carter and Kevin Hundelt with three points 
apiece. St. Louis, 21-19 in the regular season, advanced past 
Buffalo and Edmonton in the National Conference playoffs.

<HEADLINE> Congress Looking at Youth Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pressured to help stop kids from killing,  
Congress is opening hearings on the causes of a ``crisis among our 
young'' amid a thorny political question of what government should 
do to prevent massacres like the one in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tragedy at Columbine High and the ongoing carnage on our  
inner city streets presents us with a complicated cultural moment 
and an important opportunity to thoroughly examine the root causes 
of a crisis among our young,'' House Judiciary Committee Chairman 
Henry Hyde told reporters on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde's committee will hold a wide-ranging hearing beginning May  
13 focusing on urban and suburban violence by kids. 
</P>
<P>
	The witness list was still in its infancy late Monday, but  
several people close to the committee said it could include 
individuals involved in the Columbine tragedy, survivors of other 
school shootings, entertainment industry executives and interest 
groups on both sides of the gun control debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde, who has supported gun control legislation, is committed to  
keeping the hearing from spiraling into a partisan shoot-out over 
gun policy, according to two officials close to the panel who asked 
not to be named. They acknowledged, however, that the discussion 
would have to touch on such issues as new firearms technology and 
whether access to guns should be further restricted. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Hyde's support of gun control legislation makes him no  
friend of the National Rifle Association, these officials would not 
rule out testimony by the group's president, actor Charlton Heston, 
or any other of the group's officials. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, the Commerce Committee on Tuesday opens a hearing  
on the marketing of violent material to children. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate hearing was scheduled before the April 20 Columbine  
massacre.

<HEADLINE> Seven Die in Church Bus Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARTESIA, N.M. (AP) -- Six girls traveling home after a weekend  
retreat with fellow churchgoers were killed when a camper broke 
away from a pickup truck and struck the bus in which they were 
riding. 
</P>
<P>
	A seventh person driving a pickup truck behind the church bus  
also was killed in Sunday's accident on mountainous terrain on U.S. 
Route 82 in Artesia. 
</P>
<P>
	The westbound pickup truck swerved and a section of the camper  
being towed by the pickup ``tore along the side of the bus,'' state 
police Capt. John Balderston said Sunday. The girls, ages 12 to 17, 
were killed instantly. 
</P>
<P>
	The young victims were among about 80 people from Green Lawn  
Church of Christ in Lubbock, Texas, who had spent the weekend at 
Pine Springs Summer Camp, an isolated, mountainous retreat in 
Lincoln National Forest. The camp near Mayhill is about 150 miles 
southwest of Lubbock. 
</P>
<P>
	Back at Green Lawn Church, hundreds of teen-agers and parents  
sobbed, held hands and sang hymns after word spread of the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you do in the midst of a tragedy like this?'' minister  
Dale Mannon said in a prayer. ``There is nothing pretty about 
death. We don't pretend to know why these things happen. But we do 
know that you, Father, know what it is like to watch a child die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dead girls were identified as Talitha Beaman, 17; Sara  
English, 15; Sara Johnson, 13; Megan Flynn; Heather Dauman; and 
Ashton Qutby. The other girls' ages were not available. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no information available about the pickup driver who  
was killed and Balderston said it wasn't known why the other pickup 
truck swerved. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people were in critical condition and three were in  
serious condition at Alamogordo and Albuquerque hospitals, 
officials said. Twenty-one others people were treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
	Congregant Sarah Johnson said her daughter was on the trip to  
Pine Springs Summer Camp but escaped injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every one of those kids is mine, just as if I had them  
myself,'' she said. ``There are no words .... Right now, we just 
need to pray. We know that they are in a better place and it's up 
to us to be there for the parents.''

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Are Little Changed / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. treasury bonds barely changed Monday after  
a key manufacturing report eased concerns that the economy is 
overheating. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 3/32  
points, or by $0.94 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which 
moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.65 percent from Friday's 
5.66 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Purchasing Management said in a  
report released Monday that the nation's manufacturing sector 
continued to expand for the third straight month in April. But the 
growth was less robust than in the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	That, combined with more moderate spending growth, could be  
among the first signs of an expected economic slowdown, some 
analysts speculated, easing fears of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising inflation reduces the value of fixed-income investments,  
such as bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were unchanged, while intermediate maturities ranged between 
unchanged and down 3/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on three-month Treasury bills was 4.60 percent as the  
discount rose 0.05 percentage point from late Friday to 4.48 
percent. Six-month yields rose to 4.67 percent, while the discount 
increased 0.03 percentage point to 4.50 percent. One-year yields 
jumped to 4.77 percent as the discount rose 0.01 percentage point 
to 4.54 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.13 percent from late Friday's 4.94 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 123 5/16 from 123 1/2 late Friday. The 
average yield to maturity rose to 5.30 percent from 5.28 percent 
late Friday.

<HEADLINE> Buffet Won't Bet on Computer Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- For years, multibillionaire investor Warren  
Buffett has shied away from computer companies, saying he invests 
only in companies he understands. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as the Internet becomes more dominant in the U.S. economy,  
the Berkshire Hathaway Inc. chairman is waiting to see how 
businesses that catch his eye find their conventional ways of doing 
business challenged by the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime we buy a business we look at what it will be like in  
five to 10 years,'' Buffett told 15,000 shareholders Monday at the 
investment company's annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some cases, the Internet is such a threat we wouldn't want  
to get into it,'' he said. He noted that the automobile retailing 
will change dramatically as more people go online. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffett also forecast that businesses with trusted brand names,  
such as Berkshire-owned Borsheim's jewelry, should benefit from the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brand names are going to mean very, very much to people among  
the thousands of names offered on the Internet,'' Buffett said. ``I 
don't see them going for Brand X and buying fine jewelry over the 
Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger fielded  
dozens of questions ranging from accounting practices to investment 
strategies of Berkshire-owned insurance companies General Re and 
Geico. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 14,000 shareholders packed the AKsarben coliseum for  
the annual meeting, which features a six-hour-long 
question-and-answer session with Buffett and Munger. Still more 
stockholders listened to Buffett's comments via a large-screen 
television set up at a local hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	In the halls surrounding the coliseum, Buffett-owned businesses  
sold candy, Dairy Queen ice cream and Geico agents even issued 
insurance rate quotes for those interested. 
</P>
<P>
	Berkshire, which had $2.8 billion in net earnings last year,  
needs large investments if they are to have any impact on earnings 
growth for the company, Buffett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for investing in companies he likes and holding the stock  
indefinitely, Buffett's estimated wealth of more than $29.4 billion 
makes him the second-richest man in America behind Microsoft Corp. 
chairman Bill Gates at $58 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, while Buffett was vacationing with Gates at  
Yellowstone National Park, he made a bid for Long-Term Capital 
Management, a Connecticut-based hedge fund that was in financial 
trouble. The hedge fund turned down the bid, and Long-Term Capital 
was rescued by a consortium of financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffett, who owns stock in companies like Coca-Cola and  
Gillette, also said he would not invest in computer companies, 
including Microsoft, because he cannot comfortably predict where 
they will be in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's much easier to predict the relative strength that  
Coke will have in the soft drink world than Microsoft will in the 
software world,'' Buffett said. ``That's not to knock Microsoft. If 
I had to bet on anyone, I'd bet on Microsoft. But I don't have to 
bet.''

<HEADLINE> Incendiary Device at Neb. School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LaVISTA, Neb. (AP) -- An incendiary device was found today at a  
school where a written threat was received last week, and a 
15-year-old boy later admitted being responsible for both, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	LaVista Junior High was evacuated and the Omaha Police bomb  
squad was called in after a pop bottle with flammable liquid and 
fuse was found in the trash can of a boys' restroom around 9:15 
a.m. The bomb squad removed the device and defused it outside the 
school building. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said a written threat had been received at the  
school last Friday. The school also was evacuated then, but nothing 
was found. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the handwriting in the written threat, authorities  
already were questioning a boy this morning when another student 
found the bottle device, Principal Jim Glover said. The device had 
apparently been placed in the restroom earlier this morning, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glover said the 15-year-old admitted making the threat and  
placing the device. He was suspended indefinitely and turned over 
to police. 
</P>
<P>
	Classes at the school were allowed to resume, but about 200 of  
the school's 870 students were taken home by parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I wanted was him home,'' said one parent, Shelly DeLuna.  
</P>
<P>
	LaVista Junior High is in the Papillion-LaVista School district  
in suburban Omaha. The incident is the latest in a slew of bomb 
threats, gun arrests and other problems at schools across the 
nation since the attack on Columbine High School in Littleton, 
Colo., on April 20.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers Review Cuba Scouting Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers said Monday they are  
looking into allegations that they illegally signed two Cuban minor 
leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe quoted first baseman Juan Carlos Diaz and  
outfielder Josue Perez as saying the Dodgers held secret tryouts 
for them in their homeland, arranged their escapes and then ordered 
them to lie about it. 
</P>
<P>
	If the allegations are true, the Dodgers' actions would violate  
baseball rules prohibiting scouting in Cuba. They also may violate 
the U.S. trade embargo against the communist nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz, 23, and Perez, 21, have asked the commissioner's office to  
declare them free agents on grounds they were signed illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	``We learned on Friday that Mr. Gus Dominguez has written a  
letter to major league baseball requesting an inquiry into the 
circumstances under which the two players were signed in 1996 and 
1998,'' the Dodgers said. ``We have not received a copy of the 
letter and therefore cannot comment on its contents. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, we have commenced our review of the allegations  
published in the Boston Globe article this past weekend and are 
prepared to cooperate with the Commissioner's Office in addressing 
this matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pablo Peguero, the scout accused of arranging the defections,  
said he hasn't been to Cuba in more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioner's office has said teams breaking rules against  
scouting in Cuba face fines, suspensions or loss of amateur draft 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll investigate it and see what's fact and what's fiction,''  
commissioner Bud Selig said. ``We're just in the process of doing 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	``First we'll find out what the facts are and then I'll  
decide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Dodgers did recruit players from Cuba, they could be in  
violation of the 36-year trade embargo prohibiting American 
companies from conducting business on the island. Individuals can 
be fined up to $55,000 for violations, and corporations up to 
$250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez would not comment on the report before playing a game for  
Class-A Vero Beach against the St. Lucie Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both Perez and myself have been told by the front office not  
to speak about the issue,'' Vero Beach manager Alvaro Espinoza 
said. ``I am not allowed to comment about that.''

<HEADLINE> Injured Ref Targeted in Scotland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) -- Soccer referee Hugh Dallas, who needed  
four stitches in a head wound when struck by a coin during Sunday's 
``Old Firm'' game between Celtic and Rangers, was targeted again 
hours later when windows in his house were smashed. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas was at his home at Motherwell, five miles southeast of  
Glasgow, when he heard windows being smashed at about midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Police on Monday said they are assuming that those responsible  
were Celtic fans angered by his decisions during a game their team 
lost 3-0, giving the Scottish Premier League title to the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time in 334 meetings between the two Glasgow  
rivals that the Rangers had clinched the title at the home of its 
rival. The clubs meet again in the Scottish Cup final May 29 and 
Dallas will be the referee in that game, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no suggestion Hugh Dallas won't still be refereeing  
the Scottish Cup final,'' said Scottish Football Association 
spokesman Andy Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's crucial Premier League match before 60,000 fans at  
Celtic Park was televised around the world. Police arrested 113 
fans before, during and after the game and the SFA and the Premier 
League have launched their own separate inquiries into the 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Four Celtic fans ran into the field at different times to try  
and get at Dallas. Rangers vice-chairman Donald Findlay blamed the 
kickoff time, which was put back until early evening for the 
benefit of live TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to look again at the issue of 6:05 p.m. (kickoff)  
because it does give supporters all day to drink in the pub,'' 
Findlay said. ``You don't want to take the passion out of the game, 
but the violence we saw yesterday is unacceptable, and no one wants 
to see that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We condemn violence in any form. It has no part to play in  
Scottish football -- or anybody else's football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes after Dallas expelled Celtic defender Stephane Mahe for  
a second yellow card, the referee went down on one knee with blood 
pouring from a head wound. The FIFA referee, who officiated at last 
summer's World Cup, was able to continue after treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	George Cumming, SFA's referee development director, said that  
Dallas' performance at the game had enhanced his reputation as a 
top official. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hugh was under tremendous pressure during the match and he  
undoubtedly increased his stature in the game with how he 
performed,'' Cumming said. 
</P>
<P>
	``His display was magnificent last night and proved that he is  
one of the top referees operating in Europe.''

<HEADLINE>  Reggie Lewis Lawsuit Goes to Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- When Celtics captain Reggie Lewis collapsed and  
died while practicing jump shots in 1993, he left a pregnant wife, 
thousands of fans and a star team of doctors wondering what went 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	In the years since, a battle of reputations has been waged  
between Lewis' family and some of the city's most prominent 
physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	They start fighting it out before a jury today.  
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' widow says the doctors who treated her husband in his  
last months misdiagnosed and mistreated a fatal heart condition. 
The doctors contend Lewis used cocaine and lied about it, making an 
accurate diagnosis impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	The malpractice suit pits Donna Harris-Lewis against Dr. Gilbert  
H. Mudge, who led the specialists, and Drs. Mark Creager and Peter 
Friedman, who were consultants. 
</P>
<P>
	A third consultant, Dr. John Rutherford, recently reached a  
settlement with Harris-Lewis, the terms of which have not been 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith imposed a gag order  
and none of the main players in the case would comment publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	But the story of Lewis' death and the finger-pointing that  
followed has played itself out very publicly in a city that loved 
its Celtics and adored the team's brightest star when he died at 
27. 
</P>
<P>
	It all began April 29, 1993, when Lewis collapsed during a  
playoff game against the Charlotte Hornets. A ``Dream Team'' of New 
England Baptist Hospital doctors assembled by the Celtics diagnosed 
him with arrhythmia, a potentially life-threatening, career-ending 
heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The grim conclusion led Lewis to seek a second opinion from one  
of Boston's most respected cardiologists, Dr. Mudge of Brigham and 
Women's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge reported that Lewis suffered from a neurological disorder  
that causes fainting spells. With proper treatment, he said, Lewis 
could return to professional basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months later, on July 27, Lewis died while shooting hoops  
in the off-season at Brandeis University in Waltham. 
</P>
<P>
	The state medical examiner listed the cause of death as  
adenovirus 2, a common virus that could have led to inflammation of 
the heart, widespread scarring of tissue and, ultimately, a fatal 
cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Autopsy consultants later said Lewis had ``athlete's heart'' -- a  
left ventricle that has become enlarged from pumping massive 
amounts of blood. Everyone who examined Lewis' body agreed there 
was no evidence of cocaine use, which could be an explanation for 
the scarring. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mudge later said that two weeks before Lewis died, the  
player admitting using cocaine in the past but said he had stopped. 
The lack of full disclosure early in the treatment process made it 
impossible to make a proper diagnosis, Mudge has claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis has vehemently denied her husband ever used  
cocaine. In the last several months, the two sides have sparred 
over the right to bring up the alleged drug use at trial. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 21, Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith ruled that jurors can  
hear the accusations -- if the doctors' lawyers can prove cocaine 
was a factor in misdiagnosing Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a person uses cocaine, it can cause structural damage to  
the heart,'' Fremont-Smith said. ``It does become relevant, in my 
mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis, who still lives in the Boston area with her son,  
7-year-old Reggie Jr., and daughter, 5-year-old Reggiena, has 
maintained she tried to get evidence of alleged drug use excluded 
because the charges only ``sensationalize and hide the true 
issue.'' And she has said she brought the lawsuit only to restore 
her husband's name. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is very important that our children understand what  
happened to their father,'' Harris-Lewis told the Boston Herald in 
a recent interview. ``I have waited for three years for this day to 
come, and I'm looking forward to the truth.''

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes Kill 18 in Midwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Tornadoes tore through Oklahoma and Kansas  
on Monday night, wiping out whole neighborhoods, killing at least 
18 people and injuring hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard it, the house started shaking and then the big  
rumble,'' said 74-year-old Katherine Burch, who hid in the bathroom 
of her southwest Oklahoma City home during the storm. ``Glass and 
everything flew in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police and emergency workers combed through the debris as  
darkness fell, searching for survivors. Crumpled cars littered two 
highways. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are getting so many injuries we are just tagging them and  
bringing them in,'' said Shara Findley, a spokeswoman for Hillcrest 
Health Center in Oklahoma City. ``We're getting everything you can 
think of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four people were killed in Midwest City, just southeast of  
Oklahoma City, according to Ben Frizzell, spokesman for the state 
Office of Emergency Management. Another eight were killed in 
Chickasha, about 50 miles southwest of Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	Six were reported dead in neighboring Kansas about 150 miles due  
north in Wichita, according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma's Midwest Regional Medical Center said it was treating  
at least 100 injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``We fear there are many more,'' Frizzell said of the victims.  
</P>
<P>
	The tornado was one of several that formed over a five-hour  
period beginning in southwest Oklahoma and stretching northeast. 
Damage was reported with some of the storms, which were part of a 
storm system over the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Severe Storms Lab in Norman said the tornado may  
have been a mile wide at times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is just the perfect type of atmosphere, very unstable and  
with wind shear, to create supercells,'' said National Weather 
Service forecaster David Andra. 
</P>
<P>
	He said forecasters expected the Oklahoma City twister to be  
categorized as at least F-4, the second-strongest tornado 
classification. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado was one of several that formed during the night,  
beginning in southwest Oklahoma and stretching northeast. There 
were at least three tornado warnings still in effect at 10:30 p.m., 
including one about 25 miles west of Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornadoes that ripped through south Wichita in Kansas on  
Monday night damaged dozens of homes and killed at least six 
people, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several mobile homes in south Wichita were blown into a lake and  
several other homes were damaged, said Fred Irvin of the Sedgwick 
County Emergency Preparedness Office. Irvin said multiple injuries 
were reported in both Wichita and Haysville. 
</P>
<P>
	The storms, which included high winds and heavy rains, hit the  
area about 8:30 p.m., Irvin said. Power lines and trees were 
reported down throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems as if more than one tornado touched down,'' Irvin  
said. ``They seemed to have hit in spotted areas in south and 
southwest Wichita.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chad Harris' mobile home was demolished with eight people  
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no trailer,'' Harris, 19, said. ``We all rolled in it.  
It was the worst experience in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two people in the trailer were in critical condition.  
</P>
<P>
	Courtney Karr, 13, said she saw the bay windows in her house  
cave in and the tornado swirling inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was freaked out at that point. I was scared for my life,''  
Courtney said. ``I've seen it on TV, but seeing it with my own 
eyes, tearing up my own home ... it is hard to explain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Television reports in Oklahoma City showed hundreds of destroyed  
homes. Heavy damage was reported in Moore, south of Oklahoma City, 
where rows of houses were destroyed and scores of trucks 
overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas leaked from several locations Monday night. Power  
lines and piles of carpet were everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's gone,'' LeeAnn Richardson said as she looked toward where  
her home once stood. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Richardson said she and others were watching the weather on  
television when they decided to run into the storm cellar after 
clouds rolled in and rain poured down. Sixteen people and four pets 
were in there with her. 
</P>
<P>
	All survived without injury, but: ``We opened up and everything  
was gone,'' Ms. Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The twister was first reported about 5:50 p.m., but had not  
caused significant damage to homes until moving closer to Oklahoma 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Power lines popped and debris flew as the twister moved along  
from Chickasha and cut through about eight miles of the heavily 
populated Oklahoma City metro area. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth Seymore sat on the tailgate of a pickup truck being used as  
a treatment center by a Red Cross volunteer. Injured people waited 
for ambulances. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just demolished,'' Ms. Seymore said of her home in  
Moore. ``Everything fell in on me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she hid in a closet and became trapped by the debris.  
</P>
<P>
	``They couldn't hardly get me out of there. I couldn't get  
anybody to find me. I kept hollering `Help!' '' 
</P>
<P>
	In Del City, a suburb of Oklahoma City, Mary Pat Faris wore a  
nightgown at the high school where she waited for word about 
missing family members. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard it. I heard the popping and then I heard the trees  
crunching and then my house was gone,'' said Ms. Faris, who 
weathered the storm in her bathtub.

<HEADLINE> Author Criticized for Superstore Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As Frank McCourt now knows, it's hard to be  
neutral in the battle of the booksellers. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Booksellers Association overwhelmingly passed a  
resolution over the weekend criticizing the author of ``Angela's 
Ashes.'' McCourt, whose book had once been named by independent 
book stores as their favorite to sell, had appeared in a television 
ad for the on-line superstore barnesandnoble.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they (independent stores) had wanted me to do a commercial  
I would have done one for them, too. I'm not a politician. I just 
did what my publisher requested,'' said McCourt, a featured speaker 
at BookExpo America, where the resolution was approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Other authors have plugged superstores -- Tom Clancy and Stephen  
King also made barnesandnoble.com ads -- but McCourt's endorsement 
was especially upsetting to independents because they see his 
success as their success, too. 
</P>
<P>
	No one, especially McCourt, imagined that his memoir about  
growing up in poverty in Ireland would sell more than 2 million 
copies. And independents believe they had a lot to do with that. 
It's what they feel their stores are all about -- spreading the word 
about a book the big chains won't take a chance on. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the market we serve,'' said Richard Howorth, president  
of the ABA, which has a core membership of some 3,300 independent 
stores. The expo, a three-day convention and trade show that ended 
Sunday, is the publishing industry's annual national gathering. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution called for a letter to McCourt to be drafted,  
expressing the ABA's disappointment. But the wording may not 
matter; McCourt said he won't bother reading it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never asked for an apology in my life and I've never  
given one. What I do I do. ... If I get a letter from them it'll go 
back unopened,'' McCourt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the author said he would be ``very careful'' if asked to  
do another Barnes &AMP; Noble ad. And his publisher seemed sorry it 
ever got him involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I regret that, because of the complications of the retail  
environment today, what seemed like a simple decision became so 
much more complicated,'' said Susan Moldow, vice president and 
publisher of Scribner, an imprint of Simon &AMP; Schuster that 
distributes both McCourt and King. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution by the ABA, which has lost nearly 2,000 stores in  
the past decade, highlighted a weekend of tough talk and action. 
</P>
<P>
	The association aggressively promoted its answer to Amazon.com  
and other on-line sellers, BookSense.com, to be open for business 
late summer. And individual members accused Barnes &AMP; Noble, 
Amazon.com and other ``bad corporate citizens'' of everything from 
false advertising to stealing customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are fighting for our lives,'' Howorth said.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, booksellers also were talking books. Major upcoming  
releases include ``'Tis,'' McCourt's sequel to ``Angela's Ashes''; 
Edmund Morris' ``Dutch,'' his long-awaited book about former 
President Ronald Reagan; Sue Grafton's latest lettered mystery, ``O 
is For Outlaw,'' and ``Hannibal,'' Thomas Harris' sequel to his 
novel ``The Silence of the Lambs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But McCourt wasn't the only writer who stumbled into the war  
between independents and superstores. Bill Murray, who looked like 
he's done a lot of stumbling in his lifetime, got dragged in, too. 
</P>
<P>
	A featured breakfast speaker Saturday, Murray was promoting his  
upcoming golf book/memoir ``A Cinderella Story.'' He shared the 
dais with Frances Mayes, author of the bestseller ``Under the 
Tuscan Sun,'' and with Julia Child, who has a new cook book coming 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	With the crowd laughing each time he so much as twitched, Murray  
noticed an odd silence when he mentioned his book was being 
published by Doubleday, a division of Random House, which has 
invested in barnesandnoble.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not one speck of applause,'' he uttered. ``Julia got a  
standing ovation and Doubleday got NOTHING!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, there was applause. He waited for it to end, then added.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm VERY happy to be with them.''

<HEADLINE> Tape Figures in Marine Pilot Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A crew member who was in the back seat  
when a Marine jet killed 20 people in Italy testified today he 
advised the pilot and navigator to get rid of a videotape shot 
during the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing at Capt. Richard Ashby's obstruction of justice trial,  
Capt. Chandler Seagraves testified that he met Ashby, the pilot, 
and the jet's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, a few days after 
the accident in the tent city area of the Aviano, Italy, air base 
where they were stationed. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Ashby and Schweitzer asked him what they should do with  
the videotape, which Schweitzer had shot before the jet hit the 
cable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said I'd get rid of it,'' he testified. At an unspecified  
later date, Seagraves said Schweitzer told him the tape was gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagraves' testimony was interrupted by another mistrial motion  
made by Ashby's attorneys. The judge, Col. Alvin Keller, listened 
to arguments by the two sides and did not immediately rule on the 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's lawyers objected to a prosecutor raising the issue of  
the crew members' silence about the videotape. Attorney Frank 
Spinner said raising that issue violated his client's Fifth 
Amendment right against self-incrimination. Keller had already 
rejected a mistrial motion on similar grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagraves, 29, of Nineveh, Ind., was a crewman on the EA-6B  
Prowler that clipped a gondola cable near Cavalese, Italy, on Feb. 
3, 1998, killing 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., is charged with obstruction  
of justice and conspiracy for helping destroy the video. The case 
is expected to go to the jury this week. If convicted of the two 
charges, Ashby could be sent to prison for up to 10 years or be 
dismissed from the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagraves' testimony began the second week of Ashby's trial.  
</P>
<P>
	He said the four crew members met individually with Italian  
officials the day after the accident. ``I knew they obviously were 
looking into what was going on, but at that time, that was the 
least of my concerns,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors were trying to establish that Ashby knew there was a  
criminal investigation under way when he helped destroy the video. 
Ashby has admitting taking the tape from the jet, but maintains he 
didn't intend to obstruct justice because he didn't know a such a 
probe was under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagraves, Ashby, another backseat crewman and Schweitzer all  
were charged with involuntary manslaughter after the accident near 
Cavalese, Italy. Ashby was acquitted of the charges, and 
authorities dismissed the charges against the others. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., pleaded guilty to the  
obstruction charges. In April, a jury recommended his dismissal 
from the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer testified Friday that he made the tape of himself in  
the plane before the accident, intending it as a souvenir. After 
the tragedy, he told Ashby to take the videotape from the jet, 
Ashby gave him the tape a few days later, and Schweitzer threw it 
into a bonfire. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he feared his picture might be used along with those of  
the bloody accident scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I could think about was my face and the blood in the  
snow,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Creator Talks About 'Sports Night' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Aaron Sorkin is gracious as all get-out when he  
talks about the team responsible for ``Sports Night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a sense that I'm kind of a one-man band,'' he  
says, ``and nothing could be further from the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even allowing for gifted cast members like Felicity Huffman,  
Peter Krause and Robert Guillaume, and for the peppy yet sleek 
staging masterminded by executive producer Thomas Schlamme ... just 
notice the full-screen credit that appears right after the ``Sports 
Night'' title card: ``Created by Aaron Sorkin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Very well.  
</P>
<P>
	In a season of freshman delights otherwise limited to cartoons  
and HBO's ``The Sopranos,'' ``Sports Night'' has been a notable 
treat. A sort of workplace wingding set at a sports-cable network, 
it brims with style, heart and smarts. The writing, most often 
Sorkin's, deftly weds hurly-burly and tenderness. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider a couple of contrasting moments from the season finale,  
which ABC airs Tuesday at 9:30 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	When her fiance breaks their engagement, Dana Whitaker (played  
by Huffman) blows up. ``This is a cheap excuse to get out of 
marrying me,'' she storms, ``which you never wanted to do in the 
third place. And the only reason you proposed in the second place 
was out of guilt for having slept with Sally in the first place!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, a bit later, Casey McCall (Krause) has a man-to-man talk  
with his little boy, who's lousy at baseball and fears embarrassing 
Dad. 
</P>
<P>
	``In your lifetime you'll never embarrass me,'' Casey declares.  
``It's not gonna happen. You play baseball if you want to play 
baseball -- and the only thing you have to do to make me and your 
mom happy is come home at the end of the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All in all, it's a fitting windup to the maiden season of  
``Sports Night.'' (The episode even features the poignant return of 
Guillaume, absent for several weeks after suffering a stroke.) And, 
happily, the show will be back in the fall. ``It's been a great 
year,'' Sorkin sums up. 
</P>
<P>
	But what about the ratings? ``Nothing to write home about,'' he  
concedes. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first, I had a cavalier attitude: `Hey, if we do 13  
episodes then get pulled off the air, that's fine. It's 13 terrific 
episodes!' And I still can't get over the fact that millions of 
people tune in. But I have a fiduciary responsibility for the 
show's success, and besides, I'm as competitive as anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So why isn't his ``Sports Night'' the hit it seems cut out to  
be? 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there might be a perception -- and I want to nip this  
in the bud -- that `Sports Night' is good for you somehow, like 
eating your vegetables,'' says Sorkin, smiling yet earnest. ``I 
can't tell you how NOT it is. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really just telling you stories, and I think that new  
viewers will find that it's not a great effort to watch -- that, in 
fact, it's quite a bit of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After all, this series comes from the unabashedly mainstream guy  
who wrote the Broadway and film versions of ``A Few Good Men'' and 
the screenplay for ``The American President.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, ``Sports Night'' seems very much a reflection of Sorkin,  
who in person reveals himself to be: revved-up, chockablock with 
ideas and observations, cheerfully self-deprecating, warm, and at 
odds with a boyish forelock that keeps flopping in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think only in television could I be considered  
unconventional,'' he marvels. ``In the theater and in movies I 
think I hug the middle of the road pretty tightly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But if ``Sports Night'' is unconventional, and it is, one reason  
may be that Sorkin simply didn't know the conventions of half-hour 
comedy -- conventions that, after a half-century, have begun to 
grate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm as new to television as can be,'' he said last fall, ``and  
I don't know what I'm doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, he doesn't choose to. ``I'm thinking that not  
knowing what I'm doing might be an asset,'' he says now. 
</P>
<P>
	It may prove an asset once again. On this day a couple of weeks  
ago, Sorkin has stolen a few minutes from editing the pilot for a 
series NBC might air next fall. ``The West Wing'' is a comedic 
probe into the workings of the White House and would star Rob Lowe 
and Martin Sheen. 
</P>
<P>
	By May 17, when NBC unveils its 1999-2000 lineup, Sorkin will  
learn if ``The West Wing'' is a go. And if it is, he ventures no 
game plan for how he means to write scripts for not one, but two 
weekly series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in denial,'' he says brightly. ``I'm not abandoning one  
show for the other, and I'm not interested in being involved with a 
show in name only.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which might be why his name is worth noticing. And why a show is  
worth noticing when his name is on it. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dole Takes Centrist Gun Control View </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- A Republican quiz: In seven minutes or  
less, explain why you should be the party's presidential nominee 
instead of George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight GOP candidates faced that test Sunday night in speeches to  
New Hampshire party leaders. The Texas governor, meanwhile, 
remained at home in Austin -- unwilling to risk his front-runner 
status. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole answered with a challenge to the National Rifle  
Association on gun control, promising to be a tough-on-crime 
president ``no matter what the special interests say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rival Steve Forbes replied that the country must ``resist the  
temptation to enact new laws'' in response to tragedies such as the 
school shooting in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks were made at a dinner billed as the party's first  
major event of the 2000 campaign in this first-in-the-nation 
primary state. Candidates were given seven minutes to speak, with a 
band enforcing the time limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Three likely candidates stayed away: Arizona Sen. John McCain,  
commentator Pat Buchanan and Bush. McCain was celebrating his son's 
13th birthday; Buchanan was campaigning in Arizona; Bush has 
refused to campaign outside his state until the legislative session 
ends later this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Many activists who attended the kickoff questioned or criticized  
Bush's decision to pass up the event, but most predicted it would 
not change his front-runner status. 
</P>
<P>
	For the rest of the field, the gathering offered a chance to  
shine outside Bush's shadow. Their goal is to emerge as alternative 
pick should he falter. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole's was the boldest attempt at creating news and drawing  
attention to her campaign. Wearing a clip-on microphone, the former 
American Red Cross president stood several feet from the podium -- 
spinning on her high heels to address the crowd that surrounded 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she supports the continuation of the assault-weapons  
ban, elimination of bullets that pierce bulletproof vests and full 
federal funding of instant background checks for gun buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you need an AK-47 (assault rifle) to defend your  
family,'' she said, receiving a smattering of polite applause. The 
reception was even cooler when Mrs. Dole, ranked second in most GOP 
presidential polls, said she supported child safety locks on 
handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	One person in the crowd booed. Few applauded.  
</P>
<P>
	Aides say they were not troubled by the reaction because Mrs.  
Dole is trying to expand the GOP's base by targeting moderate 
voters, not party regulars. President Clinton adopted a similar 
approach on gun control in 1996 to court moderate and independent 
voters, particularly women. 
</P>
<P>
	The other GOP candidates found other ways to set themselves  
apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle argued that he deserves the  
nomination. ``Who has been fighting for your values and your 
families for over 20 years?'' he asked. ``Who has the experience 
when it comes to foreign policy and who has been tested and has the 
courage to lead this great country of ours?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Kasich of Ohio portrayed himself as the candidate who  
would ease ``the frustrations of everyday working people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith, a native son with little chance of  
winning the nomination, bragged that he had voted to remove Clinton 
from office and criticized Republicans who didn't.

<HEADLINE> Investor AB Increases Scania Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Investor AB, the investment arm of  
Sweden's powerful Wallenberg family, has increased its stake in 
Swedish truck- and bus-maker Scania to 49 percent, the company 
announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came just days after vehicle-maker Volvo  
announced two shares purchases that raised its stake in its Swedish 
rival to 20 percent of the voting shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Investor said it raised its voting share by trading selling some  
6.2 million B shares -- which carry one-tenth of a vote apiece -- and 
buying 8.5 million A shares, with one vote apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo stunned the Swedish business community in January with the  
announcement that it had bought 13 percent of the shares in Scania 
and said it was seeking to merge. Scania's chief Leif Oestling had 
decribed that move as ``close to hostile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo and Investor, which then held 45 percent of the votes in  
Scania, entered discussions, but the talks broke off this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo's move for Scania came just two weeks before Volvo sold  
its small but prestigious passenger car division to Ford Motor Co. 
Volvo said part of the reason for the sale was to allow the company 
to concentrate on its other business areas, including trucks and 
buses. 
</P>
<P>
	The car division sale for $6.45 billion gave Volvo a cash  
infusion that some analysts have speculated would make Volvo an 
attractive takeover target.

<HEADLINE> US Scientists Study Malaysia Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- In a quarantined laboratory, U.S. scientists  
outfitted in plastic biohazard spacesuits and breathing through air 
tubes are probing a killer that has struck on the other side of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	The mysterious microscopic enemy has killed more than 100 people  
in Malaysia in seven months, and scientists are baffled about its 
origin and mode of transmission. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every couple of years something like this comes along,'' says  
Dr. C.J. Peters, head of the special pathogens branch at the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ``We don't know how 
this stuff spreads, how far it's going to go. We really don't know 
what's at the end of the tunnel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rare form of viral encephalitis, which spread from pigs to  
humans, first surfaced last year near the northern city of Ipoh. It 
has since sickened more than 250 Malaysians, mostly pig farmers. 
Many of their herds also fell ill, and some pigs died. A similar 
illness afflicted 11 slaughterhouse workers in Singapore, one 
fatally, who butchered pigs imported from Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldiers have killed almost 1 million pigs and some stray dogs  
to try to curb the virus. On Monday, pet owners in Malaysia's 
high-risk areas were told to get their animals checked immediately 
after new tests confirmed house pets could transmit the disease to 
humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical authorities named the new virus Nipah, after the village  
where it was first isolated. 
</P>
<P>
	As remote as the Nipah virus may seem, controlling and  
understanding it are a concern of epidemiologists around the globe 
because of fear it could spread quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``In today's world, it's not unrealistic to think of the  
possibility that someone could get on a plane and land in San 
Francisco with it,'' says Dr. Duane Gubler, director of the CDC's 
Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases at Fort Collins, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	For months, Malaysian health officials were certain the killer  
was Japanese encephalitis, a mosquito-borne virus common to the 
area. The two pathogens cause similar symptoms -- high fever, aches, 
eventual coma and, often, death. 
</P>
<P>
	But most people in the region had been vaccinated for JE as  
children. Additionally, it doesn't usually kill adult pigs. 
</P>
<P>
	The government declared a state of emergency in three Malaysian  
states and launched fogging and vaccination campaigns, to no avail. 
The Nipah virus raged on. And despite no proof that Nipah can 
infect people who eat or handle pork, the epidemic has wreaked 
havoc on Malaysia's nearly $400 million pork industry. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 7, baffled Malaysian researchers sought help from their  
counterparts at Gubler's CDC office in Fort Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was quite fortuitous that when I sent him an offer to help,  
he was in the process of sending a note to the CDC asking for 
help,'' Gubler says. 
</P>
<P>
	The following Saturday morning, a Malaysian researcher arrived  
in Fort Collins with slides of cells infected with the mysterious 
virus. The researchers worked through the weekend, screening the 
sample against dozens of known viruses. All were negative. 
</P>
<P>
	When they tried to isolate Nipah, it formed giant cells with  
multiple nuclei -- epidemiological patterns not at all like JE. By 
Sunday, a red flag had gone up: The Nipah virus fit in none of the 
three virus families studied at Fort Collins and was actually a 
previously unknown paramyxovirus. This family includes measles and 
mumps, but one of the last new paramyxoviruses discovered was the 
especially virulent Hendra virus. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was when we packed it up and sent it to Atlanta,'' Gubler  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	The samples were taken to the CDC's Level 4 biocontainment lab,  
which houses deadly microbes that have no vaccine or cure, such as 
the Ebola virus that killed 245 Zaireans in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC's medical detectives quickly identified the culprit as  
related to but far deadlier than the very rare Hendra virus. Hendra 
was first detected in 1994 in Australia, where it killed 15 
racehorses and two trainers. 
</P>
<P>
	But they know little else.  
</P>
<P>
	``That indicated right away that this was something big. We knew  
it was a new virus and we knew it was related to a virus that kills 
people,'' Peters says. ``We're not talking about an outbreak of 
colds that's going to run through and everybody's going to get over 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In late March, a team of eight CDC epidemiologists and two  
Australian researchers packed questionnaires, protective gear, 
needles and vials and headed for Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing gloves, rubber coveralls, boots and battery-operated  
respirators, the disease detectives began combing through animal 
feed and trapping rodents. They have spent weeks tramping through 
pig pens and farming villages in the worst-hit areas. They are 
interviewing victims and their families and friends: What did they 
eat? What did they drink? Where did they go? What did they do? It's 
all to form a hypothesis about how the virus is transmitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Blood samples have been taken from birds, turkeys, goats,  
horses, cattle and wild animals. With the Hendra virus, the 
culprits were fruit bats. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no idea what the natural reservoir of this virus is,''  
Gubler says. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC's next step is to try to develop a genetically  
engineered vaccine using mice, rats and guinea pigs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Peters hopes the vaccine isn't needed. Killing hundreds of  
thousands of pigs seems to have helped -- as of last week, the 
number of new cases appeared to be declining, and the disease may 
ease naturally. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're lucky,'' Peters says, ``in two or three months the  
outbreak will come under control and we'll never have to make a 
vaccine.''

<HEADLINE> Women To Press Lawmakers on Medicare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Advocacy groups are appealing to women to be  
vigilant of lawmakers looking to make changes to Medicare this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Women rely more on the nation's health insurance program for the  
elderly and disabled because they tend to live longer and have 
lower incomes than men, according to a new report released Monday 
by the Older Women's League, which is leading the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Three out of every five Medicare beneficiaries are women, and  
among those over age 85 women outnumber men two to one, the report 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, elderly women spend 22 percent of their generally smaller  
incomes on out-of-pocket health care costs, compared to 17 percent 
spent by men. 
</P>
<P>
	The report cautioned women ``to pay close attention to changes  
that have already taken place in the Medicare program and to 
proposals for reforming it further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the help of other advocacy groups, including the  
Alzheimer's Association, the group has also distributed 30,000 
cards that women across the country can mail to members of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Without changes, Medicare is expected to run short of cash by  
2015 -- just as baby boomers are retiring. However, past attempts to 
alter the program have proven politically perilous, attracting 
powerful opposition to proposals such as raising the Medicare 
eligibility age or increasing beneficiary cost-sharing. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting with Vice President Al Gore at the White House on  
Monday, OWL members offered support for a Clinton administration 
proposal to add money from government surpluses to Medicare. Many 
Republicans and some congressional Democrats have insisted that 
cost-saving reforms must come first. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has said he will send lawmakers a more  
comprehensive plan for overhauling Medicare in time for their 
consideration this year.

<HEADLINE> Food Companies Relying on Tie-Ins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- There's a feeding frenzy at this week's annual  
supermarket industry show, but food isn't on the table. The hype 
this year is not about new products, store design or nutrition but 
can be summed up in two words: ``Star Wars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Movie executives weren't the only ones already seeing dollar  
signs in their eyes from the much-anticipated prequel to the hit 
trilogy. With little more than two weeks to go before the 
much-awaited ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' the 
Food Marketing Institute show became a showcase for companies lucky 
enough to win tie-ins with the film. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants flocked to Pepsi and Frito-Lay's huge ``Star Wars''  
setup, which showed movie trailers of the upcoming film, mockups of 
some of the main characters and the 24 different ``collector'' cans 
consumers can buy. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepsi executives and others who are unveiling promotional ``Star  
Wars'' tie-ins this week had nothing but smiles despite huge 
amounts of money being paid to LucasFilm for the rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``The universe is the limit; we're anticipating a huge  
incremental sales jump from this particular campaign,'' said Greg 
McIntee, a Pepsi vice president of customer marketing and category 
management. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lucas has a real understanding of what captures the  
imagination, while we are all about good taste and fun,'' McIntee 
said Monday. ``We think that is going to mutually drive both 
businesses in hard numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Across the cavernous convention hall, another popular stop was  
Favorite Brands International, which had set up a ``Star Wars'' 
computer game on a large-screen television as it showcased Farley 
fruit snacks that come in the shape of major characters from the 
new film. 
</P>
<P>
	The licensing deal is, on average, adding about 20 cents to each  
package, said Favorite Brands product manager Marie Gould. But the 
added cost is worth it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a kids-oriented product -- and a lot of snack foods are  
-- licensing has become more important at getting their attention 
and giving the impression of being on the cutting edge,'' Gould 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	While industry participants did see new items such as the  
world's largest pickle for Vlasic's hamburger dill and product line 
extensions such as Rold Gold cheddar-cheese flavored pretzels, 
observers noted a dearth of innovations at the show, which runs 
through today. 
</P>
<P>
	Information Resources Inc. and New Product News magazine found  
in a new study that 1998 saw the fewest number of new products come 
to market in four years as companies see a smaller return on those 
products in terms of sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, of the top 10 products of last year, only three were in  
the food and beverage category: Frito-Lay's WOW chips at No. 1, its 
Deli Style chips at No. 8 and Pepsi's One cola at No. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The diminishing returns manufacturers are seeing on new  
introductions has caused promotional tie-ins to films and 
television shows such as Looney Tunes to see increased acceptance, 
no matter what the cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Such attitude come in part because grocers fighting with space  
limitations typically are reluctant to stock newer products unless 
they are guaranteed a large return nearly immediately. And the 
widespread industry consolidation has led to increased stocking of 
store-brand items as supermarkets see lower costs by getting bigger 
and sharing distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Gould of Favorite Brands noted the new ``Star Wars'' products  
found nearly 100 percent store acceptance in just a month, while it 
typically takes up to six months to receive only 30 percent 
acceptance.

<HEADLINE> FTC Leads Crackdown on Credit Scams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A team of federal, state and local law  
enforcement agencies has filed 16 complaints against companies that 
claim they can help consumers get new credit histories with fake 
Social Security numbers, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone who applies for credit with a false identification number  
is breaking federal law, said Jodie Bernstein, director of the 
Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``These credit repair con games are spreading like wildfire on  
the Internet and in unsolicited junk e-mail,'' Bernstein said. 
``They target credit-impaired consumers anxious to repair their 
credit profiles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advertisements also are placed in newspapers and magazines, and  
they use phrases such as, ``Anyone can have a new credit file 
virtually overnight,'' or, ``There's a way to obtain a new Social 
Security No.,'' according to investigators with the FTC, the 
Justice Department and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies frequently sell credit repair kits that range in  
price from $21.95 to $129.95, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers are frequently given advice about how to develop  
whole new credit profiles by doing such things as getting new 
driver's licenses using the new I.D. number and advised about 
places that will give consumers 'starter credit' using the new 
number,'' the FTC said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Such practices have increased significantly over the past five  
years, said William Cowan, special agent in charge of the Atlanta 
field office of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven complaints filed by the FTC and an eighth filed by the  
Justice Department -- all within the last week -- accuse defendants 
of violating the Credit Repair Organizations Act and other laws. 
Another eight cases were announced by state and local law 
enforcement agencies, including the Maryland, New Jersey, Oklahoma 
and Texas attorneys general. 
</P>
<P>
	In the complaints, the agencies ask federal judges to  
permanently enjoin illegal claims and impose civil penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine state and local law enforcement agencies also are  
participating in the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, the FTC and other federal, state and local law  
enforcement agencies announced they had filed 40 complaints against 
similar companies, the FTC said.

<HEADLINE> Last Microsoft Witnesses Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft will use testimony from a rival  
executive at America Online, and an IBM executive will testify for 
the government among the six final witnesses in the Microsoft 
antitrust trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said Monday it will question AOL Senior Vice President  
David Colburn as a hostile witness when the trial resumes. It will 
ask him about AOL's recent $9.9 billion purchase of Netscape 
Communications Corp., and the implications of that extraordinary 
deal on the technology industry and on the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft argues that AOL's new alliance with Netscape  
illustrates that competition is thriving and government 
intervention is unnecessary in such an important part of the 
booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Colburn testified previously for the government, explaining  
AOL's decision in March 1996 to distribute Microsoft's Internet 
software over rival Netscape's. Microsoft said in court papers 
that, among other topics, its lawyers want to question Colburn 
about the ``completeness and candor'' of his prior testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department and 19 states said they will call Garry  
Norris, a former director at IBM Corp.'s personal computer 
division, who is expected to testify about Microsoft's alleged 
bullying practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Monday's announcement, a curious hole in the government's  
case has been the lack in its lineup of witnesses from any of the 
nation's computer makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also will use testimony from Gordon Eubanks, who  
stepped down weeks ago as president and chief executive officer of 
Symantec Corp., which makes a popular anti-virus program and other 
software utilities that run using Microsoft's Windows operating 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Eubanks, a longtime Microsoft ally, left to become president of  
Oblix Inc., a small computer automation company whose investors 
include Netscape and Novell Inc. -- some of Microsoft's biggest 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Eubanks told The New York Times last year, ``Microsoft has done  
some bad things.'' But he added that Microsoft's chairman, Bill 
Gates, is a victim of American culture's trend of attacking and 
tearing down successful people. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview last summer with an Internet trade publication,  
Eubanks said he does not believe the courtroom is the best way to 
solve technology problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``My own opinion is that the marketplace is a better arbiter of  
these issues,'' Eubanks said then. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said it also will call back Edward Felten, a  
Princeton University computer expert who previously testified it 
was possible to disable Microsoft's Internet software. 
</P>
<P>
	The company contends its Internet software is integrated with  
Windows and can't be removed without crippling the operating 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The witnesses also will include two returning economists who  
stumbled through parts of their earlier testimony, Richard 
Schmalensee, a dean at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
and MIT economist Franklin Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher, who testified for the government, slipped when he told  
Justice lawyer David Boies in January that Microsoft's behavior 
``on balance'' hasn't harmed consumers ``up to this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher caught himself moments later and amended his answer to  
explain that he believed the impact on consumers eventually will be 
felt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will live, as it were, in a Microsoft world in which  
choices are the choices that Microsoft makes,'' Fisher said. ``I 
don't think that's good for consumers, but those effects have only 
just begun.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee, who appeared for Microsoft, also stumbled on the  
stand in January, when Boies confronted him with an essay 
Schmalensee wrote 16 years ago that appeared to contradict his 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``My immediate reaction is, what could I have been thinking?''  
Schmalensee said, adding that the essay ``does not provide a good 
indication of my present views.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One critic described Schmalensee as damaged by his earlier  
admission. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think his performance in the courtroom was much less  
polished and convincingly presented than one would have expected,'' 
said William Kovacic, an antitrust expert at George Washington 
University. ``It's somewhat risky to bring him back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The witnesses will take the stand during the trial's rebuttal  
phase, an important opportunity for each side to refine its 
courtroom positions by trying to buttress the weakest parts of its 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to nail down those parts of your case,'' said Robert  
Litan, a former senior Justice Department official. ``You want to 
make sure any potential weaknesses are cleaned up, tie up loose 
ends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trial has been in a lengthy recess since Feb. 26 and is not  
expected to resume before May 24.

<HEADLINE>  Tape Figures in Marine Pilot Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A crew member who was in the back seat  
when a Marine jet killed 20 people in Italy testified today he 
advised the pilot and navigator to get rid of a videotape shot 
during the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing at Capt. Richard Ashby's obstruction of justice trial,  
Capt. Chandler Seagraves testified that he met Ashby, the pilot, 
and the jet's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, a few days after 
the accident in the tent city area of the Aviano, Italy, air base 
where they were stationed. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Ashby and Schweitzer asked him what they should do with  
the videotape, which Schweitzer had shot before the jet hit the 
cable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said I'd get rid of it,'' he testified. At an unspecified  
later date, Seagraves said Schweitzer told him the tape was gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagraves' testimony was interrupted by another mistrial motion  
made by Ashby's attorneys. The judge, Col. Alvin Keller, listened 
to arguments by the two sides and did not immediately rule on the 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's lawyers objected to a prosecutor raising the issue of  
the crew members' silence about the videotape. Attorney Frank 
Spinner said raising that issue violated his client's Fifth 
Amendment right against self-incrimination. Keller had already 
rejected a mistrial motion on similar grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagraves, 29, of Nineveh, Ind., was a crewman on the EA-6B  
Prowler that clipped a gondola cable near Cavalese, Italy, on Feb. 
3, 1998, killing 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., is charged with obstruction  
of justice and conspiracy for helping destroy the video. The case 
is expected to go to the jury this week. If convicted of the two 
charges, Ashby could be sent to prison for up to 10 years or be 
dismissed from the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagraves' testimony began the second week of Ashby's trial.  
</P>
<P>
	He said the four crew members met individually with Italian  
officials the day after the accident. ``I knew they obviously were 
looking into what was going on, but at that time, that was the 
least of my concerns,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors were trying to establish that Ashby knew there was a  
criminal investigation under way when he helped destroy the video. 
Ashby has admitting taking the tape from the jet, but maintains he 
didn't intend to obstruct justice because he didn't know a such a 
probe was under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagraves, Ashby, another backseat crewman and Schweitzer all  
were charged with involuntary manslaughter after the accident near 
Cavalese, Italy. Ashby was acquitted of the charges, and 
authorities dismissed the charges against the others. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., pleaded guilty to the  
obstruction charges. In April, a jury recommended his dismissal 
from the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer testified Friday that he made the tape of himself in  
the plane before the accident, intending it as a souvenir. After 
the tragedy, he told Ashby to take the videotape from the jet, 
Ashby gave him the tape a few days later, and Schweitzer threw it 
into a bonfire. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he feared his picture might be used along with those of  
the bloody accident scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I could think about was my face and the blood in the  
snow,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Royals Starter Struck by Ball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Kansas City starter Jose Rosado had to  
leave in the fourth inning Monday night when he was struck in the 
shoulder by a ball off the bat of New York's Bernie Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams hit a high chopper that bounced once and hit the  
left-hander in his throwing shoulder and then rolled toward third. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosado went down to one knee and grimaced in pain a few minutes  
but left the game after trying a few practice pitches. He had held 
the Yankees hitless until the previous batter, Chad Curtis, 
singled. He came into the game with a 1.72 ERA, second-best in the 
AL. 
</P>
<P>
	He was replaced by Scott Service with the Royals leading 3-0.

<HEADLINE>  Elway Makes Retirement Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- The quarterback known for being so cool  
in the final minutes of a game showed plenty of emotion this time. 
</P>
<P>
	John Elway had shown the natural poise that made him one of the  
NFL's greatest quarterbacks. Standing in a crowded conference room 
where his family, friends and fans waited for official word of his 
retirement, Elway joked about having his car towed the night before 
and prepared to reflect upon his remarkable 16 years with the 
Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when the enormity of it all blindsided him. Elway's husky  
voice started to crack and his eyes welled up with tears. Taking a 
final knee was not going to be so easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't look at it as retirement,'' the 38-year-old  
Elway said Sunday during an emotional news conference. ``I look at 
it as graduation. We graduate from high school. We graduate from 
college. I'm just graduating from football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With that, Elway paused for the second time in two minutes,  
choking back tears and trying to regain his composure. His wife 
Janet cried as she sat in the front row with their four children 
and John's father, Jack. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Janet walked up to the podium and handed her  
husband a box of tissues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It chokes you up,'' Jack Elway said. ``I've got a lot of  
friends. I like people, but that's my best friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway has been Denver's adopted son since the Broncos acquired  
him from the Baltimore Colts on May 2, 1983. It was fitting that he 
would walk away from football exactly 16 years later. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't have an over-40 league or an over-50 league,''  
Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe said. ``This is it. It's hard. To 
thank all the people who have been a part of his career and helped 
him get to this point, it's a very emotional time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe was one of several teammates who showed up on Elway Day.  
Running back Terrell Davis, defensive end Neil Smith and Elway's 
heir apparent, Bubby Brister, also listened intently as Elway 
explained that he could no longer endure the rigors of NFL life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time for me to move on,'' Elway said, breaking up again.  
``I can't do it physically anymore, and that's really hard for me 
to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his career, Elway's play often left opponents speechless.  
</P>
<P>
	He guided his team to more victories (148) than any other  
quarterback in NFL history. He threw for 51,475 yards and accounted 
for 54,882 total yards -- second only to Miami's Dan Marino. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway also rallied his team to 47 game-saving drives -- more than  
any other quarterback. He was selected to nine Pro Bowls and was 
named the NFL's MVP in 1987. He holds 55 Broncos' regular-season or 
postseason records. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I've ever been around a guy that has had  
expectations as high as John Elway,'' Denver coach Mike Shanahan 
said. ``Everybody has expected him to be the best on the football 
field. He's exceeded those expectations.' 
</P>
<P>
	For years, the only thing missing from Elway's resume was a  
Super Bowl title, and he took care of that by winning two straight. 
In his final game, he was voted Super Bowl MVP in a 34-19 win over 
Atlanta last January. 
</P>
<P>
	He becomes the only quarterback to retire after winning a Super  
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing harder than losing a Super Bowl when you work  
that hard to get there,'' Elway said. ``Heck, after 14 years I was 
wondering if we'd ever get it done. If we hadn't have won a Super 
Bowl, the chances are I'd be back next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Elway joins Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky as the  
third superstar to leave his sport since January. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's ceremony was anti-climatic because Elway's intentions  
had been known for more than a week. He delayed his announcement 
out of respect for the deadly shooting at nearby Columbine High 
School in Littleton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Elway family, Shanahan and Broncos owner Pat Bowlen wore  
blue-and-silver ribbons in memory the shooting victims and a moment 
of silence was held before the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The slayings helped Elway put his retirement decision in  
perspective, and he emphasized family while pondering his immediate 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been great for 16 years,'' Elway said. ``Since the  
kids have been born, the family life has focused around me and 
football. It's time that it focuses around them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to taking his turn in the family car pool, Elway  
will fill his days playing golf and exploring business 
opportunities -- possibly as a broadcaster or a minority owner with 
the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing, however, will be the same on Sunday afternoons.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll never be able fill the void of playing a football game,''  
Elway said. ``I'll never fill that. That will be the biggest part 
that I miss.''

<HEADLINE> Parental Supervision Cuts Risks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Parents who keep close tabs on their  
children's whereabouts and activities are less likely to produce 
kids involved in risky behavior, according to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers found that children living in Baltimore public  
housing who felt their parents set limits and talked with them 
about their concerns were far less likely to use alcohol and 
marijuana, sell drugs or have unprotected sex than their 
counterparts without parental intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	But the study, being presented today at the annual meeting of  
the Pediatric Academic Societies in San Francisco, also found that 
as the children grew older, the influence of their friends became 
even greater, even if parental monitoring stayed the same. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the University of Maryland researchers who led the study,  
Dr. Susan Feigelman said that there is nothing wrong with parents 
who monitor their children's friends. She noted the circumstances 
behind the Littleton, Colo., high school shooting tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The two teen-agers who killed themselves and 13 others were  
members of the Trenchcoat Mafia, a group of students who often 
dressed and acted in opposition to other students. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a theory that part of being a good parent is  
influencing the groups your kids hang out with,'' Feigelman said. 
``For Colorado, how do kids get into mafia behavior? Well, they're 
hanging out with the mafia to begin with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers surveyed 383 children, ages 9 to 15, periodically  
over a four-year period beginning in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The children were asked every six months for two years and then  
annually in the third and fourth years whether their parents knew 
where they were after school, if they were expected to call and say 
where they were going and with whom, if their parents knew where 
they were at night, if parents discussed those plans with the 
children and asked where they were going. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1 percent of the children who said they were highly  
monitored in this way sold drugs in the first six months of the 
study, compared to 10 percent of those who said they had little 
parental supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen months later, however, 5 percent of children who were  
closely monitored said they were dealing drugs, while the 
percentage of children who had far less supervision and were 
selling drugs rose only slightly, to 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar patterns emerged regarding drug and alcohol use and  
unprotected sex. Feigelman said peer groups became more important 
as the children got older.

	Clinton Meets Chernomyrdin on Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin emerged from  
a meeting with President Clinton today, saying the two ``got closer 
to a diplomatic solution'' to the Kosovo standoff. Chernomyrdin did 
not elaborate, except to say that he and the president discussed 
``the circumstances and the conditions'' under which NATO would 
pause its air assault on Yugoslavia. Clinton said earlier that ``we 
could have a bombing pause'' if Slobodan Milosevic accepts NATO's 
demands for the withdrawal of his troops, the return of refugees 
and the deployment of an international security force. The Rev. 
Jesse Jackson, who negotiated the release of three American POWs, 
had urged a break in the bombing in response.

<P>
	LANDSTUHL, Germany (AP) -- Upbeat and safe at a U.S. military  
hospital in Germany, three servicemen released by Yugoslavia were 
joyfully reunited with their families on their first full day of 
freedom today. Army doctors pronounced the soldiers in generally 
good shape, but checkups also revealed fractured ribs and a broken 
nose, raising questions about how they were treated during their 
capture and month in captivity. Each had a private reunion with 
family members who had arrived in Germany on overnight flights from 
the United States.

	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A man was arrested today on suspicion of  
supplying the semiautomatic pistol used in the Columbine High 
massacre. Mark Manes, 22, surrendered and was jailed on $15,000 
bail for investigation of providing a handgun to a minor. He could 
get six years in prison. Meanwhile, Columbine students returned to 
classes today at a nearby school. Banners welcoming Columbine's 
nearly 2,000 students adorned Chatfield High School. For the rest 
of the school year, Chatfield students will attend classes in the 
morning, while Columbine students will attend an afternoon session.

	Cause of Ark. Boat Accident Sought  
</P>
<P>
	HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- Investigators said today they will take  
underwater pictures of the boat that dragged 13 tourists to their 
deaths in hopes of learning how the accident happened. The World 
War II-vintage tourist boat had been in the repair shop two days 
before it sank in Lake Hamilton on Saturday, drowning 13 of its 21 
passengers. Investigators want to know if repair work done to the 
boat's drive-shaft was the cause of the accident, or if two other 
seals in the boat's hull were responsible. They say a videotape of 
the wreck on the lake bottom will help.

	U.N. Rules To Halt 'Cybersquatting'  
</P>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- A U.N. agency said today it has finished drawing  
up rules to halt the practice known as cybersquatting in time for 
the new Internet name-assigning body to adopt them this month. The 
rules try to address a wide range of concerns while protecting 
well-known trademarks for use as Web addresses, said Francis Gurry, 
assistant director-general of the World Intellectual Property 
Organization. The intent is to stop people from registering Web 
addresses involving company trademarks in hopes of getting the 
companies to pay to buy the rights to the address.

<HEADLINE> HMOs Pushing Hospital-Based Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Health maintenance organizations restored  
primary-care doctors to the focal point of medical care by making 
them responsible for coordinating all patient services. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, some of the nation's biggest HMOs have begun  
restricting the primary-care doctor's role at a crucial time: When 
the patient is in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past two years, HMOs have been hiring doctors called  
hospitalists, who work full time in hospitals coordinating care, 
replacing the role traditionally held by the patient's regular 
physician. 
</P>
<P>
	The HMOs say patients tend to get more attention from  
hospitalists because the doctors are not splitting their time 
between the hospital and an office. As a result, tests are 
scheduled faster and patients often go home sooner without care 
being compromised. 
</P>
<P>
	Shorter hospital stays also mean HMOs can save money, which some  
critics suspect is the real reason behind the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, the health plans offered the hospitalists as an  
option, and the reaction was mixed. But now that some plans such as 
Prudential Health Care and Humana have all but mandated the use of 
hospitalists, some doctors and consumer groups are outraged. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is incredible irony in this,'' said Ron Pollack,  
executive director of Families USA, a national consumer health 
group. ``HMOs have for the last few years talked about the virtue 
of having a primary-care physician who coordinates the care for a 
patient, and yet at a point when the patient most is in need of 
health care, they are withdrawing the central feature ... by the 
doctor who knows the patient best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A coalition of 24 medical groups, including the American College  
of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine, last month 
appealed to the HMO industry asking for an end to mandatory 
hospitalist programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a direct attack on our profession,'' said Dr. Cornel  
Lupu, a Miami internist and Prudential primary-care doctor. ``It's 
a horrible idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prudential started its hospitalist program in March in the South  
Florida and Tampa areas. Humana began implementing its program in 
1997 and it is now available in a dozen major markets, including 
Chicago, South Florida, Louisville, Ky., Kansas City, Mo., Las 
Vegas and San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	Cigna and some Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans proposed  
mandatory hospitalist programs in certain markets, but decided to 
keep them voluntary after primary-care doctors raised concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Humana spokesman Greg Donaldson said a study of the company's  
use of hospitalists in Kansas City found that they shortened some 
hospital stays by half, and increased the likelihood that patients 
were prescribed appropriate medications. 
</P>
<P>
	And about 85 percent of Humana's members nationally who had been  
cared for by a hospitalist said they would want the same 
hospital-based doctor if they were hospitalized again, the company 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Prudential nor Humana considers its hospitalist programs  
mandatory because doctors can continue caring for their own 
patients in the hospital if they meet certain criteria, such as 
keeping the patient in the hospital for a shorter-than-average 
period. Prudential says fewer than 20 percent of its Tampa and 
South Florida doctors meet the standard. A Humana official did not 
know what proportion of its doctors met the tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to improve efficiency in the hospital and  
improve quality, and as a result hopefully save some costs, said 
Dr. Kirk Cianciolo, Prudential's senior medical director for South 
Florida and Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	HMO industry experts say additional health plans will require  
the use of hospitalists because they reduce hospital stays. 
</P>
<P>
	``More and more plans are considering making it a mandatory  
program, '' said Brett Turner, a health care consultant with 
Hamilton-HMC, based in Minneapolis. ``It's a major trend, a much 
more efficient way to practice quality medicine,'' he said. ``But 
making the transition is a difficult process for some.''

<HEADLINE> Aetna Selling Plan For Uninsured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The 25 million working Americans who do not have  
health insurance may have a new option. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna Inc. is launching a no-frills health insurance program  
called Affordable HealthChoices that will be sold to employers who 
can't afford to offer a policy to their workers or have had to drop 
the insurance benefit because of higher premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna's new policy will cost as little as $46 per person, or  
$156 per family, per month. The employer can elect to pay all or 
part of the premium. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the new program has been approved state regulators in  
Texas, Connecticut and the District of Columbia. Aetna hopes to 
soon get approval in 25 other states. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Aetna's health maintenance organization, which has a  
prescription drug benefit and pays for most hospital and physician 
services, the new plan will only have minimal coverage. For 
instance, one new option would only offer hospital coverage of $500 
a day for the first three days and $200 days for the next four to 
10 days. Hospital bills typically can reach thousands of dollars 
even for short visits. 
</P>
<P>
	Giant health insurers such as Aetna have been criticized for  
charging expensive premiums, which has contributed to the number of 
uninsured rising from 38 million in 1992 to 43 million in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Workplaces must employ a minimum of two employees to be  
eligible. The new program will not be sold directly to individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna hopes employers which presently do not offer health  
insurance coverage will sign up. Still, one concern is some 
employers might drop the more extensive policy and fall back to the 
new less expensive option. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a very tight job market that is unlikely to happen,'' said  
Aetna spokeswoman Jill Griffiths. ``We think employers will want to 
offer the most comprehensive benefit package they can.''

<HEADLINE>  Reggie Lewis Lawsuit Goes to Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- When Celtics captain Reggie Lewis collapsed and  
died while practicing jump shots in 1993, he left a pregnant wife, 
thousands of fans and a star team of doctors wondering what went 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	In the years since, a battle of reputations has been waged  
between Lewis' family and some of the city's most prominent 
physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	They start fighting it out before a jury today.  
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' widow says the doctors who treated her husband in his  
last months misdiagnosed and mistreated a fatal heart condition. 
The doctors contend Lewis used cocaine and lied about it, making an 
accurate diagnosis impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	The malpractice suit pits Donna Harris-Lewis against Dr. Gilbert  
H. Mudge, who led the specialists, and Drs. Mark Creager and Peter 
Friedman, who were consultants. 
</P>
<P>
	A third consultant, Dr. John Rutherford, recently reached a  
settlement with Harris-Lewis, the terms of which have not been 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith imposed a gag order  
and none of the main players in the case would comment publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	But the story of Lewis' death and the finger-pointing that  
followed has played itself out very publicly in a city that loved 
its Celtics and adored the team's brightest star when he died at 
27. 
</P>
<P>
	It all began April 29, 1993, when Lewis collapsed during a  
playoff game against the Charlotte Hornets. A ``Dream Team'' of New 
England Baptist Hospital doctors assembled by the Celtics diagnosed 
him with arrhythmia, a potentially life-threatening, career-ending 
heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The grim conclusion led Lewis to seek a second opinion from one  
of Boston's most respected cardiologists, Dr. Mudge of Brigham and 
Women's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge reported that Lewis suffered from a neurological disorder  
that causes fainting spells. With proper treatment, he said, Lewis 
could return to professional basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months later, on July 27, Lewis died while shooting hoops  
in the off-season at Brandeis University in Waltham. 
</P>
<P>
	The state medical examiner listed the cause of death as  
adenovirus 2, a common virus that could have led to inflammation of 
the heart, widespread scarring of tissue and, ultimately, a fatal 
cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Autopsy consultants later said Lewis had ``athlete's heart'' -- a  
left ventricle that has become enlarged from pumping massive 
amounts of blood. Everyone who examined Lewis' body agreed there 
was no evidence of cocaine use, which could be an explanation for 
the scarring. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mudge later said that two weeks before Lewis died, the  
player admitting using cocaine in the past but said he had stopped. 
The lack of full disclosure early in the treatment process made it 
impossible to make a proper diagnosis, Mudge has claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis has vehemently denied her husband ever used  
cocaine. In the last several months, the two sides have sparred 
over the right to bring up the alleged drug use at trial. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 21, Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith ruled that jurors can  
hear the accusations -- if the doctors' lawyers can prove cocaine 
was a factor in misdiagnosing Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a person uses cocaine, it can cause structural damage to  
the heart,'' Fremont-Smith said. ``It does become relevant, in my 
mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis, who still lives in the Boston area with her son,  
7-year-old Reggie Jr., and daughter, 5-year-old Reggiena, has 
maintained she tried to get evidence of alleged drug use excluded 
because the charges only ``sensationalize and hide the true 
issue.'' And she has said she brought the lawsuit only to restore 
her husband's name. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is very important that our children understand what  
happened to their father,'' Harris-Lewis told the Boston Herald in 
a recent interview. ``I have waited for three years for this day to 
come, and I'm looking forward to the truth.''

<HEADLINE> Baltimore Embraces Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- They played Latin music over the public address  
system, served black beans and rice at Boog's Bar-B-Q Pit and even 
staged a Cuban festival behind the bullpen area. 
</P>
<P>
	There were also dozens of uniformed police positioned throughout  
the ballpark, just like in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baltimore Orioles did virtually everything possible to make  
the Cuban baseball team feel at home Monday night. The one thing no 
one could control, however, was the weather. 
</P>
<P>
	It was downright chilly at Camden Yards. Wet, too.  
</P>
<P>
	The rain subsided temporarily about 90 minutes before game time,  
but it was drizzling when Baltimore's Scott Kamieniecki threw the 
first pitch at 7:47 p.m. and the game was delayed by rain in the 
bottom of the first. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban players were excited to begin the first baseball game  
between a Cuban squad and a major league team held in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the dream of many Cubans to play baseball in a major  
league stadium,'' third baseman Omar Linares said. ``We are very 
happy and glad to be here. In this situation, everyone wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the Cubans wore warmup jackets as they jogged to the  
outfield for an abbreviated batting practice session. More than a 
few gazed into the seats and up into the stands; had they looked up 
to the roof, they would have seen members of a SWAT team poised 
with binoculars. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the stadium, hundreds of protesters staged a peaceful  
demonstration against the two-game series, which began March 28 in 
Cuba with the Orioles winning 3-2 in 11 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	That game was played under sunny skies. For the rematch, fans  
filled Camden Yards wearing coats in the uncharacteristic 60 degree 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the weather is very chilly but we will adapt after  
our practice,'' Linares said. 
</P>
<P>
	A fan by the name of Castro -- Henry, not Fidel -- came down from  
New Jersey to see the game. He's a U.S. citizen who sympathized 
with the guests of honor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not fair for the citizens of Cuba who have no freedoms at  
all. I'm here to support the Baltimore Orioles, they're an American 
team,'' he said. ``I'm looking at the expressions on the Cuban's 
faces. They're looking at a democratic country with freedom. I'm 
sure that's going through their minds right now: Should I stay or 
should I go?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A reporter asked Cuban manager Alfonso Urquiola before the game  
whether he was afraid one of his players might chase a ball into 
the Baltimore dugout and fail to return. All the players laughed at 
the suggestion, as did Urquiola. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not concerned about it. We will let the players play  
freely on the field,'' Urquiola said. ``We have no fear of that 
happening or else we wouldn't be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two men up from South Florida on their way to New York exited  
off I-95 to see the game. Although they were there to see a 
baseball game, they were well aware of the political ramifications 
of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game is both politics and baseball,'' one of them said.  
``It is a historic event. I don't have to agree with it, but it is 
history in the making.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one could argue the historical significance of the game. But  
was it about baseball or politics? 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel it's all about baseball,'' said Gene Tamayo, 33, a  
cable TV supervisor who is part Cuban. ``I think it's time for 
everybody to just come together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For baseball scouts, it was a chance to rate some talented  
players who might otherwise never have been noticed. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a pure baseball standpoint, anytime you have a chance to  
see players you don't normally see, it's a bonus. It gives you 
something to put in your library,'' said Bob Engle, a scout for the 
Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the current plight of the Orioles, who own the worst  
record in the American League, it might have been the last big game 
at Camden Yards this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a historical game and, being an archivist, I want  
to be a part of something historical,'' said Jenny Guilbaud, 41. 
``That's why I'm here. The political aspects, I'm not really 
touching on that. Life goes on.''

<HEADLINE>  Man Arrested In Colo. Shooting Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A 22-year-old man was arrested Monday on  
suspicion of supplying the Columbine High School gunmen with a 
semiautomatic handgun, one of four weapons used in their rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest came on the same day Columbine students returned to  
classes at another school, nearly two weeks after the massacre that 
left 15 dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Manes of Littleton was booked for investigation of  
providing a handgun to a minor, a charge that carries a maximum six 
years in prison. He was released on bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they do not know if Manes knew what the gun would be  
used for, but an attorney for Manes said his client knew nothing of 
the impending massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was horrified when it happened,'' attorney Robert Ransome  
said. ``I would like to say he has followed the path of integrity 
from the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manes, who once attended Columbine, was the first person since  
the April 20 shootings to be arrested on charges of helping Eric 
Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, arm themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other arrest in the case is that of a man accused of  
lying about the two teens having bought possible bomb supplies at a 
hardware store. Police are still trying to determine if others had 
a hand in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've always, from day one, had a feeling that there had to  
be some people who had some knowledge or helped them plan or build 
some of these bombs,'' Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman Steve 
Davis said. ``I think they're still leaning that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said an employee at the pizza parlor where Harris  
and Klebold worked put the two teen-agers in touch with Manes and a 
TEC DC-9 semiautomatic pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the last person who had it before it was supplied to  
one of our gunmen,'' said Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear which gunman obtained the weapon or  
when, Davis said, or whether it was sold, traded or given to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes' first court hearing was scheduled for May 10.  
</P>
<P>
	Columbine students returned to classes at Chatfield High School  
on Monday. But administrators decided it would be best if friends 
of Harris and Klebold were taught at home for the rest of the year. 
The parents agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Primarily, for their well-being, and because it's a very  
uncomfortable and difficult time for everyone involved,'' said Rick 
Kaufman, a spokesman for the school district. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaufman declined to say how many students were affected,  
although Davis put the number at eight to 10. He said he did not 
know whether they were associated with the gunmen's clique known as 
the Trenchcoat Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators also have banned trench coats at every school in  
Jefferson County, which has 89,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
	Students at Chatfield, which has a sports rivalry with  
Columbine, went out of their way to welcome the 1,900 Columbine 
students. The Chatfield students tacked up banners in hallways and 
outside the school and distributed ribbons that blended their 
school's burgundy with Columbine's navy blue. 
</P>
<P>
	They also handed out T-shirts that bore a ``C,'' with clasped  
hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can do anything to help them, we're happy to do it,''  
said Amber Mancuso, 17, a Chatfield junior. ``I think it's hit all 
of us hard, all of us have friends there. When we found out, 
probably half the school was crying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uniformed sheriff's deputies, police officers and five guards  
patrolled the school grounds, and students had to show 
identification before filing into Chatfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be nice to see the other kids and get back in  
the classroom, not necessarily to learn, but to see people and get 
back into the routine of things,'' said senior Nathan Montgomery, 
19. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Columbine students were apprehensive about returning to  
classes while their own school remained a massive crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really nervous about it,'' said sophomore Krysti DeHoff,  
16. ``I don't really want to go back because I keep feeling like 
something's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Klebold killed 12 schoolmates and a teacher before  
they killed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have said that Robyn Anderson, Klebold's girlfriend,  
purchased the other three weapons used, two rifles and a shotgun 
and has been interviewed as a witness. Under Colorado law, an 
18-year old without a felony record can furnish minors with rifles 
and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson has made no public comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Five of the 23 students who were wounded at Columbine remained  
hospitalized Monday, two in serious condition and three in fair 
condition.

<HEADLINE> Tragedy Alters Littleton Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The day the kids came running -- weeping  
and wailing and terrified -- Martin Steele was washing his van in 
the driveway. Melody Giebler was looking after someone else's 
children. Sandy Williams was giving a friend a manicure. And Ben 
Martin couldn't get to his home because the danger was too great. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon, the stream of young people running for their lives from  
Columbine High that bright warm midday on April 20 was followed by 
a flood of police cars and FBI agents and sheriff's deputies, of TV 
cameras and reporters and photographers, of ambulances and SWAT 
teams and anguished parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like I was living in another world,'' Mrs. Giebler  
said. ``Nothing ever happens over here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The murderous rampage at Columbine robbed her neighborhood of  
that claim, possibly forever. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine High sits on a wide boulevard next to Clement Park, a  
lush green haven of hills at a busy intersection south of Denver. 
Branching off the thoroughfares are tidy streets lined with cozy 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
	The police and the rescuers and the journalists are gone. Now  
it's the pilgrims who park on the byways. Every day, rain or shine, 
they trudge across the road to the park, often clutching bouquets 
to leave at the makeshift shrine where visitors have also placed 
condolence letters and teddy bears. 
</P>
<P>
	And some nights still, the chop-chop-chop of a helicopter  
shatters the dark peace. Could be police. Could be more TV people. 
</P>
<P>
	The day the kids came running, Mrs. Giebler, a 37-year-old  
daycare provider, threw open her front door to offer refuge and use 
of her telephone. Frantic teens needed to call home. Three boys 
were distraught, unable to locate their siblings at the school. 
Mrs. Giebler, who has a son, 10, and daughter, 7, said: ``I just 
thought, if these were my children, I'd want them to be able to 
call home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Mrs. Giebler herself, she said, ``I felt like I couldn't  
breathe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FBI in the backyard. Armed and helmeted SWAT teams tramping down  
the street out front. She counted four ambulances, an armored car 
and a long truck someone told her was where bombs were taken. 
</P>
<P>
	The family was rattled. Last week, her son was still vomiting,  
morning and night. ``I look over my shoulder a lot more,'' Mrs. 
Giebler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police told anxious parents to gather down the street at Leawood  
Elementary School. Youngsters who had escaped the massacre at 
Columbine could find their parents there. 
</P>
<P>
	Two young sisters raced to Sandy Williams' house. She was the  
lady who did their nails. She let them in and calmed them down. But 
she was stunned to see mothers and fathers milling in the street, 
dazed and anxious. Some wept. One man, unfamiliar with the 
cul-de-sacs and cross streets and demanding to be reunited with his 
daughter, got a lift from Miss Williams nearer to Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Williams trembled. She cried, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was like they were all in shock,'' Miss Williams said. ``I  
think that's what upset me the most,'' she said, thinking of her 
20-year-old daughter, and son, 15, who attends another high school. 
``To see them not know their kids were there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That night, Donna and Martin Steele, both 71, had planned to  
mark 48 happy years of marriage, 34 of those years spent in their 
ranch house on the road by the park. It was also Mrs. Steele's 
birthday. The day quickly dissolved into the unimaginable. 
</P>
<P>
	When Steele tried to offer help, authorities ordered him to get  
inside ``because you're in the line of fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly the home where they raised five children, where their  
15 grandchildren come to visit, would never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``You watch it all on television for a week, then you watch it  
in the backyard, and it gets you down,'' said Steele, a retired 
General Mills sales representative. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the couple find their home no longer what they thought it  
was. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Mrs. Steele: ``Walking alone in the park will be very  
difficult to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Martin's bedroom offers a view of the high school, from  
which he graduated in 1996. He is now studying graphic design and 
is a devotee of Mohandas Gandhi. On the day the kids came running, 
the 20-year-old was prevented by two teachers from going to his 
house, where the back yard butts up against Columbine High's 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just total shock,'' was his feeling that day. Now he is taking  
a petition door-to-door, hoping to persuade school authorities to 
hang pictures of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Gandhi in the 
schools. By the end of last week, he had collected 90 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want nonviolence,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Spot Possible Moon Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On Earth, the south pole may well be the worst  
place to live, but that region of the Moon could be the best choice 
for future bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Three sites, located near the Moon's south pole, provide nearly  
constant sunlight, the researchers report in the May 1 edition of 
Geophysical Research Letters. 
</P>
<P>
	Having nearly constant light means the bases could use solar  
energy, reducing or eliminating the need for other energy sources, 
according to the team lead by D. Ben J. Bussey of the European 
Space Agency in Noordwijk, Netherlands. They used data collected by 
the Clementine spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the energy potential of the sites in the sun,  
there are nearby sites that are in constant darkness, the 
researchers added. There is the possibility that water ice could be 
hidden in such locations, they reported. 
</P>
<P>
	While the location of any Moon base would depend to a great  
extent on the purpose of the base, the researchers found three 
strong candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Site A is on the rim of Shackleton crater, and B is about six  
miles away on a ridge originating from that rim. Site C is on the 
rim of another nearby crater. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Moon's 708-hour day, A is in sunlight 80 percent of  
the time, B is lighted 70 percent of the time and C about 65 
percent of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is only a period of 10 hours when neither A nor B are in  
sunlight,'' the researchers added. ``Therefore if solar arrays were 
placed in both areas and connected by a link (either microwave or 
cable) then a base at either site would receive near constant solar 
energy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The temperature at the suggested sites is relatively constant  
because of the steady light and was estimated at about -64 degrees 
Fahrenheit. Engineers say it is easier to deal with a constant 
extreme temperature than one that is changing regularly, as would 
happen elsewhere on the moon with the regular changes from daylight 
to darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Bussey the research team included Paul D. Spudis  
of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Texas, and Mark S. 
Robinson of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.

<HEADLINE> Army Whistleblower Returns To Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A safety manager fired for blowing the  
whistle on problems at an Army nerve gas incinerator is to return 
to work tomorrow, five years after his employer let him go for 
``poor management skills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Jones' return to the Tooele Chemical Agent Disposal  
Facility in Utah's western desert was ordered last month by a 
federal appeals court nearly two years after the Labor Department 
ruled that his firing was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said he was fired for refusing to certify that the  
incinerator was safe, delaying its startup by two years. EG&AMP;G 
Defense Materials Inc., the Army contractor destroying much of the 
nation's stockpile of nerve and mustard gas, insists Jones was 
fired for poor management skills after less than three months on 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is appealing the Labor Department ruling but was  
forced to take Jones back in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones flagged more than 1,000 design flaws and mechanical  
problems at the plant. Emissions from the plant have been within 
federal standards, but critics say the risks to humans are unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	EG&AMP;G spokesman Mark Mesesan said Monday the company will welcome  
Jones back even as it appeals his reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll treat him the same as we do any new or returning  
employee,'' Mesesan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones has collected $50,000 in damages from EG&AMP;G. He kept only  
$2,000 after paying his lawyers, who are owed a total of $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tooele plant is the first chemical weapons incinerator in  
the continental United States. It was built to destroy more than 27 
million pounds of chemical weapons held in earthen and concrete 
bunkers in the desert 50 miles west of Salt Lake City.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Treasurer Found Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The city's treasurer was convicted today of  
shaking down a brokerage firm for campaign donations and forcing 
her employees to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury found Miriam Santos guilty of attempted extortion  
for telling Fuji Securities to donate $10,000, saying on a taped 
conversation that it was ``time to belly up'' and ``this is no 
choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, she was acquitted of four other attempted extortion  
counts for allegedly trying to shake down other companies. Santos' 
attorney said she would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Santos, 43, faces a maximum 33 months in prison at sentencing in  
July. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Illinois State Law, any elected official found guilty of a  
felony is removed from office. The position is to be filled by an 
appointee of the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors accused Santos, a Democrat, of pressuring  
seven brokers who oversee the investment of $2.5 billion in city 
funds to donate thousands of dollars to her failed attorney general 
campaign last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The brokers said she threatened to stop doing business with them  
unless they paid up, and ordered them cut off when none donated. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors found her guilty of attempted extortion of only Fuji  
Securities, which had a tape recording of an angry conversation 
with Santos. Santos and her attorneys said her words on the tape 
may have had a rough edge, but were not a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Santos was also convicted of illegally directing employees to do  
campaign work, such as making phone calls to raise money for the 
campaign. Santos said she told workers it was illegal to do 
campaign work on city time but that a few overzealous volunteers 
stepped over the line.

	MIAMI (AP) -- Jose Canseco of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays is  
divorcing his wife of less than three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco, 34, and Jessica Marie, 26, have one child, Josie Marie,  
2 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	According to their prenuptial agreement, Jessica agreed to a  
lump sum of $100,000 in lieu of alimony, The Miami Herald reported 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco, who has been married twice, reportedly will give her an  
extra $100,000 for her promise to maintain a Florida residence 
until Josie turns 18. Jessica also wants child support. 
</P>
<P>
	He gets the 12,500-square-foot Weston home, on the market for  
$4.5 million. She gets the '97 BMW 740iL.

	In 1997, police arrested Canseco and charged him with  
misdemeanor battery after he allegedly smacked Jessica in the head. 
He was ordered to undergo battery counseling. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Foreign Auto Sales Rise in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Consumers can't seem to get enough new cars and  
trucks, pushing the auto industry's sales boom into its second 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the major automakers that reported April sales results  
Monday, total sales were up 7.5 percent. Ford Motor Co., 
DaimlerChrysler AG and Japan's three biggest automakers each 
reported gains over the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Monthly year-to-year sales comparisons have been up through the  
past 13 months except in July and August, when total sales were 
artificially depressed as two strikes against General Motors Corp. 
restricted its supply. 
</P>
<P>
	GM remained the only major automaker to report its sales today.  
Analysts expected it to report flat to slightly lower sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barring any surprises from GM ... it looks like another  
gangbuster month,'' said analyst David Healy of Burnham Securities 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The reasons for April's improvement were familiar: a robust  
economy and consumers confident enough about the future to take on 
the increased debt of a new car or truck. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy has the legs of a marathon runner,'' said Yale  
Gieszl, a vice president of Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. ``Consumers 
look at interest rates, inflation, Wall Street and the job market 
and have every reason to be confident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said its April sales were up 7 percent last month, compared  
with April 1998. Sales of light trucks set an April record -- the 
company's 12th straight monthly record for pickups, vans, minivans 
and sport utility vehicles combined. Car sales were up 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures do not include Ford's Volvo AB or Jaguar Cars units,  
each of which reported its U.S. sales rose 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said demand is so strong that it is again increasing its  
second-quarter production schedule, this time by 20,000 additional 
vehicles. With last month's 30,000 increase, Ford now plans to 
build just over 1.26 million cars and trucks during the April-June 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a somewhat unusual month at DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler  
unit, in that its biggest improvement came in car sales. Total 
sales improved 2 percent; cars were up 6 percent while truck sales 
were flat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chrysler unit sells more than twice as many light trucks as  
cars. But its minivan sales fell 19 percent just as the spring 
buying season was heating up, and pickup sales were flat. Healy 
said April's minivan performance was the ``hangover'' of 
incentive-driven sales in March that depleted inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Jameson, vice president of sales and marketing, said truck  
sales also suffered from a tough comparison to April 1998 when 
sales were boosted by a coupon war launched by GM. 
</P>
<P>
	The German-American automaker posted an 18 percent gain in sales  
of highly profitable SUVs. In fact, SUV sales at the former 
Chrysler Corp. have set monthly records in 17 of the last 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota Motor Corp. posted its best April ever in the United  
States, with sales up nearly 10 percent. Its 7 percent rise in car 
sales was led once again by the Camry, the nation's bestseller, 
with sales up 21 percent for its best April ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest Japanese automaker also was boosted by a 13.5  
percent rise in truck sales: the hot-selling Lexus RX300 SUV was up 
78 percent, while; the Sienna minivan had its best month ever with 
a 25 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda Motor Co. also benefited from improved truck sales, up 53  
percent. Overall sales improved 4 percent, dragged down by a 3 
percent decline in car sales. Honda's new Odyssey minivan posted a 
211 percent gain, while sales of the CR-V compact SUV improved 41 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Honda's top-seller, the Accord sedan, were flat while  
sales of the Civic subcompact were off 7 percent. But buyers 
flocked to the Acura TL luxury sedan, whose sales nearly doubled. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan Motor Co. had its biggest improvement in months: total  
sales were up 21 percent, led by a 26 percent gain in trucks. Its 
redesigned Quest minivan, for example, nearly doubled sales over 
April 1998. Car sales were up nearly 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Volkswagen AG said it has its best April in the United States in  
19 years, with sales up 29.5 percent on the strength of a new 
product lineup. Its redesigned Jetta sedan led the sales drive, 
with its best single month since the original version was 
introduced in 1980.

<HEADLINE>  Vladimir Guerrero Leads in Errors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Vladimir Guerrero was known for a hot bat when  
he joined the Montreal Expos two years ago. These days, his glove 
draws attention. 
</P>
<P>
	After just one month, he leads the major leagues in errors, with  
nine -- an astonishing number for an outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried or too concerned,'' he said. ``But I want to  
be sure this doesn't become a problem or a habit because some of 
the errors that I've made have been routine plays where I tried to 
be too aggressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who knows, maybe it's in the genes? His brother, Wilton, the  
Expos' second baseman, is tied for second in the majors in errors 
with seven. 
</P>
<P>
	No outfielder has reached 20 in one season since Bob Johnson of  
the 1935 Philadelphia Athletics. The post-World War II high in 19, 
by Lou Brock (1966) and Chili Davis (1988). 
</P>
<P>
	Outfielders have reached double figures just 12 times in the  
'90s. Before Guerrero made 17 last year, the highest total had been 
13 by Sammy Sosa ('90 and '95). 
</P>
<P>
	Even before an error against St. Louis on Friday night, Guerrero  
became the first outfielder with eight in one month since George 
Bell in July 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm only concerned about what's happened, I'm not concerned  
about what could happen,'' Expos manager Felipe Alou said. ``I know 
he's not that bad. Whether he's careless or lacks concentration for 
any reason right now, that's something else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	E-9 has popped up next to Guerrero's name two more times than W  
has popped up next to Montreal in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after his latest error, Guerrero worked out with Montreal  
coaches Pete Mackanin and Gene Glynn before batting practice, 
forming a pile of balls along the outfield wall after fielding and 
catching one ball after another from a ball-throwing machine. 
</P>
<P>
	``He asked to go out there,'' Alou said. ``He works out as hard  
as anybody we've had here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While two of his errors this season were on throws, 30 of  
Guerrero's 38 errors since the start of the 1997 season have been 
fielding mistakes, a staggering amount for an outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
	His ninth error this season came on a drive by St. Louis'  
Placido Polanco. Guerrero misjudged the ball off the bat, turning 
to his right as the ball sliced away from him toward the 
right-field corner. He was forced to turn around completely and 
change directions, and the ball popped out of his glove. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think he's a little confused,'' Mackanin said. ``Right  
now, after having watched him play last year and this year, you 
would have to call him a below-average outfielder based on the 
amount of errors he's made. However, the potential is there to be a 
Gold Glove winner and that's what we're trying to get out of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Dominican hit a team-record 38 homers, drove in  
109 runs and batted .324 in 1998, his second major league season. 
He was hitting .281 with four homers and 19 RBIs going into Monday 
night's game against Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure before it's said and done he's going to be one of the  
best out there,'' said the Cardinals' Willie McGee, a three-time 
Gold Glove. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's young, he's going to make errors. He's got a tremendous  
amount of ability that he's trying to hone offensively, defensively 
and everywhere. Very seldom do you see a young man with that much 
ability come up and have everything tight, as fast as he rose. 
He'll put in his time out there and get himself tight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Basically, McGee views all Guerrero's errors as growing pains.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure they're not panicking over there,'' McGee said. ``I  
wouldn't if I had a player that talented. When the time comes, you 
work on it. That's it. That guy, to me, he's going to be one of the 
best players in this game. He's already there and it's scary.''

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Actions Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Supreme Court took the following actions Monday:  
</P>
<P>
	--Made it easier for U.S. officials to deport some illegal aliens  
whose lives or freedom would be threatened in their home country. 
The unanimous ruling limited federal courts' power to second-guess 
immigration officials who decide such aliens should be deported 
because they committed ``serious nonpolitical crimes'' outside the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allowed newspaper dealers to sue the Pulitzer Publishing Co.  
over how it distributes the St. Louis Post-Dispatch to such dealers 
for retail sale. The company is accused of discriminating by 
selling the papers to some dealers at higher prices than it charges 
other dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ruled in a bankruptcy case that unsecured creditors can bar  
shareholders from putting up new money to retain ownership of an 
insolvent firm that is being reorganized if no one else was given a 
chance to come up with an alternative plan. 
</P>
<P>
	--Agreed to decide, in a California case, whether criminal  
defense lawyers have a duty to file an appeal after their clients 
plead guilty. A lower court threw out a man's second-degree murder 
conviction on grounds his public-defender lawyer violated his 
constitutional right to adequate legal representation by failing to 
file an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ruled in an Arizona case that federal courts, not Indian tribal  
courts, get to decide whether a federal law places limits on claims 
that nuclear industry activities caused harm on Indian land. The 
case involves the 1988 Price-Anderson Act, which limits the 
liability of companies involved in the nuclear industry.

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Volvo Buyers' Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by  
a group of auto purchasers in Puerto Rico who won, and then lost, a 
$129 million award against Volvo. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, turned away the purchasers' attempt  
to revive their accusations that Volvo illegally schemed to 
overcharge them. 
</P>
<P>
	About 9,000 individuals and corporations who bought Volvos in  
Puerto Rico between 1983 and 1993 sued the car manufacturer and the 
local companies that imported and sold the cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants were accused under the federal  
Racketeer-Influenced Corrupt Organizations law of conspiring to 
overcharge customers by using a company in Liechtenstein to inflate 
the prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The local importer and dealership defaulted, and the lawsuit  
against Volvo went to trial in federal court in San Juan. The jury 
ruled against Volvo and awarded $43 million in damages, an amount 
tripled by the judge to $129 million under the RICO law. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the judgment  
last July, ruling that there was no proof Volvo was involved in the 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, the auto purchasers' lawyers said  
the 1st Circuit court should be ordered to reconsider the case in 
light of a 1997 Supreme Court decision. 
</P>
<P>
	That ruling said defendants can be convicted of racketeering  
conspiracy without proof that they agreed to commit the two acts 
required for a conviction of an actual racketeering offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo's lawyers said that decision was irrelevant because the  
appeals court ruled there was no evidence that Volvo was involved 
in any fraudulent activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Bonilla vs. Volvo, 98-1425.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Worry Japanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Economic paranoia is on the loose in Japan, summed  
up in the plot of a recent made-for-TV movie: 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. bank calls in its loans to several thousand  
recession-wracked Japanese small businesses. That sends them belly 
up and clears the way for the Americans' ultimate plan -- the 
dismantling of Japan Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	As Japan struggles to get out from under its worst recession in  
a half century, a slew of books, TV dramas and articles are 
declaring that Japan is on the verge of ``economic occupation'' at 
the hands of foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The backlash is ironic. In the 1980s, Japan's high-flying  
investors were the focus of popular anger in the United States over 
mammoth real estate purchases and corporate takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic analysts say today's fears among Japanese are  
unfounded, but the emotions are real. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are surprised and uneasy about the sudden surge of  
takeovers by foreign companies,'' said Seiichi Tsurumi, a senior 
analyst of domestic affairs at the Japan Institute for Social and 
Economic Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they think of foreign firms, they think layoffs,'' he  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say that isn't exactly fair. The influx of foreign  
capital may actually be helping keep Japanese companies afloat and 
workers employed. 
</P>
<P>
	But the profile of foreign companies has been increasingly high.  
</P>
<P>
	Formerly unfamiliar corporate names like General Electric,  
Goodyear Tire and Merrill Lynch have moved to acquire operations 
once run by Japanese blue chips such as Japan Leasing Corp., 
Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. and Yamaichi Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Nissan Motor Co. -- a name that literally means ``Made in  
Japan'' -- has sold off a 37 percent stake in itself to the French 
automaker Renault. 
</P>
<P>
	Media reaction has been intense, even panicky.  
</P>
<P>
	Tabloids carry articles about foreign machinations to ``Buy  
Japan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One respectable weekly magazine featured horror stories about  
Japanese workers toiling under American-style capitalism's harsh 
corporate management practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Another ran a story about foreign firms' ``occupation'' of key  
office space in crowded downtown Tokyo. That term is especially 
sensitive in Japan, which was occupied by American troops for seven 
years after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all the fuss, the business community is hardly being  
overrun by foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as 1996, Japan's trade ministry found that  
affiliates of overseas companies accounted for just 1.3 percent of 
total sales in Japan and 0.5 percent of overall employment. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, many Japanese workers worry that foreign influence will  
break down the old paternalistic relations between labor and 
management. 
</P>
<P>
	But that already has been happening, and not necessarily because  
of outside investors. Japanese companies are increasingly dumping 
traditional perks like lifetime employment and seniority-based 
promotion to cut costs to cope with falling profits. 
</P>
<P>
	For some workers, that trend makes foreign companies not a  
menace, but an opportunity. Thus the flip side of the media 
tempest. 
</P>
<P>
	Next to the books warning about economic occupiers, books on how  
to succeed by working for foreign companies have started cropping 
up on shelves at bookstores in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them, written by the former head of Coors Brewing Co.'s  
unit in Japan, translates roughly as ``So You Want to Work for a 
Foreign Company?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The target audience appears to be younger Japanese, who have  
been among the hardest hit groups by skyrocketing unemployment. 
They also tend to be more open-minded than their elders when it 
comes to foreign bosses. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiyoshige Mizuno, a graduate of Tokyo's prestigious Sophia  
University, never dreamed of working for a non-Japanese firm until 
his employer, Japan Leasing, failed in the biggest corporate 
collapse in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Now GE Capital Corp. owns most of Japan Leasing and the  
37-year-old Mizuno has quit to work for the newly established 
Japanese unit of Hudson Advisors LLC, a Dallas-based firm that 
liquidates real estate assets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can no longer rely on the Japanese way of doing things,''  
Mizuno said. ``We must survive in the global system.''

<HEADLINE> Limited Spinning Off Girls Chain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Limited Inc. plans to spin off its very  
successful Limited Too girls clothing chain this summer and sell 
its majority interest in its Galyan's Trading Co. sporting goods 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The news came Monday as the Columbus, Ohio-based retailer  
reported that it expects its first- and second-quarter earnings to 
top Wall Street analysts' estimates. The retailer also announced 
that it will buy back up to 15 million shares of its common stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong earnings forecast, which came after financial markets  
closed, is the latest evidence that the Limited is on the road to 
recovery after an aggressive restructuring effort has helped get 
the struggling retailing giant back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what we've been waiting for at the Limited,'' said  
Maura Hunter Byrne, a retail analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	The company lost customers in the mid-1990s to other merchants  
who offered more casual, classic clothes and lower prices. But the 
Limited has worked hard to win back shoppers by improving its 
fashion offerings and coming up with fresh retailing concepts -- 
like Limited Too and Bath &AMP; Body Works. 
</P>
<P>
	In Monday's announcement, the Limited said it expects  
first-quarter earnings per share of 14 cents, a 56 percent gain 
from 9 cents a year ago and above the 10 cents expected by 
analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	The company attributed the gains to strength at its Limited Too  
stores, its Express and Lerner New York chains, which cater to 
young women looking for trendy styles; its large-size Lane Bryant 
stores; and its Intimate Brands division, which includes Victoria's 
Secret and Bath &AMP; Body Works stores. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the earnings news, the Limited announced its  
plans to spin off Limited Too to shareholders in late July or 
August 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected such a move, given the 319-store chain's  
great success in recent years. Sales have grown from $259 million 
in 1996 to $377 million in 1998, and its profits have significantly 
improved. 
</P>
<P>
	Geared for girls ages 7 to 14, Limited Too stores are filled  
with trendy merchandise, such as nail polish in outrageous colors, 
funky accessories and hip clothing styles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Limited Too spinoff follows a similar move by the Limited  
last year with Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, the casual apparel retailer 
aimed at teens and young adults. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it allows (Limited Too) to pursue their growth  
initiatives unhindered by us,'' said Tom Katzenmeyer, vice 
president of investor relations at the Limited. He added that the 
plans for the Limited Too include a catalog and a Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The Limited also announced that it will sell its majority stake  
in Galyan's to the investment firm of Freeman Spogli &AMP; Co. The 
deal, which is expected to close this summer, will leave the 
Limited with a 40 percent stake in the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Limited expects to receive about $190 million from sale of  
Gaylan's, which operates 16 stores and had revenues of $220 million 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the stock buyback, Limited shareholders can sell a portion  
or all of their shares to the company at a price no less than $50 a 
share and no more than $55 a share. The buyback will commence on 
May 4 and continue until June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading before the announcement, the Limited's stock rose 87 1/2  
cents to $44.62 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Appeal From Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to kill a  
lawsuit against a newspaper company accused of illegal 
discrimination because it allegedly sells papers at varying prices 
to independent contractors for resale in different service areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal by the  
Pulitzer Publishing Co., which is being sued for how it distributes 
the St. Louis Post-Dispatch to ``branch dealers'' for sale in 
vending machines and at retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen of the 37 branch dealers who sell the Post-Dispatch  
sued Pulitzer Publishing, saying they are forced to pay higher 
prices than other branch dealers for the papers they buy in bulk 
each day from the company's Missouri plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleges violations of the federal Robinson-Patman  
Act, which bans a seller's price discrimination if it affects 
interstate commerce and injures competition among the seller's 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the branch dealers who sued operate in Illinois; the  
rest in Missouri. According to the newspaper's lawyers, the dealers 
operate within clearly defined service areas and do not compete 
against each other. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dealers said they do compete against each other via the  
2,000 vending machines they stock with newspapers each day. ``All 
of the 2.5 million residents of the greater St. Louis metropolitan 
area are potential customers of each branch dealer,'' they told the 
justices. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge threw out the lawsuit, ruling that she lacked  
jurisdiction because the 17 dealers failed to prove any competitive 
relationship between them and others who allegedly were offered the 
different prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the lawsuit  
last December, ruling that the dealers do not need to prove any 
such competition to give the judge the authority to hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be that the (dealers) will be unable to prove any  
competitive relationship, and consequently no competitive harm,'' 
the appeals court said. ``Those shortcomings of proof, however, do 
not deprive the district court of jurisdiction -- that is its power 
-- to hear the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Pulitzer Publishing Co. vs. Godfrey, 98-1382.

<HEADLINE>  Not Just Kids Buying Star Wars Toys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a galaxy located somewhere between reason  
and insanity, 30-year-old construction worker Gil Juarez was 
spending $100 for a one-way ticket back to childhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can buy whatever you want right now,'' Juarez observed of  
the benefits of adulthood, as he shopped for ``Star Wars'' action 
figures, models and children's underwear at a Toys R Us in Los 
Feliz, just outside downtown Los Angeles. ``It used to be you had 
to ask your parents. Now it's just your wife saying, 'No, no, no.' 
And since I have the money, I say, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars'' fans, collectors, shop-a-holics and others just  
feeling frisky from the Force invaded toy stores Monday just after 
the stroke of midnight. The mission for these Storm Troopers armed 
with Visa cards was to become the first in the solar system to buy 
merchandise from the upcoming ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom 
Menace,'' which doesn't reach theaters until May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a trip to the dark side, literally: Lines started forming  
Sunday evening in places like Lawrenceville, N.J., and Brookfield, 
Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	And when the Earth's single sun rose, another wave returned to  
reap the most popular bounty, including 12-inch Darth Maul villains 
and Jar Jar Binks space creatures, or a Jabba the Hutt that barfs 
green play gel (``Not a food item,'' the box warns.) 
</P>
<P>
	Fans had been waiting for months to activate the little Darth  
Maul's light saber swinging action, or to repeatedly press the 
saddlebag of the nimble steed-like kaadu for realistic running 
action, or to just cover their bodies in ``Star Wars'' lotion. 
</P>
<P>
	But the emperor forbade it.  
</P>
<P>
	George Lucas, the director, creator and owner of all things  
``Star Wars,'' secured strict licensing deals that prevented toy 
maker Hasbro from releasing virtually any information about its 
Chinese-made products until the determined hour (though the 
Internet rebels had pictures of the stuff posted on their 
unofficial Web sites for months.) 
</P>
<P>
	Then, just after midnight, ``Man, did it go!'' said Mark  
Breller, the sales floor manager at the Lawrenceville, N.J., Toys R 
Us. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene was ... well, let him describe it.  
</P>
<P>
	``One of the managers brought a video camera in to tape it, and  
there were all these people with their shopping carts, and as soon 
as the doors opened, they started running,'' he said. ``People were 
grabbing the action figures off the shelves as fast as they could, 
filling entire shopping carts with them. One guy bought 100 of the 
battle droids. He said he was going to set up a battle scene.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a Wal-Mart in Tulsa, Okla., one collector went so far as to  
offer store employees $1,000 for a Star Wars promotional sign. At 
the Boise Toys R Us, shoppers purchased the equivalent of a 40-foot 
semi-truck of movie toys. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pure madness,'' said Erik Henriksen, a 19-year-old  
college student. ``There was so much pure desire for this stuff we 
were terrified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And who were these people, acting like this was the second  
coming of Tickle Me Elmo? 
</P>
<P>
	Some, to be sure, were collectors, acquiring Jar Jars for a  
rainy day, diversifying a college fund that may be a little heavy 
on Beanie Babies. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to get it off the shelf at the retail price,''  
explained Ron Reusch, owner of The Toy in Milwaukee, on speculators 
buying in bulk to resell at higher prices on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The least expensive toy available Monday was the Star Wars Spin  
Pop at $5.99. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even 24 hours after the merchandise launch, some fans were  
already trying to sell their new buys on the Internet. Amazon.com 
listed more than 15 new ``Star Wars'' items in its auction area on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the offerings was a set of 21 action figures and the  
related computer gear that makes them talk, with the bidding 
beginning at $350. 
</P>
<P>
	But mostly the buyers were just folks, albeit slightly more in  
love with ``Star Wars'' than most. 
</P>
<P>
	Supplies of most goods seemed to be holding up Monday despite  
the demand, but Louis Lecca wasn't taking any chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Lecca, 26, a music producer from Los Angeles, waited four hours  
in line before Los Feliz Toys R Us opened. He cooked up a plan to 
make sure he got what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of rushing for the ``Star Wars'' section like everybody  
else, he went a few aisles over and shouted, ``They're opening new 
boxes in the back!'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the mob went to the back, where there were no new boxes, he  
had his pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a while it does start to get ridiculous,'' he said. ``I  
won't buy everything, but all of those people who say it's childish 
to spend so much money on these, I say just go see the movie, and 
you'll understand.''

were terrified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And who were these people, acting like this was the second  
coming of Tickle Me Elmo? 
</P>
<P>
	Some, to be sure, were collectors, acquiring Jar Jars for a  
rainy day, diversifying a college fund that may be a little heavy 
on Beanie Babies. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to get it off the shelf at the retail price,''  
explained Ron Reusch, owner of The Toy in Milwaukee, on speculators 
buying in bulk to resell at higher prices on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The least expensive toy available Monday was the Star Wars Spin  
Pop at $5.99. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even 24 hours after the merchandise launch, some fans were  
already trying to sell their new buys on the Internet. Amazon.com 
listed more than 15 new ``Star Wars'' items in its auction area on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the offerings was a set of 21 action figures and the  
related computer gear that makes them talk, with the bidding 
beginning at $350. 
</P>
<P>
	But mostly the buyers were just folks, albeit slightly more in  
love with ``Star Wars'' than most. 
</P>
<P>
	Supplies of most goods seemed to be holding up Monday despite  
the demand, but Louis Lecca wasn't taking any chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Lecca, 26, a music producer from Los Angeles, waited four hours  
in line before Los Feliz Toys R Us opened. He cooked up a plan to 
make sure he got what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of rushing for the ``Star Wars'' section like everybody  
else, he went a few aisles over and shouted, ``They're opening new 
boxes in the back!'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the mob went to the back, where there were no new boxes, he  
had his pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a while it does start to get ridiculous,'' he said. ``I  
won't buy everything, but all of those people who say it's childish 
to spend so much money on these, I say just go see the movie, and 
you'll understand.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	AHMAT, Albania (AP) -- Sami Kraja peered through binoculars at  
two men standing on a distant ridge, the one marking Albania's 
border with Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``There, you see?'' he said, pointing at the spot from where  
mortar fire descended on this mountain village early Sunday. The 
men were Serb fighters, and Kraja, a local Albanian policeman, 
insisted they were responsible for shelling the village the 
previous two nights. 
</P>
<P>
	No one in this tiny hamlet of rock-walled homes and tree-limb  
fences was injured, but craters marked the nearby fields. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serb attacks have evoked fear and anger, causing many  
villagers to flee the border area while questioning why the 
Albanian government won't let them fight back. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have two choices -- to fight or to leave. But the government  
won't let us fight, so we must leave,'' said Bashkim Ahmati, riding 
on a small tractor hauling a wagonload of blankets, mattresses, 
clothes and other possessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb shelling and minor attacks have increased along the stretch  
of border between Albania and Kosovo, from the Morini crossing near 
Kukes to the Bajram Curri area further north. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has training bases and supply  
routes into Kosovo, and has been fighting Yugoslav and Serb forces 
inside Kosovo for control of the border area. 
</P>
<P>
	Closer to Kukes, in the mountains above the town of Kruma, Serb  
shelling and gunfire on the villages below would normally provoke a 
military response from Albania, said Kraja, who carries an 
automatic rifle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have firepower, but we are ordered to not reply, because  
all of this is political by the Serbs,'' he said, standing outside 
a home in the village of Ahmat. ``They want to spread the 
conflict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A crater in a small garden in back of the house contained  
fragments of a mortar round. Red roof tiles along the edge were 
damaged or missing, and several windows were broken. 
</P>
<P>
	Xhelil Ahmati, an elderly villager wearing a white cone-shaped  
hat common in rural Albania, said the house belonged to his 
brother, who had fled a few days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	An Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe worker  
said, on condition of anonymity, that Serb forces had increased 
border attacks in recent days, including firing a round that 
damaged an OSCE vehicle on Saturday in another village. 
</P>
<P>
	The worker also said the Serbs fired anti-tank missiles Friday  
at the Albanian border office at Qaf e Prushit, a closed border 
crossing above Kruma, setting the building on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Kraja said most of Ahmat's 1,800 residents and the 2,000 Kosovo  
refugees staying with them had fled in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have 13 refugees in my house,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Snagger Shares His Secrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just call him the baseball kid.  
</P>
<P>
	Home runs, pop-ups, line drives, fungoes, foul tips and the  
occasional pepper throw -- Zack Hample has caught them all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd watch the games on TV and see fans catch balls. The camera  
would focus on them, they'd hold up the ball, dance around and 
everybody would cheer. The first time I saw it happen at a game, I 
was hooked. I wanted a ball,'' Hample said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now -- more than 1,200 baseballs and 18 stadiums later -- the king  
of snagging balls hit or thrown by the pros is sharing his secrets 
in ``How to Snag Major League Baseballs,'' (Aladdin Paperbacks, 
$3.99, 140 pages). 
</P>
<P>
	There's the obvious: Bring a glove and sit in a section where  
you know a player regularly whacks the ball. ``You're more likely 
to get hit by lightning than catching a home run ball,'' says the 
21-year-old Manhattan native who goes to Guilford College in 
Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are other surefire ways to get a game ball, he writes.  
The book -- one part biography and two parts tips with a splash of 
trivia -- takes readers on a step-by-step guide of how to leave a 
stadium with a baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	The process begins with when to arrive at a ballpark, how to get  
a player to throw a ball your way, how to sneak into better seats 
and where to sit to catch game balls. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also a section on baseball-catching ethics: Don't try to  
catch a ball meant for another fan during batting practice, don't 
steal a game ball out of somebody's glove, and always say thank 
you. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know this works because I have more than 1,200 balls,'' said  
Hample, who started writing the book two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Stuart Hample, an author of children's books, admits  
he enabled his son's baseball fever by letting him go to so many 
games. But he says he's thankful his son put his energy into 
something he enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that he took all this passion and put it into  
something and then was able to put it in a book is marvelous,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Hample began collecting balls in 1990 during a New  
York Mets game. Over time, he picked up tricks of his trade: Take 
both teams' hats to the game and learn different languages. 
</P>
<P>
	He caught his 1,000th ball in June 1996 at Shea Stadium. Then  
Atlanta Braves pitcher Pedro Borbon Jr. was heading to the bullpen 
when Hample asked him in Spanish: ``Dame la bola, por favor?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because he was wearing a Braves cap, Borbon threw him the ball.  
</P>
<P>
	Hample admits he goes to extremes for his ball-catching  
obsession -- jumping railings, seats and, sometimes, people. He's 
been scraped, cut, bruised and whacked in pursuit of baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ball lasts forever, the injury goes away,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hample has every ball he's ever caught. All are documented and  
filed away -- literally. Most are stored in a four-drawer filing 
cabinet in his bedroom in his family's Manhattan apartment. The 
rest are stored in a plastic tub. 
</P>
<P>
	``Space has been a problem. But I'll sleep on them if I have  
to,'' he said. ``I'm not going to get rid of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's had plenty of offers though. For the very first ball he  
caught, he was offered $50. He turned the guy down, saying he 
wouldn't sell it for $500. 
</P>
<P>
	He's got a Mark McGwire ball thrown to him by the slugger, then  
a member of the Oakland Athletics, and he caught New York Yankee 
Mike Stanley's first home run of the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Heffner of Leland's Auction House in New York says some of  
Hample's collection is probably worth big money. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people out there who have spent millions of dollars  
on baseball collectibles,'' he said. ``If he's got more than 1,200 
balls, he's probably got something ... a collector would pay big 
money for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for Hample, it's about catching balls.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I wanted to see a game, I would watch it on TV and have a  
better view,'' he said. ``I go to the game to catch baseballs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's looking to catch a World Series ball and at least one  
ball in every major league stadium.

<HEADLINE> Forest, Brush Fires Hit Northeast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BASS RIVER TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) -- Light rain today helped  
extinguish hot spots remaining from a weekend forest fire that 
charred more than 11,000 acres of southern New Jersey's Pine 
Barrens. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller fires burned brush and forest during the weekend  
elsewhere in the Northeast, including Vermont, Maine, New 
Hampshire, Connecticut and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pine Barrens fire started Friday and was quickly spread by  
30 mph wind. 
</P>
<P>
	About two dozen people were evacuated from two campgrounds, but  
the camps reopened Saturday. No injuries were reported and the fire 
was declared under control Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, the southern third of Shenandoah National Park in  
Virginia was closed to hikers and motorists today and campers were 
evacuated because a 1,000-acre forest fire. Park officials didn't 
know how many people were affected. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shenandoah fire started Saturday when wind carried an ember  
from a planned burn that was set to regenerate a declining species 
of pine that needs fire to reproduce, park officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In upstate New York, fire crews were back at work today on a  
300-acre forest fire in rugged terrain near Rotterdam, about 15 
miles northwest of Albany. It briefly burned to with 100 feet of 
several houses. 
</P>
<P>
	New York had its second driest April on record, according to the  
National Weather Service. The state Department of Environmental 
Conservation rescinded all open fire permits last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 75 people were evacuated from their homes Sunday at  
Bellport, N.Y., about 75 miles east of New York City on Long 
Island, because of thick smoke from a 100-acre forest fire. The 
smoke also shut down part of a nearby highway and a branch of the 
Long Island Rail Road.

<HEADLINE> St. Louis in Command Despite Tie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The St. Louis-Phoenix first-round series is even.  
That's not to say it's equal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues are clearly in command going into Game 7 on Tuesday  
night, their power play so dominant the Coyotes have developed a 
siege mentality. And their speed tips the balance time after time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues have outshot Phoenix 196-147, making up in volume what  
they lacked in efficiency while losing three straight games by 
one-goal margins. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coyotes, on the other hand, are on the verge of blowing a  
3-1 first-round lead for the third time in a decade, and worried 
about losing their coach if they do. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Blues' 5-3 victory Sunday in St. Louis, coach Jim  
Schoenfeld confirmed that his job is on the line if the Coyotes, 
who haven't advanced past the second round since 1987, make another 
early playoff exit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coyotes had a 2-1 lead on Detroit last year, Schoenfeld's  
first with the team, before the Red Wings won the next three. The 
former Winnipeg Jets also led Edmonton 3-1 in 1990 and Vancouver 
3-1 in 1992, but lost each series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather be going in having won two than losing two,'' St.  
Louis defenseman Al MacInnis said. ``Momentum is a funny thing, but 
we have it now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Coyote Jeff Finley said the Coyotes have reason to be on  
edge. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've had two chances to close it out and haven't been able  
to do it,'' he said. ``They've had leads in both games. Right from 
the start they've been saying how their franchise hasn't gotten 
past the first round, and they've put a little bit of pressure on 
themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MacInnis has two of St. Louis' nine power-play goals -- a  
playoff-series record by a Coyotes opponent -- and is the key on 
special teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Finley, another defenseman, was with Phoenix in 1997, when the  
Coyotes had a 3-2 lead on Anaheim but couldn't finish the Mighty 
Ducks. He represents a new factor -- the Blues' improvement 
throughout the series. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Coyotes won Game 3 by a 5-4 score despite being  
outshot 38-18, St. Louis coach Joel Quenneville began emphasizing 
the need to cash in on rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Finley, who had never scored a playoff goal, had two shots  
before he broke a 3-3 tie 8:59 into the third period. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to get the rebounds, and we think that's going to be  
the difference in the series,'' said Craig Conroy, another tardy 
contributor who scored his first two goals Sunday. ``We've learned 
what we have to do, and we have to keep doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis is in its 20th consecutive postseason and swept  
Anaheim last year to advance for the second time in three years. In 
1991, the Blues overcame a 3-1 deficit to eliminate Detroit in the 
first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Coyotes forward Dallas Drake acknowledged the Blues' tenacity,  
but defended Schoenfeld's guarantee of a job-saving victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm right behind him on that one,'' Drake said. ``I think we  
have the team to do it, and I think everybody will step it up a bit 
and we'll get the job done and get this Winnipeg jinx, or whatever 
the media's calling it, off our backs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't ever want to hear it again.''  
</P>
<P>
	Team captain Keith Tkachuk, who had 36 goals in the regular  
season but just one this series, also believes the Coyotes will 
snap out of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pressure is on to win; that's the bottom line,'' Tkachuk  
said. ``The pressure's on for them to win, too. We all feel we can 
beat this team.''

<HEADLINE> Disney Co. Faces Variety of Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sluggish stock, weak earnings and the  
prospect of a bleak summer movie season hound the Walt Disney Co. 
as chairman Michael Eisner prepares to testify in what may be the 
most dramatic Disney tale of the year: a high-profile legal fight 
with the company's former studio chief, Jeffrey Katzenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisner is scheduled to take the stand Tuesday in a trial to  
determine how much money Disney must pay Katzenberg for projects he 
coordinated during a decade at Disney before quitting in an angry 
huff over Eisner's refusal to promote him. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is expected to reveal details about Eisner's souring  
relationship with one of his top lieutenants. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg claims Disney owes him $250 million for films and  
other products he developed before leaving the company in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial and a big payout to Katzenberg wouldn't be the first,  
or worst, news for Disney in recent months. As the bull market has 
continued to rage, Disney stock has been a conspicuous 
underachiever. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings fell 26 percent to $296 million in the company's second  
fiscal quarter. And Disney's stock market performance has turned 
dismal. Disney stock is down 29 percent over the past year and lags 
behind the S&AMP;P 500 and key rivals such as Time Warner, whose share 
price has increased more than 60 percent in 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday, while the Dow Jones industrial average raced ahead  
225.65 points to top 11,000 for the first time, Disney stock 
slipped 50 cents to close at $31.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney also faces the prospect of its new animated feature  
``Tarzan,'' being eclipsed by the summer's preordained blockbuster, 
``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.'' Already, ``Tarzan'' 
merchandise is getting a lukewarm response from retailers who 
instead are stocking up on toys tied to ``Star Wars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many different things going on, it's difficult to  
point to one issue and say this is the exact problem with Disney,'' 
said Linda Bannister, an analyst with Edward Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Disney will get a handle on everything. The question  
is when? We thought this was going to be the last quarter of 
difficult comparisons. Now it appears we are going to have a few 
more quarters of difficulties with Disney,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Disney spokesman declined to comment, citing the company's  
policy of not discussing its stock price. But Disney did outline 
its woes in its most recent earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings have been hurt by big investments in new ventures, such  
as Disney cruise lines and the Internet portal Infoseek. The 
company also has suffered from weaknesses in home video sales and 
merchandising and licensing. Sales at Disney Stores have suffered 
double-digit declines in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Another problem has been the high cost of sports programming for  
the ABC and ESPN television networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, there is the prospect of increased competition in the  
theme park business from Seagram Univeral's new Islands of 
Adventure park scheduled to open this month near Walt Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
	In the report, the company warned investors the company faced  
several more quarters of lackluster earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Disney faces a clear challenge in pulling itself out of its  
near-term projected earnings trough,'' Merrill Lynch analyst 
Jessica Reif Cohen wrote in a recent report. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet analysts believe Disney -- perhaps the world's best-known  
business brand -- still looks good over the long haul. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's investment in Infoseek is widely expected to  
strengthen Disney's position in electronic commerce. Advertising 
revenues from television and radio broadcasting were up in the most 
recent quarter, operating profits from Disney theme parks remained 
strong and the Disney cruise line was expected to begin making 
money over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	To enhance the appeal of its home video line, Disney plans to  
slow the release cycle of its classic videos from every seven years 
to 10. The company also is hoping its home sales effort -- a profit 
engine during much of the past decade -- will get a big boost as 
consumers switch from video cassettes to new DVD players. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also expects to make money on ``Tarzan,'' slated for  
release more than a month after ``Star Wars'' opens May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Disney is implementing a cost-cutting program  
designed to curtail ballooning costs of film production and other 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Disney's assets just have a lot of value,'' Bannister said.  
``A lot of people still go to Disney World. People still go to 
Disney movies and people buy Disney videos for their children. The 
strength of Disney's brand does mean a lot.''

<HEADLINE> Jones Lawyers Seek Clinton Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Paula Jones' lawyers recently approached  
President Clinton to inquire if he would agree to pay $300,000 to 
settle a judge's historic ruling citing him for contempt of court. 
Presidential lawyers dismissed the idea as ``outrageous and 
greedy,'' The Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry comes less than a month after U.S. District Judge  
Susan Webber Wright concluded that Clinton intentionally gave false 
testimony during Mrs. Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit and ordered 
him to repay her lawyers any ``reasonable expenses'' they incurred 
as a result. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' lawyers have until Friday to submit a reimbursement  
figure to the court in Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer familiar with discussions inside Mrs. Jones' legal  
camp, speaking on condition of anonymity, said her lawyers have not 
yet settled upon a final figure but, given the rejection by 
Clinton's lawyers, are discussing the possibility of submitting a 
figure somewhat below $300,000 to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' lawyers made the approach to Clinton's lawyers in  
the past week, first in a phone call and then in a letter, in what 
is known as a settlement offer in the legal profession. They had 
hoped to present to the judge a figure to which both sides had 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Wright likely will have to decide if Mrs. Jones'  
reimbursement figure is reasonable and amounts to an adequate 
penalty for the first president ever to be found in contempt of 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyer signaled that the president would contest any  
figure that approached $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what they suggested and it is outrageous and greedy  
and, I think, a gross misunderstanding of the court's order,'' 
attorney Robert Bennett said. There was no answer Monday night at 
the Dallas law firm that represents Mrs. Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Any money Clinton is ordered to reimburse Mrs. Jones' legal  
bills is above and beyond the $850,000 he paid her earlier this 
year to settle her charges that he made an unwanted sexual advance 
during an alleged 1991 incident at a Little Rock hotel. At the 
time, Clinton was Arkansas governor and Mrs. Jones was a state 
worker. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton denies any wrongdoing and said he settled the sexual  
harassment case, which prompted the disclosure of his affair with 
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and the subsequent 
impeachment proceedings, simply to bring an end to a public crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Wright issued her contempt ruling, Mrs. Jones'  
lawyers estimated they would seek reimbursement for ``tens of 
thousands'' of dollars in legal expenses, which included efforts to 
try to disprove Clinton's sworn denial of an affair with Ms. 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Now there's a possibility that a lawsuit that Americans have  
long since tired of will be stretched out by more legal 
maneuvering. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright ruled April 12 that Clinton gave ``false, misleading and  
evasive answers'' in a January 1998 deposition in which he denied 
having sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright ordered Clinton to pay ``any reasonable expenses,''  
including legal fees incurred by Mrs. Jones as a result of the 
false testimony. The judge also directed Clinton to reimburse the 
court $1,202 for her travel to Washington to preside over the 
taking of the deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	And she referred the matter to the Arkansas Supreme Court's  
Professional Conduct Committee, which has the power to revoke 
Clinton's law license or to impose other sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Group Names Enemies of Free Press </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Yugoslavia, China and Cuba are among the worst  
places in the world for journalists to do their jobs, according to 
a report by the Committee to Protect Journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Slobodan Milosevic, Jiang Zemin and Fidel Castro topped CPJ's  
list of ``Enemies of the Press,'' which was released for to 
coincide with today as World Press Freedom Day. 
</P>
<P>
	CPJ president Ann Cooper said the three rulers, as well as the  
leaders of seven other regimes around the world, ``knowingly acted 
to suppress information through countless violations against 
journalists, including censorship, imprisonment, physical attack 
and even murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic was cited for suppressing the press through  
``intimidation, assault, crippling fines, and license denials. ... 
Milosevic's repression of all independent media has quelled every 
opposition voice, imperiled journalists' lives, and filled the 
airwaves with hate speech.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jiang was accused of presiding over ``worsening conditions for  
politically independent journalists,'' including the shutdown of 
newspapers, magazines and publishers; and the jailing of 
journalists, including an Internet entrepreneur who provided an 
e-mail address to a dissident online magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	In Castro's Cuba, CPJ reports, independent journalists face  
arrest ``for even thinking about covering a trial of dissidents or 
a public demonstration.'' Since January, 28 journalists have been 
detained in Cuba and a new law criminalizes contact with foreign 
media if it is deemed in the service of U.S. interests against 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the list were:  
</P>
<P>
	--Democratic Republic of Congo's Laurent Kabila, accused by the  
CPJ of ``blaming his military failures on the independent press'' 
and of detaining more than 70 journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ethiopia's Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, described by the CPJ as  
``Africa's leading jailer of journalists,'' with 12 in prison at 
the end of 1998, and another 20 incarcerated during the year. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma, whose tax policies and fines  
have crippled media outlets, the CPJ said. Kuchma is also accused 
of ``tacit acceptance'' of newspaper office bombings and assaults 
on journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	--Tunisia's President Zine Abdine Ben Ali, described by the CPJ  
as banning foreign publications, blocking access to certain 
Websites, and harassing journalists ``who dare to veer from a path 
of strict self-censorship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, accused by CPJ of  
controlling most major media, rewarding journalists who self-censor 
negative news, and harassing foreign press. 
</P>
<P>
	--Peru's President Alberto Fujimori, described by the CPJ as  
sponsoring a campaign to discredit Peru's independent press through 
death threats against journalists, wiretapping, surveillance, smear 
tactics and arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	--Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, who approved a law that has  
led to censorship, newspaper shutdowns, and the jailing of 
journalists for libel.

<HEADLINE> Discrepancies Yield Raises at Kodak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Eastman Kodak will pay out $3 million to  
increase the salaries of 2,000 female and minority employees in New 
York and Colorado following employee complaints of racism and 
sexism in determining pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers will also reportedly receive a share of about $10  
million in retroactive compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Although insisting they don't discriminate, Kodak acknowledged  
Monday that since late 1998 the company fired or demoted an 
unspecified number of floor managers who determined annual employee 
pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did a study of 31,000 of our jobs in the U.S. and found  
discrepancies,'' said Kodak spokesman Charles Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	About 12 percent of the female employees and 33 percent of the  
black employees at Kodak will get the compensatory raises. The 
percentage of Hispanic employees that will get raises was very 
small, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	The $3 million pay raise allocation was not in response to a  
threatened lawsuit or as a settlement to some prior action, Smith 
said. The problem was raised by employees who complained to 
supervisors last year, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Smith said the Rev. Norvel Goff, the president of the  
Greater Rochester NAACP, had met with Kodak officials in February 
and was instrumental in resolving the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	A message left at Goff's home was not immediately returned. A  
recorded message said the number for the local NAACP branch was 
disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 2,000 production and skilled workers who will get  
the pay raises are at Kodak's Rochester manufacturing facility, 
although some of the pay raises will go to workers at Kodak's 
Windsor, Colo. facility. The raises, ranging from 3 percent to 6 
percent, will start this week. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Kodak is also making the pay hikes retroactive, the  
Rochester Times and Democrat reported. The workers will receive 
lump sum checks totaling about $10 million to compensate them for 
pay gaps dating back three years, averaging about $5,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak could not be reached to confirm the additional payments.  
Company officials would not provide details about the managers who 
were fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak has about 35,000 employees on its $1.7 billion U.S.  
payroll.

<HEADLINE> Cooling It All Off Revamped US Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Air conditioning has transformed 20th century  
America, from dating habits through lawmaking to space exploration, 
and a cool new show at Washington's National Building Museum 
demonstrates how it happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Mechanical cooling got a boost in the summer of 1881 when Navy  
engineers jury-rigged the first system in the White House for 
President Garfield, who had been wounded by an assassin. Using 436 
pounds of ice an hour, the system helped keep him comfortable for 
58 days. Then they moved him to the breezier New Jersey shore, 
where he died a few weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	``This field of study presents great opportunities for effecting  
a better condition of the atmosphere of our rooms ...,'' the 
engineers reported. ``Hospitals and public buildings ought to be 
specially protected ....'' 
</P>
<P>
	Novelist Gore Vidal noted one change a century later.  
</P>
<P>
	``Before air conditioning, Washington was deserted from mid-June  
to September,'' he wrote, but now ``Congress sits and sits while 
the presidents -- or at least their staffs -- never stop making 
mischief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the first modern air conditioners served machines, not  
people. Cotton mills can't work efficiently if the building is dry 
-- the threads snap too often. Willis Carrier succeeded in 
controlling both temperature and humidity. That was called 
``conditioning'' the cotton, and the name ``air conditioning'' 
stuck. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrier Corp. won over 80 patents on the process as it developed  
and built a major business. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnegie Hall was air conditioned in 1899, the New York Stock  
Exchange in 1902. Congress resisted for another quarter-century. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most of the members heretofore have had the feeling  
and the belief that there was a lot of foul air in the hall,'' Rep. 
John Sandlin, D-La., said in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
	That seems to have swayed Congress, but 15 years later President  
Franklin Roosevelt wouldn't have his office cooled. 
</P>
<P>
	Half a century later, some still dislike air conditioning. They  
talk of ``tight-building syndrome'' and the first spread of 
Legionnaire's disease through a cooling duct, of the drain on the 
supply of energy, windows they can't open and a feeling of 
isolation from the real world. But three out of every four homes 
now have some air conditioning and few residents would give it up. 
</P>
<P>
	House building has been revolutionized. Dating couples no longer  
enjoy the breezy dimness of the front-porch swing. Few new homes 
have a front porch, still less the privacy of one that goes around 
to the backyard as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Architects don't think about putting awnings on windows, or  
eaves that overhang them,'' said Chrysanthe B. Broikos, associate 
curator of the exhibit, dubbed ``Stay Cool!'' ``They don't have to 
design L-shaped buildings or T-shaped buildings or H-shaped 
buildings -- you don't need cross-ventilation anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit opens with a walk through a huge silvery air  
conditioning duct. It ends with a photo of a figure floating inside 
a spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't any air in outer space at all,'' Ms. Broikos  
pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Stay Cool! Air Conditioning America'' will be at the National  
Building Museum through Jan. 2. Admission is free, but a collection 
box at the entrance asks for contributions

<HEADLINE> Tigers' Moehler Suspended 10 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Brian Moehler isn't even bothering  
to appeal his automatic 10-day suspension for scuffing baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit Tigers pitcher was notified of the penalty by AL  
president Gene Budig on Monday, two days after Moehler was ejected 
from a game against Tampa Bay by umpire Larry Barnett, who said the 
right-hander doctored baseballs with sandpaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason why we didn't appeal was I wanted to get this  
behind us,'' Moehler said before the Tigers' game Monday night at 
Tampa Bay. ``Whether we appeal or don't appeal, people have their 
own opinions. It comes down to me wanting to pitch and soon. I 
think that's the best thing to do and just move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moehler, 27, said it wasn't sandpaper, merely dirt, but said he  
didn't protest his ejection during a 4-3 loss because it's not his 
nature to ``argue until I'm blue in the face.'' True to his nature, 
he notified the players' association not to appeal Budig's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is tough for me because I'm a competitor and I want to  
pitch,'' Moehler said. ``I want to be out there pitching. The 
toughest part is, you don't feel like you're contributing to the 
team. I just have to keep my head up and go out there and get my 
work done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett, the plate umpire, said he found a small piece of  
sandpaper attached to the pitcher's left thumb after the Devil Rays 
complained he appeared to be scuffing the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Moehler yielded three runs on four hits in the first two  
innings, then allowed just one hit during a four-inning stretch. 
Tampa Bay players said the velocity and movement of Moehler's 
pitches changed dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
	Devil Rays manager Larry Rothschild said he didn't derive any  
satisfaction out of getting somebody thrown out of the game and 
later suspended, but added ``the rules are clearly stated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to stand up for what these players need, and that's  
a level playing field,'' said Rothschild. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit manager Larry Parrish countered that scuffing is part of  
baseball, characterizing Tampa Bay's complaints -- as well as the 
decision to ask Barnett to check Moehler -- as ``bootleg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a pitching staff in baseball that doesn't have a  
guy who defaces the ball ... If the umpires want to check things 
like that, I think half to three-quarters of the league would be 
suspended, including some Tampa Bay Devil Rays,'' Parrish said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moehler is prepared for the attention he will likely receive  
from fans around the American League. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every city I go into this year, I'm going to hear something  
from somebody,'' Moehler said. ``It's going to happen. I'm prepared 
for it. You have leather skin and you keep moving on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Section 3.02 of the Official Baseball Rules calls for the 10-day  
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Kevin Gross was suspended  
for 10 days by NL president A. Bartlett Giamatti after Gross was 
caught with sandpaper in his glove. That same year, AL president 
Bobby Brown suspended Minnesota pitcher Joe Niekro for 10 days for 
carrying an emery board and sandpaper in his back pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	A 14-game winner in 1998, Moehler is 3-3 with a 4.23 ERA this  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays scored the winning run on a sacrifice fly, two  
batters after he was ejected Saturday night.

<HEADLINE>  Man Arrested In Colo. Shooting Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A 22-year-old man was arrested today on  
suspicion of supplying the Columbine High School gunmen with a 
semiautomatic handgun, one of four weapons used in their rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Manes was booked for investigation of providing a handgun  
to a minor, a charge that carries a maximum six years in prison. He 
was released on bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they do not know if Manes knew what the guns would  
be used for, but an attorney for Manes said his client knew nothing 
of the impending massacre that left 15 dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was horrified when it happened,'' attorney Robert Ransome  
said. ``I would like to say he has followed the path of integrity 
from the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manes is the first person since the April 20 shootings to be  
arrested on charges of helping Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 
17, arm themselves and assemble more than 50 bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other arrest in the case is that of a man accused of  
lying about the two teens having bought possible bomb supplies at a 
hardware store. Police are still trying to determine if others had 
a hand in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've always, from day one, had a feeling that there had to  
be some people who had some knowledge or helped them plan or build 
some of these bombs,'' Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman Steve 
Davis said. ``I think they're still leaning that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said an employee at the pizza parlor where Harris  
and Klebold worked put the two teen-agers in touch with Manes and a 
TEC DC-9 semiautomatic pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the last person who had it before it was supplied to  
one of our gunmen,'' said Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear which gunman obtained the weapon or  
when, Davis said, or whether it was sold, traded or given to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes' first court hearing was scheduled for Tuesday morning.  
</P>
<P>
	Columbine students returned to classes at Chatfield High School  
on Monday. But administrators decided it would be best if friends 
of Harris and Klebold were taught at home for the rest of the year. 
The parents agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Primarily, for their well-being, and because it's a very  
uncomfortable and difficult time for everyone involved,'' said Rick 
Kaufman, a spokesman for the school district. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaufman declined to say how many students were affected,  
although Davis put the number at eight to 10. He said he did not 
know whether they were associated with the gunmen's clique known as 
the Trenchcoat Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators also have banned trench coats at every school in  
Jefferson County, which has 89,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
	Students at Chatfield, which has a sports rivalry with  
Columbine, went out of their way to welcome the 1,900 Columbine 
students. The Chatfield students tacked up banners in hallways and 
outside the school and distributed ribbons that blended their 
school's burgundy with Columbine's navy blue. 
</P>
<P>
	They also handed out T-shirts that bore a ``C,'' with clasped  
hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can do anything to help them, we're happy to do it,''  
said Amber Mancuso, 17, a Chatfield junior. ``I think it's hit all 
of us hard, all of us have friends there. When we found out, 
probably half the school was crying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uniformed sheriff's deputies, police officers and five guards  
patrolled the school grounds, and students had to show 
identification before filing into Chatfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be nice to see the other kids and get back in  
the classroom, not necessarily to learn, but to see people and get 
back into the routine of things,'' said senior Nathan Montgomery, 
19. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Columbine students were apprehensive about returning to  
classes while their own school remained a massive crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really nervous about it,'' said sophomore Krysti DeHoff,  
16. ``I don't really want to go back because I keep feeling like 
something's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Klebold killed 12 schoolmates and a teacher before  
they killed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have said that Robyn Anderson, Klebold's girlfriend,  
purchased the other three weapons used, two rifles and a shotgun 
and has been interviewed as a witness. Under Colorado law, an 
18-year old without a felony record can furnish minors with rifles 
and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson has made no public comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Five of the 23 students who were wounded at Columbine remained  
hospitalized Monday, two in serious condition and three in fair 
condition.

<HEADLINE> Regulators Probing Online Brokerages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Securities regulators have been fanning out  
across the country investigating online brokerage firms and 
day-trading companies as they consider drafting new rules for the 
fast-growing electronic trading business. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's top securities regulator is expected to  
announce a new initiative on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  
and the National Association of Securities Dealers, a self-policing 
brokers' group, has been conducted over the past two months or so. 
The auditors are looking for possible violations of securities laws 
as well as examining how well the firms execute customers' orders 
and warn them of trading risks. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC ``has been reviewing the policies and practices of  
day-trading and online trading firms over the past few months for 
compliance with the securities laws,'' agency spokesman Duncan King 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the areas of inquiry include trade execution issues as  
well as the disclosure of risk. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, who warned investors early this year  
to use caution in electronic trading, plans to announce Tuesday a 
new related move by the agency, according to two regulatory 
sources. They spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the NASD declined to comment on the investigation.  
</P>
<P>
	Details of the probe were first reported by The Washington Post  
in Saturday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came in here and very thoroughly reviewed us,'' said  
James Lee, head of Momentum Securities Inc., a day-trading company 
based in Houston with 11 offices nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the auditors have visited ``every day-trading firm  
I know'' in recent weeks, said Lee, who also is chairman and 
president of the Electronic Traders Association. That would mean 
about 15 firms. 
</P>
<P>
	By year's end, an estimated 10 million amateur investors will be  
doing at least occasional trading over the Internet, and online 
brokerage accounts will represent about a quarter of all retail 
stock trades. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest online brokerages include Charles Schwab,  
Ameritrade, Datek Online, DLJdirect, Discover Brokerage and E Trade 
Securities. Spokesmen for some of them declined comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In an inquiry sparked by investors' complaints about recent  
computer system crashes at online firms that caused trading delays, 
New York state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer's office has asked 
several firms to provide reports on their services. 
</P>
<P>
	The world of electronic day trading is much smaller but also  
growing. Day traders seek out stocks, especially of high-tech 
companies, solely for sharp price swings and buy and sell them 
quickly to profit from short-term movements in price. 
</P>
<P>
	Day-trading companies sell training courses and special software  
programs to ordinary investors who want to try the risky, 
lightning-speed practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Walker, the SEC's enforcement director, said in March  
that the agency was, among other things, examining the 
advertisements of day-trading firms to see if they make unrealistic 
promises to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	State securities regulators also have been scrutinizing  
day-trading firms and a handful of them, particularly in 
Massachusetts, have filed fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Operators of the day-trading firms acknowledge they're not for  
everyone, but they contend state regulators are unfairly tarnishing 
the industry because of a few rogue firms that may have misled 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, of the electronic traders' group, said he believed the  
purpose of the investigation was ``as much information-gathering as 
they are going after people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at this as (the regulators) trying to understand what's  
going on,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NASD, which operates the Nasdaq Stock Market, has been  
considering since March a new rule that would require day-trading 
firms to screen investors and warn them in writing of the risks. 
</P>
<P>
	In related moves Monday, state securities regulators announced  
they have formed a task force to examine online trading issues such 
as advertising and customer order processing. And the Securities 
Industry Association issued a brochure for investors titled 
``Online Investing Tips.'' It is available on the trade group's Web 
site at www.sia.com.

<HEADLINE> MediaOne Calls Off Comcast Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MediaOne Group Inc. will announce today plans to  
accept an offer to be acquired by AT&AMP;T Corp., abandoning a 
previously agreed upon deal with Comcast Corp., according to a 
person familiar with the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast has until Thursday to make a better offer, or the  
Denver-based MediaOne will be sold to AT&AMP;T Corp. for $55.79 
billion, said the source, who would only speak on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight over MediaOne is attracting some of the biggest names  
in the cable, telephone, computer and Internet industries. 
Microsoft Corp. and America Online Inc., for example, may join 
Comcast to help the company beat AT&AMP;T's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake are MediaOne's 5 million U.S. cable TV subscribers and  
8.9 million overseas subscribers, who could be converted into 
lucrative, high-speed Internet subscribers. Cable access to the 
Internet is expected to replace telephone access because cable 
allows the bits of voice, video and data to travel faster. 
</P>
<P>
	So whoever controls MediaOne could have more control over the  
potential riches of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	On one side: AT&AMP;T chairman C. Michael Armstong has joined forces  
with the co-founder of Continental Cablevision (which later became 
MediaOne), Amos Hostetter. 
</P>
<P>
	On the opposite side: Comcast president Brian Roberts is trying  
to forge a stronger bid with Bill Gates chairman of Microsoft, and 
Paul Allen, a Microsoft founder who left the company in 1983, as 
well as Steve Case, chairman of America Online. 
</P>
<P>
	If the AT&AMP;T team wins, the No. 1 long-distance company will also  
be the No. 1 cable company, having access to 60 percent of the U.S. 
homes wired for cable. Hostetter would be the nonexecutive chairman 
in charge of cable assets, in effect retaking the helm of his 
former company. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Comcast team wins, Comcast will be a stronger No. 3 in  
the cable business, while America Online, the largest Internet 
service provider, could have guaranteed high-speed Internet links 
to millions of homes. Meanwhile, Microsoft could sell the software 
that makes it all happen. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for MediaOne and a spokeswoman for AT&AMP;T declined  
comment. Comcast could not immediately be reached for comment 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, MediaOne confirmed that it had signed confidentiality  
agreements with America Online and Microsoft to allow the two 
companies access to MediaOne's internal financial information as 
part of the due diligence process. Several press reports said Allen 
also was interested in saving Comcast's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast, based in Philadelphia, originally offered to use its  
stock to buy MediaOne, but AT&AMP;T trumped that bid with a superior 
cash and stock offer. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's offer, however, lost $1.7 billion of its value last week  
as the company's stock price slid from $59.50 to $50.50 on investor 
concerns that staid Ma Bell was becoming Ma Cable and diluting the 
value of its shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the deal, the decline in share price means that  
AT&AMP;T will have to spend $36.55 in cash and $47.975 in stock for 
each MediaOne share, a marked difference from the $30.85 in cash 
and the $56.525 in stock it originally offered. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online could help strengthen Comcast's hand. But with  
only $1.8 billion in cash, AOL is in a better position to lend its 
high-flying stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, which is sitting on $22 billion in cash, could give  
Comcast's side several billion dollars to tempt MediaOne executives 
and shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Seattle-based software company declined  
comment.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche Take 3-2 Lead to San Jose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The Colorado Avalanche take the ice  
tonight at the San Jose Arena with a 3-2 playoff advantage over the 
San Jose Sharks, two series-opening victories in California, and a 
proven record on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	All that's left is winning.  
</P>
<P>
	``We know we're a good road team, and we have proven that all  
year,'' said right wing Theo Fleury. ``We finally got the job done 
at home, we've got the lead going back to San Jose. So let's just 
go in there, play another boring road game -- and end this series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Up 2-0 after the delayed series opened in San Jose, the  
Avalanche dropped their next two games at home before taking 
Saturday night's game, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks, a game away from elimination, face a daunting task.  
The Avalanche were 23-14-4 on the road during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Sharks still think the home-ice advantage tonight could  
take the series back to Denver for Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't happy with our performance, but we came in and won  
two out of three and kept the series alive,'' San Jose forward Jeff 
Friesen said. ``We take the series back to the Shark Tank and will 
go back to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks also face a suddenly rejuvenated Fleury, who was  
fairly quiet early in the playoffs but came back with two goals and 
an assist Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a matter of time,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche, however, weren't looking past Monday's game  
despite their advantages, Fleury added. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a long way from over,'' he said. ``They're going to bring  
their best game Monday. ... We've got one hockey game to win, and 
it's the hardest one to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharks coach Darryl Sutter gambled and put Steve Shields in goal  
Saturday, giving Mike Vernon a night off. Vernon has won Stanley 
Cups with Calgary and Detroit over the course of his career, but 
Shields was hot down the stretch of the regular season, going 9-0-2 
in his last 11 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Sutter wasn't about to second-guess himself after the Game 5  
loss. Because of the delayed schedule, Vernon, 36, was facing a 
possible seven games in 11 nights. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was probably going to have one bad night if he did that, so  
we're probably better off that this was how it turned out,'' Sutter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The series was supposed to have started in Denver, but was  
delayed because of the mass shooting at Columbine High School. 
Instead, the first two games were played in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	Vernon, no doubt, will be back for Game 6. He wasn't dwelling on  
what might have been, had he been in goal Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why it's called a team game,'' he said. ``Everybody  
contributes. We just weren't prepared as a team (Saturday). Now we 
have to regroup.''

<HEADLINE> Race Deaths Raise Safety Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- It was planned as a big opening act for the  
83rd Indianapolis 500. It turned instead into another deadly 
reminder of the dangers of being a spectator at auto races. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to go on,'' Indy Racing League founder Tony George  
said Sunday as authorities tried to piece together evidence from an 
accident in the VisionAire 500 that killed three spectators in the 
grandstands. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight other spectators were injured, including a 9-year-old girl  
who was in critical condition, when debris from a three-car wreck 
flew into the seats near the exit of the fourth turn at Lowe's 
Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night's race marked the first time in the four-year  
history of the IRL that a second event was scheduled for the month 
of May, which had been reserved exclusively for the circuit's 
marquee race, the Indianapolis 500. IRL officials thought holding a 
race in the cradle of stock-car country would help boost interest 
in their open-wheel series leading up to the May 30 event at Indy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a business for us,'' George said. ``It's also a sport  
and a livelihood, and our fans who support us would want us to go 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 50,000 people were on hand at the suburban Charlotte  
track when the force of the crash at speeds near 215 mph rocketed a 
wheel and suspension parts over a 15-foot-high catch fence. The 
debris flew into the grandstands and slammed into spectators, some 
of them seated as high as 39 rows above the 1.5-mile, high-banked 
superspeedway. 
</P>
<P>
	As shrieking spectators sought help, rescue workers converged on  
the bloody area in a scenario eerily similar to that at Michigan 
Speedway last July 26, when three spectators were killed in a Champ 
Car race. The cause in that event also was a broken wheel and 
suspension parts that hurdled a catch fence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every once in a while, unfortunately, auto racing raises the  
black side of itself,'' Lowe's Motor Speedway president H.A. 
``Humpy'' Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
	George, whose circuit has been fighting to overcome a thin  
schedule and a lack of high-dollar sponsors and big-name drivers, 
said the IRL has made big gains in safety and will keep trying to 
improve. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't plan for every possible scenario,'' he said. ``We  
just do our level best, and unfortunately, sometimes that may not 
be enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Concord police said that because the accident occurred on  
private property and there didn't appear to be any criminal intent 
by anyone, they didn't plan any investigation but would assist if 
asked. Wheeler said the IRL and the speedway planned their own 
probes to augment the efforts of their insurers, ``to make sure 
that this never happens again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to keep wheels from flying off at impact, the  
Formula One circuit this year began requiring its teams to use 
tethers designed to keep the wheels and suspension connected to the 
main body of the machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Such tethers are not required on either Champ Cars or IRL  
machines, in part because some racing authorities think the devices 
may solve one problem while creating another. 
</P>
<P>
	Leo Mehl, executive director of the IRL, said there is concern  
that while tethers may prevent parts from flying off cars and 
hitting fans, they also may put drivers in greater danger because 
the parts could snap back and hit them instead. A tethered wheel 
also could be especially dangerous if it is launched into the 
stands in a slingshot fashion, Mehl said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL wants to study the issue more, Mehl said.  
</P>
<P>
	``You must be very cautious that you don't make regulations that  
will make things worse,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The height of Charlotte's catch fence conforms to industry  
standards, but it was difficult to tell how much higher the fence 
would have had to be to keep the debris from reaching the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have very little direct film of the accident,'' Mehl said.  
</P>
<P>
	The three people killed were Randy D. Pyatte, 21, and Jeff  
Patton, no age available, both of Connelly Springs, and Dexter B. 
Mobley, 41, of Statesville. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the eight people hospitalized were released by Sunday  
night. The lone exception was Hailey McGee, 9, of Conover, who was 
in critical condition at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte with 
bruises to her brain and lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident occurred in the last race of a three-year  
sanctioning agreement between the IRL and the speedway, prompting 
questions about whether the track might not seek to renew its 
agreement with the circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Further clouding the issue is the fact that the Charlotte track  
is owned by Speedway Motorsports Inc., which controls tracks that 
hold five of the 11 races on this year's IRL schedule. Should the 
IRL lose the support of SMI, it could spell serious trouble for the 
fledgling circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wheeler, who in addition to running the Charlotte track also  
serves as SMI's president, said the company remains committed to 
helping the IRL establish itself as a low-cost alternative to the 
Champ Car circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have pretty strong feelings about the IRL,'' he said.  
``They're trying to do the right thing.''

<HEADLINE> Court Makes Some Deportation Easier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today made it easier for  
U.S. officials to deport some illegal aliens whose lives or freedom 
would be threatened in their home country. 
</P>
<P>
	By a unanimous vote, the justices limited federal courts' power  
to second-guess immigration officials who decide an alien cannot be 
spared deportation because he or she committed ``serious 
nonpolitical crimes'' outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In other action today, the court:  
</P>
<P>
	--Agreed to decide whether police generally may stop and question  
someone who runs away after seeing them. The court said it will 
review an Illinois ruling that barred police most often from making 
such investigative stops, despite arguments by state prosecutors 
that they are justified in high-crime neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	--Strengthened creditors' rights against those of shareholders in  
some bankruptcy cases in which an insolvent firm is being 
reorganized. The court ruled in a Chicago case that unsecured 
creditors can bar shareholders from putting up new money to retain 
ownership of a reorganized firm, if no one else was given a chance 
to come up with an alternative plan. 
</P>
<P>
	--Refused to kill a lawsuit against a newspaper company accused  
of illegal discrimination because it allegedly sells papers at 
varying prices to independent contractors for resale in different 
service areas. The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal by 
the Pulitzer Publishing Co., which is being sued for how it 
distributes the St. Louis Post-Dispatch to ``branch dealers'' for 
sale in vending machines and at retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
	--Said federal courts, not Indian tribal courts, get to decide  
whether federal limits apply to claims that nuclear-industry 
activities caused harm on Indian land. Ruling unanimously in a case 
involving uranium mining on the Navajo reservation in Arizona, the 
court said federal law pre-empts tribal courts from ruling on such 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's immigration decision was a victory for the Clinton  
administration and a defeat for a Guatemala man who entered the 
United States illegally in 1993 at San Ysidro, Calif. More broadly, 
the ruling may affect the treatment accorded other refugees in this 
country and other nations as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the United Nations high commissioner for refugees  
had said the court's interpretation of federal immigration law 
could affect how other nations interpret a parallel provision in 
international law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Resolution of this case is likely to affect not only the  
interpretation by the United States of the provisions of ... 
(international law) relating to who is and who is not entitled to 
the internationally protected status of refugee, but also the 
manner in which other countries interpret those provisions,'' the 
justices were told in a friend-of-the-court brief. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. law imposes no duty on the government to admit refugees.  
But people who are already here -- even illegally -- generally cannot 
be forced to leave if they have a reasonable fear of persecution. 
An exception allows deportation of aliens who have committed 
serious nonpolitical crimes in another country. 
</P>
<P>
	When immigration officials sought to deport Juan Anibal  
Aguirre-Aguirre in 1994, he sought asylum and a ``withholding'' of 
his deportation based on his fear of being persecuted in Guatemala 
for his protests as a student. 
</P>
<P>
	Aguirre said that from 1989 to 1992 he led a student  
organization that protested human rights violations and the high 
cost of bus fares. U.S. immigration officials said he was involved 
in burning 10 buses, hitting passengers with sticks if they did not 
cooperate by getting off, and destroying merchandise in stores. 
</P>
<P>
	An immigration judge in 1995 ruled for Aguirre, 25 at the time,  
but the Board of Immigration Appeals reversed the judge and ordered 
Aguirre deported. The board cited his ``serious nonpolitical 
crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year ordered the  
board to reconsider the case, saying it must balance Aguirre's 
offenses against the danger to him if he is returned to Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Supreme Court said the 9th Circuit court was wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	``The court of appeals' error is clearest with respect to its  
holding that ... (an immigration board) was required to balance ... 
criminal acts against the risk of persecution he would face if 
returned to Guatemala,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not obvious that an already-completed crime is somehow  
rendered less serious by considering the further circumstance that 
the alien may be subject to persecution if returned to his home 
country,'' Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	While immigration officials must consider the risk of  
persecution, that consideration should not also be ``a factor in 
determining whether the crime itself is a serious, nonpolitical 
crime,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is INS vs. Aguirre-Aguirre, 97-1754.

<HEADLINE> Not Just Kids Buying Star Wars Toys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a galaxy located somewhere between reason  
and insanity, 30-year-old construction worker Gil Juarez was 
spending $100 for a one-way ticket back to childhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can buy whatever you want right now,'' Juarez observed of  
the benefits of adulthood, as he shopped for ``Star Wars'' action 
figures, models and children's underwear at a Toys R Us in Los 
Feliz, just outside downtown Los Angeles. ``It used to be you had 
to ask your parents. Now it's just your wife saying, 'No, no, no.' 
And since I have the money, I say, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars'' fans, collectors, shop-a-holics and others just  
feeling frisky from the Force invaded toy stores Monday just after 
the stroke of midnight. The mission for these Storm Troopers armed 
with Visa cards was to become the first in the solar system to buy 
merchandise from the upcoming ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom 
Menace,'' which doesn't reach theaters until May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a trip to the dark side, literally: Lines started forming  
Sunday evening in places like Lawrenceville, N.J., and Brookfield, 
Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	And when the Earth's single sun rose, another wave returned to  
reap the most popular bounty, including 12-inch Darth Maul villains 
and Jar Jar Binks space creatures, or a Jabba the Hutt that barfs 
green play gel (``Not a food item,'' the box warns.) 
</P>
<P>
	Fans had been waiting for months to activate the little Darth  
Maul's light saber swinging action, or to repeatedly press the 
saddlebag of the nimble steed-like kaadu for realistic running 
action, or to just cover their bodies in ``Star Wars'' lotion. 
</P>
<P>
	But the emperor forbade it.  
</P>
<P>
	George Lucas, the director, creator and owner of all things  
``Star Wars,'' secured strict licensing deals that prevented toy 
maker Hasbro from releasing virtually any information about its 
Chinese-made products until the determined hour (though the 
Internet rebels had pictures of the stuff posted on their 
unofficial Web sites for months.) 
</P>
<P>
	Then, just after midnight, ``Man, did it go!'' said Mark  
Breller, the sales floor manager at the Lawrenceville, N.J., Toys R 
Us. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene was ... well, let him describe it.  
</P>
<P>
	``One of the managers brought a video camera in to tape it, and  
there were all these people with their shopping carts, and as soon 
as the doors opened, they started running,'' he said. ``People were 
grabbing the action figures off the shelves as fast as they could, 
filling entire shopping carts with them. One guy bought 100 of the 
battle droids. He said he was going to set up a battle scene.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a Wal-Mart in Tulsa, Okla., one collector went so far as to  
offer store employees $1,000 for a Star Wars promotional sign. At 
the Boise Toys R Us, shoppers purchased the equivalent of a 40-foot 
semi-truck of movie toys. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pure madness,'' said Erik Henriksen, a 19-year-old  
college student. ``There was so much pure desire for this stuff we 
were terrified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And who were these people, acting like this was the second  
coming of Tickle Me Elmo? 
</P>
<P>
	Some, to be sure, were collectors, acquiring Jar Jars for a  
rainy day, diversifying a college fund that may be a little heavy 
on Beanie Babies. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to get it off the shelf at the retail price,''  
explained Ron Reusch, owner of The Toy in Milwaukee, on speculators 
buying in bulk to resell at higher prices on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The least expensive toy available Monday was the Star Wars Spin  
Pop at $5.99. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even 24 hours after the merchandise launch, some fans were  
already trying to sell their new buys on the Internet. Amazon.com 
listed more than 15 new ``Star Wars'' items in its auction area on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the offerings was a set of 21 action figures and the  
related computer gear that makes them talk, with the bidding 
beginning at $350. 
</P>
<P>
	But mostly the buyers were just folks, albeit slightly more in  
love with ``Star Wars'' than most. 
</P>
<P>
	Supplies of most goods seemed to be holding up Monday despite  
the demand, but Louis Lecca wasn't taking any chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Lecca, 26, a music producer from Los Angeles, waited four hours  
in line before Los Feliz Toys R Us opened. He cooked up a plan to 
make sure he got what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of rushing for the ``Star Wars'' section like everybody  
else, he went a few aisles over and shouted, ``They're opening new 
boxes in the back!'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the mob went to the back, where there were no new boxes, he  
had his pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a while it does start to get ridiculous,'' he said. ``I  
won't buy everything, but all of those people who say it's childish 
to spend so much money on these, I say just go see the movie, and 
you'll understand.''

<HEADLINE> Crude Tops $19 a Barrel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude futures rose Monday above $19 a barrel for the first time  
since 1997 on the New York Mercantile Exchange as traders bet world 
oil producers remain committed to slashing output despite sharply 
higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, wheat futures sank, as did palladium.  
</P>
<P>
	Crude briefly topped $19 before investors took profits, but  
analysts said the gains could continue in coming days if an 
upcoming report from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries shows its members are adhering to promised cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC and other oil producers pledged to cut about 2.7 percent of  
daily supply from the market beginning in April in a bid to boost 
prices. Oil had been hovering at 12-year lows amid overproduction 
and weak world demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest in a series of promised cutbacks has caused prices to  
jump more than 50 percent in a few weeks as oil producers signal 
they are serious by reducing exports to key countries, including 
the United States and Japan. Those cutbacks have been reflected in 
weekly inventory data. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the key to a sustain price rise, however, will be  
how long oil producers keep crude off the market. Previous 
agreements have produced few results in terms of price increases 
because of widespread cheating that left targets far off the mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Light, sweet crude for June delivery rose 19 cents to $18.85 a  
barrel, after earlier in the session topping $19 a barrel. June 
heating oil rose .27 cent to 45.73 cents a gallon; June unleaded 
gasoline rose .37 cent to 55.56 cents a gallon; June natural gas 
rose .58 cent to $2.311 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were pressured on the Chicago Board of Trade by  
expectations a crop tour of winter wheat growing regions this week 
will find above-average yields that could lead to increased 
estimates for the early summer harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	While prices were lifted recently amid fears heavy rains in the  
Plains states could lead to disease, forecasts for drier, 
beneficial weather have caused investors to take that risk premium 
out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	A bumper crop would come at a time when there still is plenty of  
last year's crop in storage amid a period of relatively weak export 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	July wheat fell 4 cents to $2.64 a bushel.  
</P>
<P>
	Palladium fell sharply, below $300 an ounce, on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange amid expectations a supply shortage will ease 
rapidly with new shipments from Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	While Russia has yet to confirm large-scale shipments are  
underway after a five-month absence, traders of the industrial-use 
metal pointed to last week's large sale as confirmation of the 
fact. Russia controls nearly 80 percent of the world's palladium 
supply, a metal used in electronic and automobile emission-control 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
	June palladium tumbled $11.70 to $296.30 an ounce.

<HEADLINE> Texas Gas Leak Sends 65 To Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A carbon monoxide leak at Continental Airlines'  
catering service sent about 65 people to the hospital early today 
with nausea and headaches. 
</P>
<P>
	The leak happened at Chelsea Catering Corp. at Bush  
Intercontinental Airport. Airport operations were not affected. 
</P>
<P>
	The catering company had been using portable generators because  
of a weekend power outage at the building, said Richard Fernandez, 
a spokesman for the agency that oversees Houston's airports. 
Exhaust from the generators apparently seeped into the building, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chelsea Catering is a Continental subsidiary that supplies meals  
to 12 airlines, including Continental. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the leak was expected to disrupt Monday's food service,  
Continental spokesman Dave Messing said the airline would provide 
passengers with meal vouchers that can be spent at the airport.

<HEADLINE> Columbine School Crosses Removed in Hassle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The carpenter who built 15 large crosses  
for the victims of the Columbine High School has taken them all 
away because of controversy over two of the memorials naming the 
gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Zanis drove 14 hours from his home at Aurora, Ill., last  
week to erect an 8-foot cross for each of the 13 shooting victims 
and the two gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	However, many people were angry that two of the crosses  
represented the killers. And on Friday, Brian Rohrbough, whose son, 
Daniel, was among those killed on April 20, took down the crosses 
for gunmen Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Zanis received so many nasty telephone calls about the 15  
crosses that he drove back to Littleton -- leaving Saturday 
afternoon and driving all night -- and removed them all early 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thought the people were upset about them,'' his daughter,  
Maria, said from Aurora. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was so disturbed by the reaction he got,'' said Edie  
Hylton, manager of community service for Foothills Parks and 
Recreation District. ``He was trying to do something good.'' Zanis 
himself had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The hundreds of people who arrived Sunday expecting to see the  
crosses were mystified. 
</P>
<P>
	``You build a memorial for someone, then you take it down? That  
doesn't make sense to me,'' said Wayne Haubenschild. 
</P>
<P>
	His 16-year-old son, Chris, who helped erect the crosses, said  
he wished they were still planted in the park. 
</P>
<P>
	``People look at that (the crosses), and they know that violence  
is really bad,'' Chris Zanis said. ``It helps them to let (their 
grief) out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rohrbough also was unhappy at Zanis' action.  
</P>
<P>
	``He should have left the 13 other crosses standing,'' Rohrbough  
said Sunday. ``Instead of doing the right thing to honor the 
victims of those two murders, he comes back and tears down whole 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday afternoon, an unidentified man erected one large,  
wooden cross near the spot where Zanis' memorials had stood. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't realize what the cross means to the Christians  
who came to the park to remember and mourn,'' Chris Odom, 32, said 
as he looked at the new cross. ``It's a symbol of forgiveness and 
healing.''

<HEADLINE> 2 IOC Ethics Cases To Get Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The last two cases involving IOC  
members in the Salt Lake scandal will be reviewed by the 
committee's leadership Tuesday with the help of new evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee's new ethics commission,  
meeting for the first time Monday, sent the cases of Australia's 
Phil Coles and South Korea's Kim Un-yong to the ruling executive 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim is an executive board member and the highest-ranking  
official implicated in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``A decision tomorrow (Tuesday) one way or the other will be  
taken in both cases,'' said executive board member Kevan Gosper, 
one of three IOC delegates on the new eight-member ethics panel. 
``If there's any further investigation to be done, that will be 
triggered tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Keba Mbaye, the head of the new ethics panel,  
said new evidence had been received on both Kim and Coles, who have 
received the highest level of warnings from IOC investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the new data in Kim's case involved verification of a  
signature and other information. Mbaye declined to give details on 
Coles' case. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics commission decided that the board already had the  
cases under control and ``it would be counterproductive'' to 
reexamine them, Gosper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has been cited for accepting travel and accommodation  
perks from Salt Lake City. He is under renewed scrutiny since his 
ex-wife claimed that representatives of Athens' unsuccessful bid 
for the 1996 Olympics gave the couple jewelry worth $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said he didn't know if Coles would need to appear again  
before Olympic investigators, and that he might abstain from a vote 
on his countryman. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, the highest-ranking official implicated in the Salt Lake  
affair, could face expulsion if it is proved that he knew that the 
Salt Lake committee paid for his son's salary at a 
telecommunications company. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel of top international personalities, including  
former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker and former U.N. 
chief Javier Perez de Cuellar, was established in March as part of 
reforms in the wake of the Salt Lake scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members were expelled or resigned for receiving improper  
inducements during the campaign for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Mbaye, said minor allegations involving some 30 members had  
arisen as a result of letters sent by the IOC to cities involved in 
Olympic bids going back several years. 
</P>
<P>
	The names -- half of which had already been dealt with in the  
Salt Lake investigation -- arose in letters from 26 Olympic 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said the latest cases would be examined by the ethics  
commission. But in a conference call, Baker said the new panel 
``did not take jurisdiction of these matters. They were left with 
the executive council (board).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mbaye refused to reveal the names, but said that the alleged  
infractions were minor. 
</P>
<P>
	Summaries of the cases later posted on the IOC's Web site did  
not contain members' names, and it appeared most of the cases 
already had been reported. Others were seemingly mundane actions, 
such as introducing the children of two members to ``academic 
institutions,'' and another member bringing two guests to a dinner 
with bid-city officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't read too much into it,'' Gosper said.  
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel is meant to draw up ethical rules, study the  
Olympic bidding and selection process, ensure accountability and 
enforce compliance with a new code of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	French Sen. Robert Badinter was put in charge of finalizing the  
new code. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker said the panel is going about the drafting ``carefully and  
slowly in a way calculated to make a real difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When it's finished, it will be a good document,'' he added.  
But many questions remained at Monday's session on what it would 
contain. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the challenges we have is to try to make it short  
enough so people read it,'' Baker said. ``There's a lot to learn 
and I'm trying to come up to speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the commission's priority was ``getting the machinery in  
place'' and hoped a draft of the new ethics code ``not only for 
members and officers of the IOC but those that do business with the 
IOC'' would be finished within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker declined to say what ideas for the code were discussed.  
But he said the commission's goal was similar to that of the ethics 
panel headed by another former Senate majority leader, George 
Mitchell, which called for more openness and accountability in IOC 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the commission is off to a good start,'' Baker said.  
``I think it is a good initiative by the IOC. I think it is almost 
certain to succeed in its mission, and its mission in the final 
analysis is to make sure that a code of ethical conduct, clearly, 
succinctly sets out what is expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other members are former Swiss President Kurt Furgler;  
former Canadian Olympic athlete Charmaine Crooks; and IOC executive

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Euro, Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen and the euro  
Monday as the Dow industrials ran past 11,000 and another raft of 
positive economic news enhanced the United States' position as the 
strongest economy worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dollar loved it because of no inflation, no near-term  
(Federal Reserve) action, a booming stock market,'' said Jeremy 
Fand, foreign exchange strategist at BankBoston in Boston. ``All in 
all, good news for the dollar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 120.31  
Japanese yen, up from 119.40 yen late Friday. The euro fell against 
the dollar, trading at $1.0567, down from $1.0582. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders bought dollars because they liked what they saw in the  
U.S. data released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest and dividend income rose in March, along with rental  
incomes and business owners' incomes. Spending last year on 
existing residential properties rose 0.8 percent. Commercial 
construction fell, but not enough to wipe out last month's 
increase. Government construction spending rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's data followed even stronger reports from Friday, which  
showed the U.S. economy growing at a robust 4.5 percent annual rate 
for the first three months of 1999 with inflation nearly 
non-existent. The lack of meaningful inflation made traders think 
the Federal Reserve will not take any immediate action to steer the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose all day, but made an extra  
push at the end of trading to rise 225 points to close at 
11,014.69, a new record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our economy still rolls along,'' said Ricardo Gomes, head of  
foreign exchange at Republic National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's rise against the yen was aided by the lack of  
announcements of new initiatives regarding Japan's recession during 
a Washington news conference with President Clinton and Japanese 
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi. Japanese markets were closed for a 
national holiday, keeping currency trading volume low. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 1.5236 Swiss francs, down from 1.5243,  
and 1.4470 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4587 late Friday. The 
British pound was quoted at $1.6093, up from $1.6090; British 
markets were also closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro no  
longer are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on the euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8508 German 
marks, up from 1.8484; 6.2073 French francs, up from 6.1996; and 
1,831.50 Italian lire, up from 1,828.15.

<HEADLINE> Columbine School Crosses Removed in Hassle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The carpenter who built 15 large crosses  
for the victims of the Columbine High School has taken them all 
away because of controversy over two of the memorials naming the 
gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Zanis drove 14 hours from his home at Aurora, Ill., last  
week to erect an 8-foot cross for each of the 13 shooting victims 
and the two gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	However, many people were angry that two of the crosses  
represented the killers. And on Friday, Brian Rohrbough, whose son, 
Daniel, was among those killed on April 20, took down the crosses 
for gunmen Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Zanis received so many nasty telephone calls about the 15  
crosses that he drove back to Littleton -- leaving Saturday 
afternoon and driving all night -- and removed them all early 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thought the people were upset about them,'' his daughter,  
Maria, said from Aurora. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was so disturbed by the reaction he got,'' said Edie  
Hylton, manager of community service for Foothills Parks and 
Recreation District. ``He was trying to do something good.'' Zanis 
himself had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The hundreds of people who arrived Sunday expecting to see the  
crosses were mystified. 
</P>
<P>
	``You build a memorial for someone, then you take it down? That  
doesn't make sense to me,'' said Wayne Haubenschild. 
</P>
<P>
	His 16-year-old son, Chris, who helped erect the crosses, said  
he wished they were still planted in the park. 
</P>
<P>
	``People look at that (the crosses), and they know that violence  
is really bad,'' Chris Zanis said. ``It helps them to let (their 
grief) out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rohrbough also was unhappy at Zanis' action.  
</P>
<P>
	``He should have left the 13 other crosses standing,'' Rohrbough  
said Sunday. ``Instead of doing the right thing to honor the 
victims of those two murders, he comes back and tears down whole 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday afternoon, an unidentified man erected one large,  
wooden cross near the spot where Zanis' memorials had stood. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't realize what the cross means to the Christians  
who came to the park to remember and mourn,'' Chris Odom, 32, said 
as he looked at the new cross. ``It's a symbol of forgiveness and 
healing.''

<HEADLINE> Gumbel Set To Return to Morning TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bryant Gumbel is about to get back into the  
morning television game. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS has called a news conference for Tuesday, where it is  
expected to announce that Gumbel will take over as host of its 
beleagured morning show, network executives speaking on condition 
of anonymity said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The network will also unveil plans to build a new storefront  
studio for ``This Morning'' that will be similar to the Rockefeller 
Center studio used by Gumbel's former employers on NBC's ``Today'' 
show, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gumbel has largely been off the air since the cancellation of  
his newsmagazine, ``Public Eye with Bryant Gumbel,'' last year. He 
left ``Today'' after 15 years in 1997 to sign a lucrative contract 
with CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	His agent, Ed Hookstratten, did not immediately return a call  
for comment on Monday. CBS would not discuss its news conference 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Morning'' has run a consistent third in the ratings  
behind ``Today'' and ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' The ABC show 
raised the stakes in the morning news competition earlier this year 
when it brought Charles Gibson and Diane Sawyer in as temporary 
hosts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratings for ``Today'' blossomed after it began televising from a  
studio with a window to the street in Rockefeller Center. ABC 
subsequently began building a Times Square studio, and CBS hopes to 
use space on Fifth Avenue near Central Park. It is expected to be 
ready in late fall or early winter. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS is not expected to reveal Gumbel's co-host on Tuesday.  
Network executives have reportedly considered ABC's Elizabeth 
Vargas and Deborah Norville, who was briefly Gumbel's partner on 
``Today.''

<HEADLINE> Manufacturing Sector Still Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The nation's manufacturing sector continued to  
expand for the third straight month in April, but the growth was 
less robust than in the previous month, corporate purchasing 
executives said in a survey released today. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Purchasing Management reported its  
monthly index of business activity fell to 52.8 percent, down 1.5 
percentage points from its March level. 
</P>
<P>
	``The manufacturing sector continued to improve in April. Both  
production and new orders remained positive and it appears that the 
manufacturing sector has significant momentum, with a much broader 
base of growth this month as 16 of 20 manufacturing industries were 
above the break-even line (of 50),'' said Norbert J. Ore, chairman 
of NAPM's Business Survey Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAPM considers any reading above 50 percent as a sign of  
growth in the industrial sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization assesses the health of the nation's factories,  
and in turn the overall economy, through a monthly survey of its 
members. The trade group's findings are widely followed by 
economists including Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan 
because they usually are the first indicator of how the economy 
performed in the just-ended month. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices jumped 6.7 percentage points to 49.9 percent, but still  
remained below their December 1997 level. That marks the fourth 
straight increase in the prices index and was the largest jump 
since May 1996, said NAPM spokeswoman Zenobia Daruwalla. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebound in prices has sparked concerns about inflation and  
tempered any boost the overall survey might have given the markets, 
said William Sullivan, senior economist with Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It represents a change and we have to be watchful. Clearly  
there is some cause for concern,'' Sullivan said. ``The real 
question is have we turned around to point toward rising inflation 
or is the economic environment so different, that a modest increase 
doesn't have any influence on broad economic trends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While a halt of falling prices could signal a change in the  
economy, Ore said other signs point toward continued growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The strengthening of an order backlog index -- up for the second  
month in a row -- indicates manufacturing activity will continue to 
grow in the next two months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overall picture is one of continuing growth in  
manufacturing activity during the month of April,'' Ore said. 
``Production and new orders remain quite positive and provide an 
indication that the manufacturing sector is gaining strength as we 
move toward the middle of 1999.''

<HEADLINE> Cubans Cheer National Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Cubans rushed home early from work and crowded  
around television sets to cheer their hometown baseball heroes 
during their historic rematch with the Baltimore Orioles at Camden 
Yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The childhood home of Cuban baseball's biggest stars, Javier  
Mendez, was packed with relatives and neighbors watching the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am so proud of my son because he fought hard to be on the  
Cuban team,'' said his father, Javier Mendez Cuadrado, 58. ``Over 
there, we have him defending the Cuban flag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The father said he hoped the game would help bring the American  
and Cuban people closer together. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sports has nothing to do with politics,'' he said. ``We have  
nothing against the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is so moving seeing him up there,'' added the player's  
mother, Mirna, who looked overwhelmed as she watched her son on the 
television set. ``For this he worked so hard, to play for his 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also crowded into the living room of the Mendez family's modest  
home was the player's 82-year-old paternal grandmother, who 
traveled 373 miles to be with her family as she watched her 
grandson play. 
</P>
<P>
	The streets were virtually deserted throughout the neighborhood  
just outside the Havana city limits in the community of Santa Fe. 
Just one uniformed police officer walked the streets outside. 
</P>
<P>
	The street cop was among the very few Cubans not glued to the  
television. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who isn't watching the game in Cuba tonight?'' asked Jose  
Antonio Arenas, a worker at a newspaper stand surrounded by 
neighbors struggling to see the game on his small set. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't miss this game for anything,'' Leonor Limonta said  
as she walked down the stairs of her apartment building to catch 
the game on a television inside a nearby pastry shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker Alejandro Zabater let the shop patrons take over the set  
and change it from the highly popular Colombian soap opera, ``Aroma 
de Mujer (Scent of a Woman),'' to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Partner, I'll do it,'' said a young man who gave his name only  
as Alexander. ``We've got to see this game against the Yuma,'' he 
added, using a colloquial term used to describe Americans. ``We're 
going to win!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the very few not watching Monday night was Ariel Perez,  
who drives a bicycle taxi in Central Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, I'd like to see the game,'' he said. ``But I have to  
work. My economic situation is not good.''

<HEADLINE> Change in Colo. Victims' Crosses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIG ROCK, Ill. (AP) -- A man who erected 15 large wooden crosses  
in Colorado to memorialize those who died at Columbine High School 
says he will change the display after the two crosses for the 
gunmen were torn down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't believe people were angry and defiled the  
crosses,'' Greg Zanis said after the two crosses for the killers, 
Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, were torn down. Harris and 
Klebold committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got involved in this whole process to help with healing,''  
Zanis said Monday. ``When I found out the crosses were not healing, 
I was saddened by it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He says families in Colorado had asked him to make the trip to  
memorialize the Columbine shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Zanis established Crosses for Losses in tribute to his  
father-in-law, who was fatally shot in 1996. Since then he has 
built more than 200 crosses and raised them around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday afternoon, as the 48-year-old general contractor put six  
crosses together for a trip to New Mexico, where children had been 
killed in a bus accident, Zanis announced he will stop again in 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has been asked to return by several people in  
Littleton, including the families of three victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to put 13 (crosses) on one hill, and two on another  
hill,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Buena Vista President Vogel Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *With AM-Disney-Slump    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- David Vogel, who oversaw the production of  
family films such as ``George of the Jungle,'' stepped down Monday 
as president of the Walt Disney Co.'s Buena Vista Motion Pictures 
Group, saying he had lost the autonomy to run the studio as he 
liked. 
</P>
<P>
	Vogel was replaced by Buena Vista executive vice president Todd  
Garner and former DreamWorks SKG executive Nina Jacobson, who will 
act as co-presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Vogel, named president of Buena Vista last year, said his  
ability to run the studio had eroded since the appointment in 
January of Peter Schneider as president of The Walt Disney Studios, 
whose role included oversight of Buena Vista. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm leaving because of the reorganization that was announced  
early this year, that changed my autonomy in terms of Disney live 
action,'' Vogel said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``... I wouldn't say it was so much a personality conflict as it  
was a change of management structure,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	During nine years as a Disney executive, Vogel oversaw the  
production of popular family fare that also included the ``Mighty 
Ducks'' films, ``101 Dalmatians'' and ``Cool Runnings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Disney executives did not respond to a request for comment on  
Vogel's statement. In a news release, Disney Studios chairman Joe 
Roth said Vogel is one of the top production executives in the 
industry ``and we're sorry to see him go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garner, a nine-year Disney veteran, has developed such films as  
``The Waterboy,'' ``Father of the Bride'' and ``Con Air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobson joined Walt Disney Pictures last year and has worked on  
two films, ``Mission to Mars'' and ``The Sixth Sense,'' both of 
which have yet to be released. At DreamWorks, she developed scripts 
and oversaw production for several films, including ``What Lies 
Beneath.''

<HEADLINE> Regulators Probing Online Brokerages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Securities regulators have been fanning out  
across the country investigating online brokerage firms and 
day-trading companies as they consider drafting new rules for the 
fast-growing electronic trading business. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's top securities regulator is expected to  
announce a new initiative on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  
and the National Association of Securities Dealers, a self-policing 
brokers' group, has been conducted over the past two months or so. 
The auditors are looking for possible violations of securities laws 
as well as examining how well the firms execute customers' orders 
and warn them of trading risks. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC ``has been reviewing the policies and practices of  
day-trading and online trading firms over the past few months for 
compliance with the securities laws,'' agency spokesman Duncan King 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the areas of inquiry include trade execution issues as  
well as the disclosure of risk. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, who warned investors early this year  
to use caution in electronic trading, plans to announce Tuesday a 
new related move by the agency, according to two regulatory 
sources. They spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the NASD declined to comment on the investigation.  
</P>
<P>
	Details of the probe were first reported by The Washington Post  
in Saturday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came in here and very thoroughly reviewed us,'' said  
James Lee, head of Momentum Securities Inc., a day-trading company 
based in Houston with 11 offices nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the auditors have visited ``every day-trading firm  
I know'' in recent weeks, said Lee, who also is chairman and 
president of the Electronic Traders Association. That would mean 
about 15 firms. 
</P>
<P>
	By year's end, an estimated 10 million amateur investors will be  
doing at least occasional trading over the Internet, and online 
brokerage accounts will represent about a quarter of all retail 
stock trades. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest online brokerages include Charles Schwab,  
Ameritrade, Datek Online, DLJdirect, Discover Brokerage and E Trade 
Securities. Spokesmen for some of them declined comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In an inquiry sparked by investors' complaints about recent  
computer system crashes at online firms that caused trading delays, 
New York state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer's office has asked 
several firms to provide reports on their services. 
</P>
<P>
	The world of electronic day trading is much smaller but also  
growing. Day traders seek out stocks, especially of high-tech 
companies, solely for sharp price swings and buy and sell them 
quickly to profit from short-term movements in price. 
</P>
<P>
	Day-trading companies sell training courses and special software  
programs to ordinary investors who want to try the risky, 
lightning-speed practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Walker, the SEC's enforcement director, said in March  
that the agency was, among other things, examining the 
advertisements of day-trading firms to see if they make unrealistic 
promises to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	State securities regulators also have been scrutinizing  
day-trading firms and a handful of them, particularly in 
Massachusetts, have filed fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Operators of the day-trading firms acknowledge they're not for  
everyone, but they contend state regulators are unfairly tarnishing 
the industry because of a few rogue firms that may have misled 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, of the electronic traders' group, said he believed the  
purpose of the investigation was ``as much information-gathering as 
they are going after people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at this as (the regulators) trying to understand what's  
going on,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NASD, which operates the Nasdaq Stock Market, has been  
considering since March a new rule that would require day-trading 
firms to screen investors and warn them in writing of the risks. 
</P>
<P>
	In related moves Monday, state securities regulators announced  
they have formed a task force to examine online trading issues such 
as advertising and customer order processing. And the Securities 
Industry Association issued a brochure for investors titled 
``Online Investing Tips.'' It is available on the trade group's Web 
site at www.sia.com.

<HEADLINE> Texas Cities Choose Mayors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- In by far the lightest voter turnout in 30 years,  
Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk has easily won re-election to a second 
four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk captured almost three-fourths of the 38,000 votes cast, a  
turnout of about 5 percent, in beating Margaret Donnelly, an 
immigration lawyer seeing office for the first time, and Billy Jack 
Ludwig, an investor making his sixth mayoral bid since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Donnelly got about 20 percent of the vote and Ludwig less  
than 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Kirk became Dallas' first black mayor, and as a result  
of Saturday's voting, minorities will make up a majority of the 
15-member Dallas City Council for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a ratification of what we accomplished the last  
four years. The people feel good about the direction of the city,'' 
Kirk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk, a lawyer and former Texas secretary of state, promised to  
focus his second term on fixing Dallas streets, keeping the city 
safe and promoting economic development in south Dallas, the 
poorest part of town. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other major Texas cities -- San Antonio, El Paso, Abilene  
and Brownsville -- also had mayoral elections Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In San Antonio, Mayor Howard Peak took 85 percent of the votes  
in a five-way race, with a 7.5 percent turnout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a great victory, not just for me, but for the  
bonds,'' said Peak as voters also approved a $140.2 million package 
to improve streets, drainage, flood control, parks and recreation, 
libraries and public safety. 
</P>
<P>
	El Paso Mayor Carlos Ramirez pulled in 56 percent in beating  
three other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	The only incumbent to fall was Henry Gonzalez in Brownsville,  
who was defeated by Blanca Sanchez Vela, wife of a federal judge. 
With all ballots counted, Ms. Vela received 4,700 votes, or 56 
percent to Gonzalez's 44 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In Abilene, Grady Barr, former president of the Abilene Chamber  
of Commerce, was elected mayor with 63 percent of the vote, 
defeating A.R. ``Fal'' Falcioni. The incumbent, Gary McCaleb, did 
not seek re-election.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A personal computer and an Internet connection  
will get you into the movie premiere of ``Dead Broke,'' a dark 
comedy starring Paul Sorvino. 
</P>
<P>
	The film is believed to be the first to debut simultaneously on  
the Internet and the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
	The film's executives and cast members, which include John  
Glover, Tony Roberts and Jill Hennessy, will be seeing a digital 
version, too. The Tribeca Film Center will download the feed and 
route it through a digital projector, USA Today reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Edward Vilga-directed ``Dead Broke'' is the first of a  
four-film series that iFilm Network, in conjunction with Globix, 
Microsoft and the Tribeca Film Center, will premiere on the 
Internet. IFilm is an online community of independent filmmakers 
and fans. 
</P>
<P>
	PC users will need an ultrafast T-1 connection to watch the  
movie ``seamlessly,'' but iFilm founder Rodger Raderman said that a 
fast connection will provide decent images and sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers will not have to wait for the entire film to download  
before seeing it. It takes only a few seconds for the movie to 
begin to play, Raderman explained. As the movie is being viewed, 
the rest of it is streaming behind it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dead Broke'' can be seen at www.ifilm.net at 2 p.m. EDT on  
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Exiles Say Game is Pure Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *PATRICIA MALDONADO   	
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- It's just baseball, right?  
</P>
<P>
	For Cubans living in exile in South Florida, the game between  
the Baltimore Orioles and the Cuban national team represents 
politics -- Fidel Castro style. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fidel uses sports, the arts, whatever he can to promote his  
politics. This is just more of the same,'' said Arnaldo Bosque of 
Miami. ``What he is interested in is in promoting his cause and 
popularity -- being treated like a god.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many Cubans in Miami oppose the game and are eager to let people  
outside the predominantly Hispanic Miami know just why. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred Cubans from Miami, Tampa, New Jersey, New York  
and Washington made the trip to Baltimore to protest the game 
outside Camden Yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubans in Miami staged their demonstration on Calle Ocho -- or  
8th Street -- the main drag in the city's Little Havana 
neighborhood. More than a 100 people gathered to show their 
opposition to any kind of U.S.-Cuba relations, whether on the 
baseball field or in a conference room. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's wrong for the United States to have a friendly  
relationship with Cuba,'' said Miguel Saaverdra, president of 
Vigilia Mambisa, a human rights organization. ``In Cuba, Castro 
doesn't give anyone rights. People in Cuba are dying. They are 
being persecuted. Everything is done to benefit tourists, and 
that's at the sacrifice of human rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's game marked the first time a Cuban team has played a  
major league team in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	When the two teams first met in Havana in March, Cubans here  
couldn't help but watch the Orioles defeat their former home team 
3-2 in 11 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	The same Cuban restaurants where locals packed tables to watch  
the first game between the two ball clubs were mostly empty Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	At Latin American Restaurant on Coral Way in Miami, the  
televisions were tuned to Spanish soap operas and popular 
prime-time sitcoms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's Monday, people have just paid their rent and their  
taxes,'' said Carlos Rodriguez, manger of Sergios, a Cuban sports 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
	Only four people asked to watch the game at Sergio's, a Little  
Havana sports bar. Manager Carlos Rodriguez avoided watching the 
game, but said he wanted the Orioles to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any victory for the Cuban team would be a victory for  
Castro,'' Rodriguez said. ``And that's not good for any Cuban.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Rodriguez, many Cubans vowed not to watch, regardless of  
their curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will just be a bunch of Castro's slaves taking the field,''  
said Raimundo Pereira-Hernandez, a bartender. ``None of those 
players has the freedom to leave the country and play ball anywhere 
else. If they don't tow the political line, they don't even get a 
chance to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball fan Julio Arango said he would watch the game, and he  
accepts the fact that it is more than just baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Castro must be loving this,'' he said. ``We are playing into  
his hands. He's getting a lot of publicity out of this.''

<HEADLINE> Colo. Officials Warn of Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Colorado officials told the nation's  
attorneys general to prepare for the kind of school violence that 
recently turned one of their affluent suburbs into a battleground. 
</P>
<P>
	``Six weeks ago I would have said that this is the last place in  
America that school violence like this could happen,'' said Dave 
Thomas, district attorney of Jefferson County, Colo., where the 
Columbine High shootings occurred. ``But I am here to tell you that 
it can happen everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas told participants at the two-day National Association of  
Attorneys General summit on youth and school violence that 
Littleton, Colo., is a white-collar, middle class area where 
students aren't faced with the limits of poverty and neglect that 
are often associated with violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has everything you would think that you would need to  
prevent school violence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, none of that stopped Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan  
Klebold, 17, from going into Columbine High School on April 20 and 
killing 12 students and one teacher before shooting themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado Attorney General Ken Salazar said addressing violence  
committed by minors on and off school campuses must become a top 
priority in all states. 
</P>
<P>
	And better relations among politicians can result in better  
programs to detect youth and school violence, said Troy Eid, chief 
legal counsel to Colorado Gov. Bill Owens. 
</P>
<P>
	``You do not build trust in a time of urgency, do it now while  
you can,'' Eid said. ``Because if times get tough you're going to 
need one another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ari Zavaras, Colorado's public safety director, urged the  
attorneys general to get their law enforcement agencies, community 
leaders and policy makers together for possible violence in their 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do any of you think this will be the last time this happens?''  
he asked. ``Because I'm sure don't.''

<HEADLINE> Smith-De Bruin Appeals Drug Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Triple Olympic gold medallist  
Michelle Smith-De Bruin appealed to an international panel Monday 
to overturn her four-year drug ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Lennon, Smith-De Bruin's lawyer, told the International  
Court of Arbitration for Sport that the swimmer had been denied ``a 
reasonable judgment'' and that FINA, swimming's world governing 
body, had failed to prove she had tampered with a urine sample. 
</P>
<P>
	Lennon said the decision last August by a FINA doping panel  
``was patently unsound.'' FINA held Smith-De Bruin responsible for 
tampering with the out-of-competition urine test taken at her home 
in Kilkenny, Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have to prove my innocence here,'' Smith-De Bruin told  
the tribunal when asked whether she had tampered with the sample. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel heard the accounts of Smith-De Bruin and Albert Guy,  
who with his wife, Kay, supervised the collection of the sample. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither could say how the sample could have been contaminated,  
but Guy said he noticed ``a sweetish, somewhat sickly odor'' when 
it was decanted into containers for processing. 
</P>
<P>
	FINA said the sample was contaminated with large amounts of  
alcohol, probably whiskey. 
</P>
<P>
	Guy said he watched the decanting in Smith-De Bruin's kitchen  
and that he didn't comment on the odor because he couldn't tell 
where it was coming from. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith-De Bruin said there was a brief period when she took her  
eyes off the sample as she went to get a drink of water. 
</P>
<P>
	FINA lawyer Jean-Pierre Morand said it was clear that someone  
had tampered with the samples before they came under the control of 
FINA. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us this case is a case of tampering,'' Morand told the  
three-arbitrator panel. ``Something happened with those samples, 
and I don't think it can be disputed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ban includes the Sydney 2000 Olympics and the 2001 World  
Championships, and effectively ends the 28-year-old Irish swimmer's 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am fighting for my reputation and for my right to go to  
Sydney,'' Smith-De Bruin said after the ban was handed down. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith had a mediocre record before capturing three gold medals  
and a bronze at the Atlanta Games, three years after Erik de Bruin 
became her coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Her marriage to de Bruin, the Dutch discus and shot put champion  
banned for four years after testing positive to excessive 
testosterone, stirred speculation that her own meteoric rise had 
been aided by drugs. But she said she had been tested more often 
than any of her rivals and each time the result was negative.

<HEADLINE> Cause of Ark. Boat Accident Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- Investigators said Monday they will  
take underwater pictures of the boat that dragged 13 tourists to 
their deaths in seconds in hopes of learning how the accident 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
	The World War II-vintage tourist boat had been in the repair  
shop just two days before it sank in Lake Hamilton on Saturday, 
drowning 13 of its 21 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators want to know if repair work done to the boat's  
drive-shaft was the cause of the accident, or if two other seals in 
the boat's hull were responsible. They say a videotape of the wreck 
on the lake bottom will help. 
</P>
<P>
	``The interest is to document the condition of the vessel before  
they attach devices to lift it to the surface so we make sure we 
don't see salvage-imposed damage when it gets to the surface,'' 
said Capt. Glenn Anderson, chief of the Coast Guard's 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators concentrated on the possible failure of three  
separate seals on the vessel -- 4-inch drain plugs on the boat's 
thin, metal bottom; rubber boots on the wheel casings; and a 1-inch 
sealed drive-shaft opening. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the amphibious boat -- called a ``duck'' because  
it can travel on both land and water -- sank in a matter of seconds 
as passengers scrambled for life preservers, which were not 
required to be worn on the vessel. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said water pouring through a 4-inch hole would have  
caused the boat to sink as swiftly as it did. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Powers said that, when he first noticed water pooling in  
the stern of the boat, he stood up and started throwing life vests 
at other passengers. He last saw his wife, Danna, 32, as she 
struggled to fit a life vest over the head of their 8-year-old 
daughter, Madeline, he said. The girl survived; his wife died. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tossed them the jacket and said `Get out of here now,'''  
said Powers, 34, of Little Rock. ``It was that quick. We were under 
water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some victims -- especially those near the center of the vessel --  
may have been prevented from swimming free by an overhead canopy. 
Most of the victims were found still inside the sunken boat. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said his formal report to the Coast Guard would include  
recommendations for changing the rules about wearing life 
preservers and installing canopies that can more easily be 
punctured if a boat sinks. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board  
obtained copies Monday of maintenance records from the shop where 
the fleet of White and Yellow Duck Tour boats operated by Land and 
Lake Tours Inc., are serviced. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said they had not had time to review the records. An  
attorney for mechanics Bill Woodall and Mike Oliver said a leaky 
accordion-shaped rubber boot on the boat's main drive shaft was 
replaced Friday. He said Oliver did the work and called it routine. 
</P>
<P>
	``They feel bad about it,'' attorney Morse U. Gist Jr. said.  
``What they've told me is that they've gone over and over in their 
minds anything that they could have done that was not done 
correctly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the NTSB began its own under-oath interviews Monday, with  
the owner of the company that operated the boat, the mechanics and 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Q. Byrum Hurst, lawyer for Land and Lake Tours, said employees  
were cooperating fully with the NTSB. He also said the company was 
conducting its own internal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said tour boats operating in the Hot Springs area,  
including the boat that sank, had received a clean bill from 
inspections done in February. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no laundry list of wrong things,'' he said. ``That  
was a clean bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Contractors were to arrive Tuesday to videotape the vessel,  
which sits under 50 feet of murky water.

<HEADLINE> DC United President Fined $15,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Kevin Payne, president and general manager of  
the D.C. United, was fined $15,000 by the MLS for remarks he made 
following his team's loss to the Chicago Fire on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, I have fined Kevin Payne the sum of $15,000 for his  
conduct and public statements made during and after the match,'' 
MLS commissioner Doug Logan said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	D.C. United, which won the first two league titles and lost the  
championship to the Fire last year, has lost three straight games. 
At Chicago, the Fire won 3-2 in a game marred by 11 yellow-card 
cautions and three red-card ejections from Stuard Dougal, a referee 
in the Scottish Premier League who was working the game as part of 
an MLS exchange program. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we witnessed tonight was an absolute travesty,'' Payne  
said. ``In all the years I've been around soccer, I've never seen 
anything like that performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we need to go 4,000 miles to get a referee that  
poor. If he did this in Scotland, he'd never referee again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dougal, rated the No. 3 referee in Scotland, has given out 26  
cards in three games. 
</P>
<P>
	The ejection of D.C. defender Brian Kamler in the 16th minute  
even was questioned by Fire coach Bob Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the early red card was appropriate,'' Bradley  
said. ``At most, it's a yellow card.''

<HEADLINE> Soldini Nears Yacht Race Finish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- After enduring hurricane-force winds and  
becalmed seas, Giovanni Soldini is almost there. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian sailor, who made a daring rescue at sea, was closing  
in on a record finish Monday in the Around Alone solo yacht race. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini was about 720 miles from Charleston on the last leg of  
the around-the-world race of 27,000 miles that began in Charleston 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Race officials said he could encounter lighter winds by midweek  
and he was not expected back in Charleston until Thursday. Still, 
Soldini's projected time is just under 116 days, about five days 
faster than the record set by Christophe Auguin in 1991 when the 
race was known as the BOC Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory by Soldini would be ``hugely significant'' as a  
challenge to French dominance of the sport, race director Mark 
Schrader said. ``What it basically says is the French have been 
doing this kind of sailing for longer and they have spent more 
money on boat design. Now it's evening out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frenchman Marc Thiercelin, with the only other 60-foot boat  
still in the race, was about 360 miles behind Soldini but more than 
11 days back in the overall standings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the smaller, 50-foot boat division, Mike Garside led  
Frenchman J.P. Mouligne by about 275 miles with about 1,400 miles 
left to go to reach Charleston. But Mouligne, who won the three 
previous legs, is the apparent winner of the division. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 16 boats that started, nine remain in the race, an  
attrition rate about the same as previous races, Schrader said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has always been close to 40 percent that don't make it. I  
am disappointed for the people who were unable to finish. This 
race, weatherwise, was incredibly difficult,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The race included stopovers in Cape Town, South Africa;  
Auckland, New Zealand; and Punta del Este, Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some extraordinary storms in the south before Cape  
Horn,'' Schrader said. ``It was uncomfortable coming out of Uruguay 
this time and slower than last time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most dramatic moment was when Soldini rescued Isabelle  
Autissier from her overturned boat PRB in the frigid Southern 
Ocean. Her boat was sailing in 20-knot winds when her automatic 
pilot made an error, the sails shifted and the boat flipped. 
</P>
<P>
	The yacht, which was supposed to right itself, never did and  
Autissier had only enough time to close the watertight cabin hatch 
and wait for rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	People around the world monitored the race's Internet site for  
dispatches describing how Soldini sailed 200 miles through 40 mph 
winds and waves as high as 30 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	When he found the overturned yacht, there was no sign of  
Autissier. But Soldini tossed a hammer at the hull and she quickly 
emerged from an escape hatch. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other sailors also got help from a Boston physician who  
makes virtual house calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Dan Carlin of the WorldClinic at the New England Medical  
Center told Mouligne the antibiotics to use to treat an infected 
knee after the sailor took digital photographs of it and sent them 
via e-mail to the doctor. Carlin earlier guided Russian sailor 
Viktor Yazykov through surgery to treat an abscess on his arm after 
Yazykov's elbow swelled with infection.

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Meritt M. Burnett, who attributed his  
longevity to doing all things in moderation and who smoked cigars 
until he was 107, died Tuesday of prostate cancer. He was 109. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Bloomingdale, Ind., in 1890, Burnett recalled that his  
grandfathers hid slaves on the Underground Railroad. He retired 
from the Export-Import Bank as head messenger in 1960 and later 
opened his home to Howard University students for room and board.

	VENTURA, Calif. (AP) -- Francis Gherini, who won a battle with  
the federal government after it seized his Santa Cruz Island 
ranchland for a park, died Tuesday. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Gherini died from injuries he suffered the previous week when he  
collapsed and struck his head on a driveway. 
</P>
<P>
	Gherini, who lived in Ventura, was patriarch of a family that  
since 1880 had owned thousands of acres of land on Santa Cruz 
Island, 20 miles off the Ventura County coast. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, the island was designated to become part of a  
five-island national park chain. In the early 1990s, the National 
Park Service bought out Gherini's three siblings. But he rejected a 
$4 million offer for his 6,300 acres, contending it was worth $14 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	He sued after the government condemned and seized the land in  
1997, and a federal jury awarded him $12.7 million in February.

	LONDON (AP) -- Oliver Reed, the feisty, hard-drinking actor who  
was as well known for his antics off screen as he was for his 
performances on screen, died Sunday in Malta. He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, who played the fearsome Bill Sikes in the 1968 musical  
``Oliver!'', died on the way to a hospital after taking ill while 
drinking with friends in a bar in the Maltese capital, Valetta, 
police said. The cause of death was not immediately disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed was on the Mediterranean island filming a new movie, ``The  
Gladiator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His 53 films include ``Women in Love,'' ``The Devils,'' and  
``Tommy,'' all directed by the eccentric Englishman Ken Russell. 
</P>
<P>
	But Reed was often better-known for misdeeds away from the  
camera and well-publicized drinking bouts.

                         *Joseph Rosenblatt    	
</P>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Joseph Rosenblatt, a Utah philanthropist  
who was decorated by the French government, died Sunday at the age 
of 96. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenblatt served on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of  
San Francisco from 1965 to 1974, which made him the longest-serving 
director in the U.S. Federal Reserve System from the corporate 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Jan 13, 1903 to Russian emigres, Rosenblatt became director  
of Eimco Corp. in the 1930s and turned the Salt Lake company into 
the largest manufacturer of rock loaders for underground mining. 
Before he resigned in 1964, he expanded Eimco into a leading maker

and wastewater-treatment industries.

	After leaving Eimco, he dedicated much of his life to  
philanthropic works, focusing on higher-education programs at the 
University of Utah and in Israel, and Holy Cross and University

</P>
<P>
	OXNARD, Calif. (AP) -- Roderick Thorp, a master of suspense  
fiction whose best-selling novels ``Die Hard'' and ``The 
Detective'' became popular movies, died of a heart attack 
Wednesday. He was 62. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorp, whose career spanned more than three decades, won prizes  
for short-story writing while attending City College of New York 
but was unable to find success as an author after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he went to work in his father's private detective  
business. Over nine years, he gathered knowledge that stood him in 
good stead in his writing career. 
</P>
<P>
	Success as an author came with his 1966 book ``The Detective.''  
It sold millions of copies worldwide and was turned into a movie 
starring Frank Sinatra and Lee Remick. 
</P>
<P>
	He taught literature at Ramapo College in Mahwah, N.J., then  
moved to Los Angeles in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	His 1979 detective novel ``Nothing Lasts Forever'' was renamed  
``Die Hard'' in its second edition, which later became a 1988 hit 
movie starring Bruce Willis. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his later books was 1995's well-reviewed ``River: A Novel  
of the Green River Killings.'' It was a fictionalized account of an 
unsolved series of murders that occurred in the 1980s in the 
Pacific Northwest.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Joyce Anderson Valdez, an ardent supporter  
and fund-raiser for the Republican party, died Wednesday after a 
long illness. She was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Valdez, who once served as state GOP finance director,  
organized events from the early 1960s to the mid-1980s that raised 
more than $100 million for Republican candidates, including 
Presidents Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford and George Bush and Governors 
Pete Wilson and George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
	She also helped candidates whose bids turned out to be  
unsuccessful, including GOP presidential candidate Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Valdez often used celebrities to draw supporters to events,  
including Frank Sinatra, Wayne Newton, and Reagan, a longtime 
friend. When he was governor, Reagan appointed Ms. Valdez 
commissioner of the state's Industrial Welfare Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Valdez also was an avid golfer and became a nationally  
top-ranked amateur in the sport.

</P>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Mark Weiser, the Xerox Corp.  
technologist known as ``the father of ubiquitous computing,'' died 
Tuesday from complications of cancer. He was 46. 
</P>
<P>
	With his staunch belief that computer technology could be folded  
into all aspects of daily life, Weiser was celebrated in the 
high-tech world as a visionary and computer science pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
	He often spoke of the day when a person's refrigerator might  
remind a shopper that he needed milk or when office workers would 
be surrounded by ``smart'' printers and copy machines. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was driven by looking at how computers could simplify our  
lives and improve the quality of our living and the quality of our 
experience,'' said John Seely Brown, the director of the Palo Alto 
Research Center and a Xerox vice president. ``He was really 
interested in the mantra of, `How do you fit computers to people,' 
rather than people to computers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, at a time of huge mainframe and desktop computers,  
Weiser coined the term ``ubiquitous computing'' to describe a 
vision of computers disappearing into the objects used in daily 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, he left Xerox to commercialize some of his ideas. But a  
company he formed failed during a time when Silicon Valley venture 
capitalists were pouring money into Internet startups. Weiser 
returned to the research center as its chief technology officer in 
1996.

<P>
	KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) -- Wearing caps and capes in party colors,  
Nepalese waited in long lines today to elect a new parliament while 
security forces stood guard against more attacks by Maoist 
guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
	Police told voters to leave guns at home and walk to polling  
stations for Nepal's third election in eight years. Cars, buses and 
other vehicles were banned from the streets as a security 
precaution after two weekend attacks left two policemen and three 
rebels dead and five officials seriously wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurgents have asked people to boycott the elections.  
</P>
<P>
	Two party activists were shot today during an attack on Madhav  
Kumar Nepal, general secretary of the United Marxist-Leninist 
Communist Party of Nepal in Saruhata village, 120 miles south of 
Katmandu, said politburo member Pradeep Nepal. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the gun-mounted military jeeps patrolling Katmandu, the  
capital took on a party atmosphere among the hundreds who waited 
more than an hour to vote. Communist supporters donned white caps 
with red stars blazing in the sun. National Democratic Party 
activists wrapped themselves with blue and green party flags. 
</P>
<P>
	The carnival mood was a sharp contrast to the poorly attended  
campaign rallies. Many voters expect Nepal's 30 parties to split 
the 205-seat parliament and produce another hung legislature or 
weak government. 
</P>
<P>
	Rampant corruption, stagnant development and the Maoist  
insurgency are the key national issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest polls showed the centrist Nepali Congress slightly  
ahead of its main rival, the United Marxist-Leninist Communist 
Party of Nepal, which has suffered a major split since the last 
elections. The two parties are partners in the present caretaker 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most political parties have split in the past year and the  
votes are going to be divided,'' said Meena Tuladhar, a housewife.

	Nearly 45,000 policemen were guarding polling stations today in  
34 districts. Hundreds of soldiers were on standby. 
</P>
<P>
	A second round of voting for the other 41 districts was  
scheduled for May 17 to give security forces the chance to guard

<TEXT>
<P>
	MOORE, Okla. (AP) -- As far as the eye could see there was  
debris. Just debris. Not one house stood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh my God! Oh my God!'' one woman yelled. Others just  
wandered, stunned. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's gone,'' LeeAnn Richardson said as she looked toward where  
her home once stood along Regency Street in this Oklahoma City 
suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were just standing in there and looking at the weather on  
television,'' Ms. Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	They ran to their storm cellar when clouds rolled in and rain  
started pouring down. Sixteen people and four pets were in the 
storm cellar. All survived without injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``We opened up and everything was gone,'' Ms. Richardson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Phillip and Jennifer Schantz stood in the front yard where their  
home used to be. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just bought this house,'' Mrs. Schantz said as she clung to  
her young daughter and wept. They weren't home when the storm hit 
about 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Rows and rows of houses were destroyed. Trucks were overturned.  
Firefighters from nearby Norman battled a house that was ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
	Power lines and piles of carpet were everywhere.  
</P>
<P>
	Catherine Meyers sat on the tailgate of a pickup truck that was  
being used by a Red Cross volunteer. Injured people waited for 
ambulances. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Meyers hid under a mattress when the storm blew over her  
home. Afterward, she bled from the head and her right arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mattress didn't help me,'' she said. ``I got hit four or  
five times on the head by something. I've lost a lot of blood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, Melvin, injured his right knee and left wrist. He  
bled from the head. He said he hid under a different mattress that 
was sucked up out of the house when the roof blew off. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first burst it took it out of there. Part of the ceiling  
fell in on me and shaded me,'' Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were in our storm cellars. We were watching TV and I knew  
to get into the storm cellar. I could feel it going over -- the 
pressure in your ears,'' Rhonda Hall said as she stood in the 
driveway of her home. 
</P>
<P>
	Her roof and the north wall were missing. She said her husband  
and two pets were in the storm cellar. No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Loretta and Theresa Jones said they survived the storm by hiding  
in their closet in their home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We heard it coming and -- Whoa, Whoa, Jesus -- we called on his  
name and I felt his arms come around us and saved us from that 
tornado. And I thank God for that,'' Theresa Jones said.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Refugees Recount Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLACE, Macedonia (AP) -- Ethnic Albanian refugees have reported a  
day of slaughter and arson by Serb forces in a central Kosovo 
village. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses fleeing into Macedonia on Sunday claimed that Serb  
forces killed at least 32 people in Slovinje, buried them in mass 
graves -- then later dug them up and forced residents to dig 
individual graves for the decomposing bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Death was all around us,'' said Nebahate Gashi, who claimed  
her husband, Omer, was among five people executed outside their 
home on April 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Accounts of the reported massacre were gathered from nearly a  
dozen other refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Masked militiamen, most with beards and long hair, entered the  
village 10 miles southeast of Pristina, the refugees said. People 
were ordered to leave their homes, identity papers and other 
documents were destroyed and many homes were set on fire, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people were lined up and shot at point-blank range, such as  
Omer Gashi and the four others, the refugees alleged. Others were 
attacked with knives, and at least one elderly woman was fatally 
burned. 
</P>
<P>
	Xhevat Gashi said a neighbor was hacked to death. He also  
claimed he saw a woman engulfed in flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities later used construction equipment to make two mass  
graves of at least 16 bodies each, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some refugees claimed the death toll was higher. They say Serbs  
also fired at people hiding in the forest outside the village of 
about 4,500 people. One resident, Agim Devshi, estimated at least 
45 people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, authorities exhumed the bodies from the graves and  
delivered them to family members, the refugees said. Armed police 
guards watched as families were forced to dig individual graves, 
they alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then we were told to leave at once,'' said Xhevat Gashi.  
</P>
<P>
	A U.N. refugee official said the reports are apparently part of  
a pattern of escalating Serb reprisals in areas near the Macedonian 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conflict appears definitely to be spreading,'' said Paula  
Ghedini, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. 
``We are hearing stories that could rival Racak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 45 ethnic Albanians were slain outside Racak on Jan.  
15, increasing Western pressure on Yugoslavia to accept a peace 
plan for Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Reported attacks on ethnic Albanians in southern Kosovo have  
sharply increased the refugee tide into Macedonia, where camps are 
severely overcrowded and health officials worry about outbreaks of 
epidemics like cholera and measles. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 5,000 refugees passed through the main Blace border  
post on Sunday. Thousands of others were crossing over the steep 
mountains, which Serbs have dotted with minefields. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three refugees died last week after stepping on mines  
in the ill-defined border between Yugoslavia and Macedonia.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Cancer Research Uses Soybeans / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Agriculture Department scientists are  
searching through leftovers from soybean oil and protein extraction 
for components that might help cancer-free people avoid the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea, according to the Agricultural Research Service, is to  
turn DNA-friendly compounds, called chemoprotectants, into food 
additives and pharmaceuticals. Some natural and synthetic chemicals 
cause DNA disruptions that sometimes result in malignancies, but 
chemoprotectants help protect against irreversible cell damage, ARS 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans and other foods contain substances called antioxidants  
that can help prevent cell mutations. Some of the antioxidant soy 
extracts, which are called isoflavones, are marketed as food 
additives. 
</P>
<P>
	ARS scientists at the National Center for Agricultural  
Utilization Research in Peoria, Ill., and other scientists at the 
University of Illinois in Champaign are looking for new 
chemoprotectants. 
</P>
<P>
	The soy leftovers make up a gooey molasses that has been used as  
livestock feed. Chemoprotectants isolated from the leftovers could 
become, pound for pound, more valuable than the main processed soy 
products. A light brown powder called phytochemical concentrate, or 
PCC, isolated from the molasses, contains a mixture of these potent 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
	In the research, university scientists are exposing cell  
cultures of Chinese hamster lungs and ovaries to PCC components 
prepared by the ARS scientists. Then they challenge the cells with 
a chemical known to induce tumors. Later, they assess DNA breakage 
in the cells and identify the most protective PCCs. 
</P>
<P>
	In preliminary studies, mice fed certain PCC components seem to  
be protected from some forms of cell damage. These components 
include molecules that are much more antimutagenic than flavonoids, 
which are antioxidants found in many foods. 
</P>
<P>
	The research, supported in part by the United Soybean Board, may  
serve as a model for research on other foods, ARS said. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Animals with four stomachs, known as  
ruminants, may be protected from an affliction known as grass 
tetany by a new tall fescue grass called HiMag. 
</P>
<P>
	When ruminants -- cattle, sheep, goats and deer -- have too little  
magnesium in their blood, they can get grass tetany. 
</P>
<P>
	Also known as hypomagnesemia, grass tetany is often fatal. It  
causes an estimated $50 million to $150 million in livestock 
production losses each year in the United States, according to the 
Agricultural Research Service. 
</P>
<P>
	American pastureland has more tall fescue than any other forage  
grass. The new variety is unusually high in magnesium and should 
help protect vulnerable animals from magnesium deficiencies, ARS 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans call for HiMag seed to be made available to plant breeders  
this year, according to ARS soil scientist Henry F. Mayland at the 
agency's irrigation and soils research laboratory in Kimberly, 
Idaho. Mayland developed HiMag tall fescue with Glenn E. Shewmaker 
of the University of Idaho, formerly with ARS, and David A. Sleper 
and colleagues at the University of Missouri, Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of breeding a high-magnesium forage grass to fight  
grass tetany isn't new. But the scientists are the first to 
accomplish it with tall fescue, ARS said. 
</P>
<P>
	They recommend HiMag for rain-fed pastures in eastern,  
southeastern and Pacific Northwestern States and British Columbia. 
So far, it has been tested in Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Missouri, 
New York, Texas, Utah and Virginia, as well as in Canada.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Fire Blamed on Air Force Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BASS RIVER TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) -- An errant bomb from an Air  
Force plane was blamed today for a forest fire that burned for a 
fourth day in southern New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb, which sends up smoke but no shrapnel, was supposed to  
be dropped on a target at the Warren Grove Bombing Range. 
</P>
<P>
	It missed by 1 1/2 miles and landed in a state forest, igniting a  
fire that has burned 11,000 acres -- or nearly 18 square miles -- in 
Pine Barrens since Friday, said Dave Harrison, chief of the New 
Jersey Forest Fire Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Accidents do happen,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear what kind of plane dropped the bomb, or why it  
missed its target so badly. An official with the New Jersey Air 
National Guard's 108th Air Refueling Wing, which operates the 
bombing range, would say only that the mistake was under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once that investigation is complete, we'll go ahead and  
release results and details. At this time, we're not releasing any 
information,'' said Capt. Kris Frazier, public affairs officer. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Forest Fire Service, the 25-pound bomb is  
designed to send up a plume of smoke so it can be spotted from the 
air, allowing training officers to know where it landed.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Snagger Shares His Secrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just call him the baseball kid.  
</P>
<P>
	Home runs, pop-ups, line drives, fungoes, foul tips and the  
occasional pepper throw -- Zack Hample has caught them all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd watch the games on TV and see fans catch balls. The camera  
would focus on them, they'd hold up the ball, dance around and 
everybody would cheer. The first time I saw it happen at a game, I 
was hooked. I wanted a ball,'' Hample said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now -- more than 1,200 baseballs and 18 stadiums later -- the king  
of snagging balls hit or thrown by the pros is sharing his secrets 
in ``How to Snag Major League Baseballs,'' (Aladdin Paperbacks, 
$3.99, 140 pages). 
</P>
<P>
	There's the obvious: Bring a glove and sit in a section where  
you know a player regularly whacks the ball. ``You're more likely 
to get hit by lightning than catching a home run ball,'' says the 
21-year-old Manhattan native who goes to Guilford College in 
Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are other surefire ways to get a game ball, he writes.  
The book -- one part biography and two parts tips with a splash of 
trivia -- takes readers on a step-by-step guide of how to leave a 
stadium with a baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	The process begins with when to arrive at a ballpark, how to get  
a player to throw a ball your way, how to sneak into better seats 
and where to sit to catch game balls. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also a section on baseball-catching ethics: Don't try to  
catch a ball meant for another fan during batting practice, don't 
steal a game ball out of somebody's glove, and always say thank 
you. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know this works because I have more than 1,200 balls,'' said  
Hample, who started writing the book two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Stuart Hample, an author of children's books, admits  
he enabled his son's baseball fever by letting him go to so many 
games. But he says he's thankful his son put his energy into 
something he enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that he took all this passion and put it into  
something and then was able to put it in a book is marvelous,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Hample began collecting balls in 1990 during a New  
York Mets game. Over time, he picked up tricks of his trade: Take 
both teams' hats to the game and learn different languages. 
</P>
<P>
	He caught his 1,000th ball in June 1996 at Shea Stadium. Then  
Atlanta Braves pitcher Pedro Borbon Jr. was heading to the bullpen 
when Hample asked him in Spanish: ``Dame la bola, por favor?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because he was wearing a Braves cap, Borbon threw him the ball.  
</P>
<P>
	Hample admits he goes to extremes for his ball-catching  
obsession -- jumping railings, seats and, sometimes, people. He's 
been scraped, cut, bruised and whacked in pursuit of baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ball lasts forever, the injury goes away,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hample has every ball he's ever caught. All are documented and  
filed away -- literally. Most are stored in a four-drawer filing 
cabinet in his bedroom in his family's Manhattan apartment. The 
rest are stored in a plastic tub. 
</P>
<P>
	``Space has been a problem. But I'll sleep on them if I have  
to,'' he said. ``I'm not going to get rid of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's had plenty of offers though. For the very first ball he  
caught, he was offered $50. He turned the guy down, saying he 
wouldn't sell it for $500. 
</P>
<P>
	He's got a Mark McGwire ball thrown to him by the slugger, then  
a member of the Oakland Athletics, and he caught New York Yankee 
Mike Stanley's first home run of the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Heffner of Leland's Auction House in New York says some of  
Hample's collection is probably worth big money. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people out there who have spent millions of dollars  
on baseball collectibles,'' he said. ``If he's got more than 1,200 
balls, he's probably got something ... a collector would pay big 
money for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for Hample, it's about catching balls.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I wanted to see a game, I would watch it on TV and have a  
better view,'' he said. ``I go to the game to catch baseballs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's looking to catch a World Series ball and at least one  
ball in every major league stadium.

<HEADLINE> RealNetworks Releases MP3 Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- RealNetworks Inc., a leading maker of Internet  
audio and video software, is expected to announce Monday a new 
product that it and its partners hope will help tame the 
free-for-all of Web music. 
</P>
<P>
	RealJukebox will be the first complete digital music system for  
Internet personal computers, officials at the Seattle company said. 
Among other features, RealJukebox will allow users to load tracks 
from music CDs onto a computer hard drive and to find and download 
the huge number of tunes in MP3 and other formats now available 
over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``RealJukebox is the biggest breakthrough in music listening  
since the Walkman,'' said Rob Glaser, RealNetworks chairman and 
chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The product, a ``beta'' or test version of which is available  
free from RealNetworks' Web site, is being released amidst a flurry 
of deals with IBM Corp., Thompson Multimedia and its RCA-brand 
electronic products, and Amazon.com Inc., Tower Records and 33 
other Web merchants. Also on board are some 60 musical groups and 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
	The MP3 format allows near-CD quality recordings to be  
transmitted over the Internet, but also has given rise to 
widespread piracy as people trade unauthorized copies of tunes for 
free. 
</P>
<P>
	RealJukebox is designed to let music publishers, artists and Web  
companies get a piece of the action, by combining mass distribution 
with software for copyright protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``RealNetworks is striking the right balance between  
responsibility and being cool,'' said Chuck D of rap group Public 
Enemy in a statement. ``RealJukebox will drive the industry's 
transition to digital distribution faster than vinyl to CDs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Public Enemy is releasing a free song from a forthcoming album  
via RealNetworks' Internet site for MP3 music, RealGuide for 
RealJukebox. Others making music available through the site include 
Julian Lennon, Randy Newman, The Offspring, George Clinton and the 
P-Funk All Stars, and They Might Be Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Other software exists to download MP3 files, and to convert  
music CDs to computer files. 
</P>
<P>
	RealNetworks says its program combines those functions, plus it  
can organize and retrieve music files by title, artist or category; 
handle a broad spectrum of music formats; and convert files for use 
on portable digital players like the Diamond Rio or Creative Nomad. 
It also allows a PC to be plugged into stereo systems as a CD or 
MP3 player. 
</P>
<P>
	Working with the Internet partners and RealGuide, RealJukebox  
can search out and display information about artists and albums and 
give access to online music stores and record company promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	RealJukebox and its underlying software also maintain the  
``serial copyright management system,'' a federally required 
implant into recorded products to prevent their unauthorized 
copying, and will support a system being developed to track and 
charge for downloaded music. 
</P>
<P>
	As with its other products, RealNetworks will give away the  
basic consumer software at its Internet site (www.real.com), but 
will offer a premium version with additional features for a price. 
It charges media producers and distributors for their versions of 
the software, and also makes money off the numerous marketing 
deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital music sales are now only a sliver of the $12 billion  
music industry, but are expected to grow dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
	With fast, cheap PCs and ``dirt-cheap hard drives,''  
RealNetworks foresees a huge market, said Dave Richards, 
RealNetworks' head of consumer products. ``There are very few speed 
bumps in the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	RealNetworks' ``streaming media'' technology already is used by  
more than 60 million people to play music, listen to radio and 
watch video over the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 13, RealNetworks said it would buy Xing Technology  
Corp. of San Luis Obispo, Calif., maker of the AudioCatalyst MP3 
software. That product has been merged into RealJukebox. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, another key deal for the new product fell into  
place when RealNetworks said it would integrate its technology with 
IBM's Electronic Music Management System, which is used in the 
preparation of digital music and other data to prevent unauthorized 
duplication. IBM's security measures already have been adopted by 
major labels such as EMI, Sony and Warner Music. 
</P>
<P>
	The RealNetworks-IBM effort challenges a rival product by  
Microsoft Corp., which is pushing a different format for delivering 
music files over the Internet.

<HEADLINE> RealNetworks Offers Music Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leading Internet audio software company  
RealNetworks placed itself squarely in the middle of a fight over 
music piracy with its creation of a product designed to make it 
easier to download and play music on a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	The release of a test version of the RealJukebox software Monday  
coincided with a separate announcement by Thomson Consumer 
Electronic Inc. that it will market a portable device under the RCA 
brand for playing music downloaded from a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves are yet another blow to the recording industry, which  
is worried the booming trend of people distributing music through 
the Internet will severely weaken copyright laws. 
</P>
<P>
	RealJukebox will make it easier and quicker for computer users  
to download music from either their own CDs or the Internet onto 
their computer hard drives, said Mark Hardie, a senior analyst with 
Forrester Research, Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	It will also help people to find and download the huge number of  
tunes in MP3 and other formats now available, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The MP3 format allows near-CD quality recordings to be  
transmitted over the Internet, but also has given rise to 
widespread piracy as people trade unauthorized copies of tunes for 
free. 
</P>
<P>
	RealJukebox will move digital music distribution beyond the  
technically savvy and into the mainstream, said Siddiq Bello, 
publisher of The MP3 Newsletter, a trade publication on Internet 
distribution of music. Hardie estimated 10 million people will be 
using RealJukebox by July. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Thomson plans this fall to begin selling a $200  
product to play MP3-formatted music downloaded from the computer. 
It will compete with Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc.'s Rio, the 
only product now on the market for his purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	RealJukebox will contain an anti-piracy device that limits a  
consumer to making a single copy of a music file for their own use. 
However, consumers will be able to easily disable the device in 
order to send out copies of the music to friends via e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry is worried that free distribution of music through  
the Internet will cripple the market for selling it, either on CDs 
or online. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Barrett, senior vice president at RealNetworks, said the  
company is ``very respectful of intellectual property.'' But he 
said RealNetworks is responding to an existing demand in the 
marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, consumers don't really care about it,'' he said.  
``The reality is most consumers don't want to be pirates and have 
no problem leaving the default in as it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Recording Industry Association of America, which has  
appointed a committee to come up with anti-piracy standards, 
declined to comment on RealNetworks' announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``People want this,'' Bello said. ``The recording industry must  
recognize that fact and make decisions knowing that instead of 
trying to modify that fact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, RealNetworks announced the formation of RealGuide,  
which offers free music downloads to RealJukebox users. Among the 
music available is an exclusive song by the rock band The 
Offspring, and the first single from rap artist Public Enemy's new 
album. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the other selections offered are by obscure artists,  
owing to the recording industry's cautiousness about the format. 
But it does include songs by Julian Lennon, Randy Newman, George 
Clinton &AMP; the P-Funk All Stars and Frank Black.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Students To Return To Class </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- After enduring 13 days of vigils,  
funerals and media scrutiny, many Columbine High School students 
were eager to return to the daily routine of academic life. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just are happy to get back to normal things instead of  
going to all these sad things and get back to what we're used to,'' 
said Kiala Slater, a 15-year-old Columbine sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,000 Columbine students were scheduled to return to  
school this afternoon for the first time since two fellow students 
stormed Columbine and killed 12 classmates and a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the students won't be attending classes at their school  
-- now a massive crime scene -- but at nearby Chatfield High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to go back for sure,'' said Tiffany Typher, an  
18-year-old senior wearing a ``CHS'' ribbon in her hair. But, she 
said, ``I don't want to go to Chatfield. I'd rather go back to 
Columbine, just to have closure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, went on a shooting and  
bombing spree April 20 before killing themselves in the school. The 
assault has produced nationwide debates over gun control, parental 
responsibility, media violence and the treatment of outcast youth. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,000 students, faculty and parents attended one last  
memorial Sunday at the majestic Red Rocks amphitheater west of 
Denver. Students gave touching tributes to the dead, while school 
administrators tried to ease tensions about heading back to school. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to get back on the horse,'' school board president  
Jon DeStefano said. ``This will take courage for all of us. But I 
promise you, you will be safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Sunday's memorial, a student representative from each of the  
four grades sent get-well wishes to the 23 wounded, five of whom 
remained in Denver hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want you to know that we miss you guys and that we look  
forward to having you back again in school with us,'' said Tim 
Matteson, the sophomore class representative. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine's students will finish out the school year, which will  
end in June, at Chatfield, three miles away. Under a school 
district plan, Chatfield students will attend classes in the 
morning and Columbine students in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, authorities appeared to move closer to concluding  
that Harris and Klebold acted alone in the attack. Detectives 
initially suspected a wider conspiracy after finding 50 bombs in 
and around Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no solid evidence to indicate there was anyone else in  
the school ... or that anybody assisted them in coming in and out 
of the school ... or transporting these items,'' District Attorney 
Dave Thomas told The Washington Post on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a sheriff's deputy said Sunday that Klebold's  
parents were ``very cooperative'' in an hour-and-forty-five-minute 
interview with investigators. Thomas and Susan Klebold met with 
authorities Friday to answer questions about their son. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris' parents have refused to talk with investigators unless  
they get immunity from criminal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Back at the memorial site near Columbine, a set of 8-foot-high  
wooden crosses erected to honor the victims was taken down by the 
Illinois carpenter who put them up just last week. Greg Zanis was 
criticized for putting up crosses for the killers near those of the 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	An angry father of one of the victims took down the crosses for  
Harris and Klebold, saying it wasn't appropriate to honor the 
shooters in the same spot. Later, two smaller crosses were put up 
for Harris and Klebold before Zanis arrived early Sunday and 
removed his entire display.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Call Shooters a Deadly Mix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Eric Harris was a troubled teen,  
apparently suffering from depression and obsession. Dylan Klebold 
was a follower, who was rejected by his peers and who found 
acceptance from Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	Psychologists say that was a deadly mix, exploding April 20 at  
Columbine High School when the pair marched through the school's 
halls, killing 13 of their classmates and then themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``What leads to violence in kids is a series of problems:  
problems with the parents, a feeling of low self-esteem, a pattern 
of being rejected,'' said Dr. Jeff Dolgan, chief of psychology at 
Children's Hospital in Denver. ``These kids were in a group that 
was put down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, whose father retired to Colorado from the U.S. Air  
Force, railed against his tormentors on his Internet web page, 
saying ``we have many enemies in our school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also warned of the attack that he planned for a year, saying  
``I don't care if I live or die in the shootout.'' The pair timed 
their assault for Adolf Hitler's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Just five days before the attack, the Marine Corps rejected  
Harris as a recruit because he had been taking the antidepressant 
drug Luvox. He also reportedly was turned down by a girl he wanted 
to take to the prom. An autopsy found no drugs -- illegal or 
prescription -- in his body. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Don Marxhausen, pastor of St. Philip Lutheran Church in  
Littleton and pastor for the Klebolds, said his daughters knew 
Harris as a young man filled with rage. He said Klebold, ``a nice 
young man with above-average intelligence,'' was easily pulled 
under Harris' spell. 
</P>
<P>
	``Harris was just so charismatic, but he was definitely angry,''  
Marxhausen said. ``There was just such a rage in Harris. You either 
had to follow him or get away from him,'' the pastor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Klebold found comfort and refuge in a group called  
the ``Trenchcoat Mafia,'' a group of about a dozen school outcasts 
who bought floor-length dusters at a western store sale for $99 
each. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the group were angry because ``jocks'' and other  
members of the school elite teased and harassed them, throwing 
rocks and cigarettes at them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everywhere they went, they were teased about how they  
dressed,'' Harris' former girlfriend, Tiffany Typher, told The 
Denver Post. ``If you're called a psycho all your life, you're 
going to live out that reputation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friends said Klebold joined up with Harris about four years ago  
and began shunning his former friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Eric and Dylan got together, Eric changed Dylan's  
demeanor. Dylan was a follower, who was constantly looking for 
someone to lead,'' said Nick Baumgartner, 17, a senior who met 
Dylan in grade school. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold and Harris got their own home computers, and linked them  
with modems, playing simulated shooting games like ``Doom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They had death matches with violent computer games, matching  
computer to computer,'' Baumgartner said. ``I don't believe violent 
video games lead to violence, but this was different. They'd play 
these games for hours and hours and hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John Kluck, a psychiatrist at the University of Colorado  
Health Sciences Center, said the youths did a good job of hiding 
their antisocial behavior from their parents and authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Following their arrest on criminal trespass, theft and mischief  
charges, the two boys were ordered to perform community service and 
write apology letters. Harris' juvenile diversion supervisor wrote 
that the boy enjoyed his anger management class and he called him 
``a bright young man who is likely to succeed in life.'' 
Supervisors wrote that Klebold needed to work on his motivation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They played social roles so they didn't stand out to the  
judges or their parents,'' Kluck said. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Good knew Harris, the schoolmate who lived in the gray,  
two-story home two doors down. He said Klebold often came over in 
his older BMW to visit Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt, 16, now wonders about the explosions neighbors heard in a  
nearby meadow. But other than that, ``We never saw anything to be 
alarmed about,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Good said Harris and Klebold spoke German to each other in  
the hallway and talked a lot about World War II, Hitler and the 
Nazis. ``He thought Eric was a little strange, and he didn't want 
to associate with him,'' said Matt's father, Mike Good. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Beard, a fellow student, said Harris came to class in  
steel-toed combat boots and a German cross. Harris was also said to 
be a big fan of Rammstein, a German industrial, or techno, rock 
band. 
</P>
<P>
	John House, 17, a senior, said he refused to associate with  
Klebold after he joined the Trenchcoat Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went bowling with him, and when he would do something good,  
he would shout, `Heil Hitler!' and throw up his hand,'' House said. 
``It just made everyone mad.''

<HEADLINE> Court To Hear Exxon Valdez Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Nearly five years after an Alaskan jury awarded  
$5.3 billion in punitive and compensatory damages to those hurt by 
the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, Exxon has yet to pay a single 
dollar as the case winds through the legal process. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel for the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
was set to hear the appeal Monday afternoon in Seattle. A ruling is 
expected to take at least six months. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, a federal court jury in Anchorage unanimously awarded  
the largest-ever jury award to 35,000 fisherman, Native Americans, 
cannery workers and landowners for the damage from the spill in 
Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon immediately appealed, contending it had paid enough: $2.2  
billion for the cleanup, $1 billion to settle state and federal 
civil charges and $300 million for lost wages to 11,000 fishermen 
and business operators. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon is contesting both the size of the punitive damages and  
the way the $287 million compensatory damage award was calculated. 
</P>
<P>
	But lawyers for the plaintiffs argue the award is appropriate  
considering the scope of damage. They also argue it takes an amount 
as large as $5 billion to punish a company as wealthy as Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil giant contends one juror was intimidated and threatened  
by other jurors and the court bailiff during the 1994 trial in 
Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge H. Russel Holland rejected that charge,  
writing in his ruling that the juror's memory was not credible. The 
plaintiffs want the appeals court to affirm Holland's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Another issue in the appeal is whether a group of Seattle  
seafood processors known as the ``Seattle Seven'' is entitled to a 
share of the $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the start of the 1994 trial, the processors reached a  
$70 million settlement with Exxon. The confidential settlement 
agreement required the seafood processors to pursue their share of 
any punitive damages at trial and then turn the proceeds over to 
Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Seven's share comes to more than $700 million. The  
plaintiffs contend Exxon would hardly be punished if it could pay a 
share of the damages to itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Holland agreed in 1996 and rejected Exxon's claim to the money.  
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago, Exxon Valdez skipper Joseph Hazelwood ordered the  
984-foot tanker to shift position to avoid icebergs in Valdez Arm. 
Hazelwood then went below to his cabin, leaving 3rd Mate Gregory 
Cousins in control of the vessel. Cousins ran the vessel onto Bligh 
Reef just after midnight on March 24, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The resulting 11 million gallon spill, which remains the  
nation's worst, polluted more than 1,000 miles of Alaska shoreline, 
killed tens of thousands of birds and marine mammals and disrupted 
fishing.

<HEADLINE> Dow Jones Ends Above 11,000 Points / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average sped past  
11,000 Monday, shattering the record for the fastest rise between 
1,000-point milestones. 
</P>
<P>
	The index of 30 blue chip stocks rose 225.65 to close at  
11,014.69. It took just 24 trading days for the Dow to move from 
10,000 to 11,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Even by the compressed standards of the modern stock market, the  
latest milestone arrived with remarkable speed. The previous record 
for 1,000-point gains -- from 6,000 to 7,000 -- was 89 trading days 
from October 1996 to February 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's close was also Dow's fourth record high in the last  
five trading sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more reports of an ebullient economy -- showing consumer  
spending up and manufacturing continuing to grow -- pushed the 
stocks of big corporate names higher. That aided the Dow and the 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index, which also recorded a healthy 
gain of 19.45 to 1,354.63. But investors continued to dump Internet 
shares, pushing the Nasdaq composite index down 7.27 to 2,535.58. 
</P>
<P>
	On a percentage basis, Monday's Dow speed record is not  
comparable to the previous mark. The move from 6,000 to 7,000 was a 
16 percent rise, while the move from 10,000 to 11,000 was only 10 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Dow's rise above 11,000 ``is truly remarkable; it's  
breathtaking,'' said Hugh Johnson, market strategist at First 
Albany Corp. ``I didn't suspect that I would be talking about Dow 
11,000 this year, let alone at the beginning of May.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Acampora, director of technical research at Prudential  
Securities, said the market was much stronger now than it was five 
weeks ago. When the Dow passed 10,000, investors were excited, but 
also wary because the advance was made on just a few stocks in the 
technology, telecommunications and pharmaceutical sectors, and a 
few other industries. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past five weeks, the market's roster of leaders has  
broadened to include manufacturing and basic-materials companies 
that had been out of favor for years. 
</P>
<P>
	That means the market -- and the economy -- are much stronger than  
they were a short month ago, Acampora said. ``It's like driving a 
brand new car out of the showroom, and this thing doesn't have a 
nick on it. That's a real move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturing and industrial shares rose Monday after investors  
got two fresh reminders that the economy is strong, but not 
inflationary. The National Association of Purchasing Management's 
index of manufacturing activity declined 1.5 percentage points, to 
52.8 percent, in April. That indicated that the manufacturing 
sector is still expanding, but at a slower rate than before. 
Analysts had expected the index to rise 2.2 percent. The slower 
rate quelled fears of inflation among some traders. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Commerce Department reported that Americans' personal  
income rose 0.4 percent in March, but their spending kept pace, 
leaving the nation's savings rate at a record low. 
</P>
<P>
	After the purchasing managers' report, bond prices erased early  
losses. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which moves in the 
opposite direction from price, closed at 5.65 percent, down from 
5.66 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Influenced by the rise in bond prices, financial stocks  
recovered from a weak opening to end higher. Dow component J.P. 
Morgan added 2 5/8 to 137 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was also led higher by such industrial stalwarts as  
Minnesota Mining &AMP; Manufacturing, up 4 7/8 to 93 7/8; United 
Technologies, up 3 1/2 to 148 3/8; and Goodyear Tire and Rubber, up 3 5/8 to 
60 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks, which have benefited lately from strong oil prices,  
were also big winners. Exxon gained 3 to 86 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Internet and some technology stocks took a drubbing  
as investors continued last week's strategy of taking profits. 
America Online slid 9 5/8 to 133 1.7 in leading volume on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Microsoft shed 1 5/8 to 79 11/16 in leading Nasdaq 
volume. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a strong 2-to-1 margin  
on the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated NYSE volume came to 
985.58 million shares, down from Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 9.88 to 644.18, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 9.70 to 786.67. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.47 to 433.28.

<P>
	In foreign stock markets, the Tokyo exchange was closed for the  
first day of a 3-day holiday and will resume trading on Thursday. 
The London market was closed for the May Day holiday. In Paris, the

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 126 but Nasdaq Falls 26 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks were mostly higher in late  
afternoon, as strong consumer and manufacturing data boosted 
economically sensitive names, but technology stocks were lower as 
investors continued to unload Internet stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 126.28 at 10,915.32, a record high. On Friday the Dow ended 
89.34 lower at 10,789.04, after coming within 39 points of 11,000 
and setting three record highs last week. The Dow closed at a 
record 10,878.38 last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 5.87 at 1,341.05, but the Nasdaq composite index was 
down 26.04 at 2,516.81. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturing shares took off this morning, pushing the Dow  
higher, after a report from the National Association of Purchasing 
Management showed that its index of manufacturing activity declined 
1.5 percentage points, to 52.8 percent, in April. The survey 
indicated the manufacturing sector is expanding, but at a slower 
rate. Analysts had expected the index to rise 2.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAPM report followed an earlier report from the Commerce  
Department that showed Americans' personal income rose 0.4 percent 
in March, but their spending kept pace, leaving the nation's 
savings rate at a record low. 
</P>
<P>
	After the purchasing managers' report, bond prices erased early  
losses. The 30-year Treasury bond was yielding 5.66 percent. The 
strength in the bond market helped push manufacturing stocks 
higher, said William Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor 
Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds ``got a nice bounce off the (manufacturing) report, which  
came in a little bit weaker than expected,'' Meehan said. The 
recovery in bond prices in turn helped stocks, he added. ``You'd 
have a difficult time moving cyclicals, or anything else, if you 
continued to see the bond market going lower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was led higher by industrial shares Minnesota Mining &AMP;  
Manufacturing, up 3 3/4 at 92 3/4; United Technologies, up 2 3/4 at 147 5/8, 
and Goodyear, up 2 3/4 at 59 15/16. Oil stocks, which have benefitted 
lately from strong oil prices, were higher again today. Dow 
component Exxon was up 2 3/4 at 85 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks were mixed. American Express was up 11/16 at  
131 3/8, but Citigroup was off 7/8 at 74. Richard Cripps, chief market 
strategist for Legg Mason in Baltimore, said that was a sign that 
the stock advances may not hold. 
</P>
<P>
	``The financials are one of those groups that we probably should  
watch here because they are an indicator of what the bond market is 
likely to do,'' Cripps said. ``I'd say their mixed showing is not a 
strong indicator that this market can continue to go higher. It 
could be an indication that the Dow is overstating'' the market's 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks were lower as investors continued last week's  
strategy of taking profits in them. AOL was down 7 5/8 at 135 1/8 in 
leading volume on the New York Stock Exchange, and Microsoft was 
down 2 9/16 at 78 3/4 in leading volume in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues led decliners by 7 to 4 on the New York Stock  
Exchange, where volume came to 619.34 million shares, down from 
Friday's pace.

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- A television reporter said in an interview  
published Monday that he was told what questions to ask when he 
interviewed the country's security chief. 
</P>
<P>
	The interview with national security adviser Vladimiro  
Montesinos last week on the television news program ``Revista 
Dominical'' had been advertised as the ``interview of the 
century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Alamo Perez, the reporter who conducted the interview, was  
quoted as saying by El Comercio, Peru's leading newspaper, that 
doing ``the interview meant not touching certain issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The revelation came a day after The New York-based Committee to  
Protect Journalists labeled Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori one 
of the 10 world leaders who most violate press freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time in Fujimori's nine years in power that the

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- The government of a southern state and  
General Motors Corp. announced Monday that they had reached an 
agreement allowing the U.S. automaker to complete its new assembly 
plant there. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement came after a month of negotiations following the  
decision by officials in the state of Rio Grande do Sul to stop 
disbursement of several million dollars in loans and other 
incentives earmarked for the world's largest automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	The state government's press office said further details of the  
agreement would be announced later this week by Gov. Oilivio Dutra 
and the president of GM's Brazilian subsidiary, Frederick 
Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Ford Motor Co. scuttled its plans to build its $1  
billion factory in Rio Grande do Sul. Construction of the Ford 
plant, which was expected to begin making 120,000 cars a year in 
2001, was in its initial stages. Ford said it would build its plant 
elsewhere in Brazil, but gave no indication where.

<HEADLINE> Larry Flynts Returns to Cincy Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Hustler publisher Larry Flynt commands a porn  
empire that has made the self-described ``smut peddler'' very rich, 
awfully powerful and terribly bold. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, more than two decades after making his reputation in a  
Cincinnati courtroom, Flynt plans to return to the city again to 
face a new set of obscenity charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always said if something is not worth going to jail for,  
it's not worth very much,'' Flynt said from his office in Los 
Angeles. ``I'm not looking forward to it, but I knew the risk 
involved in the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If his trial scheduled for May 10 in Cincinnati were a movie, it  
would probably be a sequel. A portion of ``The People vs. Larry 
Flynt'' depicted his 1977 obscenity trial and portrayed him as a 
defender of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Flynt hopes to overturn a U.S. Supreme Court decision  
that lets community standards determine what's obscene. Flynt said 
such standards now are much more relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world is becoming much smaller,'' Flynt said. ``When that  
Supreme Court decision was made in 1973, those justices had an idea 
of what the community was. That no longer exists. If someone has a 
computer in Cincinnati, they can download material from all over 
the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	County Prosecutor Mike Allen disagrees. ``I don't know that  
community standards and mores have changed in Hamilton County that 
much since the last go-round,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt, 56, and his brother, Jimmy, 52, were indicted April 7,  
1998, on charges of pandering obscenity, disseminating material 
harmful to a juvenile, conspiracy and engaging in a pattern of 
corrupt activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to win this case more than anything else in the  
world,'' Flynt said. ``But it would probably be better for the 
country if I lost. Because if I win, nothing changes; if I lose, 
the case can be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where you change laws, at the appellate level. And  
that's what I'm attempting to do now is to get the antiquated 
obscenity laws off the books.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, Flynt was convicted of pandering obscenity for selling  
his magazine in Cincinnati, but the conviction was overturned on 
appeal in 1979. He was never retried. 
</P>
<P>
	That led the City Council to pass an emergency ordinance  
requiring businesses with a ``significant'' but unspecified portion 
of adult-oriented merchandise to get a special permit and to do 
business in areas zoned for industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Irritated that obscenity crackdowns kept Hustler from being  
readily available in Cincinnati, Flynt recently opened his own sex 
shop just steps away from the city's downtown centerpiece, Fountain 
Square. Jimmy Flynt is the manager. 
</P>
<P>
	It's there that prosecutors say a 14-year-old boy bought a sex  
video. With that charge included, each brother could get up to 24 
years in prison and $65,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Flynt previously has taken his First Amendment fight all  
the way to the top. In 1983, Flynt's sex magazine ran an ad parody 
suggesting the Rev. Jerry Falwell lost his virginity to his mother 
in an outhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baptist minister won on the emotional-distress charge and a  
federal jury in awarded him $200,000 in damages. But in 1988, the 
Supreme Court unanimously overturned the award by ruling that even 
pornographic spoofs enjoy First Amendment protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year he recast himself as an avenger of Washington, D.C.,  
sexual hypocrisy, offering monetary rewards to expose adulterous 
lawmakers following the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal. Early this year, 
former Rep. Robert Livingston resigned days before he was expected 
to become speaker of the House after confirming Flynt's discovery 
that he had had adulterous affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt said he wants his new impending trial again to focus the  
national debate on sexual expression. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like no one is willing to have any sort of meaningful  
dialogue on sexuality in this country, and I find that 
troublesome,'' Flynt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sex is the medium we use to communicate with, more than  
anything else, so you'd think we'd make a little bit better effort 
to understand it.''

<HEADLINE> Boston Waits for Next Opponent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Bruins spent Monday waiting to face the  
great unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	Who would they play next in the NHL playoffs? And what would it  
be like to reach the second round where few of them have been? 
</P>
<P>
	``This is new for a lot of guys,'' forward Rob DiMaio said.  
``Now the attention is going to get greater. The mental mistakes 
can't be made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaio was in the minority among the 19 Bruins who suited up for  
Sunday night's 2-0 victory over the Carolina Hurricanes that 
clinched the Eastern Conference quarterfinal series four games to 
two. 
</P>
<P>
	He was one of seven players in that group who reached the second  
round before. The other 12 aren't sure what's in store. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of experience was handed around (in Sunday's) game,  
because a lot of guys haven't been beyond the first round before 
and now guys are believing,'' goalie Byron Dafoe, one of the 
second-round newcomers, said a few minutes after the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins' next opponent hinges on the outcome of Tuesday  
night's seventh game between New Jersey and Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	If New Jersey wins, Boston will open the best-of-7 second round  
at Toronto. If Pittsburgh wins, Boston starts at home against 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's Toronto, they're the top offensive team in the league,  
so, obviously, they can bring it and they have pretty good 
goaltending,'' DiMaio said. ``If it's Buffalo, their goaltender 
(Dominik Hasek) can beat you on his own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least the Bruins, who thrived on defense, have shown a  
balanced scoring attack in the playoffs. Eleven players contributed 
to the 16 goals they scored against the Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Young forwards like Anson Carter, 24, and Joe Thornton, 19, made  
key contributions. Carter scored the winning goal in a 4-3, 
double-overtime win in Game 5. And he and Thornton, the top pick in 
the 1997 draft, scored in Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carter and Thornton stepped it up. Their future is unlimited  
as to how good they could be,'' said captain Ray Bourque, in his 
19th playoffs in his 20-year career that began about three months 
after Thornton was born. 
</P>
<P>
	During the regular season, the Bruins were 3-1-1 against the  
Maple Leafs, outscoring them 15-11. Toronto scored just one goal in 
three of the five games. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Sabres, the Bruins were 1-4 and were dominated by  
Hasek as they scored a total of just seven goals while allowing 14. 
</P>
<P>
	But Boston finished with a flourish, going 17-6-4 in its last 27  
regular-season games before beating Carolina in a very close series 
in which two games were decided in overtime and only one was won by 
more than two goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought our veteran leadership and experience in the locker  
room would be an edge for us in the series,'' Carolina's Keith 
Primeau said Sunday. ``Dafoe made saves time and time again. It 
really hurt us. Dafoe's goaltending was the difference in the 
series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Boston was eliminated in the first round by  
Washington, 4-2. This time, the Bruins succeeded in pressure-filled 
games despite their playoff inexperience. 
</P>
<P>
	``This series was huge in terms of this team growing,'' Bourque  
said. ``This year having a good series and falling short wasn't 
going to be good enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With no dominant team in the Eastern Conference, Boston might  
have as good a chance as any to advance to the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all have a taste of the first round,'' said Boston's Tim  
Taylor, a member of the Detroit team that lost in the 1995 
championship series. ``We're excited for a day and bask in our 
glory, but come Tuesday we have to start getting ready for 
Thursday.''

<HEADLINE> Patriots Say They'll Stay in Mass. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Two days after ending stadium talks with  
Connecticut, the New England Patriots said they plan to stay in 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since owner Robert Kraft scrapped one of the  
richest stadium deals in sports history Friday, the team publicly 
ended speculation it might be sold or moved. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to a long future in Massachusetts,'' team  
spokesman Stacey James told The Boston Globe on Sunday. ``The New 
England Patriots are not for sale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kraft declined to elaborate Sunday, saying only that he ended  
talks with Connecticut because it was in the ``best interest of the 
fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Kraft informed Connecticut Gov. John Rowland he was  
walking away from a $380 million offer of a new stadium that some 
analysts estimated could have been worth up to $1 billion over 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The team doubted a stadium could be built by 2002 as promised  
and ended the talks before a Sunday deadline that allowed Kraft to 
withdraw without penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	That move came less than three days after Massachusetts  
legislative leaders presented their own proposal, a deal that would 
pay $70 million for infrastructure near a new Foxboro stadium. The 
NFL also lobbied to keep the team in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Sunday's statement by James, however, the team still  
hadn't said it would stay in Massachusetts where it began in 1960 
as the Boston Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
	The Massachusetts deal hammered out Tuesday night by Gov. Paul  
Cellucci, Senate President Thomas Birmingham, House Speaker Thomas 
Finneran, members of the Boston business community and NFL 
representatives, still needs approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``What some thought was a Hail Mary pass was completed for a  
touchdown,'' Birmingham said Sunday. ``I expect the Senate will 
adopt it soon because we passed a virtually identical bill last 
year. And since we all negotiated in good faith, I expect we will 
all keep our word.''

<HEADLINE> Vikings' Senior VP Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Jeff Diamond, who spent 24 years  
working for the Minnesota Vikings and was named the NFL's Executive 
of the Year in 1998, resigned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm walking out of the Vikings with my head held high, because  
I know I did a good job here and I feel good about what I did,'' 
said Diamond, the team's senior vice president of football 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he and Vikings owner Red McCombs were ``parting  
amicably,'' although he also said they held differing views about 
salary caps. He called his departure a mutual decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a situation where ... I've worked 24 years with the team  
in my hometown and perhaps it's time for a change,'' Diamond said. 
``I still wish the Vikings well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he might seek sports or business opportunities in  
Minnesota, or perhaps with another NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
	McCombs said Diamond will remain with the club as a consultant  
through Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeff built a model that has been successful for the Vikings,''  
McCombs said in written statement. ``I have different ideas how 
that model will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCombs told the Saint Paul Pioneer Press that discussion of  
Diamond's future with the club came about because of Diamond's 
desire to be a general manager, and McCombs' unwillingness to give 
him that position. 
</P>
<P>
	Diamond, 45, whom The Sporting News named NFL Executive of the  
Year last season, helped re-sign key free agents John Randle, Jake 
Reed, Robert Smith and Todd Steussie before the 1998 season. The 
Vikings compiled a 15-1 regular season record before losing to 
Atlanta in the NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Diamond, however, found himself with less power after McCombs  
bought the Vikings last July. McCombs hired Tim Connolly as the 
team's general manager last October.

<HEADLINE> Baseball's Mud Man Lives Quiet Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEMINOLE, Fla. (AP) -- To his neighbors, Burns Bintliff is a  
retired New Jersey Turnpike maintenance contractor. To Major league 
players, who may not even know his name, he's the supplier of a 
silky, chocolate pudding-like product known as ``magic mud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires at every major and minor league ballpark in America and  
Canada use the mud, called Lena Blackburne Rubbing Mud, to take the 
shine off baseballs before each game. 
</P>
<P>
	Shiny balls, straight out of their plastic wrapping, are no  
good, professionals say. Pitchers can't get a good grip and hitters 
are sometimes blinded when the sun or indoor lighting hits the 
too-white surface. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires say a little dab of Bintliff's mud removes the shine off  
balls without scratching or denting the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	Bintliff's product is so superior to other muds, professionals  
say, that in 1969 it was permanently enshrined in the Hall of Fame 
at Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's something about this mud,'' retired major league  
umpire Bill Kinnamon told the St. Petersburg Times for its Monday 
editions. ``I don't know how to explain it. It takes the shine off 
without getting the ball excessively dark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Bintliff's wife, Doris, Russell Aubrey ``Lena''  
Blackburne was a major league infielder with the Chicago White Sox 
and later, a coach for the then-Philadelphia Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the mid-1930s, teams used a variety of substances  
to rub baseballs -- tobacco juice, shoe polish, dirt from the 
baseball field or a combination -- but nothing they tried gave the 
balls the right look or feel. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackburne searched for the perfect rubbing compound until one  
day, according to legend, he found mud he liked in a secret body of 
water, probably some place in the northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1938, he was supplying the mud to all American League teams.  
Because he was a die-hard American League fan, he refused to sell 
the mud to National League teams until the mid-1950s. Since then, 
every major and minor league team has used only the product. One 
container, a little more than 16 ounces, will usually last a 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a can of it in every umpire's dressing room,'' said  
Kinnamon ``Before each game, we'd rub up about five dozen balls, 
more for a double header.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blackburne died in 1968 and left the mud business to his boyhood  
friend, John Haas, who was the father of Bintliff's first wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he died, Haas shared the secrets of the mud with  
Bintliff, including its source. Today, the mud remains a mystery 
and only a few family members know where it comes from. 
</P>
<P>
	Buddy Bates, equipment manager for the St. Louis Cardinals, said  
there is a tub of Bintliff's mud in his locker room. ``We get it 
automatically every spring,'' Bates said. ``It costs $100.''

<HEADLINE> FAA Wants Better Flight Recorders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pressured by investigators seeking more clues  
about airplane accidents, the government today called for faster 
installation of better flight recorders on Boeing 737 commercial 
jets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration proposed requiring airlines  
to install flight data recorders, known as black boxes, that can 
track more flight functions, especially related to the rudder. The 
FAA proposal comes after the National Transportation Safety Board 
ruled that a jam in rudder-control valve caused the 1994 crash of 
USAir Flight 427 near Pittsburgh, killing all 132 people on board. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the years, flight recorders have provided a blueprint for  
deficiencies in the system that needed to be fixed,'' FAA 
Administrator Jane Garvey said at the NTSB's international 
symposium on flight data recorders that began Monday in Arlington, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the FAA also will propose increasing the 30-minute  
recording now required on cockpit voice recorders to two hours and 
installing a 10-minute backup power supply by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB has been asking the FAA for years to require longer  
tapes to record pilots' conversations and better flight data 
recorders, two devices that play a critical role in helping 
investigators determine the cause of accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, federal regulators issued a rule ordering all U.S.  
transport airplanes -- not just 737s -- to be equipped with flight 
data recorders that could track a minimum of 17 functions. The FAA 
said the changes had to be made by August 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Garvey said the agency now will propose additional requirements  
for newer 737s. The FAA wants to require these 737s to have flight 
data recorders that can keep information on four to 11 other flight 
functions -- beyond those covered by the 1997 ruling. And they would 
have to be installed by August 2000 -- a year sooner than those 
covered in the earlier ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 3,100 Boeing 737s in the worldwide fleet.  
</P>
<P>
	Robert Frenzel, head of safety and operations for the Air  
Transport Association, which represents major U.S. airlines, said 
the association is somewhat frustrated by the changing mandates 
from the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our members have already been upgrading the parameters on the  
flight data recorders based on the previous order,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Southwest Airlines, a Dallas-based carrier, already has upgraded  
flight data recorders on 264 of the 288 737s in its fleet. 
Spokeswoman Linda Rutherford said the new recorders track 18 to 88 
parameters, depending on the plane. The proposed rule is not likely 
to require the airline to do additional retrofitting, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's our understanding that the upgrades we've done will  
either meet or exceed what the FAA is now asking,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the NTSB announced in March that the probable cause of the  
Sept. 8, 1994, crash of USAir Flight 427 near Pittsburgh was 
related to the rudder, the board again pressed the FAA to require 
better airline flight recorders. The board criticized the FAA for 
not mandating them until 2001. Investigators said they were 
hampered by the plane's flight data recorder that provided only 11 
pieces of information to help them determine a cause for the crash.

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes Are Complex Phenomena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	While the violence and damage from tornadoes are well known, the  
actual mechanics of these storms are complex and not completely 
understood. 
</P>
<P>
	They can occur in a variety of situations but are generated most  
often in severe thunderstorms that occur when warm air and cold air 
collide. 
</P>
<P>
	The collision forces warm air upward, and that creates a low  
pressure area at the ground. Surrounding air moves in to fill the 
vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
	In severe storms, cloud tops can rise high into the air,  
reaching the level of strong horizontal winds that blow the tops 
into the classic anvil shape often reported around tornadoes. When 
this happens, more air is pulled upward in something like a chimney 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The air moving in toward the ``chimney'' begins to turn  
counterclockwise and then rises in a twisting column of extreme 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Winds in a tornado are believed to reach more than 200 to 300  
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally tornadoes form in the rear portion of severe storms  
which move toward the east or northeast and are separate from the 
heavy rains that occur in these storms.

<HEADLINE> Marlins' Fernandez Missing 3 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Florida's Alex Fernandez will miss at least three  
weeks with a pulled groin, the latest setback in his comeback from 
shoulder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez, who missed the entire 1998 season following surgery  
to repair a torn rotator cuff, was placed on the 15-day disabled 
list Monday. The Marlins recalled reliever Rafael Medina from 
Triple-A Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez is on the DL for the second time in the last month.  
Earlier, he was out with inflammation in the surgically repaired 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Team physician Dan Kanell has said it's likely Fernandez will be  
out a minimum of three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating, but it's something I plan to take care of,''  
Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez said his shoulder felt fine in Sunday's 4-2 loss to  
the Astros. He injured his right groin muscle in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like there's a black cloud over us,'' said Marlins  
manager John Boles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins have on off day Thursday, so they won't need another  
starter until May 11. The team will make a decision later in the 
week on who will move into the rotation.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Rally Vs. Cuba Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Chanting anti-Castro slogans, Cuban-Americans  
protested Monday's game between the Cuban national team and the 
Baltimore Orioles as a diversion from what they say is the Cuban 
leader's brutal crackdown on dissenters. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters, some of whom had spent a day on buses riding from  
Miami, gathered first at a statue of 19th century Cuban 
independence hero Jose Marti before making their way to the 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The noisy crowd of several hundred chanting demonstrators was  
separated from the stadium by two rows of officers and mounted 
police. Police had been expecting a crowd of 1,500. No serious 
disturbances had been reported as of game time. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria E. Cosculluela, a member of Miami-based Mothers against  
Repression for Cuba, said she could not support the game, even out 
of simple national pride. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are rooting for the Cuban people, the dissidents, the  
people in jail,'' she said. ``We are for the Cuban people, and this 
game should never have happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters wore T-shirts with messages like ``Fidel murderer''  
and ``Justice and human rights now! Baseball later,'' and held 
signs that read ``La Represion en Cuba no es cosa de juego'' (The 
repression in Cuba is not a game). They held a moment of silence 
for those martyred in the fight against the Cuban leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Buses ferried protesters from New York, New Jersey, Washington,  
D.C., and Florida. Two congressmen, Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, 
R-Fla., and Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said they planned to attend and 
support the anti-Castro groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Fernandez, a banker from Newark, N.J., said the decision to  
allow Cuba to play a major league club in the United States was 
hypocritical. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to tell the government in Kosovo that we want  
human rights but 90 miles from (Miami) we allow repression to 
continue,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez, 37, and his family were allowed to leave Cuba and  
join relatives in the United States in 1976 only after his father 
agreed to cut sugar cane for five years in a government labor camp 
in exchange for freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	About one block away from the anti-Castro protesters, a smaller  
group called for an end to the longstanding trade embargo against 
the Communist country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern is the effect of the blockade on the Cuban  
people,'' said Jeff Bigelow of Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``What has Cuba done to the U.S. to deserve this punishment for  
40 years?'' said a Miami man, who declined to give his name fearing 
retribution from anti-Castro forces. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time Cuba has played a major league club in  
the United States. In March, the Orioles became the first major 
league team to play in Cuba in 40 years, beating Cuba 3-2 in 11 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles owner Peter Angelos has said his goal is to improve  
relations through people-to-people contact between the two 
countries, which have been divided by a longstanding U.S. trade 
embargo against the communist nation. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said,  
``Regardless of the outcome, the Cuban people will win when they 
have a window to the outside world, even if it is only through the 
televised version of this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sylvia Iriondo, head of Mothers against Repression for Cuba,  
said the game only fostered ``people-to-tyrant contact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This baseball game hides the desire of many commercial  
enterprises that want to do business with Cuba's bloody dictator,'' 
she said.

<HEADLINE> Reggie Lewis Suit Goes to Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- When Boston Celtics captain Reggie Lewis collapsed  
and died while practicing jump shots in 1993, he left a pregnant 
wife, thousands of fans and a team of doctors wondering what went 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	In the years since, a battle of reputations has been waged  
between Lewis' family and some of the city's most prominent 
physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, they started fighting it out before a jury.  
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' widow says the doctors who treated her husband in his  
last months misdiagnosed and mistreated a fatal heart condition. 
The doctors contend Lewis used cocaine and lied about it, making an 
accurate diagnosis impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to everyone finally hearing the truth  
about Reggie and how his life could have been saved,'' Donna 
Harris-Lewis said in a statement released just before the trial 
began. ``When this is over, I hope and pray justice will finally be 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The malpractice suit pits Harris-Lewis against Dr. Gilbert  
Mudge, who led the specialists, and Drs. Mark Creager and Peter 
Friedman, who were consultants. 
</P>
<P>
	A third consultant, Dr. John Rutherford, recently reached a  
settlement with Harris-Lewis, the terms of which have not been 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith imposed a gag order  
and none of the main players in the case would comment publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	But the story of Lewis' death and the finger-pointing that  
followed has played itself out very publicly in a city that loved 
the Celtics and adored the team's brightest star when he died at 
27. 
</P>
<P>
	It all began April 29, 1993, when Lewis collapsed during a  
playoff game against the Charlotte Hornets. A ``Dream Team'' of New 
England Baptist Hospital doctors assembled by the Celtics diagnosed 
him with arrhythmia, a potentially life-threatening, career-ending 
heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The grim conclusion led Lewis to seek a second opinion from Dr.  
Mudge, of Brigham and Women's Hospital, one of Boston's most 
respected cardiologists. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge reported that Lewis suffered from a neurological disorder  
that causes fainting spells. With proper treatment, he said, Lewis 
could return to professional basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months later, on July 27, Lewis died while shooting hoops  
in the off-season at Brandeis University in Waltham. 
</P>
<P>
	The state medical examiner listed the cause of death as  
adenovirus 2, a common virus that could have led to inflammation of 
the heart, widespread scarring of tissue and, ultimately, a fatal 
cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Autopsy consultants later said Lewis had ``athlete's heart'' -- a  
left ventricle enlarged from pumping massive amounts of blood. 
Examinations of Lewis' body showed no evidence of cocaine use, 
which could have been an explanation for the scarring. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiff attorney Robert Harley said in opening statements that  
Lewis died because his heart arrhythmia was misdiagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the proper treatment had been given, Reggie Lewis would be  
here today,'' Harley said. ``In all likelihood (he) would be 
playing for the Celtics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But William Daley, Mudge's attorney, said Lewis lied about his  
cocaine use until two weeks before he died, making it impossible to 
diagnose him properly. Lewis also refused to follow Mudge's orders 
to stay away from certain physical activities, Daley said in 
opening statements. 
</P>
<P>
	``A disclosure that cocaine was being used would place that  
money in huge jeopardy,'' Daley said, referring to Lewis' 3-year, 
$9 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis has vehemently denied her husband ever used  
cocaine. In the last several months, the two sides have sparred 
over the right to bring up the alleged drug use at trial. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 21, Fremont-Smith ruled that jurors can hear the  
accusations -- if the doctors' lawyers can prove cocaine was a 
factor in misdiagnosing Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a person uses cocaine, it can cause structural damage to  
the heart,'' Fremont-Smith said. ``It does become relevant, in my 
mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis, who still lives in the Boston area with her son,  
7-year-old Reggie Jr., and daughter, 5-year-old Reggiena, has 
maintained she tried to get evidence of alleged drug use excluded 
because the charges only ``sensationalize and hide the true 
issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And she has said she brought the lawsuit only to restore her  
husband's name.

<HEADLINE>  Grissom's Mercury Capsule Located </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Thirty-eight years after it vanished  
into the Atlantic Ocean, the Mercury space capsule flown by 
astronaut Gus Grissom has been found -- in amazingly good condition, 
considering where it is. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Bell 7 -- the only U.S. manned spacecraft ever lost  
following a successful mission -- was discovered Saturday 300 miles 
southeast of Cape Canaveral, three miles beneath the surface of the 
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Salvagers will have to wait several more weeks, however, before  
they can exhume it. The underwater robotic rover that was used to 
identify and photograph the spacecraft sank in rough seas Saturday, 
putting recovery efforts on hold until a new vessel can be 
obtained. 
</P>
<P>
	Expedition leader Curt Newport said on his way back to port  
Sunday that he went from an emotional high when the capsule was 
located to an emotional low when the recovery vessel sank, all in a 
matter of hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't think of a more perfect example of triumph and  
tragedy,'' he said in a ship-to-shore news conference arranged by 
the Discovery Channel, which is funding the mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Before its tether snapped, the remotely operated submersible  
sent back haunting video of the capsule. 
</P>
<P>
	Still shiny in spots, the spacecraft is propped upright on a  
sandy knoll, its window and parachute liner still intact and its 
periscope still extended. The words ``United States'' and ``Liberty 
Bell'' are plainly visible. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport said he also could see the fake crack that was painted  
on the exterior of Liberty Bell 7 to replicate its namesake, as 
well as the singe marks left by the explosives that blew out the 
hatch following splashdown on July 21, 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosives detonated too soon, and the spacecraft took on so  
much water that helicopter rescuers could not lift it from the sea. 
Grissom nearly drowned, but was pulled to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The mishap forever marred Grissom's otherwise successful  
15-minute suborbital flight, which was the nation's second manned 
space shot. The astronaut, who went on to fly in Gemini, insisted 
until his death in the 1967 Apollo launch pad fire that he'd done 
nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Some wondered at the time -- and still do -- whether Grissom  
bumped something or even panicked. 
</P>
<P>
	His widow, Betty Grissom, feels certain the hatch malfunctioned.  
In any case, she wishes the capsule was never found. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Grissom said last month that she resents not being  
consulted from the start about the salvage effort and doesn't want 
the capsule to be restored at the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space 
Center, as is the plan. That's where the capsule eventually will be 
put on display under an agreement with NASA and the Smithsonian 
Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding Grissom's capsule wasn't easy.  
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after setting sail on April 19, Newport and his team  
struggled with a broken sonar. Once fixed, it uncovered 88 
potential targets in a 24-square-mile area that Newport had 
pinpointed based on 14 years of analyzing NASA charts and 
photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	The first target they looked at with the camera-equipped rover  
turned out to be Liberty Bell 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport said the team followed the decomposed pieces of the  
capsule's heat shield up a hill. The trail of debris led them to 
the 7-foot titanium and aluminum capsule. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, Newport thought the dark, tall, conical object was  
airplane wreckage. He was stunned when he saw the words ``United 
States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember saying, 'Oh my God, I can't believe it. That's it.  
We found it. This is it!''' he said. ``There was a lot of shaking 
hands and slapping each other on the back and just congratulating 
each other and just staring in disbelief at this spacecraft in 
front of us, us being the first ones to see it since 1961.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newport, 47, a former space station worker, had made two  
previous attempts to find the capsule in the early 1990s, but did 
not have sophisticated enough equipment or enough time to 
accomplish the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a very difficult thing to find,'' he said. ``You have  
to understand, what we did was find something in water half a mile 
deeper than the Titanic and it's smaller than one of the Titanic's 
boilers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two cameras and a tape recorder that sank with the capsule could  
shed light on why the hatch blew open too soon -- one of the biggest 
mysteries of American space flight. But it's doubtful the film can 
be salvaged after so long underwater. 
</P>
<P>
	The hatch would hold the answer. Newport estimates it could be  
as much as a mile from Liberty Bell 7; he plans to spend a day 
looking for it when he returns for the capsule and the sunken 
rover. 
</P>
<P>
	If the capsule was tough to find, the hatch will be that much  
tougher. But Newport can't resist trying.

<HEADLINE> Smith-De Bruin Appeals Drug Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Three-time Olympic gold medalist  
Michelle Smith-De Bruin appealed to an international panel today to 
overturn her four-year drug ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Lennon, Smith-De Bruin's lawyer, told the International  
Court of Arbitration for Sport, that the swimmer had been denied 
``a reasonable judgment'' and that FINA, swimming's world governing 
body, had failed to prove she had tampered with the urine sample. 
</P>
<P>
	Lennon said the decision last August by a FINA doping panel  
``was patently unsound.'' FINA held Smith-De Bruin responsible for 
tampering with the out-of-competition urine test taken at her home 
in Kilkenny, Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	FINA said the sample was contaminated with large amounts of  
alcohol, probably whiskey. 
</P>
<P>
	FINA lawyer Jean-Pierre Maurand said it was clear that someone  
had tampered with the samples before they came under the governing 
body's control. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us this case is a case of tampering,'' Maurand told the  
three-arbitrator panel. ``Something happened with those samples, 
and I don't think it can be disputed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith-De Bruin's ban includes the Sydney 2000 Olympics and the  
2001 World Championships, in effect ending the 28-year-old Irish 
swimmer's career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am fighting for my reputation and for my right to go to  
Sydney,'' Smith-De Bruin said after the ban was handed down. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith-De Bruin had a mediocre record before capturing three gold  
medals and a bronze at the Atlanta Games, three years after Erik de 
Bruin became her coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Her marriage to de Bruin, the Dutch discus and shot put champion  
banned for four years after testing positive to excessive 
testosterone, stirred speculation that her own meteoric rise had 
been aided by drugs. But she said she had been tested more often 
than any of her rivals and each time the result was negative. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, a test showing containers used to transport  
urine samples can be opened without detection gave Smith-De Bruin 
renewed hope of overturning the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	In test results released in February and carried out on behalf  
of British shot putter Paul Edwards, chemist David Brown showed the 
Versapak drug-test containers could be opened and closed without 
detection by immersion in boiling water. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards, who had been banned for life, had his suspension lifted  
by UK Athletics, the governing body of British track and field, 
pending a review of his case. 
</P>
<P>
	But UK Athletics said the review concerned ``inconsistencies''  
in a hearing held several years ago and was not necessarily related 
to the test results. 
</P>
<P>
	Lennon has said he believes the question of the container,  
dismissed as a ``theoretical possibility'' by the FINA doping 
panel, won't be dismissed in the same way by the CAS. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that he didn't think he would have to show why someone  
would want to tamper with Smith's sample in order to have the ban 
overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	FINA secretary Gunnar Werner argued just the opposite, saying  
Smith would need to show a motive for someone else to have tampered 
with the sample. She maintains that FINA was conspiring ``to ensure 
that I did not swim again.''

the Discovery Channel, which is funding the mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Before its tether snapped, the remotely operated submersible  
sent back haunting video of the capsule. 
</P>
<P>
	Still shiny in spots, the spacecraft is propped upright on a  
sandy knoll, its window and parachute liner still intact and its 
periscope still extended. The words ``United States'' and ``Liberty 
Bell'' are plainly visible. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport said he also could see the fake crack that was painted  
on the exterior of Liberty Bell 7 to replicate its namesake, as 
well as the singe marks left by the explosives that blew out the 
hatch following splashdown on July 21, 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosives detonated too soon, and the spacecraft took on so  
much water that helicopter rescuers could not lift it from the sea. 
Grissom nearly drowned, but was pulled to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The mishap forever marred Grissom's otherwise successful  
15-minute suborbital flight, which was the nation's second manned 
space shot. The astronaut, who went on to fly in Gemini, insisted 
until his death in the 1967 Apollo launch pad fire that he'd done 
nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Some wondered at the time -- and still do -- whether Grissom  
bumped something or even panicked. 
</P>
<P>
	His widow, Betty Grissom, feels certain the hatch malfunctioned.  
In any case, she wishes the capsule was never found. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Grissom said last month that she resents not being  
consulted from the start about the salvage effort and doesn't want 
the capsule to be restored at the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space 
Center, as is the plan. That's where the capsule eventually will be 
put on display under an agreement with NASA and the Smithsonian 
Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding Grissom's capsule wasn't easy.  
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after setting sail on April 19, Newport and his team  
struggled with a broken sonar. Once fixed, it uncovered 88 
potential targets in a 24-square-mile area that Newport had 
pinpointed based on 14 years of analyzing NASA charts and 
photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	The first target they looked at with the camera-equipped rover  
turned out to be Liberty Bell 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport said the team followed the decomposed pieces of the  
capsule's heat shield up a hill. The trail of debris led them to 
the 7-foot titanium and aluminum capsule. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, Newport thought the dark, tall, conical object was  
airplane wreckage. He was stunned when he saw the words ``United 
States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember saying, 'Oh my God, I can't believe it. That's it.  
We found it. This is it!''' he said. ``There was a lot of shaking 
hands and slapping each other on the back and just congratulating 
each other and just staring in disbelief at this spacecraft in 
front of us, us being the first ones to see it since 1961.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newport, 47, a former space station worker, had made two  
previous attempts to find the capsule in the early 1990s, but did 
not have sophisticated enough equipment or enough time to 
accomplish the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a very difficult thing to find,'' he said. ``You have  
to understand, what we did was find something in water half a mile 
deeper than the Titanic and it's smaller than one of the Titanic's 
boilers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two cameras and a tape recorder that sank with the capsule could  
shed light on why the hatch blew open too soon -- one of the biggest 
mysteries of American space flight. But it's doubtful the film can 
be salvaged after so long underwater. 
</P>
<P>
	The hatch would hold the answer. Newport estimates it could be  
as much as a mile from Liberty Bell 7; he plans to spend a day 
looking for it when he returns for the capsule and the sunken 
rover. 
</P>
<P>
	If the capsule was tough to find, the hatch will be that much  
tougher. But Newport can't resist trying.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Warns Japan on Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton warned Japan today to reduce  
its steel shipments to the United States ``on a consistent basis'' 
or the government will act to block them. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi,  
Clinton told a news conference the United States would act to keep 
Japanese steel out of U.S. markets if those imports continue to 
exceed the levels existing prior to the Asian economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will take action if steel imports do not return to their  
pre-crisis levels on a consistent basis,'' Clinton said. ``Playing 
by the rules of trade is the best way to sustain a consensus for 
open trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said last week it had determined that  
Japanese steel companies were engaging in illegal steel dumping -- 
selling abroad at less than home-market prices -- and that tariffs 
of up to 67 percent could be imposed on hot-rolled carbon steel, a 
widely used product. 
</P>
<P>
	Such tariffs, which could be imposed retroactively to  
mid-November, effectively would price that type of steel out of the 
U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said it is important that Japan respect both the  
principles of open trade and fair trade. ``I have fought for both 
objectives. It will help Japan adapt to the challenges of the new 
global economy,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi did not directly address Clinton's warning, but said  
Japan was ``swiftly and boldly taking every measure in order to 
address the difficulties we are facing and to achieve Japan's 
economic recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The steel troubles aside, Clinton warmly welcomed Obuchi to the  
White House for the first official visit of a Japanese prime 
minister in 12 years. He said the fact that Obuchi went to work on 
economic problems immediately after taking office last July was a 
positive indication that Japan will weather its woes. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have been in office less than a year, but already you have  
taken important steps in meeting the challenges that face you, and 
reaching the goals that unite us,'' Clinton said. ``With the right 
choices, Japan and Asia will emerge stronger, more open, more 
democratic, better adapted to meet the 21st century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the two leaders met in the White House, the administration  
announced a package of new trade agreements in which Japan pledged 
greater efforts to expand sales opportunities for U.S. 
telecommunications companies, drug manufacturers, lumber companies, 
banks and brokerage firms and energy companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreements were part of a two-year effort by the  
administration to force Japan to deregulate its economy by removing 
trade barriers. The United States maintains the barriers are a 
major reason for America's trade deficit with Japan, which climbed 
to $64 billion last year, part of a record overall imbalance of 
$169 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the deregulation measures, Deputy U.S. Trade  
Representative Richard Fisher said it will be important for Japan 
to follow through on its commitments, not only for American 
business interests but if Japan is to succeed in ending an 
eight-year period of stagnant economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The emphasis in this is to help Japan turn its economy around  
and pull up its socks,'' Fisher told reporters. ``To do that, 
significant deregulation is mandatory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House arrival ceremony, Obuchi said Japan's  
businesses and industries are now starting to shake off ``an 
overhanging stagnant mood'' and said he would continue to take 
steps to keep that momentum going. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our economy is showing an emerging sign of change for the  
better,'' Obuchi said. ``I am determined to ensure a successful 
revitalization of the Japanese economy, through overcoming with 
unwavering resolve any obstacle we may encounter in the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi, who acknowledges joblessness in Japan is likely to  
deepen, says he is doing all he can but that it will take time to 
reverse the worst recession his country has experienced in 50 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``At present, the United States is perfectly healthy and never  
catches a cold, but on the other hand, Japan has been ailing and 
losing its vigor for the last 10 years,'' Obuchi said Saturday in a 
speech in Chicago, the second stop on his U.S. tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his efforts, Obuchi said, the unemployment rate in Japan  
is 4.8 percent -- twice the rate to which it is accustomed -- and 
Japanese companies can be expected to cut more jobs, a sobering 
thought for workers in a land once proud of its promise of lifetime 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
	Taichi Sakaiya, Japan's minister of economic planning, said last  
week that the country is content to ``achieve growth in a timely 
and flexible manner'' under the strategy Obuchi now is pursuing, 
``and then see if anything else needs to be done.''

<HEADLINE> Protesters Rally Vs. Cuba Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Chanting anti-Castro slogans, Cuban-Americans  
protested Monday's game between the Cuban national team and the 
Baltimore Orioles as a diversion from what they say is the Cuban 
leader's brutal crackdown on dissenters. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters, some of whom had spent a day on buses riding from  
Miami, gathered first at a statute of 19th century Cuban 
independence hero Jose Marti before making their way to the 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria E. Cosculluela, a member of Miami-based Mothers against  
Repression for Cuba, said she could not support the game, even out 
of simple national pride. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are rooting for the Cuban people, the dissidents, the  
people in jail,'' she said. ``We are for the Cuban people, and this 
game should never have happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters wore T-shirts with messages like ``Fidel murderer''  
and ``Justice and human rights now! Baseball later,'' and held 
signs that read ``La Represion en Cuba no es cosa de juego'' (The 
repression in Cuba is not a game). They held a moment of silence 
for those martyred in the fight against the Cuban leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Buses ferried protesters from New York, New Jersey, Washington,  
D.C., and Florida. Two congressmen, Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, 
R-Fla., and Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said they planned to attend and 
support the anti-Castro groups. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time Cuba has played a major league club in  
the United States. In March, the Orioles became the first major 
league team to play in Cuba in 40 years, beating Cuba 3-2 in 11 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles owner Peter Angelos has said his goal is to improve  
relations through people-to-people contact between the two 
countries, which have been divided by a longstanding U.S. trade 
embargo against the communist nation. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said,  
``Regardless of the outcome, the Cuban people will win when they 
have a window to the outside world, even if it is only through the 
televised version of this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sylvia Iriondo, head of Mothers against Repression for Cuba,  
said the game only fostered ``people-to-tyrant contact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This baseball game hides the desire of many commercial  
enterprises that want to do business with Cuba's bloody dictator,'' 
she said.

<HEADLINE> Rice Wine Loses in Taiwan's WTO Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The price of joining the World Trade  
Organization hit home in Taiwan on Monday, when a popular rice wine 
was pulled off the shelves and substituted with a wine costing 
three times as much. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bureau of Cigarette and Wine Monopoly suspended sales of  
michiu, a rice wine used widely in cooking, as part of a package of 
concessions by Taiwan in its bid to join the body that governs 
international trade. 
</P>
<P>
	But some consumers were furious when they went to the stores and  
found that michiu, which costs about 72 cents a pint, had been 
replaced with Fragrant Rice Michiu, which costs $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is, after all, a cooking wine and the price hike is  
outrageous,'' said Chang Pi-hua, a mother of two. Many Taiwanese 
generously add the wine to popular recipes like stewed chicken, 
duck and mutton. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to be accepted as a WTO member sometime this year, Taiwan  
agreed to gradually increase the price of michiu over five years to 
$5.60. WTO members also have demanded that Taiwan impose taxes on 
liquor based on alcoholic content, regardless of its use, and scrap 
its liquor monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Legislature was expected to consider new liquor taxes  
proposed last month by the Cabinet sometime before Taiwan's 
anticipated entry into WTO later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	After the taxes were proposed, angry consumers immediately  
started hoarding michiu, clearing out the shelves in stores. The 
bureau responded by suspending sales Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to concerns that the suspension would result in more  
people illegally brewing their own wine, bureau head Shih 
Yen-shiang said Monday that michiu may be placed back on sale next 
week.

<HEADLINE> Umpire Hospitalized as Precaution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Umpire Kerwin Danley was hospitalized  
overnight Monday after becoming light-headed while working home 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Danley left after the second inning of the Cincinnati Reds' 4-3  
victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks, walking off the field 
without assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	When a medical exam at Cinergy Field found that his blood  
pressure was high, Danley was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital for 
further tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpire Ed Montague, who took over behind the plate, said Danley  
has not felt well for the last few days. The umpiring crew worked a 
3-hour, 48-minute game in Montreal on Sunday and had to get up at 6 
a.m. Monday to catch a flight to Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't been feeling well lately, so they want to make sure  
he's all right,'' Montague said. ``When we were in Montreal, he 
said he hadn't been feeling well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the game was played with three umpires.  
</P>
<P>
	Danley, 37, worked his first National League game in 1992 and  
became an NL regular last season. 
</P>
<P>
	After Danley made it through the first inning on a 78-degree  
evening, Montague went into the umpires' dressing room to put on 
his chest protector and shin guards so he could replace him after 
the next half-inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Diamondbacks catcher Damian Miller said Danley gave no  
indication to him that anything was wrong. Miller got the start 
because Kelly Stinnett became ill shortly before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of those nights, I guess,'' Miller said. ``He  
didn't say anything to me about feeling bad.''

<HEADLINE> Mayor Arrested in Corruption Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A mayor and two former police officers were among  
those arrested today in a corruption case alleging they charged a 
``street tax'' to bars, restaurants and adult bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials called it the most significant case in years  
involving Chicago-area organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``It targets the corruption of police and public officials who  
the mob allegedly bribed,'' U.S. Attorney Scott Lassar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indicted were Anthony T. Centracchio, an alleged mob boss; Stone  
Park Mayor Robert D. Natale; former Stone Park police Lt. Thomas R. 
Tucker and former Franklin Park officer Robert Urbinati. The men 
have pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	A Chicago crime commission has said Centracchio is the head of  
the mob on the city's West Side and in DuPage County. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thursday federal indictment accuses the four of a conspiracy  
to put illegal gambling devices such as video poker in numerous 
west suburban bars, restaurants and fraternal clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment also says the participants imposed a ``street  
tax'' -- or charge for protection on establishments as far north as 
Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Students Return to Studies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Welcoming signs and banners decorated  
Chatfield High School today as students arrived from former rival 
Columbine, who hadn't been to class since the devastating shooting 
attack nearly two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	For the rest of the school year, Chatfield students get their  
school for morning sessions. Columbine students, whose school is 
still a police crime scene, arrived around lunchtime today to take 
over Chatfield for afternoon classes. 
</P>
<P>
	Three large banners adorned the school today, one reading  
simply: ``Welcome Columbine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine students Veronica Nuncio and Breanna Cook, both  
17-year-old juniors, showed up for their first day of classes in a 
small car with the words ``We are Columbine'' on the back window. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been really nice, very supportive,'' Cook said of the  
Chatfield students and staff. ``I didn't think they would want us 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nuncio said she was near the cafeteria when shooting broke out  
in her school, and she saw people get shot. She said she still has 
trouble sleeping, and she was nervous about going back to school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel safe still,'' she said. ``I feel like I'm a  
walking target for anybody now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The roughly 2,000 Columbine students haven't been in class since  
Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, went on a shooting and 
bombing rampage on April 20, killing 12 students, a teacher and 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Chatfield, about 3 miles from Columbine, was decorated to  
welcome the Columbine students, with unity signs incorporating the 
Chatfield Chargers' signature burgundy with the Columbine Rebels' 
navy blue. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can do anything to help them, we're happy to do it,''  
said Amber Mancuso, a Chatfield junior. ``I think it's hit all of 
us hard, all of us have friends there. When we found out, probably 
half the school was crying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're welcoming them with open arms,'' Chatfield senior Chris  
Durant said. ``Students are trying to do what they can to make the 
Columbine students feel comfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the investigation into the shootings continued, Jefferson  
County Sheriff John P. Stone said the man suspected of selling a 
semiautomatic handgun used in the massacre could surrender today. 
</P>
<P>
	The man faces a state felony charge of selling a handgun to a  
minor, the sheriff said late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis refused to elaborate on the  
timing of the arrest today. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,000 students, faculty and parents attended one last  
memorial Sunday at the majestic Red Rocks amphitheater west of 
Denver. Students gave touching tributes to the dead, while school 
administrators tried to ease tensions about heading back to school. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to get back on the horse,'' school board president  
Jon DeStefano said. ``This will take courage for all of us. But I 
promise you, you will be safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Sunday's memorial, a student representative from each of the  
four grades sent get-well wishes to the 23 wounded, five of whom 
remained in Denver hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want you to know that we miss you guys and that we look  
forward to having you back again in school with us,'' said Tim 
Matteson, the sophomore class representative. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, authorities appeared to move closer to concluding  
that Harris and Klebold acted alone in the attack. Detectives 
initially suspected a wider conspiracy after finding 50 bombs in 
and around Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no solid evidence to indicate there was anyone else in  
the school ... or that anybody assisted them in coming in and out 
of the school ... or transporting these items,'' District Attorney 
Dave Thomas told The Washington Post on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a sheriff's deputy said Klebold's parents were  
``very cooperative'' while being interviewed by investigators. 
Thomas and Susan Klebold met with authorities Friday to answer 
questions about their son.

	Harris' parents have refused to talk with investigators unless  
they get immunity from criminal prosecution.

	Back at the memorial site near Columbine, a set of 8-foot-high  
wooden crosses erected to honor the victims was taken down by the 
Illinois carpenter who put them up just last week. Greg Zanis was 
criticized for putting up crosses for the killers near those of the 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	An angry father of one of the victims took down the crosses for  
Harris and Klebold, saying it wasn't appropriate to honor the 
shooters in the same spot. Later, two smaller crosses were put up 
for Harris and Klebold before Zanis arrived early Sunday and 
removed his entire display.

<HEADLINE>  Grissom's Mercury Capsule Located </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Thirty-eight years after it vanished  
into the Atlantic Ocean, the Mercury space capsule flown by 
astronaut Gus Grissom has been found -- in amazingly good condition, 
considering where it is. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Bell 7 -- the only U.S. manned spacecraft ever lost  
following a successful mission -- was discovered Saturday 300 miles 
southeast of Cape Canaveral, three miles beneath the surface of the 
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Salvagers will have to wait several more weeks, however, before  
they can exhume it. The underwater robotic rover that was used to 
identify and photograph the spacecraft sank in rough seas Saturday, 
putting recovery efforts on hold until a new vessel can be 
obtained. 
</P>
<P>
	Expedition leader Curt Newport said on his way back to port  
Sunday that he went from an emotional high when the capsule was 
located to an emotional low when the recovery vessel sank, all in a 
matter of hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't think of a more perfect example of triumph and  
tragedy,'' he said in a ship-to-shore news conference arranged by 
the Discovery Channel, which is funding the mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Before its tether snapped, the remotely operated submersible  
sent back haunting video of the capsule. 
</P>
<P>
	Still shiny in spots, the spacecraft is propped upright on a  
sandy knoll, its window and parachute liner still intact and its 
periscope still extended. The words ``United States'' and ``Liberty 
Bell'' are plainly visible. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport said he also could see the fake crack that was painted  
on the exterior of Liberty Bell 7 to replicate its namesake, as 
well as the singe marks left by the explosives that blew out the 
hatch following splashdown on July 21, 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosives detonated too soon, and the spacecraft took on so  
much water that helicopter rescuers could not lift it from the sea. 
Grissom nearly drowned, but was pulled to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The mishap forever marred Grissom's otherwise successful  
15-minute suborbital flight, which was the nation's second manned 
space shot. The astronaut, who went on to fly in Gemini, insisted 
until his death in the 1967 Apollo launch pad fire that he'd done 
nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Some wondered at the time -- and still do -- whether Grissom  
bumped something or even panicked. 
</P>
<P>
	His widow, Betty Grissom, feels certain the hatch malfunctioned.  
In any case, she wishes the capsule was never found. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Grissom said last month that she resents not being  
consulted from the start about the salvage effort and doesn't want 
the capsule to be restored at the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space 
Center, as is the plan. That's where the capsule eventually will be 
put on display under an agreement with NASA and the Smithsonian 
Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding Grissom's capsule wasn't easy.  
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after setting sail on April 19, Newport and his team  
struggled with a broken sonar. Once fixed, it uncovered 88 
potential targets in a 24-square-mile area that Newport had 
pinpointed based on 14 years of analyzing NASA charts and 
photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	The first target they looked at with the camera-equipped rover  
turned out to be Liberty Bell 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport said the team followed the decomposed pieces of the  
capsule's heat shield up a hill. The trail of debris led them to 
the 7-foot titanium and aluminum capsule. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, Newport thought the dark, tall, conical object was  
airplane wreckage. He was stunned when he saw the words ``United 
States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember saying, 'Oh my God, I can't believe it. That's it.  
We found it. This is it!''' he said. ``There was a lot of shaking 
hands and slapping each other on the back and just congratulating 
each other and just staring in disbelief at this spacecraft in 
front of us, us being the first ones to see it since 1961.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newport, 47, a former space station worker, had made two  
previous attempts to find the capsule in the early 1990s, but did 
not have sophisticated enough equipment or enough time to 
accomplish the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a very difficult thing to find,'' he said. ``You have  
to understand, what we did was find something in water half a mile 
deeper than the Titanic and it's smaller than one of the Titanic's 
boilers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two cameras and a tape recorder that sank with the capsule could  
shed light on why the hatch blew open too soon -- one of the biggest 
mysteries of American space flight. But it's doubtful the film can 
be salvaged after so long underwater. 
</P>
<P>
	The hatch would hold the answer. Newport estimates it could be  
as much as a mile from Liberty Bell 7; he plans to spend a day 
looking for it when he returns for the capsule and the sunken 
rover. 
</P>
<P>
	If the capsule was tough to find, the hatch will be that much  
tougher. But Newport can't resist trying.

<HEADLINE> Court To Decide on Appeals Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court said today it will use a  
California case to decide whether criminal defense lawyers have a 
duty to file appeals after their clients plead guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices voted to review the case of a California man  
sentenced to 15 years to life in prison after pleading guilty in 
1993 to second-degree murder. The court documents submitted in 
Lucio Flores Ortega's case gave no details of the crime. The 
charges had been filed in Fresno County. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortega, who spoke no English, did not appeal his plea-bargained  
conviction until it was too late under state law. When he did 
appeal, California appellate courts and a federal trial judge 
turned him down. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out Ortega's  
conviction last November, ruling that his public-defender lawyer 
had violated Ortega's Sixth Amendment right to adequate legal 
representation by failing to file an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortega contended that in 1993 he had requested such an appeal  
within the 60-day deadline, but that the lawyer never followed 
through. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court ordered California authorities to release  
Ortega unless a state court re-enters a conviction and allows an 
appeal within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, state prosecutors argued that  
defense lawyers commit no constitutional error when they do not 
file appeals in behalf of clients who pleaded guilty, were informed 
of right to appeal and made no such request. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal said other federal appeals courts have issued rulings  
in conflict with the 9th Circuit Court's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Roe vs. Ortega, 98-1441.

	Fatal Tornado Hits Oklahoma  
</P>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- A tornado that witnesses said was at least  
a half-mile wide tore through the central part of the state 
tonight, wiping out neighborhoods and causing an unknown number of 
fatalities. Oklahoma City police dispatcher John Zondol said there 
were a few fatalities and at least 400 houses had been destroyed. 
Forecasters said the tornado would register as an F-5, the 
strongest classifications for twisters. Television reports showed 
hundreds of homes destroyed east of Oklahoma City. Heavy damage 
also was reported in Moore, east of Oklahoma City.

	Jackson: Don't Demonize Milosevic  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson returned from  
Yugoslavia today and urged President Clinton to call Slobodan 
Milosevic and release two Yugoslav prisoners of war as a goodwill 
gesture that can lead to peace. A senior administration official 
said there are no plans to meet Jackson's two requests. Upon 
returning to Washington, Jackson met with Clinton to give him the 
letter Jackson received from Milosevic in Belgrade. Jackson, 
speaking to reporters after meeting the president, did not reveal 
the letter's contents. But Jackson said Clinton did not reject his 
appeal outright, so he remains hopeful he president will respond.

	Clinton: Pause in Bombing Possible  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. official who sat in on a meeting today  
with Viktor Chernomyrdin said the Russian envoy's report on his 
talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade last 
Friday revealed nothing that merits serious consideration. 
Chernomyrdin met with President Clinton today to urge a diplomatic 
solution to the Kosovo standoff. Clinton said ``we could have a 
bombing pause'' in Yugoslavia if Milosevic accepts NATO's demands 
for the withdrawal of his troops, the return of refugees and the 
deployment of an international security force. Chernomyrdin said 
after the meeting with Clinton that ``we got closer to a diplomatic 
solution.''

	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The attorney for the man arrested on  
suspicion of supplying the Columbine High School gunmen with a 
semiautomatic handgun said his client knew nothing of the impending 
massacre. Mark Manes ``was horrified when it happened,'' said 
attorney Robert Ransome. Manes, 22, of Littleton, was booked for 
investigation of providing a handgun to a minor, a charges that 
carries a maximum six years in prison. He was released on bond. 
Manes, who once attended Columbine, was the first person since the 
April 20 shootings to be arrested on charges of helping Eric 
Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, arm themselves.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Aetna Inc. is launching a no-frills health  
insurance policy geared to help the 25 million working Americans 
who are uninsured. The program, called Affordable HealthChoices, 
will be sold to employers who can't afford to offer a policy to 
their workers or have had to drop the insurance benefit because of 
higher premiums. Aetna's new policy will cost as little as $46 per 
person, or $156 per family, per month. The employer can elect to 
pay all or part of the premium.

at-bats against Pittsburgh tonight, becoming the first San 
Francisco Giants player to do so since Robby Thompson on April 22, 
1991. Kent is the 19th player in Giants' history to hit a single, 
double, triple and homer in the same game -- something Giants star 
Barry Bonds has never done. Kent singled in the first inning before 
hitting a three-run homer in the third for his first RBIs since 
April 20. He tripled to center field in the fifth and doubled down 
the left-field line in the seventh.

<HEADLINE>  Netanyahu: Proud To Be Riffraff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Eagerly grasping a campaign issue handed  
him by his opponents, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu surveyed 
cheering supporters Monday in a Tel Aviv slum and declared: ``I am 
proud to be riffraff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu was responding to an actress and backer of his rival,  
Ehud Barak, who used the slur in a rally to describe Netanyahu 
voters, many of them Sephardic Jews of Middle Eastern origin. 
</P>
<P>
	The remark has ignited Israel's ethnic powder keg less than two  
weeks before May 17 elections and was expected to help Netanyahu 
revive his sluggish campaign and catch up to Barak in the polls. 
Barak's Labor Party is still closely identified with Israel's 
predominantly European-born elites. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu quickly seized actress Tiki Dayan's remarks and turned  
them into the centerpiece of his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor leaders ``understand, of course, that this is going to  
hurt them because it reveals that they all think this way,'' 
Netanyahu told Israel army radio. 
</P>
<P>
	His Likud Party ran a TV campaign ad replaying excerpts from  
Dayan's speech, followed by footage of a smiling Barak and an 
announcer saying: ``Barak clapped, laughed and didn't say anything. 
Such a man cannot be prime minister.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labor responded by screening some unedited footage showing that  
Barak was laughing at something else entirely. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu made an unscheduled campaign stop Monday in the  
outdoor market of the poor Hatikvah quarter, a Likud stronghold of 
Sephardic Jews, to reinforce the message. Surrounded by cheering 
vendors and shoppers, Netanyahu declared he was proud to be 
``asafsouf'' (pronounced as-af-SOOF') -- the Hebrew word for 
riffraff. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an ugly comment,'' vendor Ezra Mizrahi, 48, said of  
Dayan's statement as he measured coffee beans into a grinder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you think there's no discrimination any more?'' he asked,  
his large eyes narrowing in anger as he told how his daughter was 
refused entry into a prestigious high school because of her 
Sephardic last name. 
</P>
<P>
	Sephardic Jews find it hard to forgive the Labor Party for  
mistreating waves of North African immigrants in the early years of 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Barak took the unusual step of asking for forgiveness  
from the Sephardic community for his party's wrongs. Now Labor 
campaign managers worry that one word from an actress may have 
scuttled all their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	It was all the more maddening to the Labor activists because it  
has happened before. 
</P>
<P>
	Menachem Begin's Likud government was in serious trouble in 1981  
until an actor took a microphone at a rally and called Likud 
backers ``chach-chachim,'' Hebrew slang for roughnecks. Begin 
latched on to the ethnic issue and rode it to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu narrowly won the 1996 election by putting together a  
coalition of what he said were Israel's outsiders -- Sephardic Jews, 
ultra-Orthodox Jews and Russian immigrants. Although of European 
descent himself, he presented himself as the underdog who would 
seize power from Israel's elites. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1999 campaign, he has tried to revive that coalition, but  
has run into some trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak, who is also of European origin, has made inroads among  
Sephardic Jews and disappointed Likud supporters, and there is 
growing acrimony between two former Netanyahu allies, the Russian 
immigrants' party, Israel B'Aliya, and the ultra-Orthodox Shas 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor activists are trying to control the damage caused by  
Dayan's comments. They point out that she is Sephardic herself and 
has apologized. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the shopkeepers in the Hatikvah quarter agreed with  
Labor that her slip-up is being blown out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
	But the neighborhood remains Likud territory. The people say  
they have always voted Likud. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a strong leader, we can trust him,'' said Ofer Yaacov,  
36, cutting up a chicken in his butcher shop. Barak's accusation 
that Netanyahu constantly lies doesn't bother him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone lies, that's what works today,'' he explained. ``You  
can trust him to lie to everyone.''

	Last year, Barak took the unusual step of asking for forgiveness  
from the Sephardic community for his party's wrongs. Now Labor 
campaign managers worry that one word from an actress may have 
scuttled all their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	It was all the more maddening to the Labor activists because it  
has happened before. 
</P>
<P>
	Menachem Begin's Likud government was in serious trouble in 1981  
until an actor took a microphone at a rally and called Likud 
backers ``chach-chachim,'' Hebrew slang for roughnecks. Begin 
latched on to the ethnic issue and rode it to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu narrowly won the 1996 election by putting together a  
coalition of what he said were Israel's outsiders -- Sephardic Jews, 
ultra-Orthodox Jews and Russian immigrants. Although of European 
descent himself, he presented himself as the underdog who would 
seize power from Israel's elites. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1999 campaign, he has tried to revive that coalition, but  
has run into some trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak, who is also of European origin, has made inroads among  
Sephardic Jews and disappointed Likud supporters, and there is 
growing acrimony between two former Netanyahu allies, the Russian 
immigrants' party, Israel B'Aliya, and the ultra-Orthodox Shas 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor activists are trying to control the damage caused by  
Dayan's comments. They point out that she is Sephardic herself and 
has apologized. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the shopkeepers in the Hatikvah quarter agreed with  
Labor that her slip-up is being blown out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
	But the neighborhood remains Likud territory. The people say  
they have always voted Likud. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a strong leader, we can trust him,'' said Ofer Yaacov,  
36, cutting up a chicken in his butcher shop. Barak's accusation 
that Netanyahu constantly lies doesn't bother him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone lies, that's what works today,'' he explained. ``You  
can trust him to lie to everyone.''

<HEADLINE>  Tape Figures in Marine Pilot Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A back-seat crewman on the Marine jet  
that sliced an Italian gondola cable -- killing 20 people -- 
testified today he was asked by the pilot and navigator what to do 
with a videotape shot during the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said I'd get rid of it,'' Capt. Chandler Seagraves said at  
the court-martial of Capt. Richard Ashby. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagraves, who testified under immunity, was the main witness  
against Ashby, who is charged with obstruction of justice and 
conspiracy for helping his navigator get rid of the personal tape. 
</P>
<P>
	The government rested its case Monday. If convicted, Ashby, 32,  
could be sentenced to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagraves said he was approached by Ashby and navigator Capt.  
Joseph Schweitzer, 31, a few days after the mishap. Schweitzer told 
him they had taken a tape out of the crippled jet and asked what 
Seagraves thought should be done with it. 
</P>
<P>
	After Seagraves told them to dispose of it, he said Schweitzer  
told him several days later that the tape was gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer has pleaded guilty to obstruction and conspiracy and  
was sentenced by a jury to dismissal from the Marines after 
admitting he threw the videotape into a bonfire. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagraves also testified that the four crew members met  
individually with Italian officials the day after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew they obviously were looking into what was going on, but  
at that time, that was the least of my concerns,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors were trying to establish that Ashby knew there was a  
criminal investigation underway when he helped destroy the video. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby has admitting taking the tape from the jet, but maintains  
he didn't intend to obstruct justice because he didn't know there 
was a criminal investigation at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Another military jury acquitted Ashby in March of 20 counts of  
involuntary manslaughter stemming from the Feb. 3, 1998 accident.

<HEADLINE>  Ex-Celtic Lewis' Death Is Disputed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Celtics captain Reggie Lewis died because  
his heart condition was misdiagnosed, a lawyer for his widow told 
jurors today. But a defense lawyer said the basketball star died 
after lying about cocaine use. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis collapsed and died while practicing jump shots in 1993,  
leaving a pregnant wife and thousands of fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The malpractice suit pits Donna Harris-Lewis against three of  
the city's most prominent physicians, Dr. Gilbert Mudge, who led 
the specialists, and Drs. Mark Creager and Peter Friedman, who were 
consultants. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiff attorney Robert Harley said in opening statements  
today that Lewis died because his heart arrhythmia was not 
diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the proper treatment had been given, Reggie Lewis would be  
here today,'' Harley said. ``In all likelihood (he) would be 
playing for the Celtics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But William Daley, Mudge's attorney, said in his opening  
statement that Lewis lied to doctors about cocaine use until two 
weeks before he died, making it impossible to diagnose him 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
	``A disclosure that cocaine was being used would place that  
money in huge jeopardy,'' Daley said, referring to Lewis' 3-year, 
$9 million contract. He said that when Mudge finally was told of 
cocaine use, he told Lewis that he should be checked out further, 
but Lewis died before that was arranged. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis also refused to follow doctors orders to stay away from  
certain physical activities, Daley said in opening statements. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to everyone finally hearing the truth  
about Reggie and how his life could have been saved,'' Harris-Lewis 
said in a statement issued today. ``When this is over, I hope and 
pray justice will finally be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith imposed a gag order  
and none of the main participants in the case would comment 
publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	But the story of Lewis' death and the finger-pointing that  
followed has played itself out very publicly in a city that loved 
its Celtics and adored the team's brightest star when he died at 
27. 
</P>
<P>
	It began April 29, 1993, when Lewis collapsed during a playoff  
game against the Charlotte Hornets. A ``Dream Team'' of New England 
Baptist Hospital doctors assembled by the Celtics diagnosed him 
with arrhythmia, a potentially life-threatening, career-ending 
heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The grim conclusion led Lewis to seek a second opinion from one  
of Boston's most respected cardiologists -- Mudge of Brigham and 
Women's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge reported that Lewis suffered from a neurological disorder  
that causes fainting spells. With proper treatment, he said, Lewis 
could return to professional basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months later, on July 27, Lewis died while shooting hoops  
in the off-season at Brandeis University in Waltham. 
</P>
<P>
	The state medical examiner listed the cause of death as  
adenovirus 2, a common virus that can cause inflammation of the 
heart, widespread scarring of tissue and, ultimately, fatal cardiac 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Autopsy consultants later said Lewis had ``athlete's heart'' -- a  
left ventricle that has become enlarged from pumping massive 
amounts of blood. Everyone who examined Lewis' body agreed there 
was no evidence of cocaine use, which could have been an 
alternative explanation for the scarring. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mudge later said that two weeks before Lewis died, he  
acknowledged using cocaine in the past, but said he had stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis has vehemently denied her husband ever used  
cocaine. In the last several months, the two sides have sparred 
over the right to bring up the alleged drug use at trial. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 21, the judge ruled that jurors can hear the  
accusations -- if the doctors' lawyers can prove cocaine was a 
factor in misdiagnosing Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a person uses cocaine, it can cause structural damage to  
the heart,'' Fremont-Smith said. ``It does become relevant, in my 
mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis, who lives in the Boston area with her son,  
7-year-old Reggie Jr., and daughter, 5-year-old Reggiena, has 
maintained she tried to get evidence of alleged drug use excluded 
because the charges only ``sensationalize and hide the true 
issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A third consultant, Dr. John Rutherford, recently reached a  
settlement with Harris-Lewis, the terms of which have not been 
disclosed.

<HEADLINE> 2000 Sydney Games: 500 Days To Go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- With 500 days to go before the Sydney  
Olympics, organizers still cannot escape the shadow of the last six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The bribery scandal involved in Salt Lake City's winning bid for  
the 2002 Winter Olympics erupted last November, and has since 
brought the purge of 10 International Olympic Committee members, 
the creation of two panels to regulate ethics and write new rules, 
and tarnished the image of the games and their leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney organizers want to refocus attention on the athletes and  
competition. Yet as the 500-day countdown passes Tuesday, the 
scandal remains in the spotlight despite good progress on 
preparations for the games of Sept. 15-Oct. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction of venues and the athletes village is on or ahead  
of schedule, with the 100,000-seat Olympic Stadium opened to rave 
reviews more than a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests of the stadiums and the transportation system for the  
games have been positive, if not perfect, and the huge events 
schedule is set. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very satisfied,'' said Jacques Rogge, an IOC executive  
board member and head of the committee's coordination panel for the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge's commission reviewed venues, transportation , housing,  
security and coordination with international sports bodies during a 
visit last month, the first by top IOC officials since the scandal 
broke. 
</P>
<P>
	But even that visit was colored by the bribery scandal. Rogge  
spent his first day with Australian sponsors, saying the IOC had 
betrayed them, the athletes and the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Budget problems also dog the Sydney Organizing Committee for the  
Olympic Games, which last month cut $32.5 million from sponsorship 
forecasts and put another $16 million into a contingency fund in 
case things get worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said Sydney's sponsorship goals always were overambitious,  
but acknowledged the scandal discouraged sponsors. He said reform 
will make the IOC a ``better-functioning'' IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the Sydney Games are not going to be damaged long  
term, or at games time,'' Rogge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney organizers said the cuts will be made through  
``reorganization of priorities'' rather than budget slashing. The 
``core quality'' of the games won't be affected, although ``we are 
not considering anything immune,'' said Michael Knight, the 
Olympics minister of New South Wales and the head of the organizing 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG still has to find about $110 million before the Olympics,  
a figure Rogge said was achievable. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, an Australian IOC member is one of two who remain  
under investigation in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Coles was censured after the Salt Lake investigation and  
stands further accused of receiving excessive gifts from another 
bidding city. His case is expected to be decided by the IOC this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	While the scandal has simmered, Sydney organizers are gearing up  
their campaigns for public support. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100,000 people attended the opening of the Olympic  
Stadium in March with a fireworks display and rugby league games. 
Other events have been marred slightly by a transportation glitch, 
which once sent a trainload of city-bound spectators in the wrong 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
	The path of the Olympic torch relay is so extensive -- including  
an underwater visit to the Great Barrier Reef -- that even people 
living in the most remote town will not have to travel far to see 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG's next big challenge is to sell 5 million tickets reserved  
for Australians to the 1,700 events covering 28 sports, which go on 
sale in late May. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight says the necessary cuts are small in an overall budget of  
$1.6 billion. But there is no doubt finding the savings puts 
pressure on the overall spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG chief executive Sandy Hollway has imposed a freeze on  
staff hiring. And while looking for cuts elsewhere, SOCOG has had 
to boost its budget to solve emerging technology problems, an area 
that plagued Atlanta in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said the coordination commission was watching technology  
closely, although he was reassured by the allocation of extra money 
and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight is determined that the forecast budget surplus of $19.5  
million not be touched. After spending $1.3 billion of public money 
on venues, taxpayers deserve to get something back, Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can't put on a great games for 2.5 billion (Australian  
dollars), then everybody involved deserves to be sacked and I 
should be politically executed,'' Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG is facing opposition from local residents who claim the  
beach volleyball event will close off too much of famous Bondi 
Beach for too long. 
</P>
<P>
	The local council said it is willing to negotiate a better  
compensation deal with SOCOG, after Knight hinted SOCOG would 
consider legal action if the council tried to renege.

<HEADLINE> EU Panel Finds Beef Hormones Unsafe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union scientific experts said  
Monday one of six growth hormones contained in U.S. beef exports 
and banned by the EU can cause cancer. But the experts admitted 
they lack evidence to prove all the hormones pose a health risk to 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report released Monday, the EU's Scientific Committee on  
Veterinary Measures said the hormone 17 beta-oestradiol ``has to be 
considered as a complete carcinogen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It exerts both tumor initiating and tumor promoting effects.  
In plain language this means that even small additional doses of 
residues of this hormone in meat, arising from its use as a growth 
promoter in cattle, has an inherent risk of causing cancer,'' the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 90 percent of American cattle producers feed hormones  
approved by the Food and Drug Administration to cattle to make them 
grow faster and bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, the World Trade Organization ruled that the EU ban  
on hormone-treated beef was illegal and must be lifted by May 13. 
It said the EU's ban was not backed up by the proper risk analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU has been importing hormone-free beef only from the United  
States and other countries since 1989. The EU has threatened to 
extend its ban to cover all beef exports from the United States 
because of fears that U.S. beef shipped as hormone-free may 
actually contain hormone residue. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee said it had inadequate data to make a definitive  
finding on other growth hormones used in U.S. beef: progesterone, 
testosterone, zeranol, trenbolone and melengestrol acetate. The 
scientists said exposure to small levels of residues in meat and 
meat products ``carries risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the six hormones may cause a variety of health  
problems including cancer, developmental problems, harm to immune 
systems and brain disease, but it acknowledged ``the available data 
do not enable a quantitative estimate of the risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	EU spokesman Pietro Petrucci said the 20-member European  
Commission will examine the report by the scientific committee and 
decide by May 13, whether to ask the WTO for an extension of the 
ban on the basis of the preliminary scientific evidence.

radio network, announced Monday an agreement to broadcast live

<HEADLINE> Circus Circus Proposing Name Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Circus Circus Enterprises Inc. is so pleased  
with the success of its new Mandalay Bay resort that it wants to 
rename the company after it. 
</P>
<P>
	The gambling company said Monday it will propose to shareholders  
that the company be renamed Mandalay Resort Group at its annual 
meeting in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The company revealed the new name at the same time it reported  
that its results for the quarter ending April 30 will significantly 
exceed the estimates of Wall Street analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expected earnings on an operating basis of about 25  
cents a share, while the company said it will be 40 cents to 42 
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The news boosted Circus Circus shares in midday trading by about  
13.4 percent, as it rose $2.81 1/4 a share to $23.87 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Circus Circus said in a statement that a good start at Mandalay  
Bay, which opened in March, and strong occupancy rates and room 
rate increases at its other hotel-casinos led to a very good 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Circus Circus also reported it has authorized a share repurchase  
program for up to 15 percent of the company's outstanding shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Circus Circus owns and operates 11 properties in Nevada,  
including five on the Las Vegas Strip. It also has a hotel-casino 
in Mississippi and owns a half interest in a riverboat casino in 
Illinois.

<HEADLINE> Racing Track Offering Counseling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- The track where three fans were killed by  
flying debris is offering counseling for other spectators, and has 
set up a trust fund for the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight other fans were injured Saturday night when parts from a  
three-car wreck at more than 200 mph during an Indy Racing League 
event flew over a safety fence and into the grandstand. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe's Motor Speedway officials also said Monday that they  
probably would increase the height of the safety fences surrounding 
the 1 1/2-mile superspeedway in response to the crash during the 
VisionAire 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to Saturday night, no spectators had died at the track,  
which opened in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on everything that's happened in our 40-year history  
this is certainly an isolated event, but we need to keep it that 
way,'' track spokesman Jerry Gappens said Monday. ``The fans need 
reassurance that we're going to keep working to make it a safe 
place for them, and we're very committed to doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The speedway scheduled three counseling sessions Tuesday at a  
clinic in nearby Charlotte to help spectators cope with their 
grief. The track is paying for the sessions, and depending on the 
response, officials said more sessions could be arranged. 
</P>
<P>
	The speedway also established a trust fund designed to help the  
families of those who were injured and killed. The fund will be 
administered by First Union, which will appoint a board of trustees 
to distribute the funds as the members see fit. The track will not 
be represented on the board. 
</P>
<P>
	Early indications were that the trust fund will be a popular way  
for people to express their support for the victims. The speedway 
canceled the race shortly after the crash and offered to refund the 
total cost of the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	But within minutes spectators began leaving telephone messages  
at the track office offering to target their refunds for a trust 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
	When the speedway reopened for business Monday morning, it was  
more of the same. By the time the business day ended, track 
officials said about 80 percent of the people who called about 
refunds wanted to know how they could earmark that money for the 
victims and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	The track also got calls from people who didn't attend the race  
but wanted to make donations to a trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets for the race, which drew almost 50,000, cost $15, $30  
and $45. 
</P>
<P>
	The event was barely one-fourth complete when a three-car crash  
at speeds near 215 mph launched a wheel and suspension parts over a 
fence and into a crowded grandstand near the exit of the fourth 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
	The catch fence where the accident occurred rises 15 feet above  
the racing surface, a height that is standard for most 
superspeedways. The fence is topped off with a 35-inch overhang 
that leans out over the track at a 45-degree angle. 
</P>
<P>
	The track, until this season known as Charlotte Motor Speedway,  
spent more than $1 million on various safety improvements in the 
months leading up to its first IRL race in 1997. Those upgrades 
included raising the height of the fence. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gappens said Monday that the speedway's engineers and  
architects were studying the possibility of raising the fence again 
as well as extending the length of the overhang. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has evolved to where it is today, and I would think it  
would continue to evolve,'' he said. ``That's one of the things 
we're looking into right now. We don't know for sure what we're 
going to do, but that's one thing we're considering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Track president H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler and a speedway chaplain  
drove to Connelly Springs on Monday morning to visit the families 
of Randy Pyatte and Jeff Patton, two of the spectators who were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of Dexter B. Mobley, the other spectator who died,  
arrived from Georgia on Monday and came to the speedway. Doug 
Stafford, the track's senior vice president, met with the family 
members and, at their request, took them out to see where Mobley 
was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, a 9-year-old girl remained in critical condition at  
Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte with brain and lung bruises. 
Hailey McGee of Conover is the only one of the eight injured people 
still in a hospital.

<HEADLINE> Exxon Appeals Valdez $5.3B Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Nearly five years after an Alaska jury awarded  
$5.3 billion in punitive and compensatory damages to those hurt by 
the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, Exxon has yet to pay a single 
dollar to the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Exxon lawyers told a three-judge panel of the 9th  
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the award was not be justified 
considering what it had already paid. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, a federal court jury in Anchorage issued the damages to  
35,000 fishermen, Native Americans, cannery workers and landowners 
for the destruction caused by the spill in Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon appealed, contending it had paid enough: $2.2 billion for  
the cleanup, $1 billion to settle state and federal lawsuits and 
$300 million for lost wages to 11,000 fishermen and business 
operators. 
</P>
<P>
	``The grounding of the Exxon Valdez and the resulting oil spill  
was a terrible accident which Exxon deeply regrets,'' John Daum, a 
lawyer for Exxon, told the judges in a standing-room-only 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	But Daum added, ``Piling on an additional $5 billion in damages  
will not achieve anything not already achieved long before this 
trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to contesting the size of the punitive damages,  
Exxon is appealing the way the $287 million compensatory damage 
award was calculated. 
</P>
<P>
	But lawyers for the plaintiffs argue the award is appropriate  
considering the type and amount of damage caused by the oil. They 
also argue it takes an amount as large as $5 billion to punish a 
company as wealthy as Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
	``The punishment fits the crime,'' said Brian O'Neill, a lawyer  
for the plaintiffs. ``It's one year's income for them, and most 
fisheries lost one year's income'' due to the spill. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Charles E. Wiggins questioned whether the plaintiffs had  
even proven Exxon's liability for the spill. O'Neill said the 
company admitted liability in a stipulation to the jury, which made 
it unnecessary to prove it in court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Putting a drinking alcoholic in charge of a supertanker is  
inherently negligent conduct,'' O'Neill said, referring to skipper 
Joseph Hazelwood, who admitting drinking alcohol and leaving the 
bridge the night of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
	On that night, Hazelwood ordered the 984-foot-long tanker to  
shift position to avoid icebergs in Valdez Arm. Hazelwood then went 
below to his cabin, leaving 3rd Mate Gregory Cousins in control of 
the vessel. Cousins ran the vessel onto Bligh Reef just after 
midnight on March 24, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The resulting 11 million gallon spill, which remains the  
nation's worst, polluted more than 1,000 miles of Alaska shoreline, 
killed tens of thousands of birds and marine mammals and disrupted 
fishing. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, four people testified the accident wouldn't  
have happened if Hazelwood had been on the bridge instead of 
relinquishing it to Cousins, O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A sober Cousins wasn't as good as a drunk Capt. Hazelwood,''  
O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the oil giant also asked the appeals court to order a  
new trial, alleging one juror was intimidated and threatened by 
other jurors and the court bailiff during the 1994 trial in 
Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge H. Russel Holland previously rejected that  
allegation, writing in his ruling that the juror's memory was not 
credible. The plaintiffs want the appeals court to affirm Holland's 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs argued that bailiff Don Warrick was joking when  
he brandished his gun to juror Doug Graham, took out a bullet and 
suggested Graham put another juror ``out of her misery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham said he didn't take the comment seriously, O'Neill said.  
</P>
<P>
	Warrick initially lied about the incident, but later admitted it  
to U.S. marshals and was fired from his job. 
</P>
<P>
	A third appeal filed by Exxon involved the issue of whether a  
group of Seattle seafood processors known as the ``Seattle Seven'' 
is entitled to a share of the $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the start of the 1994 trial, the processors reached a  
$70 million settlement with Exxon. The confidential settlement 
agreement required the seafood processors to pursue their share of 
any punitive damages at trial and then turn the proceeds over to 
Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Seven's share comes to more than $700 million. The  
plaintiffs contend Exxon would hardly be punished if it could pay a 
share of the damages to itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Holland agreed in 1996 and rejected Exxon's claim to the money,  
calling the maneuver an ``astonishing ruse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A ruling by the appeals panel was expected to take at least six  
months.

<HEADLINE> Case From Starr Probe Tried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- A judge said today that Kathleen Willey's  
allegation of an unwanted sexual advance by President Clinton won't 
be allowed to dominate the trial of a former friend charged with 
lying about Mrs. Willey to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury and two alternates -- eight women and six men -- were  
seated in less than an hour this morning in the trial of Julie 
Hiatt Steele, whose sworn testimony in Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr's probe contradicted part of the story told by her one-time 
friend, Mrs. Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has denied making a sexual advance to Mrs. Willey.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to try Mrs. Willey,'' U.S. District Judge  
Claude Hilton warned a defense attorney while the jurors were out 
of the courtroom. ``We are not going to get into the truthfulness 
of Mrs. Willey's story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton was responding to a complaint from Ms. Steele's lawyer,  
Nancy Luque, that she had been unable to reach witnesses who she 
believes have information undermining Mrs. Willey's credibility. 
Luque said one of those witnesses was expected to say Mrs. Willey 
herself had given false information to Starr's investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	The case against Ms. Steele, a relatively minor player in  
Starr's probe, is the only criminal trial resulting from the 
investigation that centered on the president's relationship with 
Monica Lewinsky and led to a Senate impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In addressing potential jurors, the judge noted that Ms.  
Steele's case was ``part of the investigation of ... the president 
of the United States'' and would include some mention of 
independent counsel Starr and Mrs. Willey, who told her story on 
``60 Minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr recently suffered a stinging courtroom setback in his case  
against Susan McDougal, a figure in the Whitewater phase of his 
investigation, who planned to be on hand for the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton has made clear he will not allow Ms. Steele's lawyers to  
put Starr's tactics on trial, as happened when Ms. Steele testified 
in support of Mrs. McDougal, a former Whitewater investment partner 
of Clinton and his wife, Hillary. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's lawyer, Luque, argued before Hilton that Starr's  
prosecutors made a series of misrepresentations, designating Ms. 
Steele as a mere witness in the investigation when they actually 
regarded her as a major focus of the probe. Ms. Steele was tricked 
into making statements for which she was later indicted, her legal 
team contends. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nancy Luque told me that if she sees an opening to put Starr  
on trial, she'll call Starr as her first witness and Susan McDougal 
right behind him,'' said Geragos. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense has subpoenaed testimony and notes from Newsweek  
magazine reporter Michael Isikoff, who first wrote about Mrs. 
Willey's allegation. The defense team also issued a subpoena to CBS 
for outtakes from a ``60 Minutes'' interview with Mrs. Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton has yet to decide whether to allow that evidence into the  
case. CBS and Newsweek are seeking to quash the subpoenas. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey says she confided Clinton's alleged sexual advance  
to Ms. Steele, a fellow resident of the Richmond area, the day it 
occurred in 1993. Ms. Steele initially supported Mrs. Willey's 
version of events to Newsweek, then recanted, telling her revised 
account to the FBI and two grand juries. 
</P>
<P>
	She now says the first time she heard the allegation was when  
Mrs. Willey called her in 1997 and asked her to back up her story 
to Isikoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office has not said whether Mrs. Willey will testify,  
but Ms. Steele's lawyers are assuming that she will and are 
marshaling evidence about Mrs. Willey's background that they hope 
to use to destroy her credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office denies that and says the information from such  
witnesses has nothing to do with Mrs. Willey's accusation against 
Clinton. It says it has witnesses besides Mrs. Willey who will 
testify that Ms. Steele knew of the alleged sexual advance well 
before 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors acquitted Mrs. McDougal of a charge she obstructed  
Starr's investigation and deadlocked on two counts of criminal 
contempt for refusing to testify before a grand jury.

<HEADLINE>  'Nightingales' Nominated for Tony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Arthur Miller, the nation's most distinguished  
living playwright, and two other titans of the American theater -- 
the late Tennessee Williams and Eugene O'Neill -- dominated 
Broadway's Tony nominations Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Their plays collected a total of 17 nominations. Williams' ``Not  
About Nightingales,'' a prison drama written more than 60 years 
ago, was nominated as best play. O'Neill died in 1953 and Williams 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the first time these three men have had plays on  
Broadway at the same time,'' said Jed Bernstein, president of the 
League of American Theaters and Producers, which co-produces the 
Tony Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	The ambitious ``Parade,'' a musical that sharply divided critics  
and audiences and closed in February after a short run, received 
nine nominations, more than any other show. The musical was based 
on the true story of a 1913 murder in Georgia and the subsequent 
lynching of a Jewish man. 
</P>
<P>
	Potent productions of Miller's ``Death of a Salesman'' and  
O'Neill's ``The Iceman Cometh'' will square off for best 
revival-play, the Tony's most hotly contested category. Also up for 
the award: critically acclaimed reworkings of Sophocles ``Electra'' 
and Shakespeare's ``Twelfth Night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Salesman'' and ``Not About Nightingales'' received six  
nominations each and ``Iceman'' took five nominations. Written in 
1938, ``Nightingales'' was not produced until it was done last year 
in England, then at Houston's Alley Theater before coming to 
Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Salesman,'' ``Iceman'' and ``Nightingales'' will also face off  
in the toughest acting race, pitting Brian Dennehy, who plays Willy 
Loman in the Miller play, against Kevin Spacey of ``Iceman'' and 
Corin Redgrave, a corrupt prison warden in the Williams melodrama. 
The fourth nominee is Brian O'Byrne, playing a combative brother in 
Martin McDonagh's ``The Lonesome West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDonagh's black comedy also was nominated for best play along  
with Warren Leight's jazz-memory play ``Side Man.'' ``Closer,'' 
Patrick Marber's acerbic look at sex and love in the '90s, 
completes the category, although nominators snubbed all four of its 
actors, including Natasha Richardson, a winner last year for 
``Cabaret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Hare was the year's biggest loser. He had three new plays  
on Broadway this season, yet none was nominated. Nor was Nicole 
Kidman, star of Hare's most publicized effort, ``The Blue Room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Hare's ``Amy's View'' is a solid box-office success, thanks  
to its star and Tony nominee for best actress, Judi Dench. She 
already has won an Oscar this year for ``Shakespeare in Love.'' 
Dench's competition on Broadway: Stockard Channing for ``The Lion 
in Winter''; Marian Seldes in ``Ring Round the Moon'' and Zoe 
Wanamaker who starred in ``Electra.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nominations buoyed bankrupt Livent Inc., which produced not  
only ``Parade'' but another best-musical nominee, ``Fosse,'' a 
celebration of the choreography of Bob Fosse. Both shows were 
initiated by the company's former head, Garth Drabinsky, who was 
dismissed because of financial irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nominations are particularly rewarding because it has been  
such a difficult year for the company legally and financially,'' 
said Todd Haimes, Livent's artistic director. 
</P>
<P>
	Also nominated for best musical were ``The Civil War,'' Frank  
Wildhorn's pop pageant, and ``It Ain't Nothin' But the Blues,'' a 
history of the blues and the influence it has on other forms of 
music. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernadette Peters was the favorite in the musical-actress  
category for her perky portrayal of Annie Oakley in ``Annie Get 
Your Gun.'' Also nominated was Peters' co-star, Tom Wopat. The 
Irving Berlin musical received a musical-revival nomination along 
with ``Peter Pan,'' ``You're a Good Man Charlie Brown'' and 
``Little Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wopat's challengers: Martin Short of ``Little Me''; Brent Carver  
of ``Parade,'' and Adam Cooper, who danced the lead swan in ``Swan 
Lake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The winners will be announced June 6 in a televised ceremony.  
They will be chosen by more than 800 theater professionals and 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Miller, at 83, is assured of one Tony Award. Miller,  
actress Uta Hagen and Isabelle Stevenson, chairman of the American 
Theater Wing, will be given special Tonys for lifetime achievement.

``Cabaret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Hare was the year's biggest loser. He had three new plays  
on Broadway this season, yet none was nominated. Nor was Nicole 
Kidman, star of Hare's most publicized effort, ``The Blue Room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Hare's ``Amy's View'' is a solid box-office success, thanks  
to its star and Tony nominee for best actress, Judi Dench. She 
already has won an Oscar this year for ``Shakespeare in Love.'' 
Dench's competition on Broadway: Stockard Channing for ``The Lion 
in Winter''; Marian Seldes in ``Ring Round the Moon'' and Zoe 
Wanamaker who starred in ``Electra.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nominations buoyed bankrupt Livent Inc., which produced not  
only ``Parade'' but another best-musical nominee, ``Fosse,'' a 
celebration of the choreography of Bob Fosse. Both shows were 
initiated by the company's former head, Garth Drabinsky, who was 
dismissed because of financial irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nominations are particularly rewarding because it has been  
such a difficult year for the company legally and financially,'' 
said Todd Haimes, Livent's artistic director. 
</P>
<P>
	Also nominated for best musical were ``The Civil War,'' Frank  
Wildhorn's pop pageant, and ``It Ain't Nothin' But the Blues,'' a 
history of the blues and the influence it has on other forms of 
music. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernadette Peters was the favorite in the musical-actress  
category for her perky portrayal of Annie Oakley in ``Annie Get 
Your Gun.'' Also nominated was Peters' co-star, Tom Wopat. The 
Irving Berlin musical received a musical-revival nomination along 
with ``Peter Pan,'' ``You're a Good Man Charlie Brown'' and 
``Little Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wopat's challengers: Martin Short of ``Little Me''; Brent Carver  
of ``Parade,'' and Adam Cooper, who danced the lead swan in ``Swan 
Lake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The winners will be announced June 6 in a televised ceremony.  
They will be chosen by more than 800 theater professionals and 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Miller, at 83, is assured of one Tony Award. Miller,  
actress Uta Hagen and Isabelle Stevenson, chairman of the American 
Theater Wing, will be given special Tonys for lifetime achievement.

<HEADLINE> Moehler Suspended in Sandpaper Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Detroit Tigers pitcher Brian Moehler  
was suspended today for 10 days for doctoring baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
	Moehler was accused of doctoring the balls in Detroit's game  
Saturday night against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He was ejected by 
home plate umpire Larry Barnett and suspended by AL president Gene 
Budig. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was watching him,'' Barnett said, describing the Detroit  
pitcher's mannerisms just before discovering a small piece of 
sandpaper attached to the right-hander's left thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I didn't see anything in his glove, (Moehler's gesture)  
made me suspicious,'' the umpire added, demonstrating how the 
Tigers pitcher held up four fingers but did not extend his thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he did that, I said to myself: `He's got something on  
there.' As soon as I got (the thumb) and turned it over, it was 
right there. It was smaller than a dime. I just said: `Son, you're 
gone.' He didn't say nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Section 3.02 of the Official Baseball Rules calls for a 10-day  
suspension, and Moehler decided not to appeal, the players' 
association said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Kevin Gross was suspended  
for 10 days by NL president A. Bartlett Giamatti after Gross was 
caught with sandpaper in his glove. That same year, AL president 
Bobby Brown suspended Minnesota pitcher Joe Niekro for 10 days for 
carrying an emery board and sandpaper in his back pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one of those things as a manager that you don't have a  
whole lot of control over, like a team not hitting,'' Detroit's 
Larry Parrish said of possible league action. 
</P>
<P>
	Moehler, a 14-game winner in 1998 who's 3-3 with a 4.23 ERA this  
season, denied scuffing the ball or having sandpaper on his thumb 
when the Devil Rays asked Barnett to check the pitcher's glove and 
hands with one out in the seventh inning of a tie game. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he didn't protest the ejection because it's not his  
nature to argue and that Barnett was just doing his job. Parrish 
maintained he didn't argue, either, because it was time for a 
pitching change. 
</P>
<P>
	Moehler had allowed consecutive singles before Devil Rays Larry  
Rothschild asked the umpire to check the pitcher. Reliever Sean 
Runyan walked the next batter to load the bases, then gave up a 
sacrifice fly that gave Tampa Bay a 4-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nothing there. It was dirt,'' Moehler said. ``I  
don't know if other guys do it or not, but I was rubbing the ball 
like I always do. These three fingers get the dirtiest, but the ump 
said he saw something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays became suspicious after Moehler, who allowed  
three runs in the first two innings, suddenly began getting sharper 
than usual movement on some of his pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	Rothschild waited until his players collected five or six balls  
they felt had been scuffed by Moehler, then approached Barnett to 
tell the umpire what they suspected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't check for gamesmanship. I checked because there was  
something going on. I don't play that game,'' Rothschild said. ``I 
did it because I knew that something was going on. I wouldn't do it 
to distract somebody or anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Parrish didn't protest the ejection, he did take issue  
with the Devil Rays going to the umpire. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a pitching staff in baseball that doesn't have a  
guy who defaces the ball ... If the umpires want to check things 
like that, I think half to three-quarters of the league would be 
suspended, including some Tampa Bay Devil Rays,'' Parrish said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying that Mo does or does not. I'm just saying that  
in the major leagues, as long as I can remember, that's sort of 
been a part of baseball.''

<HEADLINE>  Vladimir Guerrero Leads in Errors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Vladimir Guerrero was known for a hot bat when  
he joined the Montreal Expos two years ago. These days, his glove 
draws attention. 
</P>
<P>
	After just one month, he leads the major leagues in errors, with  
nine -- an astonishing number for an outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried or too concerned,'' he said. ``But I want to  
be sure this doesn't become a problem or a habit because some of 
the errors that I've made have been routine plays where I tried to 
be too aggressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who knows, maybe it's in the genes? His brother, Wilton, the  
Expos' second baseman, is tied for second in the majors in errors 
with seven. 
</P>
<P>
	No outfielder has reached 20 in one season since Bob Johnson of  
the 1935 Philadelphia Athletics. The post-World War II high in 19, 
by Lou Brock (1966) and Chili Davis (1988). 
</P>
<P>
	Outfielders have reached double figures just 12 times in the  
'90s. Before Guerrero made 17 last year, the highest total had been 
13 by Sammy Sosa ('90 and '95). 
</P>
<P>
	Even before an error against St. Louis on Friday night, Guerrero  
became the first outfielder with eight in one month since George 
Bell in July 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm only concerned about what's happened, I'm not concerned  
about what could happen,'' Expos manager Felipe Alou said. ``I know 
he's not that bad. Whether he's careless or lacks concentration for 
any reason right now, that's something else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	E-9 has popped up next to Guerrero's name two more times than W  
has popped up next to Montreal in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after his latest error, Guerrero worked out with Montreal  
coaches Pete Mackanin and Gene Glynn before batting practice, 
forming a pile of balls along the outfield wall after fielding and 
catching one ball after another from a ball-throwing machine. 
</P>
<P>
	``He asked to go out there,'' Alou said. ``He works out as hard  
as anybody we've had here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While two of his errors this season were on throws, 30 of  
Guerrero's 38 errors since the start of the 1997 season have been 
fielding mistakes, a staggering amount for an outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
	His ninth error this season came on a drive by St. Louis'  
Placido Polanco. Guerrero misjudged the ball off the bat, turning 
to his right as the ball sliced away from him toward the 
right-field corner. He was forced to turn around completely and 
change directions, and the ball popped out of his glove. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think he's a little confused,'' Mackanin said. ``Right  
now, after having watched him play last year and this year, you 
would have to call him a below-average outfielder based on the 
amount of errors he's made. However, the potential is there to be a 
Gold Glove winner and that's what we're trying to get out of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Dominican hit a team-record 38 homers, drove in  
109 runs and batted .324 in 1998, his second major league season. 
He is hitting .269 this season with four homers and 19 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure before it's said and done he's going to be one of the  
best out there,'' said the Cardinals' Willie McGee, a three-time 
Gold Glove. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's young, he's going to make errors. He's got a tremendous  
amount of ability that he's trying to hone offensively, defensively 
and everywhere. Very seldom do you see a young man with that much 
ability come up and have everything tight, as fast as he rose. 
He'll put in his time out there and get himself tight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Basically, McGee views all Guerrero's errors as growing pains.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure they're not panicking over there,'' McGee said. ``I  
wouldn't if I had a player that talented. When the time comes, you 
work on it. That's it. That guy, to me, he's going to be one of the 
best players in this game. He's already there and it's scary.''

<HEADLINE> WTO Paralyzed by Leadership Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The World Trade Organization struggled today to  
select a new director-general, trying to prevent one of the world's 
most influential economic bodies from grinding to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with a leadership vacuum that would prevent the  
Geneva-based organization from arbitrating trade disputes, WTO 
ambassadors were summoned to a crisis session of the 
decision-making general council today. 
</P>
<P>
	But the meeting was postponed without explanation until further  
notice. 
</P>
<P>
	Weekend meetings of the 134-nation WTO council degenerated into  
bad-tempered clashes between supporters of former New Zealand 
Premier Mike Moore and his rival, Thai Deputy Prime Minister 
Supachai Panitchpakdi. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali Mchumo, chairman of the WTO council, had called the meeting  
for today in an attempt to find a solution. Mchumo on Friday 
proposed Moore as the new head, as he had support from 62 countries 
compared to Supachai's 59. 
</P>
<P>
	But prospects looked bleak for consensus around Moore, a  
50-year-old former trade unionist who held a series of ministerial 
jobs and was briefly prime minister in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan and other Asian countries seemed set to stand firm behind  
Supachai, who led the race for much of the campaign and was viewed 
as the candidate of developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese ambassador Nobotushi Akao said no consensus could be  
formed around Moore. ``It's time for you to put Mr. Supachai to the 
test to see whether there is consensus or not around him,'' Akao 
said in a message to the WTO council chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should be clear that if Mr. Moore was vetoed, there would  
be no way in which Dr. Supachai could become the new 
director-general,'' countered Uruguay's ambassador, Carlos Perez 
del Castillo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The obvious way out would be for Dr. Supachai to bow out with  
dignity,'' he told a press conference Sunday, supported by 
delegates from the United States, Venezuela, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, 
France, Turkey, Sweden and Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez del Castillo sought to downplay growing fears that the  
hunt for a new leader might have to begin again from scratch 
despite the impressive track record of both existing candidates. 
This would likely take months. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Renato Ruggiero stepped down as scheduled Friday after a  
four-year term in office, as did the WTO's deputy directors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The work of the organization is absolutely paralyzed at the  
moment,'' said Perez del Castillo. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the practical running of the WTO, the  
organization needs a leader with global clout as it prepares for a 
November conference meant to set the trade agenda for the 21st 
century and usher in agreements to liberalize global commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are nearing a crisis,'' said U.S. ambassador Rita Hayes.  
``It is important we put this behind us and appoint a new 
director-general as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asian countries and their allies are particularly angry that the  
Thai candidate held a clear lead for months while the United States 
and Europe sat on the fence. Only when Washington opted in favor of 
Moore did the New Zealander gain ground.

<HEADLINE> Trey Ferguson Picks Tennessee Tech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOOVER, Ala. (AP) -- Trey Ferguson, a top basketball recruit who  
reneged on a verbal commitment to Indiana after Hoosier star Luke 
Recker left the school, has committed to Tennessee Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson, a 6-foot-5 guard from Hoover High School, backed out  
of his Indiana commitment two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Neil, said the decision was made partly because  
Recker was transferring and partly because coach Bobby Knight was 
wavering on whether the school's scholarship offer to Ferguson 
would be honored. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to say Luke transferring was the only reason,  
but I know it put some doubt in Trey's mind,'' Neil Ferguson said 
at the time. ``Trey believed if anyone would be happy at Indiana, 
it would be Luke. He said it just made him wonder. He said with 
Luke leaving, something just didn't feel right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson had originally planned to attend prep school in New  
Hampshire this fall and join the Hoosiers for the 2000-01 season. 
But Neil Ferguson said the prep school route was Knight's idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson will go directly to college at Tennessee Tech  
University, which he chose over Rutgers and Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson finished his high school career as the Buccaneers'  
all-time leading scorer with 1,802 points and was also named to the 
Class 6A All-State team.

<HEADLINE> Federal Trial Opens Against Amway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A federal trial got under way Monday in a lawsuit  
accusing Amway distributors of reviving false rumors linking rival 
Procter &AMP; Gamble with satanic cults. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit is one of many that consumer products giant Procter  
&AMP; Gamble brought after rumors began circulating in 1981 that the 
company's logo -- a bearded man on the moon and stars -- was a symbol 
of Satanism. 
</P>
<P>
	The company alleges Amway distributors, including several from  
the Houston area, revived the rumors in 1995, using a voice mail 
system to tell thousands of customers that part of Procter &AMP; 
Gamble's profits were directed to satanic cults.

	``It's a malicious lie that erodes the trust of customers and  
has cost us millions of dollars in sales,'' said Elaine Plummer, a 
spokeswoman for Procter &AMP; Gamble, which makes such products as 
Ivory soap, Tide detergent and Crest toothpaste. 
</P>
<P>
	Amway Corp., based in Ada, Mich., denies the allegations.  
</P>
<P>
	``This rumor was started in churches ... and Amway didn't have a  
thing to do with it,'' defense attorney Charles Babcock said. ``A 
few Amway independent distributors talked about the rumor -- not in 
a mean-spirited way but in an informational way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In March, a Utah federal judge dismissed a similar lawsuit  
against Amway, ruling the rumors were not defamatory and that 
Procter &AMP; Gamble hadn't made a case for specific damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston trial is expected to last two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Climbers Say Body Found on Everest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- It has been 75 years since George Mallory and  
Andrew Irvine, bundled in woolen coats and trousers, vanished near 
the top of the world's highest mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, members of an expedition seeking to learn whether  
the two Englishmen were the first to summit Mount Everest, made an 
astonishing find at 27,000 feet -- the body of Mallory, according to 
the name tag sewn into his coat. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we realized that it was George Mallory, we were really  
blown away by that,'' climber Dave Hahn said in a dispatch relayed 
on the Internet by one of the expedition's sponsors, Seattle-based 
MountainZone.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want to disturb him, he'd been lying there for 75  
years,'' said Hahn, the first to find the body. ``But at the same 
time we thought, `What better tribute to the man than to try and 
find out if he had summitted Mt. Everest in 1924?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Eight climbers, including expedition leader Eric Simonson, plan  
to continue looking for the body of Irvine and a camera that could 
contain images proving they reached the summit 29 years before Sir 
Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the wishes of Mallory's family, Hahn and his  
companions performed an informal memorial service, according to 
MoutainZone Editor Peter Potterfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our expedition was formed to pay homage to these great British  
climbers,'' Simonson said on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The search is funded by PBS for the Boston-based television show  
NOVA, which is documenting the expedition. NOVA is also posting 
online updates throughout the expedition. 
</P>
<P>
	Mallory's body was found 2,000 feet from the windblown  
29,028-foot summit -- not far from the body of a Chinese climber, 
Wang Hongbao, whose accounts were used by the NOVA crew to try to 
locate Mallory and Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
	Expedition planner Jochen Hemmleb, a 28-year-old German climber  
and Mallory historian working from the team's base camp, chose the 
search location based largely on Hongbao's report of a body on the 
North Ridge route Mallory and Irvine would have taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Hongbao described the body as ``English Dead,'' and indicated  
its vintage clothing broke to pieces when he touched it. But two 
days after he told his story in 1975, he died in an avalanche on 
Everest's North Face. 
</P>
<P>
	Mallory's body was found on a snow terrace, just below the spot  
where an ice ax believed to be Irvine's was found in 1933. The ax 
had three notches on the handle, which was how Irvine marked his 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The current climb, which began on March 29, is being made in six  
stages. The mountaineers establish camps at ever higher altitudes, 
and then descend to base camp as they become acclimated to the thin 
air. 
</P>
<P>
	High winds combined with low precipitation have scoured the  
mountain clean, helping the expedition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to convey how much, for us, this discovery is a huge  
achievement and so far beyond our wildest dreams,'' Simonson said. 
``It is hard to convey our excitement over this discovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from his climbing, Mallory's place in history is secure,  
if only for his memorable answer to the question of why he wanted 
to climb the world's highest peak: ``Because it is there.''

<HEADLINE> Kidd, Carter, Popovich Win Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jason Kidd of the Phoenix Suns, Vice Carter of  
the Toronto Raptors and coach Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio 
Spurs are April's award winners in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Kidd was picked as player of the month after accounting for more  
than 40 percent of the Suns' offense during the month as Phoenix 
qualified for the playoffs for the 11th consecutive season. He 
averaged 20.1 points, 10.4 assists, 6.7 rebounds and 2.38 steals 
during the month and had two triple-doubles, increasing his league 
lead to seven. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, who led all first-year players in scoring and shot  
blocking during April, was chosen as rookie of the month. He 
averaged 20.6 points, 5.9 rebounds, 4.2 assists and 1.61 blocked 
shots. He was the fifth player chosen in last June's college draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich's Spurs had the best record in the NBA for April at  
13-3 -- including 9-0 at home -- making him coach of the month. San 
Antonio began the lockout-abbreviated NBA season at 6-8 but has 
improved to 35-13, challenging the Utah Jazz for first place in the 
Midwest Division.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Spot Possible Moon Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It might not sound like the most promising  
real estate: Temperature -64 degrees, rocky, no atmosphere. But 
researchers say nearly constant sunlight makes the Moon's south 
pole an ideal spot for a future base. 
</P>
<P>
	Three sites near the Moon's south pole provide nearly constant  
light, researchers report in the May 1 edition of Geophysical 
Research Letters. 
</P>
<P>
	That means the bases could use solar energy, reducing or  
eliminating the need for other energy sources, according to the 
team lead by D. Ben J. Bussey of the European Space Agency in 
Noordwijk, Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	And, besides the energy potential of the sunny sites, there are  
nearby locations in constant darkness, the researchers added. There 
is the possibility that water ice could be hidden in such 
locations, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the location of any Moon base would depend to a great  
extent on the purpose of the base, the researchers focused on three 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Site A is on the rim of Shackleton crater and B is about six  
miles away on a ridge originating from that rim. Site C is on the 
rim of another nearby crater. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Moon's 708-hour day, A is in sunlight 80 percent of  
the time, B is lighted 70 percent and C about 65 percent of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is only a period of 10 hours when neither A nor B are in  
sunlight,'' the researchers added. ``Therefore if solar arrays were 
placed in both areas and connected by a link (either microwave or 
cable) then a base at either site would receive near constant solar 
energy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The temperature at the suggested sites is relatively constant  
because of the steady light and was estimated at about -64 degrees 
Fahrenheit. Engineers say it is easier to deal with a constant 
extreme temperature than one that is changing, as would happen 
elsewhere on the moon with the regular shifts from daylight to 
darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Bussey the research team included Paul D. Spudis  
of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Texas and Mark S. 
Robinson of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.

<HEADLINE> Protests at Cuba, Orioles Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A boisterous crowd of Cuban-Americans protested  
Monday's game between the Cuban national team and the Baltimore 
Orioles, both in the streets and on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	One anti-Castro demonstrator carrying a sign that said,  
``Freedom -- Strike Out Against Castro,'' ran onto the field in the 
middle of the game and was wrestled to the ground by a Cuban 
umpire. 
</P>
<P>
	As another protester who ran onto the field was led, shouting,  
past the Cuban dugout and the Cuban delegation, the Cubans booed 
and gave him the thumbs-down sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Rolando Suarez Cobian, director of Caritas Cubana, a Roman  
Catholic relief agency, said the Cuban delegation was not insulted 
by the protest. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are merely slowing the game down,'' he said. ``This is a  
joke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban-Americans considered the game, which the Cuban team won  
12-6, a diversion from Fidel Castro's brutal dictatorship in the 
communist nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters, some of whom had spent 18 hours on buses from Miami,  
met first at a statue of 19th century Cuban independence hero Jose 
Marti before gathering across the street from the main entrance to 
Oriole Park at Camden Yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The noisy crowd of chanting demonstrators was separated from the  
stadium by two rows of officers and mounted police. Police 
estimates put the number of protesters at 300, far less than the 
1,500 anticipated. No protesters were arrested outside the stadium, 
according to a police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the stadium, three men from Miami, who ran onto the  
field, were given criminal citations for misdemeanor trespassing. 
If convicted, they face a maximum sentence of three months in jail 
and a $500 fine. A 13-year-old boy, the son of one of the men, also 
ran onto the field and was detained, but not charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Police identified the men as: Diego Tintorero, 42; Pablo Capote,  
67; and Carlos Dolz, 50. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria E. Cosculluela, a member of Miami-based Mothers against  
Repression for Cuba, said she wouldn't support either team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are rooting for the Cuban people, the dissidents, the  
people in jail,'' she said. ``We are for the Cuban people and this 
game should never have happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters wore T-shirts with messages like ``Fidel murderer''  
and ``Justice and human rights now! Baseball later,'' and held 
signs that read ``La Represion en Cuba no es cosa de juego'' (The 
repression in Cuba is not a game). They held a moment of silence 
for those martyred in the fight against the Cuban leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Buses ferried protesters from New York, New Jersey, Washington,  
D.C., and Florida. Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., helped organize some 
of the bus trips and attended the rally along with Rep. Lincoln 
Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Fernandez, a banker from Newark, N.J., said the decision to  
allow Cuba to play a major league club in the United States for the 
first time was hypocritical. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to tell the government in Kosovo that we want  
human rights but 90 miles from (Miami) we allow repression to 
continue,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez, 37, and his family were allowed to leave Cuba and  
join relatives in the United States in 1976 only after his father 
agreed to cut sugar cane for five years in a government labor camp 
in exchange for freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	About one block away from the anti-Castro protesters, a smaller  
group called for an end to the longstanding trade embargo against 
the Communist country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern is the effect of the blockade on the Cuban  
people,'' said Jeff Bigelow of Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``What has Cuba done to the U.S. to deserve this punishment for  
40 years?'' said a Miami man, who declined to give his name fearing 
retribution from anti-Castro forces. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the Orioles became the first major league team to play  
in Cuba in 40 years. They beat Cuba 3-2 in 11 innings, but have 
been struggling in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles owner Peter Angelos has said his goal is to improve  
relations through people-to-people contact between the two 
countries, which have been divided by a longstanding U.S. trade 
embargo against the communist nation. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said,  
``Regardless of the outcome, the Cuban people will win when they 
have a window to the outside world, even if it is only through the 
televised version of this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sylvia Iriondo, head of Mothers against Repression for Cuba,  
said the game only fostered ``people-to-tyrant contact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This baseball game hides the desire of many commercial  
enterprises that want to do business with Cuba's bloody dictator,'' 
she said.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Team Prepares for Orioles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- With the wrangling over visas and flight delays  
behind them, Cuba's national baseball team is ready to play ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban team arrived in Baltimore Sunday night after visa  
delays caused them to missed a scheduled workout and reception at 
Camden Yards. At one point during the weekend, the Cuban government 
threatened to cancel the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	But Orioles owner Peter Angelos, Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke  
and baseball commissioner Bud Selig greeted the team at 
Baltimore-Washington International Airport where they will play the 
Orioles tonight in an historic double-play combining sports and 
diplomacy on the diamond. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked on his way to the meeting who would win the game, Angelos  
said, ``Well, we'll see tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations about every aspect of the game were tense. Felix  
Wilson, deputy chief of the Cuban Interest Section, which serves as 
an unofficial embassy in Washington, was upset that Angelos met 
with the players while local Cuban officials were kept away from 
the group until after the team cleared customs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you imagine we cannot meet the Cuban delegation?'' he  
said. ``This is unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the excitement about fielding the first game between  
Cubans and a major league team in the United States, the event also 
raised the prospect of defections. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Joe Cubas, who signed pitcher Orlando ``El Duque''  
Hernandez to a contract with the New York Yankees after he 
defected, is in Baltimore for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Gus Dominguez, who represents players Rene Arocha and  
Ariel Prieto, said he will also be at tonight's game, but refused 
to say whether he has been in contact with any of the Cuban 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very personal decision and obviously they have to make  
those decisions themselves. We can't ask them, we can't pressure, 
but they know we are here to help,'' Dominguez said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban team is expected to be stronger than the squad that  
lost to the Orioles 3-2 in 11 innings in Havana on March 28. That 
team was missing some of Cuba's best players, who were 
participating in the island's national championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those making the trip who did not play in the first game  
are sluggers Orestes Kindelan, Antonio Pacheco and Gabriel Pierre. 
</P>
<P>
	The lineup announced this weekend by the Cuban government,  
however, does not include two stars many had expected to play: 
outfielder Victor Mesa and flashy shortstop German Mesa, the hero 
in Cuba's win over the United States during the 1991 Pan American 
Games held in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	The pitchers include three of Cuba's best -- Jose Ariel  
Contreras, Jose Ibar and Pedro Luis Lazo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles have struggled mightily since beating Cuba in March.  
The team is in last place, the players are being booed at Camden 
Yards and manager Ray Miller might not have his job by the end of 
the 12-game homestand Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	So the Orioles can be forgiven if they don't regard the game  
with great anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, you'd like the club to have a day off,'' Miller  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's much the same attitude the Orioles carried into the first  
exhibition. But shortly after the playing of both country's 
national anthems, their attitude changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot more comes into it than just you or your team. Even  
though we weren't really representing the U.S., we were in a way,'' 
outfielder B.J. Surhoff said Sunday. ``We were one team but we were 
representing a whole lot of people. They looked at it as their 
national team representing them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Down there I knew it would be really intense and they'd be  
into it. I'm kind of curious to see how it's all going to play out 
tomorrow night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller hoped to rest his starters after six innings of that  
game, but the close score and high intensity caused him to stick 
with most of his stars for the entire contest. He will use his 
regular lineup Monday with the exception of his starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Kamieniecki, who is on the disabled list, will start for  
Baltimore. The Orioles can only hope the Cubans don't counter with 
Jose Contreras, who allowed two hits over eight shutout innings and 
struck out 10 in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
	While many of the Orioles consider the game a distraction, they  
realize the prestige associated with representing their country. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of pride taken over in Cuba. We did everything  
we could to win that game and I'm sure it will be no different over 
here,'' backup catcher Lenny Webster said. ``We hope to enjoy it, 
but at the same time we're going to try and beat them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost 300 Cubans were to travel to Baltimore for the game,  
including reporters, retired players, members of youth groups and 
outstanding students. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the better-known athletes in the delegation were former  
boxer Teofilo Stevenson, high jump world record-holder Javier 
Sotomayor and Connie Marrero, who once played with the Washington 
Senators and threw out the ceremonial first pitch in the first 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five school-age Cubans, accompanied by a group of  
parents, are scheduled to play a game Tuesday against a group of 
Baltimore-area Little Leaguers -- just as a group of American 
youngsters played Cuban children during their visit to Havana last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles will be wearing their traditional black, orange and  
white for the rematch, but they'll be thinking red, white and blue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The important thing of every game is to win, no matter what  
kind of uniform you wear or who you represent,'' Orioles pitcher 
Ricky Bones said Sunday. ``This time we're going to represent the 
United States. We should go out there with pride and try to win.''

<HEADLINE> Dodgers Accused of Cuba Recruiting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers denied accusations they  
held secret tryouts in Cuba, but two Cuban minor league players say 
the team scouted them in their homeland, arranged their escapes and 
then ordered them to lie about it. 
</P>
<P>
	First baseman Juan Carlos Diaz, 23, and outfielder Josue Perez,  
21, have asked major league baseball to declare them free agents on 
grounds they were signed illegally, and at less than market value, 
The Boston Globe reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The accusations, if true, violate the league's rules prohibiting  
scouting in Cuba. They also might violate the U.S. trade embargo 
with Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand that nobody should go to Cuba,'' Ralph Avila, the  
Dodgers' senior vice president, told the Globe. ``Look, I don't 
work for the immigration. I don't work for the State Department. I 
don't work for the police department. If someone went to Cuba, it's 
not my business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pablo Peguero, the scout accused of arranging the defections,  
said he hasn't been to Cuba in more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz said Peguero approached him in 1995 after a game in Havana  
and offered a tryout for the next morning. Afterward, Diaz said, 
Peguero told him the Dodgers wanted to bring him to the Dominican 
Republic. Two months later, Peguero returned with a woman he said 
was his cousin. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz received a visa after the woman told authorities his family  
helped her find a Cuban doctor for surgery she needed. She said she 
had invited Diaz to the Dominican Republic to show her gratitude 
and paid all his expenses, Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz went to the Dodgers' training academy at Campo Las Palmas  
outside Santo Domingo, where Avila signed him to a contract with a 
$65,000 bonus. Last year, Diaz hit a combined 30 homers at Single A 
and Double A. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if they paid off people or what, but I  
immediately got my provisional residency papers, which enabled me 
to sign,'' Diaz said, adding Peguero and Avila told him to lie if 
asked how he escaped to the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, who plays for the Dodgers' Single A team in Vero Beach,  
Fla., told a similar story in a separate interview. He said after a 
tryout with Peguero in 1996, he was escorted to the Dominican 
Republic by a young woman he never saw again. Perez was signed to a 
contract with a $40,000 bonus, and also was told to lie about his 
escape, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The players said they came forward after realizing their signing  
bonuses were too low. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioner's office has said teams that break rules  
against scouting in Cuba face fines, suspensions or loss of draft 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
	In the only documented case of scouting in Cuba, Miami-based  
agent Juan Ignacio Hernandez was arrested for trying to persuade 
players to defect. Hernandez was sentenced to 15 years in prison by 
Cuban authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Dodgers did recruit players from Cuba, they could be in  
violation of provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act and 
regulations administered by the Treasury Department, said John 
Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Individuals can be fined up to $55,000 for violations, and  
corporations up to $250,000.

<HEADLINE> Maine City Steamed at Starbucks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- Some people must really be steamed at the  
Starbucks coffee shop in Portland's harborfront neighborhood of old 
brick buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge custom windows at the Starbucks in the city's Old Port  
section have been smashed four times in five weeks in what may be a 
protest against the corporate giant and its coast-to-coast 
uniformity. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the windows are boarded up and surveillance cameras will be  
installed inside and out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like a war zone,'' says Police Chief Michael  
Chitwood. ``I can't remember any time in recent history where one 
location received so much aggravated criminal vandalism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Never before has the coffee giant been treated so badly, not  
even when a grand opening was greeted by protesters in Madison, 
Wis., and a petition drive was launched to shut down a shop in 
Larchmont, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Many see Starbucks as a big business turning small-town America  
into a generic landscape of chain stores. Critics also fear 
Starbucks will snuff out the independent coffee houses in Old Port, 
a neighborhood of boutiques, art galleries, restaurants and 
buildings that date to the late 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
	For that reason, Amy Therberge would never set foot in  
Starbucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to support local businesses,'' the coffee-loving  
Simmons College student says outside Java Joe's, a locally owned 
coffee house down the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Boskin, director of urban and public policy at Boston  
University, says the backlash may be greater in older, established 
cities on the East Coast, where there is resentment when 
mom-and-pop stores are replaced by corporate chains. 
</P>

	Starbucks began in 1971 in Seattle as a single store. By 1996,  
there were 1,115 stores. The company's goal is to own 2,000 stores 
in the United States by next year. It also has stores in Asia, 
Europe and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last year alone, three Starbucks have come to the  
Portland area -- two downtown and one at the Maine Mall. The Old 
Port store opened a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	For all the anti-corporate talk, the Old Port Starbucks is  
hugely profitable and not a bad neighbor. It offers decent wages 
with health and dental benefits, along with stock options. It also 
becomes involved in the community through charity events. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a great respect for the community that we go into,''  
says Alan Gulick, Starbucks spokesman in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The police chief believes Starbucks is being targeted, but he's  
not convinced there is a sinister attempt to drive the company 
away. More likely, the late-night attacks are spur-of-the-moment 
and driven by alcohol, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	One person was arrested in the first attack aand pleaded guilty  
to criminal mischief for throwing a bottle through the Starbucks 
window after he left a neighboring bar. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of lamenting the corporate intrusion, people writing  
letters to the editor are praising Starbucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me sick to see this stuff,'' says Leslie Gostley. ``I  
support Starbucks even more since this happened.''

<HEADLINE> Exams Delay Holdsclaw's DC Arrival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chamique Holdsclaw isn't quite ready to join  
the Washington Mystics. Final exams come first. 
</P>
<P>
	Mystics coach Nancy Darsch on Monday confirmed the widely  
expected move -- her team will use the top pick of Tuesday's WNBA 
draft to select the two-time player of the year from Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft is especially deep, featuring college players as well  
as ones from the defunct ABL. And, clearly, Holdsclaw is the best 
one out there. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw, who wears No. 23, has had to play down claims she is  
the ``female Michael Jordan.'' The 6-foot-2 forward is projected to 
be the league's dominant player for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think eventually she will be,'' Darsch said. ``If it happens  
this summer, then I will be thankful for it. She is an extremely 
talented young lady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The draft was postponed one week because a labor dispute between  
the players and league. Last week, the Mystics had planned to 
welcome Holdsclaw with a rally at Union Station the day after they 
selected her. 
</P>
<P>
	They were going to do the same thing this time until they  
learned Holdsclaw's final set of exams is Thursday, and she plans 
to spend all day Wednesday studying. 
</P>
<P>
	So the rally has been postponed until Friday, when she will have  
completed requirements for a political science degree to go with 
the three national championships she helped win for the Volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have an opportunity to graduate on time, and take your  
finals and get that behind you before you join your new team, that 
says a lot,'' Darsch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw is arriving at the right time -- for herself, the  
league and the Mystics. Women's sports are enjoying a surge in 
popularity, and her marketability could earn her millions in 
endorsements in her first year alone. 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA will benefit from a player familiar to fans, and the  
Mystics need all the talent they can get. 
</P>
<P>
	They went 3-27 last year -- thought to be the worst season record  
in pro basketball history -- yet were a big draw at the MCI Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft is so rich with talent that a player of first-round  
quality could be available in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good teams are going to get better; the bad teams are  
going to get better,'' Mystics general manager Wes Unseld said. 
``The thing that concerns me most is just being able to catch up. 
Even the expansion teams have an opportunity to improve very 
quickly.''

<HEADLINE>  Hockey Player Steve Chiasson Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Carolina Hurricanes defenseman Steve  
Chiasson was killed early today when his pickup overturned while he 
was returning home from the team's playoff loss in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson, a 32-year-old native of Barrie, Ontario, died about  
4:15 a.m. EDT on Falls of the Neuse Road in north Raleigh, Trooper 
K.L. Horn of the State Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
	Horn said Chiasson was thrown from the pickup truck after it ran  
off the road and flipped. 
</P>
<P>
	Highway Patrol Sgt. Jeff Winstead said evidence at the scene and  
interviews suggested Chiasson might have been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	A Hurricanes spokesman confirmed the death, and the team  
scheduled a morning news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes lost 2-0 in Boston, eliminating them from the  
Stanley Cup playoffs. On Friday night, Chiasson scored the first 
goal in a 4-3 double-overtime loss to the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent eight years with the Detroit Red Wings, was traded to  
the Calgary Flames in 1994 and in 1997 to what then was the 
Hartford Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was drafted by Detroit in 1985 and played his first NHL game  
the following year. In 1988-89, he led all Red Wings' defensemen 
with 47 points. In 1989-90, he scored a career-high 14 goals and 
again led all Detroit defensemen in scoring with 42 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson played in his first NHL All-Star game in 1993. At  
Calgary, he was rated second among Flames' defensemen in scoring in 
1995-96 with 33 points and notched his 300th NHL career point on 
Nov. 29, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson is survived by his wife Susan, two sons and a daughter.

<HEADLINE> 'Nightingales' Nominated for Tony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Not About Nightingales,'' a prison drama  
written more than 60 years ago by Tennessee Williams, was nominated 
for a Tony Award today as best play of the Broadway season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nightingales,'' not seen on stage until a production last year  
in England, will compete against another American play, ``Side 
Man,'' Warren Leight's portrait of a jazz musician and his family, 
for the top prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Also nominated for best play were two foreign entries,  
``Closer,'' English playwright Patrick Marber's acerbic look at 
love and sex at the end of the century, and Martin McDonagh's ``The 
Lonesome West,'' a black comedy about two battling brothers set in 
rural Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Williams play received six nominations, including one for  
its star, Corin Redgrave, who plays a prison warden in the show. 
Also receiving six nominations was the revival of Arthur Miller's 
``Death of a Salesman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The revival category for play is expected to provide the most  
spirited competition, with ``Salesman'' going up against three 
other critically acclaimed productions -- ``Electra,'' ``The Iceman 
Cometh'' and ``Twelfth Night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another tough category is best actor in a play with Redgrave  
facing Brian Dennehy, who plays Willy Loman in ``Death of a 
Salesman,'' Kevin Spacey in ``The Iceman Cometh'' and Brian F. 
O'Byrne, one of the brothers in ``The Lonesome West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Parade,'' a musical that sharply divided critics and audiences  
and closed in February after a short run, received nine 
nominations, more than any other show. The musical was based on the 
true story of a 1913 murder in Georgia and the subsequent lynching 
of a Jewish man. 
</P>
<P>
	Its competition for best musical will be ``Fosse,'' a  
celebration of the dances of the late, great choreographer Bob 
Fosse; ``It Ain't Nothin' But the Blues,'' a history of the blues, 
and ``The Civil War,'' Frank Wildhorn's pop version of the Battle 
of the Blue and Gray. 
</P>
<P>
	Judi Dench, already an Oscar winner this year for ``Shakespeare  
in Love,'' was nominated for best actress in a play for ``Amy's 
View,'' a London success. Her playwright, David Hare, wasn't as 
lucky. Hare was the biggest loser in the nomination sweepstakes 
with no nominations for the three plays he had on Broadway this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Also not nominated was Nicole Kidman, star of Hare's most  
publicized effort, ``The Blue Room.'' Instead, Dench's challengers 
will include Stockard Channing, ``The Lion in Winter''; Marian 
Seldes, ``Ring Round the Moon;'' and Zoe Wanamaker, ``Electra.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernadette Peters and Tom Wopat, her co-star in ``Annie Get Your  
Gun,'' were nominated for their performances in the revival of the 
Irving Berlin musical. Peters is the favorite in the best actress 
in a musical category, competing against Carolee Carmello, 
``Parade''; Dee Hoty, ``Footloose''; and Sian Phillips' portrayal 
of film great Marlene Dietrich in ``Marlene. 
</P>
<P>
	Wopat faces Martin Short, who played seven roles in ``Little  
Me''; Brent Carver of ``Parade''; and Adam Cooper, who danced the 
lead swan in ``Swan Lake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 53rd annual Tony Awards will be given June 6 in ceremonies  
televised from the Gershwin Theater. No guest host has been 
announced. Talk show host Rosie O'Donnell, credited with boosting 
the telecast's ratings, declined to take the job for a third 
straight year, citing scheduling difficulties.
