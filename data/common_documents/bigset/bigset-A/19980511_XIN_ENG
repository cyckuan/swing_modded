<HEADLINE> Syria Attacks Israel's Intransigent Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Prime Minister Mahmoud
Zouebi Sunday attacked Israel for taking a hostile attitude toward
peace and creating tensions in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inaugural session of the sixth Arab Energy
Conference held here, Zouebi said the Israeli government is
pursuing extremist policies in an attempt to evade commitments in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He lashed out at Israel's intransigent policies on the Mideast
peace process and violation of human rights and Islamic and
Christian sanctity.
</P>
<P>
Despite international efforts to rescue the peace process,
Israel strives to dodge commitments to implementing United Nations
resolutions, the Syrian prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Israel is resorting to maneuvers to nullify the U.N. Security
Council Resolution 425 demanding an unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has decided to endorse the U.N. resolution 425, but
conditioned its troop pullback from south Lebanon on security
arrangements made with Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, which agree to coordinate their stances on
key issues, have rejected Israel's conditional withdrawal offer,
insisting that the Israeli exit should be unconditional.
</P>
<P>
Zouebi said that Israel aims at undermining Syrian-Lebanese
unified position that either country will not make peace with the
Jewish state unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Syria's determination to achieve a just and
comprehensive peace based on U.N. resolutions and the
land-for-peace principle, and not to relinquish an inch of its
territory.
</P>
<P>
Syria wants the return of the Golan Heights, which was captured
by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Zouebi underlined the importance of enhancing Arab solidarity
and actions to oppose Israel's intransigence.
</P>
<P>
This is the "decisive factor" to confront Israel's expansionist
designs aimed at all Arab states, he said, adding that the Arabs
have no choice but to stand united to Israeli maneuvers.

<HEADLINE> SADC to Discuss Customs, Trade Documents in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Industry and Trade Coordination
Division of the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
will hold a three-day workshop here beginning Monday to harmonize
the region's customs and trade documents.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, to pave the way for the implementation of the
SADC trade protocol, is sponsored by the United States Agency for
International Development, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It is a follow-up on the directive of the committee of SADC
industry and trade ministers held in Dar es Salaam last year,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
The SADC ministers directed the coordination division to
finalize the relevant documents to be used for the implementation
of the SADC trade protocol.
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the workshop are expected to consider the report
prepared by two customs consultants on the harmonization and
simplification of customs and trade documents.
</P>
<P>
The working groups will draw up appropriate, practical,
simplified and harmonized customs and trade documents and
procedures for use by all the SADC member states for the
implementation of the SADC trade protocol.
</P>
<P>
SADC member states -- Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique,
Malawi, Mauritius, Zambia, Tanzania, Namibia, South Africa,
Swaziland and Zimbabwe with the exception of two newly-admitted
members, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Seychelles --
will be represented at the workshop.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Between Afghan Factions Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia and
forces loyal to Tajik warlord Ahmed Shah Masood continued to
exchange fire on Sunday in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here Sunday evening from
Afghanistan's capital of Kabul, Masood's forces with artillery and
heavy weapons launched a big attack Sunday over Ishkemish
district, 50 kilometers southeast of Talokan, provincial capital
of Takhar in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The forces of Masood claimed that they captured eight Taliban
posts and seized three tanks.
</P>
<P>
However, Taliban sources in Peshawar, capital of Pakistan's
North West Frontier Province, denied the claim and said the
offensive of Masood forces had been repulsed.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen people were killed and 25 others injured in the
fighting, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The renewed fighting in Afghanistan followed the collapse of
peace talks last Sunday in Pakistan between the Taliban and the
rival Northern Alliance.

<HEADLINE> British Surgeons to Implant World's First Mini </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The world's first thumb-sized
artificial heart is to be implanted in a human patient by British
surgeons, The Sunday Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The titanium mini-heart, developed in America, is the first of
a new generation of implantable artificial hearts which may offer
an alternative to scarce human organs in transplants, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The powerful miniature electric heart is capable of pumping
eight pints of blood a minute. It is driven by a tiny turbine
which sits inside the left ventricle of the heart.
</P>
<P>
Power is provided via a wire which runs up the body and exits
discreetly on the skull behind the ear.
</P>
<P>
The first human operation of the revolutionary device will be
performed by cardiac surgeon Steve Westaby, Britain's leading
mechanical hearts expert, at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford
later this year, according to The Sunday Times.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot FM Vows Military Buildup to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides said here Sunday that military build-up in Cyprus will
continue if there is no solution to the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark before his departure for a 13-day tour of
France, Argentina, Colombia and New York.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the concern of seven industrialized countries
over elevated force levels and upgrading of weaponry on the
island, Kasoulides said it would not influence Cyprus' decision on
the deployment of the Russian-made S-300 missile system.
</P>
<P>
"They should worry because for as long as the Cyprus problem
remains unresolved more weapons will be concentrated on the
island," Kasoulides said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that that if the Turkish troops stationed in
northern Cyprus, now reportedly 45,000-strong, withdraw from the
island, there will be no need for armaments.
</P>
<P>
"They should therefore act in such a way as to reach a
solution to the Cyprus problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974, when
Turkey sent troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the divided
island as a bizonal, bicommunal federation, but so far no tangible
results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides also pointed out that there could be no change
concerning the basis of bi-communal talks aiming at a resolution
to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has demanded the
recognition of his breakaway state in northern Cyprus before peace
negotiations can be resumed on state-to-state footing.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus was declared
unilaterally in 1983 by Turkish Cypriots but has been recognized
only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The relevant U.N. resolutions and the high level agreements of
1977 and 1979, reached between the Greek Cypriots and Turkish
Cypriots, provide for a federal, bizonal, bicommunal Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Iran Summons Austrian Ambassador over Egg Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry Sunday
summoned Austrian ambassador to Tehran, Werner Ehrlich, to protest
his government's "incompetence in preventing the trouble-making"
by a group of Iranian dissidents at a seminar in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's Director General in charge of western Europe Ali
Ahani complained about Austrian police's "irresponsible act," and
called for those Iranian dissidents' arrest and punishment, the
official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Those Iranian dissidents threw eggs and colorful materials at a
seminar on the role of policy and religion in Iran in Vienna
Thursday, when Iranian deputy foreign minister for education and
research affairs, Gholamali Khoshrou, was delivering a speech.
</P>
<P>
Expressing regret, Ahani urged that decisive measures be taken
by the Austrian police to "hunt down the attackers who were
seeking to weaken cultural cooperation between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
The Austrian ambassador condemned the attack and promised to
convey Iran's protest to his government in order to tackle the
matter promptly, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday Iran also summoned German ambassador to Tehran, Horst
Baechmann, to "strongly protest" an attack by a group of Iranian
dissidents on a mourning ceremony to mark the death of the third
Shiite Imam Hussein in Cologne on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry demanded the "arrest and punishment" of
those "who violated the religious sanctities" of the Muslims and
Iranians residing in Germany, IRNA added.

<HEADLINE> Hussein Voices Support for Iraq on Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 10 (Xinhua) - Jordan's King Hussein assured visiting
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed Al-Sahhaf Sunday that Amman
would spare no efforts to help bring the U.N. sanctions on Iraq to
an end.
</P>
<P>
"Jordan will do its uttermost to lift the sanctions imposed
on Iraq and ease the suffering of the Iraqi people," Jordan's
official news agency quoted the king as saying.
</P>
<P>
The king said that Jordan would use its influence with the
U.N. Security Council five permanent members, especially the
United States, to help end to the seven-year-old sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the king pointed out that Jordan's effort alone is
far from enough to make the sanctions lifted.
</P>
<P>
"The best means to achieve this goal is a quick implementation
of the U.N. Security Council resolutions as well as continued
(Iraqi) cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM)
entrusted with eliminating Iraqi weapons of mass destruction," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In a message from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to King
Hussein, Saddam briefed the king on Baghdad's full cooperation
with UNSCOM despite difficulties arising from the tough conditions
put forward by the commission during its inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali
also voiced his support for lifting the sanctions, contending that
Baghdad has committed itself to all the agreements with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Jordan, Iraq's one-time ally and trade partner, has often
called for an end to the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf arrived here Saturday night on the first leg of his
multi-nation tour that will also take him to Egypt and some Arab
countries to seek support for ending the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait can only lifted when UNSCOM verifies that Iraq has been
free of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
However, UNSCOM said last month in its report to the U.N.
Security Council reviewing the sanctions that virtually no
progress has been made during its months-long inspections in Iraq,
which led to the sanctions being kept in place.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Approves N. Ireland Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army, gave formal approval to the Northern
Ireland peace agreement on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At a special conference in Dublin, the party also backed a
motion to amend its constitution permitting members to join the
Northern Ireland Assembly, which is set to emerge from the accord.
</P>
<P>
The vote on the peace accord was taken by a show of party cards
held aloft, showing overwhelming support for the historic peace
accord aimed at ending conflict between Irish nationalist
Catholics and pro-British Protestants in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The conference also recommended 'Yes' votes in referendums to
be held on both sides of the Irish border on May 22 on the peace
accord. The peace deal was reached on April 10 after 22-month
negotiations by Northern Ireland major political parties.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam welcomed the decision by
Sinn Fein to back the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
"The government has always hoped that this agreement will be
supported by all parties that were present at the Stoormont
talks," she said.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams also said after the voting that
the decision was "important and historic."
</P>
<P>
He told the 1,500 delegates at the conference that "today we
have cleared the way for the future."

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls Israeli Nuke Programs Regional Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran said on Sunday that Israel's
nuclear programs are the major threat to the peace and security in
the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the official news agency IRNA, Iran's Defense
Minister Ali Shamkhani accused Israel's expansionist policies and
its non-conventional weapons programs in particular of being a
major source of threat to regional stability.
</P>
<P>
Israel is waging a propaganda war to exaggerate Iran's military
capabilities, Shamkhani said, calling it as "a clumsy move by the
Zionist-dominated media to divert public opinion from the nuclear
activities of the Zionist regime (of Israel)."
</P>
<P>
Such propaganda will fail to distort Iran's positive role in
maintaining peace and stability in the region and the world, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official blamed the United States for its move to
block condemnation of Israel in a recent international conference
to review the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani said the U.S. stymies efforts to free the Mideast of
nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
"Today, the American tax payers are financing the Zionist
regime's illegitimate and expansionist goals, the evidence of
which is its aggression against other countries, its terrorist
moves and its non-conventional weapons programs," he added
</P>
<P>
The propaganda blitz against Iran also aims to divert
attention from the failure of the so-called Middle East peace
process, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Israel accuse Iran of seeking weapons of mass
destruction and Israeli reports have claimed that Tehran has four
nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, Tehran lashes out at the U.S. for supporting
Israel's expansionist policies and its nuclear programs.

LONDON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A splinter pro-Irish guerrilla group
on Sunday claimed responsibility for a mortar attack on a police
station in a Northern Ireland village late on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Television said it had received a message from
Oglaigh Na h'Eireann, an Irish Republican Army splinter group,
which claimed responsibility for the mortar attack in Belleek in
south of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the attack which took place hours before
Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, began a party conference to
vote on whether to approve the Northern Ireland peace deal
thrashed out in April this year. Sinn Fein endorsed the peace
accord later Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement, which was reached on April 10, is aimed at
ending strife between Irish nationalist Catholics and pro-British
unionist Protestants. Guerrilla conflict has claimed more than
3,200 lives in the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
The accord will be put to a referendum in both Northern Ireland
and the Republic of Ireland on May 22.

<HEADLINE> Ross Again Ends Peace Mission Empty-handed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East peace envoy
Dennis Ross wound up his three-day ill-fated mission here Sunday
and left for home empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
Ross's current mission was to try to persuade Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept a U.S. initiative, which
calls for a 13.1 percent more Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank in exchange for concrete Palestinian measures against
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has accepted the
proposal. Netanyahu, however, stuck to no more than 9 percent
handback and did not budge citing Israeli security as the highest
priority.
</P>
<P>
At the London meetings on May 4-5 aimed to get the
Israeli-Palestinian talks back on track with the U.S. proposal,
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright failed to sell the
American idea to Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton then extended conditional
invitations to Arafat and Netanyahu for a Washington summit on
Monday for accelerated final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Clinton demanded that Netanyahu accept the proposal before
going to Washington. And Ross returned to the region Friday at the
request of Netanyahu for "creative" discussions.
</P>
<P>
Ross, likewise, failed to bring Netanyahu in line with the
U.S. initiative, and the proposed Washington summit, though not
outrightly rejected by Israel, has to be postponed until late this
month.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting Sunday morning with Ross, Israeli President Ezer
Weizman expressed his concerns about the development of the peace
process, and asked the U.S. to continue to help revive the stalled
Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel's cabinet met on Sunday, but no decision was announced
about Israel's stand on the U.S. proposal.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu told Ross that Israel would go on to find a
solution to the satisfaction of all concerned, although he could
not meet the Washington deadline on Monday to make final decisions
on the redeployment.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Congo to Host COMESA Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Republic of Congo
has been allowed to host the summit next month of the Common
Market for Southern and Eastern Africa (COMESA) despite its
failure to clear its arrears.
</P>
<P>
COMESA Acting Secretary-General Erastus Mwencha said here
Sunday that Democratic Congo has been given a special arrangement
for clearing its arrears to the regional group due to extenuating
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha said the arrears had been accumulated during the
Mobuto Sese Seko regime which was overthrown by Laurent Kabila
last year, and that the new government led by Kabila needs time
to clear them.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha made the remarks when he explained the reason why
Congo (Kinshasa) will host the summit when it is among the six
member countries under sanctions for accumulating arrears on
their subscriptions to the secretariat of the 20-member group for
more than two years.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed last year by the COMESA Council of
Ministers.
</P>
<P>
One of the highlights of the Kinshasa summit will be the
admission of Egypt, a north African country, to COMESA.
</P>
<P>
A draft agreement on the accession of Egypt to the COMESA
treaty was concluded here last week by an Egyptian government
delegation and the COMESA Secretariat in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The summit will also work out measures on how to achieve a
free trade area in the COMESA region by the year 2000, said
Mwencha.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, COMESA is finalizing the establishment of the Court
of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha said it is in the process of recruiting a court
registrar and that names of the seven judges who were selected by
the council of the ministers of justice and attorneys-general
will be submitted to the summit for approval.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Rebels May Attack Guinea: ECOMOG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's rebel group
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) may launch an attack on Guinea,
the west African peace-keeping force ECOMOG said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Normally when they want to carry out an action, they go to
tell the world that someone is attacking them," said Col. Maxwell
Kobe, ECOMOG task force commander in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"I will not be surprised if they attack Guinea. So I've
advised the Guinean armed forces to look out against them," the
ECOMOG commander said, quoted by a British Broadcasting
Corporation report monitored here.
</P>
<P>
Col. Kobe made the remarks in response to RUF's alleged
information claiming an impending attack against its traditional
stronghold in Kailahun, eastern Sierra Leone, by ECOMOG troops
based in Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Guinea, which together with Nigeria has the largest contingent
in ECOMOG, shares common border with Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
According to Col. Kobe, the Guinean troops have been deployed
along the border long before now. If they received the order,
they will carry it out systematically.
</P>
<P>
"If they carry the battle into Guinea, I will give order to
cross the border into Guinea. I will do so," Col. Kobe stated.
</P>
<P>
RUF, which has fought against successive governments of Sierra
Leone since 1991, became allied to the military junta that ousted
the legitimate government in a coup on May 25 last year.
</P>
<P>
Both RUF and the junta forces fled to the east of the country
after they were driven out of the capital Freetown by ECOMOG in
mid-February.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG is now carrying out operations to mop up the remnants
of the junta forces and RUF rebels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is reported that the junta leader, Johnny Paul
Koroma, has offered surrender to a senior churchman and not
ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the Roman Catholic bishop of Sierra Leone's
northern diocese, George Biguzzi, Koroma said that he would
surrender to the bishop.
</P>
<P>
He would like to do so as he feared for his life and that of
his family at the hands of the ECOMOG force, said an ECOMOG
senior officer, quoted by the report, which is yet to be
confirmed.

<HEADLINE> E. African Countries to Build Joint Power Grid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda
are considering to create a joint power grid in a bid to
intensify their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The final draft for regional power supply plan is ready and
has been presented to the East African Cooperation (EAC)
secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The plan, to be circulated to three partner states for review,
was discussed during a regional energy experts meeting in Dar es
Salaam at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
An expert who attended the two-day meeting under the auspices
of EAC, said experience has shown that interconnection of two or
more independent electricity systems usually benefit all
participants.
</P>
<P>
He cited an example of a 132-kv double circuit line running
from Uganda's Owen Falls generation station to Kenya via a
sub-station at Tororo. Uganda is also supplying power to Bukoba
of Tanzania through a 132-kv single circuit line from Masaka.
</P>
<P>
"Interconnection has been considered as technically feasible
and economically viable," the expert said.
</P>
<P>
"The interconnection of EA power systems will be another
milestone toward regional cooperation," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The expert, however, did not reveal the costs of connecting
the power systems of the three member states.
</P>
<P>
More than 15 experts at the meeting also reviewed the status
of biogas technology in each of the three states and advised them
to appropriately address the issues covering installation costs
and service life of the biogas plant.
</P>
<P>
On solar energy, the meeting stressed the need to adopt right
technology and to abandon substandard equipment in the three
countries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting noted that direct solar water heating system or
hybrid solar electric system will be appropriate for
institutions, hotels, hospitals and school and consequently
reduce the use of biomass energy.
</P>
<P>
It also encouraged the exchange of visits of experts and
information to share energy information in the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The world today is economically
richer but environmentally poorer than ever before, according to a
new study of global trends from the Worldwatch Institute.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the global economy expanded at a near record 4
percent, pushing incomes to a new high with the biggest gains
coming in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"It was also a year of disturbing new signs of environmental
stress," said Worldwatch president Lester Brown. "Indonesia's
rainforests burned out of control for several months, grabbing the
headlines, but an even larger area of forests was burning in the
Brazilian Amazon. China's Yellow River failed to reach the sea for
226 days, devastating the ecosystem in its lower reaches."
</P>
<P>
On climate change, the study, entitled Vital Signs 1998: The
Environmental Trends Shaping Our Future, said carbon emissions
reached a record high in 1997 totalling 6.3 billion tons, up 1.5
percent from 6.2 billion tons in 1996. Atmospheric concentrations
of CO2 climbed to 364 PPM, the highest in 160,000 years. With the
record temperature in 1997, the 14 warmest years since
recordkeeping began in 1866 have all occurred since 1979. Evidence
of the warming can be found in melting icecaps in the Andes,
shrinking glaciers in the Alps and the breakup of the sea ice
around Antactica.
</P>
<P>
In the field of energy, during the 1990s, sales of coal and oil
have grown just over 1 percent a year, while wind power has grown
26 percent a year. Sales of solar cells, averaging 15 percent
annually from 1990 through 1996, jumped a phenomenal 43 percent in
1997.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Ends 8-Nation African Tour in Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Sunday left Eritrea, ending his two-week-long
eight-nation African tour, according to a report from Asmara, the
Eritrean capital.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief held talks with Eritrean President Isaias
Afwerki before heading for New York later Sunday.
</P>
<P>
They discussed among others the issue of the return of 150,000
Eritrean refugees from neighboring Sudan, some of whom are said
to be supporting the opposition Eritrean Liberation Front.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, particularly its High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), have been at odds with Asmara for years over
the treatment of Eritrean refugees in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR has said that its mandate does not allow forced
expulsions of refugees from host countries, although Eritrea says
that it wants its refugees to be returned home.
</P>
<P>
However, Eritrea said Sunday that it would allow a permanent
office of UNHCR to be established in the newest African country
of Eritrea, which may improve their relations.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea, formerly part of Ethiopia, became independent in
May 1993.
</P>
<P>
At a joint conference held in Asmara, President Afwerki told
Annan that African nations would like to see the United Nations
forge a new relationship with the continent.
</P>
<P>
"Here in Africa, we would like to see a different United
Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Not the United Nations which made mistakes in Somalia, not
the United Nations which made mistakes in Rwanda, not the
United Nations which makes mistakes in dealing with refugee
issues, and not the United Nations which has been discredited
in Africa."
</P>
<P>
Annan flew to Asmara from Rwanda where Kigali blamed the
U.N. for failing to prevent or stop the 1994 genocide of over
500,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus by hardline Hutus.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda's president, vice-president and premier boycotted
their official dinner for Annan frowning on his speech saying
the U.N. did little in 1994 because there was no political will
among important member states to intervene militarily.
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, Annan have also visited Ethiopia,
Djibouti, Burundi, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Police Head Warns Against Fresh Riot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian police have warned that
the government will deal squarely with any fresh attempts to
foment trouble by any group of persons in the country.
</P>
<P>
Giving the warning in the western city of Ibandan at the
weekend, Inspector-General of Police Alhaji Ibrahim Coomassie
called on the people of the ancient city to give peace a chance.
</P>
<P>
At least seven persons died in Ibadan during a May Day
confrontation between protesters and the police when
anti-government organizations launched a demonstration to protest
against the possible self-succession of General Sani Abacha, the
current head of state.
</P>
<P>
Pro-democracy and human rights groups in the country have
recently been wooing the support of the public in their
activities, particularly since the five political parties adopted
Abacha three weeks ago as their sole consensus candidate for the
August presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Ibandan has been a hot spot of protest.
</P>
<P>
"Incidents such as we witnessed on Friday, May 1, 1998 should
never be allowed to take place again," the police chief said,
quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Needless to say those arrested in connection with this
incident. If found liable, they will be dealt with in accordance
with the law," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the police commissioner of Kaduna State in the
north, Shu'aibu Yakubu, has said that his command would not allow
any group of persons to hold the state to random for any reason.
</P>
<P>
He said the issue of the members for the Shi'ite Moslem group,
who clashed with his men several times recently, should be a
pointer to troublemakers that his command was determined to
maintain law and order in the state.
</P>
<P>
The clashes this year took place when some members of the
group came out calling for the release of their leader and
mentor, El-Zak Zaky, who is standing trial in Kaduna.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Fund Industry Sees Net Inflows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The fund industry in Hong Kong
registered new inflows of nearly 100 million US dollars in March,
showing a significant turn-around in sales after five months of
net outflows.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Investment Funds Association (HKIFA) announced
here Monday that net inflows in March hit 93.8 million US dollars,
about one quarter of the gross sales.
</P>
<P>
Gross sales of unit trust in March 1998 reached 393.98 million
US dollars, an increase of 46 percent over that of the previous
month.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since September last year that the
industry drew net inflows, according to the Association. Between
October 1997 and February 1998, the fund management industry
registered monthly net outflows, which added up to 158 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Peter Lord, chairman of the HKIFA said: "The inflows seem to
indicate both a selective increase in optimism about certain Asian
markets, and a continued trend towards diversified equity and bond
funds."
</P>
<P>
He said that by the end of March, most of the regional currency
and stock markets had stabilized or managed to stage a rebound.
</P>
<P>
"We have noted that an increasing number of investors are of
the view that the worst is over and have started to buy into the
Asian markets selectively," said Lord. His association consists of
47 fund management companies and 41 trustees and other
professionals.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Richard Ivey School of
Business, a well-known western business school, announced here on
Monday that its first campus outside Canada will be opened in Hong
Kong this September.
</P>
<P>
The facility will be known as the Cheng Yu Tung Management
Institute as Dr. Henry Cheng, managing director of New World
Development Company Ltd. and also an Ivey alumnus, has donated 5
million Canadian dollars (around 3.5 million U.S. dollars) in
honor of his father Dr. Cheng Yu Tung to fund the establishment of
the campus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the naming ceremony, Henry Cheng voiced the hope
that the institute would add a new dimension to Hong Kong's
executive education and contribute to the development of
management talent in China and throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
Located in the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, the
institute will be a world-class facility, with a state-of-the-art
amphitheater classroom, electronic library, global video
conferencing and work-stations with on-line access to Ivey's
extensive library in Canada, according to Professor Joseph
DiStefano who will head the institute.
</P>
<P>
It will also feature an open lounge, seven discussion rooms,
and administrative and faculty offices.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the ceremony was Lawrence Tapp, dean of the
Ivey school, who said that the donation was the largest
international contribution in the school's history.
</P>
<P>
It will be used to finance the start-up of the Hong Kong
Executive MBA Program and also support business case study in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to establish a unique resource for managers and
potential manager practicing in Asia and to create a legacy of
top-quality research for tomorrow's business leaders. To do this,

HONG KONG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 2.8 million registered
electors in Hong Kong for the 1998 Legislative Council election
will receive poll cards, maps and voting guides starting from this
week.
</P>
<P>
With the delivery of these documents, the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) is giving the finishing touches to its
preparations for the first Legislative Council election, which
falls on May 24.
</P>
<P>
"These documents will remind electors when, where and how to
vote," chairman of the Electoral Affairs Commission, Justice Woo
Kwok-hing, said here Monday in a speech at a Legislative Council
election forum of the Hong Kong Society of Accountants.
</P>
<P>
The 60 members of the first HKSAR Legislative Council will be
elected in three different ways, 20 by five geographical
constituencies, 30 by 28 functional constituencies and 10 by an
800-member Election Committee.
</P>
<P>
Ten candidates from uncontested functional constituencies have
already been declared as legislative councilors. So the election
in two weeks will be held only for the remaining 50 seats.
</P>
<P>
Justice Woo and the commission he chairs will supervise the
election to ensure that it is conducted in an open, fair and
honest way.
</P>
<P>
"The convenience of electors is a prime concern to us," he
said. Except for the 800 members of the Election Committee, every
elector will be assigned a polling station near his home.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 51st World Health Assembly Rejects Nicaraguan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Assembly, the
highest governing body of the World Health Organization (WHO),
rejected here Monday a proposal by Nicaragua and a few other
countries on Taiwan's participation in the assembly as an
observer.
</P>
<P>
The General Committee's recommendation not to include the
Nicaragua-led proposal in the agenda of the 51st World Health
Assembly was adopted by consensus at the plenary of the 51st World
Health Assembly being held here on May 11-16.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Chinese delegation Zhang Wenkang welcomed the
unanimous adoption without a vote of the General Committee's
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
"The issue on Taiwan observer status is not a new one," said
the Chinese Minister of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
Zhang recalled that last year it was by an overwhelming
majority of 128 votes that the plenary upheld the General
Committee's decision to reject the above-mentioned proposal.
</P>
<P>
"Regretfully, the Taiwan authorities have asked certain member
states to raise this issue again this year," Zhang said. "It
constitutes an interference with the work of the current
assembly."
</P>
<P>
"What they are trying to do is to create 'Two Chinas' or 'One
China, one Taiwan' in this organization, thus undermining China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the Chinese government has always paid great
attention to the issue of how 21.8 million people in China's
Taiwan Province can enjoy the services of the WHO.
</P>
<P>
"If the Taiwan authorities raise the question to the Central
Government under the principle of 'One China', I believe that the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait can surely find an appropriate
solution," Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Holds Japan Responsible for "Comfort Women" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea on Monday urged Japan to take responsibility for the
"comfort women" issue.
</P>
<P>
The issue involves the many Asian women who were forced by
Tokyo to act as sex slaves for Japanese troops during World War
Two.
</P>
<P>
Japan should unconditionally admit and apologize for all war
crimes, and take responsibility for the issue of "comfort women",
a spokesman for DPRK's foreign ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came in the wake of a Japanese court ruling
that Tokyo should compensate three South Koreans forced to serve
as "comfort women".
</P>
<P>
The Yamaguchi District Court in western Japan, on April 27,
ordered the government pay 300,000 yen (2,460 U.S. dollars) each
to three of 10 plaintiffs, who had demanded a total of 564 million
yen (4.62 million dollars) for being forced to work as "comfort
women".
</P>
<P>
The spokesman welcomed the ruling, saying it was a fair one
despite some limits -- the latter including the court's rejection
of the women's appeal for an official apology by the Japanese
government.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government, said the spokesman, could in no way
avoid the legal and moral responsibility of this issue.
</P>
<P>
Until now, Japan has refused to pay direct compensation and
make any official apology to any of the women, saying all claims
were settled by peace treaties that formally ended the war.

<HEADLINE> Low Turnout Leaves Hungary's Election Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's first-round
parliamentary election on Sunday failed to yield specific results
due to low voter turnouts, the elections commission said.
</P>
<P>
General election returns showed that only about 50 percent of
Hungary's 8.1 million voters went to the polls, signaling a
significant drop in turnout from the 1990 and 1994 elections,
which had 65.1 and 68.92 percent turnouts respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the states of Hajdu-Bihar and Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg, voter
turnouts failed to reach the 50 percent threshold, leaving their
party elections invalid .
</P>
<P>
As a result, the elections commission could not decide, as
planned, which parties had pocketed more than five percent votes
and were eligible to enter the parliament. The final results will
not come out until the second-round election on May 24.
</P>
<P>
Initial results showed that Hungary's ruling socialists took
the lead with 32.25 percent, followed by the Federation of Young
Democrats with 28.2 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
The Small Holder's Party, the Alliance of Free Democrats and
Hungarian Justice and the Life Party were also possible entrants
to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The low voter turnouts in the election caused an outcry in
various circles of the country. An authoritative person, in a
television speech, attributed it to a "crisis in the democratic
system and Hungarian society".
</P>
<P>
President Goncz Arpad, however, said most of those who did not
vote failed to feel the improvement in the national economy.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Orders Nationwide Cleanup After Voting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing Philippine President Fidel
Ramos Monday ordered government officials to clean up all
communities, especially to remove election posters and banners in
public places immediately after voting for national and local
elections ended.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the 34 million registered voters trooped to
precincts to elect a president, a vice president, 12 out of 24
senators, 260 members of the House of Representatives and
thousands of local officials and councilors.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who fled back to the Presidential Palace after casting
his vote in his hometown in Pangasinan province in the north,
ordered the Department of the Interior and Local Government and
the Philippine National Police to clean up the streets to make
preparations for celebrations of the 100th anniversary of the
country's proclamation of independence.
</P>
<P>
The country has started to celebrate the centennial of
independence since January this year. The celebrations will
culminate on June 12 with parades all over the country and a grand
rally in Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, barred by the constitution from seeking a second term,
will step down on June 30 when his single six-year term ends. He
has anointed House Speaker Jose de Venecia as the standard bearer
of the ruling Lakas-NUCD party in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Back in Manila from his hometown, the president has been
monitoring the outcome of the elections and checking on the hot
spots by phone.
</P>
<P>
A presidential news release said Ramos talked to leaders from
not only Mindanao, the violence-prone region in the south, but
also from all over the country, inquiring about the peace and
order situation during the elections and after the polling
precincts closed at 3 p.m. local time (7:00 GMT Monday).
</P>
<P>
Despite some election-related violence incidents, the polls
were held in a "generally orderly and peaceful manner," the
Commission on Elections said.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest exit poll conducted by the private DZRH
radio station, 16.8 percent of the 41,840 voters surveyed
nationwide said they voted for de Venecia.
</P>
<P>
However, Vice President Joseph Estrada, the candidate of the
Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino (Fight of Patriotic Filipino
Masses), led with 34.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
A total of 10 presidential candidate are running for the
presidency in the elections. Analysts said that no candidate would
get majority support and it is also possible that a dark horse
might emerge.

BONN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Germany's inflation rate jumped
to 1.4 percent in April mainly due to a one-percent increase in

<P>
The lastest increase came after Germany's inflation dropped to
1.1 percent in March, the lowest level since the German
reunification in 1990.

HARARE, May 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 200,000 Zimbabweans have
died of AIDS since appearance of the epidemic about 13 years ago,
Deputy Minister of Health and Child Welfare David Parirenyatwa
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Of the country's estimated population of about 12.5 million,
said Parirenyatwa, 1.5 million are infected with HIV, 350,000 of
whom had developed full blown AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the official opening of a five-day AIDS exposition
workshop, Parirenyatwa said the government is setting up an AIDS
coordination mechanism which will place AIDS on the national
priority list for social and resource mobilization.
</P>
<P>
The government is also working with Zimbabwe National
Traditional Healers Association to utilise herbal drugs which
are being evaluated to alleviate symptoms and signs of HIV/AIDS,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite development of anti-retroviral drugs to improve the
management of HIV infected people, said the deputy minister, the
drugs are inaccessible to those who need them because of their
high cost.
</P>
<P>
The exposition, the first to be held in the country, marks the
beginning of an era for collective determination to contain the
AIDS pandemic which is killing more than 700 people a week.

MEXICO CITY, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Jamaica defeated Santos of
Brazil 3-2 on Sunday in its build-up to the World Cup finals in
France.
</P>
<P>
In the eighth minute, teenager Ricardo Gardner scored the first
off a long pass from Fitzroy Simpson to send the home fans in
Kingston into screaming frenzy.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the Santos players were not to be subdued and rallied back
with two goals from Lucio and Jorginho in the 23rd and 37th
minutes.
</P>
<P>
As the fans stopped cheering, forward Paul Hall levelled 2-2
from a corner headed over by Linval Dixon three minutes later.
</P>
<P>
In the 67th minute, Jamaican fans rose to celebrate their last
home game when defender Ian Goodison found the back of the net in
a goal mouth melee.
</P>
<P>
From then on, the Jamaicans withstood all efforts by Santos to
find an equalizer and came very close several times to increasing
their lead.
</P>
<P>
So far, Jamaica has maintained its record of not losing at home
since 1994 despite a string of moderate performances abroad.
</P>
<P>
Jamaica will play two away games against South Korea on May 16
and 19 and end its pre-World Cup build-up on May 31 at Giants
Stadium in New York with a match against a Caribbean all-stars

<HEADLINE> PNA Accepts No Less than 13 Percent Pullback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb
Erekat has said the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) will
accept no less than 13 percent of Israel's troop redeployment in
the West Bank as proposed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Talking to Israel Radio on Monday, Erekat, also PNA minister of
local government, said he has learned from the media that
U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu have completed a compromise on the U.S. proposal.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Ross, during his visit to the region last weekend,
agreed with Netanyahu that Israel will only hand over 9 percent of
the West Bank to the Palestinians by mid-summer and an additional
4 percent will be designated for transfer to PNA civilian control
at a later date.
</P>
<P>
"There was a U.S. proposal for this issue and the PNA has
already accepted it and the PNA will not accept any other new deal
which is less than 13 percent," Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
News leaked to the media Sunday night from Netanyahu's office
said that as engineered by Ross, agreed by Netanyahu and with a
nod from PNA President Yasser Arafat, Israel would designate
certain areas beyond 9 percent, hold them in abeyance and turn
them over to the PNA later only on its fulfillment of certain
conditions, including fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
This may be narrow in scope, but it could suffice to generate a
renewal of momentum in the long-stalled peace process, a senior
Israeli government official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The specific timetable for implementing this deal presumably
will be negotiated during the two-and-a-half week running up to
the rescheduled Washington summit of Netanyahu, Arafat and
U.S. President Bill Clinton later this month, the official added.
</P>
<P>
The official contended that the ball now is in the American
court and credited Arafat with having exposed Israel's true
position by having agreed to accept the U.S. initial invitation to
a summit.
</P>
<P>
The Washington summit had been planned for Monday, but was put
off due to Israel's refusal to accept the U.S. ideas of a 13.1
percent redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe that the postponement the
Washington summit was indeed a blow to Clinton and a sign of
Israeli ingratitude.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is scheduled to travel to the U.S. on Wednesday to
attend a meeting of the Jewish community there and be back Sunday
night. He will meet Jewish community leaders, congress members and
other low-ranking administration officials to lobby their support
for Israel.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. administration officials reportedly said in Washington
on Sunday that Netanyahu will be making a grave tactical mistake
if he tries to use the U.S. trip to turn the American public
opinion against the administration's policy in the Middle East
peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze on Monday called for the intensive development of
relations between Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
He made the call in his weekly radio interview, said an
Interfax news agency report from Tbilisi, the Georgian capital.
</P>
<P>
The president said it was time for an intensive development of
triangular Georgian-Armenian-Azerbaijiani contacts, because "the
Caucasus has no future without peace."
</P>
<P>
He mentioned his recent visit to Baku to take part in
celebrating Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev's 75th birthday,
where they discussed a strategic partnership between their two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said he is preparing a meeting with Armenian President
Robert Kocharian for the near future.
</P>
<P>
Referring to relations with Russia, the president said the
three countries must work together to think of radical changes in
relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Georgian-Russian relations should be improved
on the basis of "principles of mutual benefit, and not on
confrontation, diktat or disregard for national interests".
</P>
<P>
Talking about the proposed Eurasian Transport Corridor
(TRACECA) Shevardnadze said interest in the project is growing
throughout the world, including in the United States, Japan, China
and other leading nations.
</P>
<P>
He urged Russia to become closely involved in TRACECA, and said
both Azerbaijan and Georgia would welcome the Russian president to
the planned TRACECA summit in Baku.
</P>
<P>
As for the hot point in Abkhazia region, Shevardnadze noted
that if the refugees returned and the conflict was settled by
political means, Abkhazia would in no time become a prosperous and
rich territory. This would happen much more quickly than in other
regions of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
He said he was ready to discuss the matter with Abkhazina
leader Vladislav Ardzinba at any time.

<HEADLINE> Forum Held on Learning from China's Model Steel Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- At a forum held here today, the
Chinese government called on the country's ailing state-own
industries to learn from the success of Handan Steel Co., or
Hangang.
</P>
<P>
Learning from Hangang is in essence learning how to establish
an enterprise mangement system in conformity with a market
economy, said Chen Qingtai, vice minister in charge of the State
Economic and Trade Commission, at the forum co-sponsored by the
Commission and the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
"The essence of Hangang's experience is applicable to every
state-owned enterprise in the market," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He added that learning from Hangang is an important measure for
the majority of large- and medium-size state-owned enterprises to
get out of difficulty and establish a modern enterprise system in
three years' time, a target set by the central authorities.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, China's Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) grew by 7.2 percent on a year-on-year basis, close
to its goal of an 8 percent increase for the whole year, according
to Chen.
</P>
<P>
However, the poor economic efficiency of state-owned businesses
was still the major problem in the national economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Xu Guangchun, deputy head of the Publicity Department of the CPC
Central Committee, called on the media to tell about the
successful experience of Hangang to help with the ongoing reform
of state-owned industries.

<HEADLINE> 4 Killed in Voting in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Heavily armed men Monday shot dead a
candidate of the ruling party in the southern island of Sulu,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The killing brought to four the number of people killed in
Monday's elections and 40 the death toll in election-related
violence since January this year.
</P>
<P>
The reports said a commander of the Moro National Liberation
Front was on his way to a poll precinct to vote when attackers
fired at him from all directions in Pata, Sulu.
</P>
<P>
The Moro National Liberation Front, the former largest rebel
group in the country, signed a final peace agreement with the
government in September, 1996 after 24 years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The assailants fled after the incident, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, two people were shot dead in Lanao del Sur by a
group of unidentified gunmen while waiting at a mini-bus station
to deliver ballots to precincts.
</P>
<P>
A third person was shot dead early in the morning near his
residence in Claveria town, Masbate province in the north.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, police arrested 13 men with three M-16
armalite rifles and a grenade for violating a gun ban issued by
the Commission on Elections in Tambobong, Misamis Oriental
province, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Despite these election-related incidents, the voting was
conducted in a "generally peaceful and orderly" manner, poll
watchers said.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the previous elections including the two held in
1992 and 1995, Monday's voting may be the most peaceful and
orderly in the country's election history, the poll watchers said.
</P>
<P>
In the 1992 general elections, over 100 people were killed in
election related violence, while in the 1995 senate elections, 210
people died.
</P>
<P>
To ensure "honest, peaceful and orderly elections," the
government has identified 425 towns and municipalities as
"sensitive areas" where a total of 116,000 troops and policemen
have been deployed.
</P>
<P>
The voting, which started at 7 a.m. (23:00 GMT Sunday), ended
at 3 p.m. (7:00 GMT Monday). The counting of votes is still
underway in Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the 34 million registered voters went to
the polls Monday to elect a new president, a vice president, 12
out of 24 senators, 260 members of the House of Representatives
and more than 17,000 local officials and local councilors.
</P>
<P>
An exit poll released by a private radio station DZRH showed
that vice President Joseph Estrada, candidate of the Laban ng
Makabayang masang Pilipino (Fight of Patriotic Filipinos Masses),
led the other 9 presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed 36.1 percent of the 13,491 voters surveyed said
they voted for the 61-year-old former movie star.
</P>
<P>
The other major contenders in the presidential race include
House Speaker Jose de Venecia of the ruling Lakas-NUCD party and
former Manila mayor Alfredo Lim of the Liberal Party.

<HEADLINE> Daimler Confirms Cooperation Talks with Nissan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Germany's largest industrial concern,
Daimler-Benz AG, confirmed Monday it is talking with Japan's
second largest carmaker, Nissan Motors, on a possible alliance in
truck operations.
</P>
<P>
The confirmation came after the Japanese carmaker said earlier
Monday that the two companies had engaged in talks about a tie-up
in the development, production and sale of commercial vehicles.
</P>
<P>
A possible capital participation by Daimler in truck maker
Nissan Diesel would possibly be included in the deal, said the
Japanese carmaker which holds a 39.8 percent controlling stake in
Nissan Diesel.
</P>
<P>
Three cooperation projects are under discussion between the two
companies: Daimler's deliveries of axles and drive shafts to
Nissan, cooperation in building a transporter on a common chassis
for the Asian market and the joint development of a new
light-truck.
</P>
<P>
The latest news came in the wake of last week's surprising
announcement by Daimler and the third largest United States
carmaker, Chrysler, on their possible merger into the world's
third largest carmaker with combined global sales of 130 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Daimler is eyeing the vast Asian market, while the two Japanese
companies have seen their sales declining and balance sheets
deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Daimler's buying in Nissan Diesel, which has
production lines throughout Asia, would clearly expand the German
company's presence in the Asian market.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Argentine Charges over Bomb Blasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran Monday rejected as "unfounded"
the charge by some Argentine officials that Iran was behind the
1994 bomb blasts in Argentine capital Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said Iran has
reiterated that the explosions at a Jewish center and near the
Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires were Argentina's domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
According to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), Mohammadi
warned that if certain Argentine officials, influenced by the
U.S. and Israel, insisted on attributing the incidents to Iran,
they would meet Iran's serious reaction.
</P>
<P>
A number of Argentine officials, Interior Minister Carlos
Corach in particular, have recently accused that the Iranian
cultural attache was involved in the blast at the Jewish center,
which killed 88 people and injured 159 others.
</P>
<P>
After the bombing, an Iranian national, identified as
Manouchehr Motamer, offered some information to the Argentine
authorities, incriminating four Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
However, over the past three years, there has been no enough
evidence found to prove Iran's involvement in the blast, IRNA
said.

examples.

<HEADLINE> Fightings Resume for Control of Somali Town of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The fighting for control of the
southern port town of Kismaio resumed Sunday night after a lull
in the fighting since last Saturday, said reports reaching the
Somali capital of Mogadishu Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to radio reports, General Mohamed Saeed Morgan's
Majerten militiamen are making further advances towards the
territories controlled by faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid in
Lower Jubba region.
</P>
<P>
Junior Aidid has so far been avoiding to have a face-to-face
clashes with Morgan's militiamen probably due to his
concentration on lobbying in the power sharing for the capital.
</P>
<P>
Morgan's militiamen have once again captured the important
bridge town of Kansuma Monday following heavy clashes with the
Marehan militiamen of the Somali National Front (SNF).
</P>
<P>
Reports said 13 combatant militiamen (eight from General
Morgan's and five from the Marehans) have died and more than 22
others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources, militia forces of the Marehan
subclan have been seen regrouping themselves 20 km south of the
populated town of Jilib, 330 km south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the fall of Kansuma has been facilitated by
some battle wagons and more than a hundred of heavily armed
militiamen from the Ogaden subclan who have come from the
direction of Marerey town, about 60 km west of Jilib, forcing the
defensive units of the Marehans to disintegrate and retreat back
towards Jilib.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of families from the villages of Gobwein, Bulo Gudud,
Yontoy and Kansuma have fled their houses to the nearby jungles
for safety. The situation of these families is reportedly
desperate with no food, shelter or medicine and there are no
peace tentative continuing at the moment despite several peace
appeals made by the faction leaders and elders in Mogadishu and
others in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, leaders of Somalia's main factions held a meeting
Monday at Kah Hotel for the announcement of a 26-member Supreme
Council which will be the ultimate authority for Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
However, the administration for the capital is yet to be
finalized even though the deadline for the convening of the
Somali National Reconciliation Conference scheduled to take place
in Baidoa is only four days away.
</P>
<P>
The Baidoa conference is most likely to be postponed for the
third time due to financial reasons. Sympathizers of the Cairo
peace deal, mainly the Arab and Moslem nations, have pledged to
finance the meeting if Mogadishu's administration is set up
first.
</P>
<P>
It may take two more weeks for Mogadishu's administration to
conclude the opening of the main air and seaports of the capital
which have been closed since 1995.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Officials Urged on to Learn Deng Xiaoping Theory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese officials, especially
high-ranking ones, were called on today to further study Deng
Xiaoping Theory to meet a new level required by the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said that Chinese officials
should apply the theory to coping with new situations and new
trends to make use of a favorable external environment and
conditions that are beneficial to China's development.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the remarks at the opening ceremony of a forum on
studying Deng Xiaoping Theory and the spirit of the 15th CPC
National Congress. This is the second forum held for members and
alternate members of the CPC Central Committee. The first one was
held in last December in accordance with the requirements raised
by president Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that the only choice to solve some pressing issues in
China's ongoing reform and opening-up and the modern construction
drive is to adhere to the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory and the
spirit of the 15th CPC National Congress.
</P>
<P>
He added that the level of China's official contingent has
greatly improved in recent years. However, the quality of some
officials, including some leaders, still cannot meet the demands
of new situations and the expectation of the Party and the people.
</P>
<P>
Chinese president Jiang Zemin has emphasized repeatedly that
state officials should strengthen theory study, especially Deng
Xiaoping Theory, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Hu asked officials to combine the theory study with experience
in China's reform and opening-up, as well as the problems that
China is now facing.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Kenya Tries to Improve Telecommunication Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government intends to
enhance its telecommunication sector with the telephone line
increasing from 300,000 to one million by the year of 2000, local
press Monday quoted Kenyan Transport and Communication Minister William
Ntimama as saying.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival from a week-long telecommunication fair in
South Africa, Ntimama said Sunday that with the enactment of
the Communication Act, the Kenya Posts and Tele-communications
Corporation (KPTC) will be liberalized.
</P>
<P>
According to a proposed privatization plan, KPTC will split
into three autonomous bodies to provide separate services.
</P>
<P>
Ntimama noted that competition to be introduced in the
telecommunication sector will widen the capital base of the
industry and improve the efficiency of its services.
</P>
<P>
A Communication Commission of Kenya will be set up under the
Communication Act to register, licence and regulate investors in
the field of telecommunications, he added.
</P>
<P>
During the Africa Telecom '98 Exhibition closed on May 9, the
minister said, a ministerial meeting was held and recommended
priority projects to ensure Africa's launch into the "Information
Age".
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan minister said sub-Saharan African governments
committed themselves at the meeting to enhancing their
telecommunication capacity from 12 million telephone lines to 50
million lines in five years.
</P>
<P>
The ministers attending the meeting resolved to set up an
African telecommunication development fund with the aim to
establish data banks in the fields of education, agriculture and
medicine throughout the Africa.
</P>
<P>
Ntimama blamed the failure of Africa in information technology
on economic factors such as lack of financial, manpower resources
and capital investment.

<HEADLINE> Algerian President Highlights Role of G-15 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Liamaine Zeroual
on Monday stressed the importance of the Group of 15 (G-15) to
play an effective role at regional and international levels at a
time when the world economy is witnessing a radical change.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of the group's eighth summit on
behalf of African nations, Zeroual said developing countries
should not be kept away from international developments, but
should participate in formulating a new economic system within the
context of globalization.
</P>
<P>
He said the 16 member states of the group are committed to
defending in solidarity issues concerning the developing countries
in international economic relations.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian president said that Africa wants to play a bigger
role in shaping the world economy, adding that African nations
often face "a negative or even hostile climate" as they try to
develop.
</P>
<P>
He accused wealthy Western nations of trying to marginalize
developing states seeking to expand their economies.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue our effort to stand up against
marginalization," he said. "The international community should
give due consideration to the sacrifices the African nations have
made and show more solidarity with Africa."
</P>
<P>
"We are doing our share of the responsibility, but we believe
that the international community is duty-bound to do its share,
too," Zeroual noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that wealthy Western nations have not done
enough to help African countries in their efforts to develop,
adding that the rich can help Africa's poor by waiving debts and
increasing aid and investments.
</P>
<P>
He said African states should be paid more for raw materials
such as oil and minerals supplied to the West, and called on
developing and industrial countries to share the burdens and
benefits of economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial turmoil, South-South cooperation and
South-North dialog will be high on the agenda of the three-day
summit.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of Senegal, Peru, Indonesia, Zimbabwe and Kenya,
vice presidents of India, Brazil and Argentina and other leaders
of the G-15 member states are present at the opening ceremony
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The summit offers the leaders an opportunity to take stock of
the recent world economic developments and orchestrate a unified
stand for the bloc.
</P>
<P>
A final joint statement is expected to spell out the stances of
the G-15 on main economic and political issues around the globe.
</P>
<P>
As a group of developing countries from Latin America, Africa
and Asia, the G-15 was founded in 1989 with the aim of promoting
economic and trade and boosting cooperation among developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
The organization retains its name after Kenya became its 16th
member in 1997, joining Egypt, India, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Algeria, Nigeria, Senegal, Zimbabwe, Argentina, Brazil, Chile,
Jamaica, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
</P>

The first and last G-15 summits were held in the Malaysian
capital of Kuala Lumpur, in 1990 and 1997 respectively.

"We regret that the meeting proposed by the Americans could not
take place, and we regret the Israeli intransigence," said French
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
The American proposal constituted "the only realistic basis to
the day for the relaunch of the peace talks and implementation of
the concluded agreements" between Israel and Palestinians, she
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the proposal should not be abandoned, she said, hoping
that the Washington summit was only "delayed."
</P>
<P>
Reaffirming Paris' support for the U.S. peace proposal, she
said the setback should not discourage the partisans of peace in
Israel and Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process had been ground to a standstill
for more than a year because of the continued launching of Jewish
settlements in defiance of opposition from the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel has stubbornly insisted on a less than 10 percent land
concession from the occupied West Bank area which was seized by
Israel during the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
The April London three-party summit between Israel, Palestine
and the U.S., which aimed at revitalizing the peace process,
failed with no progress in sight.

BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Experts have advocated that a state
standard should be set as soon as possible for the release of
harmful nitrogen and oxygen compounds from kitchen stoves to
protect people's health.
</P>
<P>
In a recent seminar on residential environment, a group of
experts warned that nitrogen and oxygen compounds, in a gaseous
form mainly created from cooking, have become a significant threat
to family members' health.
</P>
<P>
"It will have a strong negative influence on one's liver,
kidneys and lungs; it can even cause death," one of the experts

He said that due to the lack of awareness only a few countries

<HEADLINE> Seoul Stock Down to New Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Seoul stock
market plunged to a new low Monday, with the composite index
tumbling to below 370 points.
</P>
<P>
The composite index fell 13.18 points to close at 361.58,
within 30 minutes of the opening bell, the lowest since December
24, 1997, when it stood at 351.45 points.
</P>
<P>
The new low was blamed on a domestic labor strike, delay in
national corporate restructuring, and the continued political
instability in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume was tepid with 39.31 million shares worth 236.05
billion won (169.45 million U.S. dollars) changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Losers outnumbered gainers by 724 against 104, with 49 others
remaining unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Insurance, electric machinery, pharmaceuticals and securities
issues were the hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predicted a further drop as South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung on Sunday warned against more rises in unemployment and a
slash in international credit ratings for the local banks.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean won also weakened to 1,393 won against the
dollar Monday, down from the last weekend's closing of 1,387.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Improves Supply of Fertilizers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Supply of chemical fertilizers
has been better and more timely now in Nepal, a predominantly
agricultural country, the official RSS news agency said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shortages of chemical fertilizers have been a chronic problem
in Nepal, hindering agricultural development. The situation began
to improve after the government last December provided the
industry with subsidies and allowed the private sector to procure
and sell fertilizers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned Agriculture Inputs Corporation in the past held
a monopoly over the fertilizer market in the country.
</P>
<P>
The RSS said a large quantity of fertilizers has been or will
be imported very soon.
</P>
<P>
"We are now capable of supplying quantities of fertilizers as
demanded by the farmers and have introduced a system of renewing
stocks every month so that there will be no shortage," an official
with the Agriculture Ministry was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
An Agriculture Perspective Plan, introduced last year with a
view to reducing poverty through boosting agricultural output,
estimates that demand for chemical fertilizers this year is
208,000 metric tons, the RSS said.

<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>

the West Bank that the United States has set as the threshold for
resuming peace negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>

<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- The Federal Aviation Administration Sunday ordered all older

country as airplanes were removed from service.
</P>

both Chinese people and Latvians.

Krasts, and expressed his appreciation to the Latvian government

<HEADLINE> Iranian Minister Pledges to Support Press Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Minister of Culture and
Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani on Monday pledged to support
the freedom of press and defend all the press according to laws.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after inaugurating the Fifth
Press Exhibition here, Mohajerani said his ministry will respond
strongly to harsh attitudes toward the country's mass media,
particularly violent attacks on newspaper offices.
</P>
<P>
The offices of several moderate and leftist newspapers were
stormed by rival groups and even policemen last month. The latest
were the attacks last Tuesday and Wednesday by a group of 30 to 40
people on the distribution office of the Jameah (Society)
newspaper in Rasht, northern province of Gilan.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani stressed that it is the duty of his ministry to
defend all the press according to relevant laws, and to offer more
facilities and assistance to promote the status of the press.
</P>
<P>
He put the aggregated daily circulation of newspapers in the
country at 2 million, which he said was far from enough compared
with the population of 60 million.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, the ministry, which oversees the
mass media, has issued permits to 1,055 publications across the
country, including 40 daily newspapers. Some 500 publications are
on display at the six-day press exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of lifting the ban on receiving
satellite television programs, the minister denied there was a
complete ban and said Iranian television should improve the
quality of its programs to attract the people.
</P>
<P>
The Majlis (parliament) passed the ban on receiving satellite
programs on January 1, 1995. However, since the moderate
government of President Mohammad Khatami came to power last
August, small satellite dishes have mushroomed.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Polls "Generally Peaceful": Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Commission on
Elections (Comelec) said Monday that the just-concluded voting for
national and local elections was "generally peaceful and orderly"
despite reports of election-related violence incidents.
</P>
<P>
After the voting ended in most parts of the country at 3 p.m.
(07:00 GMT), Comelec commissioner Teresita Dy Liacco said the
commission had yet to receive reports of "unfortunate" incidents.
</P>
<P>
However, commissioner Evalyn Fetalino disclosed that a failure
of elections had been declared in seven towns in Lanao del Sur
province, five towns and cities in Maguindanao province and four
precincts in Lanao de Norte province, with 144,000 people failing
to vote.
</P>
<P>
"We have reports that Comelec officials in Davao declared
failure of elections," Fetalino said, adding that the Comelec has
the right to schedule a special election in the above areas.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that two people were shot dead in Lanao del Sur
by a group of unidentified armed men while waiting at a mini-bus
station to deliver ballots to precincts.
</P>
<P>
A third person was shot dead early Monday near his residence in
Claveria town, Masbate province in the north, bringing to 39 the
death toll in election-related violence since January this year.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the past elections including the two held in 1992
and 1995, Monday's polling was arguably the most peaceful and
orderly in the country's election history.
</P>
<P>
In the 1992 general elections, over 100 people were killed in
election related violence, while in the 1995 senate elections, 210
people died.
</P>
<P>
To ensure "honest, peaceful and orderly elections," the
government has identified 425 towns and municipalities as
"sensitive areas" where a total of 116,000 troops and policemen
have been deployed.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the confirmed reports of failure of elections,
massive vote buying, missing of voters' names, disfranchisement
and double registrations of voters were also reported in central
Mindanao, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Voters confirmed to police officials that leaders of at least
three gubernatorial candidates in the province were paying voters
from 300 pesos to 400 pesos (about 10 U.S. dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
Despite these hitches, the elections were generally held in an
"orderly and peaceful manner," the Comelec said. It estimated that
80-85 percent of the 34 million registered voters turned out and
voted in the polls.
</P>
<P>
At stake in Monday's polls are president, vice president, 12
out of 24 senators, 260 members of the House of Representatives
and more than 17,000 local officials and local councilors.
</P>
<P>
The counting of votes has begun immediately after the voting
ended. An exit poll released by a private radio station DZRH
showed that vice President Joseph Estrada, candidate of the Laban
ng Makabayang masang Pilipino (Fight of Patriotic Filipinos
Masses), led the other 9 presidential candidates by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, 36.1 percent of the 13,491 voters
surveyed said they voted for the 61-year-old former movie star.
</P>
<P>
After casting his vote in a Manila suburb precinct, Estrada,
surrounded by a large crowd of supporters, predicted that he would
win the election by "a landslide victory."
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 presidential candidates, Estrada and House Speaker
Jose de Venecia were widely seen as the two major contenders. De
Venecia was anointed by President Fidel Ramos as the standard
bearer of the ruling Lakas-NUCD party.
</P>
<P>
In a survey released just before the election day, Estrada got
a 33 percent popularity rating, followed by de Venecia with 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
The final official results of the polls are not expected to be
known for about four weeks.

<HEADLINE> Jiang: Healthy, Stable, Overall Sino-Bulgarian Ties Expected (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China treasures its ties with
Bulgaria and is ready to bring a healthy, stable and comprehensive
Sino-Bulgarian cooperative relationship into the coming century,
Chinese President Jiang Zemin said here today.
</P>
<P>
In talks with visiting Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov,
which was held in a frank and fruitful way, the two leaders had an
in-depth exchange of views on bilateral ties and on international
issues of mutual interest, and reached wide-ranging consensus.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he believes the ongoing visit by Stoyanov will
further deepen the traditional friendship between the people of
both countries and push this relationship to a new height of
overall development.
</P>
<P>
"China and Bulgaria are friendly nations and the friendship
between the two people can be traced far back, and we treasure
this traditional friendship," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria was the world's second country to establish diplomatic
ties with the People's Republic of China, Jiang said, adding that
in recent years, both sides have undertaken fruitful cooperation
in various fields, and understood and supported each other in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We're satisfied with the development of bilateral ties," Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the reason bilateral friendly cooperation developed so
smoothly under new circumstances and on a new basis is that both
sides can go beyond their differences in ideology and value
conception, and respect each other on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
Both nations have no conflicts of substantial interests;
instead they share common interests in many sectors, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining Sino-Bulgarian friendly cooperation caters to the
trend in global development and is in the fundamental interests of
the people of both countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov said his government values its friendly cooperative
ties with China, adding he is here in China with the goodwill to
strengthen the bilateral relationship.
</P>
<P>
He said Bulgaria is watching closely the great economic
achievements made by China and its important role in handling the
southeast Asia financial crisis, which Bulgaria appreciates.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian government has a positive attitude toward
Bulgaria-China relations and, under new circumstances, it is very
important to tighten this relationship, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Stoyanov said he hoped his current trip would help increase
understanding between Bulgaria and China, draw from China's
experience in its reform and opening-up and enhance mutual
cooperation in a bid to promote bilateral friendly cooperative
ties.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that his government supports the "one China"
policy and will not establish official relations nor undertake
official contact with Taiwan, with which Jiang expressed
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral economic and trade ties, Jiang said the Chinese
government treasures such ties with Bulgaria. Both nations are
undertaking economic reforms and each other's economic and trade
systems are also undergoing drastic change, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China is ready to make concerted efforts with
Bulgaria to expand trade, and take full advantage of the two
nations' mixed committee on economic, trade, scientific and
technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should also positively explore a variety of
economic and technological cooperation, and strengthen exchanges
in an effort to promote bilateral economic and trade relations, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov said he agreed with Jiang on that point, and his
country is willing to collaborate with China to tighten
cooperation and make progress in their relations.
</P>
<P>
On the international situation, Jiang said the overall trend is
toward detente, while peace and development are still the two main
topics of the world.
</P>
<P>
Multiple centers of power are becoming more obvious, he
continued, and various countries differ in social system, values,
developmental levels, history and tradition, religious beliefs and
cultural background.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that people of these countries are entitled to
choose their own social system, road of development, and way of
life, which cater to the needs of their own countries.
</P>
<P>
The world is colorful and diverse, and this is a reality which
should be respected, he said, adding that various countries should
seek common grounds while preserving differences, live in peace
and promote concerted development.
</P>
<P>
While mankind is approaching the 21st century, he said, all
countries should make joint efforts to establish a peaceful,
stable, just and fair international political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two leaders also briefed each other on
their respective countries' political and economic circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Jiang presided over a ceremony to honor his
Bulgarian counterpart, who arrived here Sunday for a six-day state
visit at Jiang's invitation.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, the two presidents signed a joint statement in
the wake of the talks, and attended a signing ceremony for four
other documents, including an agreement on veterinarians'
cooperation, a 1998-2000 cooperation plan on culture, science and
education, an agreement on posts and telecommunications
cooperation, and a 1998-1999 working plan on cooperation between
China's State Intellectual Property Office and Bulgaria's patent
office.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday Stoyanov is expected to meet Li Peng, chairman of
China's National People's Congress Standing Committee, and Premier
Zhu Rongji before leaving for a visit to Shanghai and Zhuhai.
</P>
<P>
This is Stoyanov's first visit to China since he became
Bulgaria's president last year.

<HEADLINE> China Strengthens Control on Cereals Enterprise Account </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC)
issued a circular today demanding stricter control on the account
of enterprises purchasing and storing cereals, cotton and edible
oil.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the PBOC said that the circular aims to support
the on-going reform of the grain circulation system and
prevent any diversion of funds earmarked for the purchase of
cereals, cotton and edible oil.
</P>
<P>
The circular regulates that enterprises purchasing and storing
cereals, cotton and edible oil must get licenses from the local
branches of the PBOC before they open accounts in banks.
</P>
<P>
It demands that all branches of the PBOC and the Agricultural
Development Bank (ADB) should strengthen their control on the
accounts of those enterprises, and make regular inspections on the
conditions of their accounts.
</P>
<P>
According to the circular, enterprises using cereals, cotton
and edible oil purchasing loans from the ADB must open their
deposit accounts in the ADB, and their settling business can only
be handled through their accounts in the ADB.
</P>
<P>
Cereals, cotton and edible oil purchasing and storing
enterprises should not open any accounts in financial institutions
other than the ADB, unless they have ratification from the PBOC.
</P>
<P>
The circular also includes punishing methods for malpractices
by the related enterprises and financial institutions in opening
accounts.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government made public last week its plan to carry
out fundamental reforms on the country's grain circulation
system.

<HEADLINE> Suharto: Asian Economic Crisis May Cause World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Suharto warned
here on Monday of a recession of the world economy if the Asian
economic crisis is not overcome.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the opening session of the eighth summit
of the Group-15, he said that since the world financial sector is
deeply integrated, the effect of the Asian financial turmoil can
spill over beyond the region.
</P>
<P>
Due to a decline of exports to Asian countries, the trade of
the European Union (EU) is expected to contract by 0.4 percent in
1998, the Indonesian president said, adding that the EU has to
revise downward its projections for the annual economic growth
from 3 percent to 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Suharto strongly urged intensified international cooperation to
contain the impact of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The three-day summit of the G-15 developing countries from
Africa, Asia and latin America will seek ways of cooperation to
promote economic development of the member states and a dialog
with industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
On South-South cooperation, he called on the members of the
G-15 to capitalize on the immense potential of the group.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 countries together accounts for 10 percent of the
world trade and the combined investment of the grouping has
reached 17 percent of the total investments of the developing
countries, but the investments within the group is limited,
according to Suharto.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian leader expressed hope that effective and
regular consultations will be held between developed and
developing countries to deal with marco-economic policies and the
management of the globalization process to equitably benefit all
nations.
</P>
<P>
The G-15, established in 1989, also includes Algeria,
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, India, Jamaica, Kenya, Malaysia,
Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Senegal, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Armed Robbers Raids House of Former Nigerian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A gang of 12 armed robbers raided
the house of former Nigerian Head of State, General Olusegun
Obasanjo last Friday, injuring his wife and carting away a
certain amout of cash and value properties.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said on Monday that the robbers raided
Obasanjo's house in Abeokuta, capital of Ogun State in
southwestern Nigeria at around 2:00 a.m., last Friday.
</P>

the house had stopped coming several months ago.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo's wife was hit on the head with an object by the
robbers in the operation, which lasted more than one hour.
</P>
<P>
The loss of cash and properties was estimated to be more than
one million Naira (about 85 Naira equal to one U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The case is being investiaged by the police, with no arrest
made so far, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo ruled Nigeria from 1976 to 1979. He is currently

<HEADLINE> China's Industrial Production Slows in January-April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China generated an industrial added
value of 608.7 billion yuan during the first four months of 1998,
up 7.9 percent over the same period last year. However, the margin
is down 3.5 percent on an annual basis, according to a monthly
report released by the State Statistical Bureau (SSB) today.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the readjustment in enterprises and government's
limit in inventory volume, China's industrial sector suffered a
shrinking domestic demand and decrease in exports.
</P>
<P>
In April, industrial sales went up by 2.8 percent over the same
period in 1997, while the export volume was up 7.2 percent. Both
margins are lower than the average in the first three months
of this year, said the SSB report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the state-owned sector turned out an industrial
added value of 94.1 billion yuan, up 2.8 percent on an annual
basis. The collectively owned sector grew by 6.4 percent, with the
added value hitting 41.7 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the added value of light and heavy industries stood
at 74.1 billion yuan, up by 6.7 percent over the same period last
year. Heavy industry is gaining momentum, generating an increase
of 7.7 percent in added value, up one percentage point over the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The SSB report shows that the year-on-year profit decrease
margin in Chinese enterprises dropped from 83 percent of the
January-February period to an average of 58 percent for the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
However, the country is far from resolving all the difficulties
in the sweeping enterprise reform, the report said.

<HEADLINE> G-7 Countries' Stance on Iran Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Mahmoud Mohammadi has blamed some of the G-7 countries for
continuing criticism of Iran over the sensitive issues of
terrorism, human rights and weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The English language newspaper Iran News reported on Monday
that Mohammadi Sunday expressed regret that certain G-7 states
maintained their "old mentality about international developments."
</P>
<P>
"Although the foreign ministers of the eight industrialized
countries (of G-7) in their statement have adopted a more
realistic approach compared with the past, they have failed to
heed the realities of the Islamic Republic of Iran appropriately,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 foreign ministers in their Saturday statement welcomed
"encouraging political development" in Iran, but calling on it to
halt support to groups that use violent means against the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
They also urged Tehran to improve human rights of all
citizens, condemn terrorism and remove the threat to the British
writer Salman Rushdie who was sentenced to death by late Iranian
supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini for his controversial
novel "The Satanic Verses."
</P>
<P>
The G-7 also called on Iran to respect international
agreements it has signed regarding weapons of mass destruction
and called on other countries not to provide Tehran with the means
to develop such weapons or missile capabilities.
</P>
<P>
In a response to the G-7 statement, the foreign ministry
spokesman expressed surprise that the G-7 foreign ministers
repeated "unfounded claims of the past," saying that Iran's
stances toward international issues are transparent and comply
with international laws.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Exports, Imports Decline in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's exports declined 13.2
percent in April 1998 as compared with the previous month while
its imports dropped 12.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to provisional figures released recently by the
Federal Bureau of Statistics (FBS), the country's exports during
April stood at 686 million U.S. dollars as against 790 million
dollars in March, showing a decrease of 13.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the 684 million dollars in April last year,
however, the exports in April this year recorded an increase of
0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, exports during the past 10 months of the current
financial year (July 1, 1997, to June 30, 1998) totaled 7.13
billion dollars as against 6.8 billion dollars during the
corresponding period of the previous year, indicating a rise of
4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
During April this year, the export of rice fell substantially
by 52 percent to 39,988 dollars from 83,493 dollars in March.
</P>
<P>
The export of textile manufactures also went down to 408.81
million dollars from 486.46 million dollars, showing a drop of 16
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the FBS figures showed that imports in April
decreased by 12.3 percent to 661 million dollars from 754 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The figure for April also indicated a decline of 31.1 percent
as compared to 960 million dollars of imports in the same month of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Imports between July 1997 and April 1998 totaled 8.45 billion
dollars as against 9.71 billion dollars a year earlier, showing a
decrease of 12.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The fall in imports in April was primarily due to a decline in
the imports of wheat, tea, palm oil and other food products.
</P>
<P>
The export and import targets set by the Pakistani government
for the current financial year are 9.57 billion dollars and 11.9
billion dollars respectively.

<HEADLINE> Car Consumption Growth Urged By People's Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily today urged the
central government to gear up its efforts for developing the
automobile industry, one of the chosen growth points for the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that the number of cars owned by individuals
grew explosively in the past decade to 2.897 million in 1996, more
than 10 times that of 1985.
</P>
<P>
Beijing alone has about 400,000 cars owned by individuals.
</P>
<P>
However, the newspaper pointed to many obstacles which prevent
more individual car owners. One of the obstacles is that cars are
priced above the average family's income level despite several
recent rounds of price-cutting by Chinese auto manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Numerous fees and charges, which amount to 14 percent of a
car's price in Beijing and 25 percent in some other cities, also
hinder the development of car sales to individuals, the article
said.
</P>
<P>
With exports facing fierce challenges due to the Asian
financial crisis, China has decided to increase domestic demand to
ensure hitting the 8 percent economic growth rate set for this
year.
</P>
<P>
With the housing sector expected to become a strong economic
growth area, the car industry is likely to follow suit, the
newspaper reasoned.
</P>
<P>
When someone buys a new house in the suburbs, he would then
have to ponder -- "car or no cars, that's the question," stated
China's most influential newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"After having an aerial view of the consumption history of some
advanced countries, housing and car consumption were always linked
together," said the report. "It is hard to imagine someone
wouldn't plan to buy a car after buying a presentable apartment in
the suburbs."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper then noted that even when cars are affordable for
ordinary Chinese, there would be no place to park them.
</P>
<P>
China's cities, which were constructed without anticipating the
pressing needs of the car industry, were urged to make the
necessary changes caused by an increased reliance on automobiles.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Earns $44 Million from Cotton Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Zambia earned 44 million U.S.
Dollars from line cotton exports last year, the Export Board of
Zambia (EBZ) has said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Business Mail, EBZ Acting Executive
Director Johnson Mwenya stressed the need for the people in the
country to work hard to improve its cotton production as the crop
is a major foreign exchange earner.
</P>
<P>
From January to March this year, Zambia's lint cotton export
earnings are 4.6 million Dollars, but the figure is expected to
grow to beat last year's 44 million Dollars because of the good
rainfall during the just ended season, the newspaper Monday
quoted Mwenya as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Since most areas where cotton is grown in the country
received favorable amount of rainfall, there's going to be high
yields and thus exports will increase," said Mwenya.
</P>
<P>
He commended cotton farmers for having formed an association,
a step, he said, is in the right direction toward the efforts to
increase cotton production.
</P>
<P>
The association, set up last week, aims to promote and enhance
cotton production in the country.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Open New Stock Exchange Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will soon open a new stock
exchange in its new capital Abuja, Finance Minister Anthony Ani
has said.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you that in the next couple of weeks the Abuja
Stock Exchange of will be officially commissioned," the minister
said at a lecture in Lagos at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Ani disclosed that the government has already approved the sum
of one billion Naira (about 12 million U.S. Dollars) paid up
capital for the stock.
</P>
<P>
Half of the sum will be contributed by the Central Bank of
Nigeria, the state insurance company NICON and other selected
government parastatals, Ani said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria currently has a stock exchange in Lagos called
Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), which has about 183 listed
companies and six trading floors in Kaduna, Port Harcourt, Ibadan
and other major cities.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government approved the establishment of the
Abuja Stock Exchange last year with the aim of introducing
competition in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
The idea is resisted by the NSE, which contended that a new
trading floor might be far more than enough for the lull stock
market.

<HEADLINE> G-8 Ministers Seek "Credible Transition" in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria again came under
international focus at the weekend amidst a flurry of diplomatic
posturings.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from the Group of Eight who met in London
Saturday asked Nigeria to undertake "credible transition" to
civil rule, which they insisted must allow the opposition to
campaign freely, the Guardian reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Pro-democracy and human rights groups in Nigeria have been
criticizing the military administration's transition to civil
rule program for lack of democratic procedures.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations have been staged in the country especially
after the five registered political parties adopted about three
weeks ago the current Head of State, General Sani Abacha, as
their sole consensus candidate for the August 1 presidential
polls.
</P>
<P>
However, the G-8 foreign ministers, drawn from Britain, the
United States, Germany, France, Canada, Italy, Japan and Russia,
stopped short of condemning the presidential elections, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain, which had been more vocal in their views
on Nigeria, held a separate meeting at the weekend on the
situation in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
They reportedly agreed to hold further consultations on what
steps to take.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two countries have been accused by Nigerian
Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi of plotting to stir up violence in
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi dismissed the idea that either a low turn out or the
absence of opposition candidates could invalidate the elections.
</P>
<P>
Simultaneously, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said
Commonwealth ministers might meet soon to decide on applying a
limited package of sanction agreed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the European Union have already started
considering whether to step up existing limited sanctions on
Nigeria, including a ban on sporting links and visa for senior
officials.
</P>
<P>
They have also reportedly suggested that the U.S., which buys
half of Nigeria's oil export, should impose an oil embargo on it.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria William Twaddell ruled out
the possibility last week of the oil embargo from his country at
least for now.
</P>
<P>
The action may not hit the "right target", he argued.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Stresses Israel's Security Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Monday stressed that Israel would determine its
security needs by itself, saying that security is the foundation
of peace.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to over 50 mayors from around the world, who are
convening here for the annual Jerusalem Conference of Mayors,
Netanyahu noted that Israel is a small country, but faces a "very
large enemy" as well as terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
The "enemy" is an apparent reference to Arab neighbors
demanding Israel to return lands it seized from Arabs during wars.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel will determine the scope of its troops'
second pullback in the West Bank without compromising the security.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister added that the London talks, in which the
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met separately with
Israelis and Palestinians last week, had made some progress.
</P>
<P>
He said the related parties will continue to work in a bid to
end the interim accords between Israel and the Palestinians, and
launch the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks just after the U.S. canceled the
Washington talks, which were originally scheduled for Monday,
because Israel refused to accept its peace proposal, calling for
Israel to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinians during the second withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israel has insisted that any further redeployment of more than
9 percent would damage its national security interests.
</P>
<P>
However, local newspaper The Jerusalem Post reported on Monday
that the U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross, who wrapped up
his latest round of peace efforts in the region Sunday night, had
worked out a compromise with Netanyahu on the next redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The details of the compromise were not known. But the report
quoted Israeli sources as saying that according to it Israel will
first withdraw from 9 percent of the West Bank during the second
pullback, while an additional 4 percent of territory will be
transferred until the Palestinians fulfill their commitment to
fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
So, the report added, Netanyahu and Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat are expected to meet in
Washington within the next two to three weeks.

<HEADLINE> Jones Ready to Shock World in Fastest Women Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, China, May 11 (Xinhua) -- American Marion Jones,
world's fastest woman who clocked 10.79 seconds two days ago in
Japan, said she is ready to improve her personal best in the
world's fastest women challenge to be started in Chengdu, a
Southwestern city of China tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
"I believe I am able to run 10.60 seconds right here tomorrow,
I am in superb form, the track is fast and the atmosphere is
exciting," said the 22-year-old world champion, whose personal
best is 10.76.
</P>
<P>
Jones, who arrived here Sunday afternoon, flexed her muscles at
the 30,000-seat Chengdu stadium and looked in perfect shape.
</P>
<P>
"The track seems pretty good, I can definitely lift my personal
best in this big race tomorrow. The press conference this morning
was the biggest ever for me, and people here are very friendly,"
added the basketballer-turned-sprinter.
</P>
<P>
Coach Trevor Graham said the weather condition could be an
ideal one if the workers dried up the rain-soaked track. "I think
the 10.60 is not a big problem for Marion, she can run even faster
than that this time," the Jamanican coach said seriously.
</P>
<P>
Jones said she regards China's Li Xuemei as one of her main
opponents in the springting world. "She ran a 10.79 personal best
last season, and she did pretty well last month with a 11.01. This
time the race will be held at her hometown, so I believe she will
bring out her best. With a strong field summoned up for this race,
the results will be quite impressive."
</P>
<P>
Jones' agent Mark Wetmore said the American has set her eyes at
a new world record and has asked about whether the one million
Renminbi (about 120,000 U.S. dollars) bonus for a new world record
is serious or not.
</P>
<P>
Wetmore said if everything goes perfect, a new world record is
not a dream.
</P>
<P>
Li, who slightly injured her right knee last month, said Jones
has an obvious edge over her.
</P>
<P>
"Now I am not nervous any more. I know Jones is very strong and
faster than I, but I just want to concentrate on my own race
tomorrow. I can post a sub-11-second mark and won't disappoint the
home crowd."
</P>
<P>
Hoever, Li's coach Zhang Rongwei signaled in a low note, saying
Li is able to run around 11.10. "We didn't let the race occupy all
our hearts. The most important competition for her will be the
Asian Games this December. Li lacks international experience, but
this season we have planned to take part in several meetings in
Europe," said the soft-spoken Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Over 250 Chinese journalists and TV crew are flying into the
city to cover the eye-popping event.

LAGOS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- About five persons were feared dead
and 40 others seriously injured in a bloody clash between
students and villagers over the weekend in southwest Nigeria's Osun
State.
</P>
<P>
The action, according the Post Express Monday, was sparked off
by a traffic accident last Thursday when a commercial driver ran
into some students of Osun State College of Technology.
</P>
<P>
One of them was killed while two others were injured and
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
In a swift reaction, some students were said to have set the
vehicle ablaze, with the driver taking to his heels.
</P>
<P>
Then armed indigenes of the Esa-Oke town, where the driver
lives, stormed the campus and allegedly attacked the students
with guns and machetes in what appeared to be a retaliatory move.
</P>
<P>
The state government has closed down the school with immediate
effect and students have been ordered to proceed on indefinite
holiday, said the report.
</P>
<P>
With some 500 anti-riot policemen being drafted to the town,
normalcy has returned to the area.
</P>
<P>
The police only confirmed the death of one farmer in the
clash.

CAIRO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori
Monday called for further South-South cooperation to give stronger
support for the development drive of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori issued the call here in his speech on behalf of the
Latin-American members of the G-15 at the opening of the eighth
summit of the group.
</P>
<P>
He said that cooperation among countries which do not have
great resources must be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
"In Latin-America, we are now fully aware that regional
integration is one of the essential tools in order to advance in
our economic and social development and to ensure a better quality
of life for all our people," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We need the integration of groups of developing countries in
order to improve their capacity to face the challenges of an
increasingly competitive world," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "we must realize that our developing
countries, having societies not fully integrated, require national
as well as regional strategies to work more effectively for
development."
</P>
<P>
Fujimori also talked about the negative effects of the economic
globalization on developing countries. "Globalization should not
be imposed, nor should we passively allow it to come upon us."
</P>
<P>
"Globalization should not lead to frustration for anyone. on
the contrary, it should be the path to follow as to accelerate
development in our countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial turbulence, South-South cooperation and
South-North dialog are high on the agenda of the three-day summit.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of Senegal, Indonesia, Algeria, Zimbabwe and Kenya,
the vice presidents of India, Brazil and Argentina and other
leaders of the G-15 are present at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 summit will allow the leaders to take stock of the
recent world economic developments and formulate a unified stand
for the bloc.
</P>
<P>
As a grouping of developing countries from Latin America,
Africa and Asia, the G-15 was founded in 1989 with the aim of
promoting economic and trade cooperation among the member states
and boosting cooperation among developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The organization retains its name since Kenya became its 16th
member in 1997, joining Egypt, India, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Algeria, Nigeria, Senegal, Zimbabwe, Argentina, Brazil, Chile,
Jamaica, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.

<P>
The new housing reform plan will give full consideration to the
gaps and differences existing in the wages of workers and staff
and in housing prices between cities of various regions, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, various cities are allowed to determine their
own basic and standard housing prices, which will be affordable
for common residents. Meanwhile, rational housing subsidies will
be given to cadres and workers and staff in line with their
official ranks and academic titles.
</P>
<P>
Under the new housing reform plan, the newly-built affordable
housing projects will be sold to residents only. The workers and
staff have to purchase houses by themselves by using the housing
subsidies, public housing fund and loans.
</P>
<P>
The old public-owned houses can be both sold or rented to
residents, but with the former as the main. The housing rents will
be greatly raised.
</P>
<P>
As for workers and staff in extremely poverty, they may still
enjoy the government's low-rent houses.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that after purchasing their own houses, the
residents in general will be able to pay off loans in some 10 to
20 years.
</P>
<P>
According to experts with the Housing Reform Office of the
State Council, when the housing allocation is commercialized, the
proportion of the public housing fund will further rise to around
30 percent, which will help stimulate the housing
commercialization.
</P>
<P>
The officials and experts here noted that the new housing
reform plan will greatly promote the residents' housing
consumption, which will play a strategic role in readjusting
economic structures and will guarantee the sustainable and sound
economic development of the country.

<HEADLINE> China to Stop Welfare Housing Allocation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A new housing reform plan targeting
at commercializing housing allocation instead of being as a welfare
is expected to be published soon and is scheduled to go into
effect on July 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
By then, the country's low-rent welfare housing allocation
system, which has been running for nearly 50 years and
characterizing the planned economic system, will be put to a full
stop.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the 1950s, workers and staffs in various Chinese
government institutions and enterprises have enjoyed government
housing allocation as a welfare by paying extremely low rents.
</P>
<P>
The government had to put in a huge amount of capital yearly
for housing construction and maintenance, resulting in huge
financial burdens for the country.
</P>
<P>
However, housing shortage became worse, leaving more and more
residents in acute housing shortage.
</P>
<P>
Starting from the early 1980s, China has piloted housing
reforms in some cities trying to convert the welfare housing
allocation system to commercialization of housing allocation,
under which residents have to buy their own houses with the help
of government subsidies and loans.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming housing reform plan, after serious deliberation
and soliciting opinions from various aspects, centers on
commercializing housing instead of allocating houses to residents
as a welfare. It means converting part of the welfare into
housing funds which will be contained in salaries.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Economy Improves: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Contrary to the gloomy picture
painted by the country's manufacturers last week, Nigeria's
Finance Minister Anthony Ani has given a more optimistic review
of his country's economy in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
In a lecture delivered at the weekend in Lagos, the minister
said the country's inflation rate fell from 8.5 percent at the
end of last year to 6.5 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
Also in the first three months, the country's external reserve
increased from 7.7 billion U.S. Dollars to 8.4 billion Dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Nigeria has recorded an in-flow of
foreign investment worth of eight billion Dollars since 1994,
while its external debt stock was reduced from 32.58 billion
Dollars in 1995 to the present 27.08 billion Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Ani hailed the economic policies introduced by the government
of General Sani Abacha in the last few years, including those in
the curtailment of extra-budgetary expenditure and budget
deficit, debt management, sanitation of the banking sector and
trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that it is now still too early to assess
most of the measures that have been undertaken. "We are dealing
with structural problems...we cannot expect quick results," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Manufacturing Association of Nigeria in its half year
(July-December 1997) report published last week complained of
shockingly low capacity utilization, growing stock of unsold
goods and rising unemployment.

<HEADLINE> Australia Sees Big Rise in Overseas Students Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Australia will reap as much as 2.9
billion U.S. dollars a year from overseas students in the year
2001 as traditional Southeast Asian markets are replaced by India
and the Americas, Australian Education Minister David Kemp said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kemp released a federal government analysis showing growth
would mostly be in universities, with the major sources being
India, Europe, Vietnam, China and the Americas.
</P>
<P>
The total number of overseas students is expected to increase
from 151,464 last year to 181,000 in 2001, a 19.5 percent jump, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The growth is expected to come mainly in 2000-2001, with 1998
showing relatively little growth, and is projected to push the
total revenue from overseas students from 2.09 billion U.S.
dollars in 1997 to 2.9 billion U.S. dollars in 2001, Kemp said.
</P>
<P>
The estimates showed students from India would increase by 94
percent to 10,800 in 2001, while those from the Americas would
jump by 147 percent to 9,500.
</P>
<P>
The number coming from Vietnam would rise by 50 percent, from
China by 39 percent and Europe 99 percent, but no details were
given.
</P>
<P>
The number of students from Indonesia would fall 8.7 percent,
from South Korea 19.3 percent and Taiwan 17.3 percent, the
minister said, citing the financial crisis in Asia as one of the
major reasons for the decline.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government would also provide 13 million U.S.
dollars over the next four years for an international marketing
campaign, and its marketing arm, Australian International
Education Foundation, would be renamed Australian Education
International.
</P>
<P>
Kemp said the campaign would focus on Asia and untapped markets
in order to minimize the impact of the Asian currency downturn on
student numbers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, university estimates released to the Australian Vice
Chancellors' Committee showed the effective number of full-time
overseas students was expected to rise by 8 percent this year to
56,929.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested for Coal Mine Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Three persons who are suspected
of being responsible for the April 6 coal mine explosion in
central China's Henan Province have been arrested by local public
security officers.
</P>
<P>
The explosion in three shafts near the city of Pingdingshan
claimed the lives of 55 people.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, the accident was the result of
carelessness arising out of a fight between mine operators to
claim a larger share of resources. The three shafts, which were
connected, were unlicensed and the operators were involved in
illegal mining beyond allotted areas, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
To get more coal, they set off dynamite in one shaft to block
it but the explosion spread to the other two, they said.
</P>
<P>
The mine owners, Lei Guowei, Yang Zhiyuan and Li Jianwei, went
into hiding after the accident, but Yang and Li were found soon
afterwards, and Lei, who had sneaked into Zhejiang Province in
east China, was arrested on May 9.

<HEADLINE> Australia Designates Sept. 5 Information Economy Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Australia Monday declared
September 5 its National Information Economy Day in a bid to
promote the potential of information economy.
</P>
<P>
Australian Information Economy Minister Richard Alston said the
decision is part of the Australian government's major public
awareness campaign on information economy.
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased to announce that (the National Information Economy
Day) will take place on 5th of September, with a wide variety of
activities and events around Australia," Alston told reporters in
Melbourne, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
"It will link government, business, community and consumer
groups, educational institutions and as many individual
Australians as possible in a coordinated program to make people
aware of all that's involved in the information economy, make them
realize that, like it or not, it's coming, and you might as well
get on board."
</P>
<P>
Having been encouraged by the success of the United States in
information industry in recent years, the Australian government
has vowed to be at the forefront of the information age in the
coming century.

Alston said the newly-established National Office for the
Information Economy would also conduct a large corporations
awareness program to make chief executives and top industry bodies

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Near 11-Year Lows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar Monday
continued its downward slide to near-11-year lows, dragged half a
U.S. cent lower by continued negative sentiments.
</P>
<P>
The local unit closed at 63.36 U.S. cents, down from 63.83 on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
A trader from National Australia Bank said the malaise of
recent sessions was still weighing on the local currency.
</P>
<P>
"It is an extension of the negative sentiment we have had for
four to five days now, ever since we broke down from the 65.25
U.S. cent level," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hefty selling at the outset from U.S. and Swiss banks brought
the Australian dollar down to 63.22 U.S. cents, near the 11-year
low of 63.15 U.S. cents recorded in January.
</P>
<P>
That level saw the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) intervene in
the foreign exchange market to buy the local currency.
</P>
<P>
Societe Generale Economist Glenn Maguire said the RBA is not
necessarily going to intervene if the Australian dollar breaks its
lows.
</P>
<P>
It would depend on whether they feel the fall is
"self-reinforcing" as the RBA described the move back in January,
he said.
</P>
<P>
At the close, the Australian dollar was traded at 83.98
Japanese yen, from 84.77 on Friday, and at 1.1202 Deutsche marks
from 1.1308 marks.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A dramatic earnings downgrade at
Australia's third largest telecommunications company AAPT Ltd.
featured heavily in an otherwise quiet pre-budget trading day
Monday on the Australian stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
Australian Associated Press Telecommunications (AAPT) Ltd.'s
share price was hammered in afternoon trading as investors took
fright at the implications of revised earnings forecast for 1998.
</P>
<P>
It featured as the main trading focus in a day of light volumes
which saw the all ordinaries index climb 17.1 points to 2,797.6 in
a rise which followed Wall Street's stronger showing Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Volume was pretty light and other than gold being up on Friday
night, which has boosted our gold sector a bit, the market was not
all that convincing," Steve Mayne from Nevitts said.
</P>
<P>
"The turnover reflected the budget due out tomorrow night as
people wait to see how it impacts some sectors," he said.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index lifted 23.8 points to 4,817.4, with
improvements spreading relatively broadly.
</P>
<P>
While Australia's dominating telecommunications company
Telstra's interim receipts were the top-traded stock, closing
steady at 3.65 Australian dollars, its smaller competitor AAPT
slumped 28 cents, or 8 percent, to 3.22 Australian dollars after
its earnings downgrade.
</P>
<P>
In a sign of just how tough telecommunications companies are
finding competing with Telstra, AAPT said its 1998 calendar year
earnings would be more than halved compared with its prospectus
forecast.
</P>
<P>
AAPT floated in November last year, just ahead of Telstra's
float on November 17.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, among the banks Monday, ANZ bank continued the
recent strength with a 19-cent rise to 11.41 Australian dollars
while National Australia Bank dropped 17.4 cents to 22.215
Australian dollars after last week's rises following its half-year
profit results.
</P>
<P>
Westpac improved 10.9 cents to 10.719 Australian dollars
following its share buyback announcement Friday and the
Commonwealth bank added six cents to 19.01 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index improved 12.8 points to 1,182.6
following a slight rise in base metal prices.
</P>
<P>
Global miner Rio Tinto was 29.3 cents higher at 21.53
Australian dollars, BHP rose 18.5 cents to 14.38 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold index jumped 30.3 points to 1,324.6 as the bullion
price rose 1.90 U.S. dollars to 300.30 U.S. dollars per ounce in
late afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 258.52 million shares at a value of
467.93 million U.S. dollars, with rises outnumbering falls 591 to
519.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Continue Tight Fiscal Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Monday that the government cannot
deviate from the current tight and prudent fiscal measures so as
not to burden the country with large debts.
</P>
<P>
"We can't shift from applying tight fiscal measures... whatever
relaxations that we allow are meant to keep economic activities
going," Anwar, who is also finance minister, told reporters after
meeting Indonesian Finance Minister Fuad Bawazier here.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the reality of the country's current economic
problems would require careful spending.
</P>
<P>
Unless this picture was clearly given, ministries and
departments, with no exception, would submit demands for urgent
allocations, he said, adding nonetheless, specific relaxations
from the tight fiscal measures for low-cost housing, education and
health would be allowed.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the projected deficit in this year's budget will be
small and manageable and will not disrupt stability and long term
economic management.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said he would provide more details about
the projected deficit in Parliament or in a special statement at a
later date.
</P>
<P>
"I believe we can proceed now with registering a small deficit
and at the same time cater for the vulnerable community," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar made a statement Sunday that Malaysia would not be able
to register a surplus budget this year, unlike last year with 6
billion ringgit (about 1.579 billion U.S. dollars) surplus, due to
the current economic woes.
</P>
<P>
To a question on whether the government would review the
projected growth rate of between 2.5 and 3 percent for this year,
Anwar said it would not do so at this stage and added "We have
looked up until April ... it (the growth) is still comfortable, in
fact, even revenues have not dropped drastically."
</P>
<P>
However, he said the national income would be lower because
companies were hit by the slowdown and the corporate tax collected
would be less than previously.

<HEADLINE> Restructuring in China Means Nationwide Personnel Movement (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese government restructuring,
based on a decision of the newly established cabinet, is expected
to trigger another round of nationwide personnel movements.
</P>
<P>
A number of large enterprise groups in developed coastal
provinces like Guangdong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang have been asking
ministries for more senior personnel. And representatives of some
enterprises in the interior are now in Beijing looking for
personnel.
</P>
<P>
In early March, during the First Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress, the chairman of the board of Guangdong's Weida
Medical Equipment Group came to Beijing looking for people. When
they heard of this, Jiangsu's Huaxi Group, and Guangdong's
Jianlibao and Meidi groups followed suit to join the competition.
</P>
<P>
Government officials from Zhejiang's Wenzhou, which is famous
for the rapid development of privately-run enterprises, and
Yangzhou in nearby Jiangsu, also came to Beijing to try to
persuade senior ministerial personnel to work in their cities.
</P>
<P>
Even foreign-funded ventures in Beijing, Shanghai, and some
other big cities are looking for resumes of civil servants of
various ministries in order to get the people they want. Big
enterprises are offering higher salaries and houses in Beijing for
senior personnel.
</P>
<P>
The State Council's institutional restructuring program was
adopted in March 10 by an overwhelming majority at the third
plenary meeting of the First Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress and cut the number of State Council's
departments from 40 to 29.

<TEXT>
<P>
More than 17,000 State Council civil servants will have to look
for new jobs by the end of this year, as "institutional
restructuring" brings about new personnel movement, according to
Prof. Lu Guotai of the People's University's Labor and Personnel
Affairs College.
</P>
<P>
He says that civil servants are expected to go from government
offices to enterprises, from big cities to small ones or even to
rural areas, and the interior is expected to become a major
destination.
</P>
<P>
China has seen several big personnel moves since 1978, when the
reforms and opening up began. In the early 1980s, the Shenzhen
Special Economic Zone and some other coastal cities took the lead
and a large number of people with education sought jobs there.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s, the restructuring and personnel reforms have
increased. So far, some 2,000 personnel exchange agencies have
been established nationwide and more than one million people are
changing their jobs annually.
</P>
<P>
The move is significant because it will result in a more
efficient, well-coordinated system, and large savings of
administrative funds, and will provide a large number of senior
personnel for enterprises in China's western areas.
</P>
<P>
Analysts estimate that well over a million civil servants at
various levels will be looking for new jobs in the process of
institutional restructuring. Many of them are Ph.D.s or graduates
or senior engineers. Because they have worked in government
policy-making offices for a long time, they understand policies
and regulations and have relations with many important departments.
</P>
<P>
Most of the civil servants in departments that are cutting jobs
are optimistic, especially the young and the specialists.
</P>
<P>
A 26-year-old man at the State Oceanic Administration, now a
department of the Ministry of Land and Natural Resources, says
that any new job may be a good chance to start something new, and
that the new job may make better use of his talent.
</P>
<P>
Another senior official at the former Ministry of Machinery
Industry says that, with his professional credentials and
administrative skills, he is not afraid of looking for a job at
home.

<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng has said that China and
Sweden complement each other in their economies and have conducted
sound cooperation in the economic and trade sector.
</P>
<P>
Shi made the remarks while meeting here today with Anders
Sundstrom, Swedish Minister of Industry and Commerce,
</P>
<P>
Many Swedish enterprises are investing in China and
participating in China's economic construction, Shi said, and this
has improved bilateral trade ties.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that Swedish enterpreneurs' visit here will
play a positive role in developing bilateral economic and trade
ties.
</P>
<P>
Shi discussed China's economic development, its policy on
foreign investment, and economic and trade cooperation between
China and the EU.
</P>
<P>
Sundstrom said he appreciates China's progress in economic
construction and in avoiding the effects of the Asian financial
crisis and that he hopes to further improve bilateral cooperation
in infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade was worth 1.8 billion US dollars in 1997, up
2.9 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Sweden is China's 7th largest trading partner in the EU and had
291 projects with China, worth 170 million US dollars at the end
of last September.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: G-15 Says South-South, South-North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of developing countries
attending the G-15 summit Monday said the southeast Asian
financial crisis underlined the need of South-South, South-North
cooperation in the world economy system.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the inauguration speech at the three-day summit
here, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said the crisis is an apt
example of the interdependence of world economy.
</P>
<P>
"The inadequacies of individual countries or of the
international financial system should serve us to draw the
appropriate lessons," which will shape the South-South and
South-North dialogs, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This episode (Asian financial crisis) has shown us the
weaknesses of our global system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Calling for cooperation between the northern rich countries and
their poor counterparts in the south, Mubarak said a structured
dialog has become essential for the proper management of the world
economy.
</P>
<P>
Developing and industrial countries should share the burdens
and benefits of the economic globalization, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also voiced confidence that the financial crisis in
Asia will pass and "stronger and more robust economies will
emerge."
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial turbulence, South-South cooperation and
South-North dialog are high on the agenda of the three-day summit.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president said the summit will serve to boost the
South-South cooperation in the face of world challenges.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian President Suharto said in his speech at the summit
that his country, which is at the core of the crisis, is committed
to economic reforms under the aid package of the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
"The economic crisis adversely affected not only the economy
but also the social structure," he said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the crisis to a lack of openness in the global
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Suharto said the damage to the economies of his country and
other former Asian "tigers" could have wide repercussions.
</P>
<P>
"If these economies were not quickly rehabilitated, the entire
region could soon be severely affected," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of Senegal, Peru, Indonesia, Algeria, Zimbabwe and
Kenya, and the vice presidents of India, Brazil and Argentina are
present at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 summit will allow the leaders to take stock of the
recent world economic developments and formulate a unified stand
for the bloc.
</P>
<P>
As a grouping of developing countries from Latin America,
Africa and Asia, the G-15 was founded in 1989 with the aim of
promoting economic and trade cooperation among the member states
and boosting cooperation among developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The organization retains its name since Kenya became its 16th
member in 1997, joining Egypt, India, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Algeria, Nigeria, Senegal, Zimbabwe, Argentina, Brazil, Chile,
Jamaica, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> Writethru-2: Voting Ends in Philippines Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Voting ended Monday afternoon in the
Philippines for the national and local polls and it was arguably
the most peaceful and orderly in the country's election history
despite some sporadic election-related violence incidents.
</P>
<P>
After the voting ended nationwide at 3 p.m. (07:00 GMT),
officials of the country's Commission on Elections (Comelec)
announced on a local television station that Monday's elections
were peaceful in most parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Only in some precincts, mainly in the southern Philippine
island of Mindanao, "a failure of elections" was declared, they
said.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the more than 34 million registered
Filipino voters were reported to have gone to the polls to elect a
new president, a new vice president, 12 out of 24 senators, 260
members of the House of Representatives and more than 17,000 local
officials and local councilors.
</P>
<P>
The counting of votes, which has already begun in many
precincts, is being conducted mainly by thousands of election
officials and public school teachers.
</P>
<P>
The Comelec, the only government agency overseeing the
elections, has pledged to come out with the official election
results within three to four weeks. In the 1992 elections, vote
counting took five weeks.
</P>
<P>
Only the votes in the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao
(ARMM), where a computerized election system was implemented
Monday, are counted by machine.
</P>
<P>
According to an early exit poll conducted by the private radio
station DZRH, Vice President Joseph Estrada, candidate of the main
opposition, had a commanding lead in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The poll said 36.1 percent of the 13,491 it surveyed in Manila
and several other major cities said they voted for Estrada, more
than double his nearest rival.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the House of Representatives Jose de Venecia of the
ruling party had 18 percent, followed by Senator Raul Roco and
former Cebu governor Emilio Osmena with 12.5 percent each.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia was the choice of outgoing President Fidel Ramos who
must step down on June 30 when his single
constitutionally-mandated six-year term ends.
</P>
<P>
When casting his vote in a Manila suburb precinct, the
61-year-old Estrada, a former movie action star who has led in all
pre-election opinion polls, again predicted he would win the
election by "a landslide victory."
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 presidential candidates, Estrada of the LAMMP (Fight
of Patriotic Filipino Masses) and De Venecia of the Lakas-NUCD
(National Union of Christian Democrats) were widely seen as the
major contenders.
</P>
<P>
Three people have been reportedly killed in two
election-related violence incidents on the election day Monday,
bringing the death toll from such incidents to 39 since January.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the previous two elections held in 1992 and 1995,
Monday's polls may be the most peaceful and orderly in the
country's election history.
</P>
<P>
In the 1992 general elections, over 100 people were killed in
election related violence, while in the 1995 senate elections, 210
people died.
</P>
<P>
One of the three killed was a local political leader who was
shot dead early Monday morning near his residence in Claveria
town, Masbate province in the northern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The other two fatalities were campaigners of a local candidate
in Malabang, Lanao del Sur province in Mindanao. They were shot
dead by a group of unidentified armed men while waiting at a
mini-bus station to deliver ballots to precincts.
</P>
<P>
Also in Lanao del Sur province, a failure of elections was
declared by election officials in eight towns after election
inspectors and poll watchers, who were supposed to distribute
ballots in various precincts, went missing since early Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, massive vote-buying and some cases of ballot
snatching were reported in Masbate province.
</P>
<P>
Voters confirmed to police officials that leaders of at least
three gubernatorial candidates in the province were paying voters
from 300 pesos to 400 pesos (about 10 U.S. dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
In other parts of the country, including Manila, voting was
conducted in an orderly manner, except for some delays in some
precincts due to technical hitches, such as missing of voters
lists and election documents.
</P>
<P>
In San Nicolas, Pangasinan Province, protests led by an
incumbent mayor prevented election officials from distributing
election documents and materials, leading to a long delay in the
voting.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, an official of the election commission had
predicted an election failure in many parts of the country,
particularly in the Southern Mindanao, where ballot-rigging would
spark large-scale violence.
</P>
<P>
To ensure an "honest, peaceful and orderly election," the
government has identified 425 towns and cities in the country as
"hot spots," or violence-prone areas, and deployed 116,000
government troops and policemen in these areas.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Election Commission Defies Exit Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Commission on Elections
Chairman Bernardo Pardo said here Monday that the exit polls may
cause confusion and cast doubts in the credibility of the May 11
elections.
</P>
<P>
Pardo said the exit polls which would be carried out by a local
broadcasting corporation may run counter to the unofficial tally
of the votes cast by the National Citizens Movement for Free
Elections (NAMFREL), a private election watchdog.
</P>
<P>
Exit polls involve the random selection of a voter who had just
left his or her voting precinct. The voter, in turn, is
interviewed as to who he or she voted for.
</P>
<P>
Pardo said that with the exit polls, results may be announced
selectively in favor of certain candidates and could pre-condition
the minds of the public as to who is winning or losing.
</P>
<P>
"These polls could give the misimpression to some candidates
and to the public. We just hope it will not lead to confusion and
trending," Pardo said.
</P>
<P>
The Commission on Elections tried to stop the local
broadcasting corporation and other groups from conducting the exit
polls, but the Supreme Court last Saturday issued an order to
allow the conduct of the polls.
</P>
<P>
The commission has authorized the NAMFREL to conduct an
unofficial quick count of the voting results. The NAMFREL said it
would release its result in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The official count and canvass of the votes by the Commission
on Elections will be announced by Congress and the commission
about four weeks later.
</P>
<P>
About 27 million registered voters went to the polls Monday to
vote for a new president, a vice president, 12 out of 24 senators,
all 260 members of the House of Representatives and thousands of
local officials.
</P>
<P>
The voting ended as of 3 p.m. (0700 GMT) and the counting of
the votes has started in the country.

<HEADLINE> Serious Water Shortage hits Vietnam Nationwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The hot weather caused by the El Nino
phenomenon is posing a severe water shortage nationwide in
Vietnam, the Vietnam News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The situation is especially serious in the central region, the
central highlands of Tay Nguyen and the east of Nam Bo in southern
Vietnam, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Although several showers came in early April with an average
rainfall ranging between 20-50 mm in northern, central, central
highlands and eastern Nam Bo Provinces, they did little to ease
the rapid reduction of river and stream water flows, said the
Department of Water Management under the Agriculture Ministry.
</P>
<P>
River water levels dropped by 50-150 cm compared with the
annual average. People in central provinces will be the hardest
hit as the monsoon season will not come to the region until
September, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The government has called for anti-drought measures to ensure
water supplies for domestic and agricultural use, to control the
intrusion of saline water in coastal areas, as well as to speed up
the construction of irrigation works.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Announces Huge Loan to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has announced that it
would provide a loan of 250 million U.S. dollars to Indonesia
which was waiting for the balance of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) bailout package to be released to revive its economy.
</P>
<P>
Making the announcement in Cairo, Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Indonesia would repay the loan to Malaysia
once the IMF released the balance of its rescue package, according
to a report by the Malaysian national news agency Bernama Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Indonesia urgently needed the assistance as its
economy was in a dire state and student riots had broken out
following the withdrawal of subsidies on fuel prices, which was a
condition for the IMF package.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's loan to Indonesia was a "bridging finance," Mahathir
told a news conference at the end of his three-day official visit
to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He said the World Bank had pledged 3 billion U.S. dollars to
Indonesia as the balance of the IMF bailout package but the amount
would be disbursed in three phases of 1 billion U.S. dollars each.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia hopes to get 3 billion U.S. dollars and hence it has
to get the bridging finance. They will get another portion from
Japan and Australia," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, like Indonesia, was hit by the financial crisis in
the region with the value of its currency -- the ringgit -- having
depreciated by about 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
To a question on whether Malaysia as Indonesia's nearest
neighbor was "very alarmed" by the situation in Indonesia with
student riots and some of the demonstrators being shot dead last
week, Mahathir only replied,
"We cannot interfere in our neighbor's affairs but we will help as
much as we can."
</P>
<P>
On how far the current economic downturn would affect Malaysia
such as in terms of operating expenditure and the budget for next
year, Mahathir said this had not been fully determined.
</P>
<P>
"How bad it will be we have not determined. But certainly it
will have an effect. If we notice, our companies are no longer
declaring their profits as they used to do. Hence if they are not
making profits, the government also cannot collect tax," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Turkey to Discuss Caspian Oil Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. and Turkish officials and
oil experts are to meet here late this month to discuss the
planned Baku-Ceyhan pipeline aimed at transporting the abundant
Caspian oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. delegation, which might be headed by
U.S. Secretary of Energy Federico Fabian Pena, is to hold talks
with Turkish officials from May 25 to 27 on the issue, local
newspaper Daily News on Monday quoted Turkish Energy Ministry
Undersecretary Yurdakul Yigitguden as saying.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation will be composed of officials and experts
from the U.S. Department of State, Department of Energy as well as
Department of Commerce, said Yigitguden.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish side is expected to brief the U.S. delegation on
the talks among Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia regarding this
issue, as well as ask for information about some U.S. companies,
such as UNOCL and Bechtel, which are expected to participate in
the project.
</P>
<P>
The projected pipeline from Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the
southern Turkish city of Ceyhan, which has 468 kilometers in
Azerbaijan, 225 kilometers in Georgia and 1,037 kilometers in
Turkey, is crucial to the three countries' energy industry.
</P>
<P>
If completed, the pipeline is expected to have a capacity of
transporting 45 million tonnes of oil per year and the figure
might be further raised in future, according to a report prepared
by an expert team.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, as an energy-starving country, has been playing an
active role in exploiting the Caspian oil resources to meet its
quickly increasing energy demands and to earn foreign exchange
through the pipeline that passes through its territory.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., whose many oil companies are involved in the Caspian
oil exploitation, gives firm support to the Baku-Ceyhan scheme
backed by Turkey, Azerbaijan as well as Georgia.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Massive vote-buying and some cases
of ballot snatching were reported Monday in the northern
Philippine province of Masbate when voters elected a new president
and other elective officials.
</P>
<P>
Voters confirmed to police officers that leaders of at least
three gubernatorial candidates in the province were paying voters
300 to 400 pesos (about 10 U.S. dollars) each, the Philippine News
Agency said.
</P>
<P>
At least three cases of ballot snatching, which has yet to be
confirmed by the police, were also reported.
</P>
<P>
In Claveria town in the province, a local political leader was
gunned down early Monday morning, bringing the death toll from the
election-related incidents on the election day to three.
</P>
<P>
The victim was abducted by unidentified armed men and shot in
the head near his residence.
</P>
<P>
The other two deaths were two election campaigners shot dead by
a group of unidentified gunmen in Malabang town in the southern
province of Lanao del Sur. Six others were wounded in the
incident.
</P>
<P>
In Paoay town in the northern province of Ilocos Norte, two
polling precincts were bombed at 1 a.m. local time Monday, said
General Santiago Alino, chief director of the Philippine National
Police (PNP).
</P>
<P>
Nobody was hurt in the bombing incident and the balloting was
moved to other places, he said.
</P>
<P>
But officials of the country's Commission on Elections
(Comelec) said in Manila that the elections were generally
peaceful in most parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the presidential race, nearly 70,000 candidates
are running for more than 17,000 other elective positions
nationwide.

<HEADLINE> International Training Program Ends in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A 10-day international training
program designed to train enviromental decision-makers
ended here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Leadership for Environment and Development (LEAD) training
session, which ran under the theme ''Exploring Links Between the
Environment and Sustainable Development'', is focused on
enviromentally sustainable and socially equitable use of
resources.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was attended by 200 managers from over 40
countries, is part of a multiple-stage international training
program, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The participants studied a number of situations and proposed
policy alternatives that promote sustainable development. They
also visited several locations in Nyanga of east Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to mark the conclusion of the meeting, Zimbabwean
Lands and Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai said major
environmental concern in the country included deforestation, land
degradation, habitat and bio-diversity loss and problems of urban
expansion at the expense of agricultural land.
</P>
<P>
He said the underlying causes were high population growth
rates against poor economic performances, one of the problems
which dated back to colonial era when the majority of people were
restricted to marginal and unproductive areas.
</P>
<P>
''As a result many people were forced to over-exploit the
delicate environment in search of a living causing serious
degradation. Most of the areas the majority of people are
located are fragile and unsuitable for any meaningful economic
activities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Kangai said that since independence, the government had
embarked on several programs in an effort to tackle development
issues and environmental problems.

<HEADLINE> Prospects for Use of Overseas Investment in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Chen Bingcai, a researcher of the
State Development Planning Commission's Foreign Economics
Institute, was quoted in today's "Economic Daily" as saying
that the prospects for use of overseas investment in China is
bright.
</P>
<P>
The amount of international capital will increase in China with
economic globalization, especially the paper-money economy and the
investment of this capital will also increase, Chen said, adding
that the use of overseas funds in China is likely to continue to
increase.
</P>
<P>
China's continued adapting to the world economy, the
development of relations with the West, and the improving
investment environment are favorable conditions for increased
overseas investment in China.
</P>
<P>
China has guaranteed domestic economic safety and the
short-term and long-term safety of overseas investment and will
keep improving laws and policies on overseas funds, while
increasing standardization of enterprise performance and guiding
the use of overseas investment to make sure it is safe in China
and conducive to China's industrial development.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of overseas investment in China may go down in
the short run because of negative effects internationally like the
Asian financial crisis, the development of the Euro, and the
changing domestic environment where preferential treatment is
changing from one based on capital scale to one based on
technology and market potential.
</P>
<P>
But, as Chinese market prospects continue to look encouraging,
overseas investment will adjust and the improved use of overseas
investment will cover losses from a diminished amount of overseas
investment and eventually improve the competitiveness of Chinese
enterprises and the overall economic competitiveness and strength
of China.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Hire Foreign Judges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is to hire foreign judges
to help dispose off a back-log of cases, a senior Ugandan
official has said.
</P>
<P>
But information is not available as to which countries the
judges will come from.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Gidudu, the high court registrar in charge of
research and training, was quoted by The New Vision newspaper
Monday as saying that the plan is expected to cost 1 billion
Uganda Shillings (1 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
"We have a backlog of cases in the courts but we do not have
enough staff to handle them. This makes it difficult to dispose
of cases in time and prisoners stay on remand much longer," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, he added, all cases of people on remand will
have been handled by September 1999.
</P>
<P>
This stop-gap plan is expected to last till the ban on
recruitment in the public service is lifted.
</P>
<P>
There has been growing concern over congestion in prison cells
caused by a delay to dispose of cases due to understaffing in the
judiciary of the country.

<HEADLINE> French Non-Governmental Delegation Visits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A seven-member non-governmental
delegation from France has completed a two-day tour of Palestinian
refugee camps in southern Lebanon, preparing to organize a march
on Saturday in Paris in support of Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Daily Star newspaper published Monday quoted Georges
Labica, a member of the delegation, the first of such kind from
France in recent years, as saying that after visiting the camps,
they have recognized the "injustices inflicted on Palestinian
people and the stripping of their basic human rights."
</P>
<P>
"In France, the Israeli embassy is celebrating the 50th
anniversary of its creation and our president and other public
figures are taking part. For us, the anniversary commemorates the
loss of the Palestinians' land and homes," he said at a news
conference here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel declared an independent state on May 14, 1948,
more than 700,000 Palestinians have been forced to flee their
homes. Most of them are living as refugees in neighboring Arab
countries under the financial support from an United Nations
agency on Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
To counteract the influence of the Israeli lobby in France, a
group of people from France and the Arab world is organizing a
march scheduled for Saturday in Paris.
</P>
<P>
"The Marche pour la Palestine" is aimed at turning Europe's
attention to the Palestinian plight and demanding their right to
return home, Labica said.
</P>
<P>
"The unconditional support in France for Israel is very
strong. But we think something new is happening," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that French newspapers began to write about what the
Palestinian supporters are doing and why, adding that the group
has also collected 1,000 signatures in support of their campaign,
some of them from Jews.
</P>
<P>
On its return to France, Labica said, the delegation will visit
President Jacques Chirac and members of the French parliament to
brief them on what they saw about the Palestinian situation in
Lebanon.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Disfranchisement, double
registrations, non-appearance of election inspectors and
accidental switching of ballot boxes delayed the conduct of
Monday's elections in some areas in Central Mindanao, the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Some 285 voters in two precincts in Cotabato city were deprived
of their right of suffrage after a fire hit a portion of the
school where their records of registration were kept. The regional
commission on elections failed to conduct special registration for
them.
</P>
<P>
Missing names of voters were also noted in the towns of
Midsayap, Kabacan and Matalam in North Cotabato province. Reports
said many voters just went home and did not bother to look for
their names in other polling precincts.
</P>
<P>
In Shariff Aguak, Maguindanao province, voting started almost
three hours behind schedule as the ballot boxes intended for the
area were switched to other towns in the province.
</P>
<P>
The voting started at 7 a.m. local time (2300 GMT Sunday) all
over the country and ended at 3 p.m.(0700 GMT Monday). Counting of
the votes has started, but the final official results will come
out about four weeks later.
</P>
<P>
In Domolondong and Masiu in Lanao del Sur province, failure of
elections was reported due to the failure of election inspectors
and poll watchers to appear at their assigned voting precincts.
</P>
<P>
Just minutes before the closing time, there are still some
areas in Central Mindanao which have yet to open the polling
precincts due to the said problems.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Commission on Elections confirmed the reports,
saying voters who failed to vote may cast their ballots later
Monday or the following day.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Not to Restore Self-Regulation Near Japanese Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will not reinstate its
self-imposed off-limits regulation for its fishing boats near
Japanese territorial waters, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and
Trade said Monday.
</P>
<P>
This is seen an apparent response to a report that Minister for
Foreign Affairs and Trade Park Chung-soo is ready to announce
South Korea's restoration of the self-regulation when he visits
Japan late this month to prepare for re-negotiations over revising
the 1965 fishery agreement signed by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We have never officially start to consider of reintroducing
the self-imposed off-limits and Minister Park's visit to Japan
late this month has nothing to do with the reinstatement," said
Lee Hoi-jin, spokesman for the ministry.
</P>
<P>
On January 23 this year, Japan announced its unilateral
termination of the 1965 fishery accord after two years of
negotiation between the two nations over revision of the accord
produced nothing.
</P>
<P>
A few days after Japan's unilateral move, South Korea recanted
its self-regulation near Japanese waters.
</P>
<P>
However, on March 21 this year, the two countries agreed to
re-open negotiations in April on revision of the fishery treaty
when Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi expressed "regret" for
his nation's unilateral act during his visit in South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Why China's Exports Continue to Increase (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese exports grew by 12.8
percent to reach 40.1 billion US dollars worth in the first quater
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Although the growth rate was eight percentage points less than
that of last year, the development has laid a foundation for China
to achieve the 1998 goal of 345 billion US dollars worth of
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
In the first three months, general trade reported a 9.2 percent
increase and processed goods grew by 14 percenth.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to low labor costs and the stability of the Chinese
currency, which was not affected by the Asian financial crisis,
processed goods maintained their competitiveness, but general
trade export was affected to a greater extent by the devaluation
of Southeast Asian currencies and its exports grew less than the
average.
</P>
<P>
Exports of industrial goods saw higher growth and accounted for
89.3 percent of China's total in the period, but exports of raw
materials were down.
</P>
<P>
Textile and garment exports continued to grow.

<HEADLINE> China's Exports (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a result of the Asian financial crisis, some Asian countries
reduced their imports and China's exports to Asia were worth 22.65
billion US dollars in the period, an increase of only 4.2 percent,
far lower than the average. Exports to Japan, the Repubic of
Korea, and ASEAN countries were all down.
</P>
<P>
Export to Europe, North and South America, and Africa were up
by more than 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although Asia remains China's major importer, exports to it
have dropped from over 70 percent at the beginning of the 1990's
to less than 60 percent now, while those to Europe and America
have grown year by year. This shows that the market
diversification strategy of China has yielded some results and that
the country no longer relies entirely on the Asian market.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say that exports of China this year still face
serious difficulties, though the economies of some Asian countries
affected by the financial crisi have shown improvement.
</P>
<P>
They suggest that China increase the processed goods trade,
improve its trade structure by exporting more value-added
products, and further explore the international market.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Voting Relatively Peaceful, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Voting in the Philippines' national
and local elections Monday proved relatively peaceful and orderly,
but uncertainties will remain at least until the election results
come out and are accepted by all the candidates.
</P>
<P>
During the polling day, shooting, bombing and other incidents
and violence have been reported in some parts of the country,
especially in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
But compared with violence in the previous elections, Monday's
incidents could be described as "minor."
</P>
<P>
In the 1992 national and local elections, over 100 people were
killed, while in the 1995 senate election, 210 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Although over 30 people have been killed since January, the
situation in the 1998 election period was comparatively stable.
Monday's voting might be called the most peaceful and orderly in
the country's history of elections.
</P>
<P>
The peaceful conduct of voting could be attributed to the
efforts made by the government, which deployed 116,000 troops and
policemen in violence-prone areas across the country.
</P>
<P>
The commitment made by all the political parties to hold
peaceful elections also promoted the orderly voting.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the positive role played by President Fidel Ramos,
who is barred from a second term by the constitution, could not be
ignored.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the election, Ramos invited all the presidential
candidates and their running mates to a breakfast meeting, at
which they signed a Statement of Affirmation on Honest, Orderly
and Peaceful Elections with the president as a witness.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Filipinos are not only expecting the peaceful
conduct of the voting, but also the honest counting of votes.
</P>
<P>
If vote-rigging incidents take place, political chaos will be
unavoidable, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Now, six years after the 1992 presidential elections, some
candidates are still claiming that they had "won the voting but
lost in counting" in the presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
During this election, the voters choose a new president, a vice
president, 12 out of 24 senators, 260 members of the House of
Representatives, 1,600 mayors and other local officials.
</P>
<P>
Two days before the election, six of the ten presidential
candidates claimed that they had already won the polls and the
only thing they had not done is to wait for the outcome of the
elections.
</P>
<P>
It seems that none of them has prepared for his or her defeat
in the race, at least in public.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest opinion polls, Vice President Joseph
Estrada from the opposition Partido ng Masang Pilipino (Fight of
Patriotic Filipinos Masses) drew 33 percent of the votes, and
Speaker Jose de Venecia from the ruling Lakas-NUCD (national union
of Christian democrats trailed second with 15 percent of the
votes.
</P>
<P>
Other front runners in the presidential race include former
Manila mayor Alfredo Lim, Opposition Senator Raul Roco and
businessman Emilio Osmena.
</P>
<P>
As so many candidates are running in the presidential race,
none of them can get the majority support, and a dark horse might
emerge in the contest, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The Commission on Elections estimated that the official results
of the polls may not come out in less than two weeks. During the
period, everything, including vote-rigging and
vote-counting-related violence, could happen, observers said.
</P>
<P>
Even after the winner is announced, there are still
possibilities that other candidates might reject the outcome.
</P>
<P>
This is not only likely to happen at the national election
level, but also at the local election level.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, analysts said that political uncertainties may
remain in the Philippines until a new government is formed at the
end of June.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Raised in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Pressed by capital shortage,
commercial banks in Vietnam have no other option but to raise the
interest rates, the Vietnam News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rates are being increased to 0.9-0.95 percent for six month
deposits and 1.05-1.1 percent for 12 month deposits, according to
the English-language daily.
</P>
<P>
The commercial banks in the country are facing severe capital
shortage this year, contrary to the situation of last year when
the banking system accumulated huge capital stocks but had few
borrowers.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the banks adopted record low interest rates of
0.7-0.8 percent for deposits of between nine and 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the retail price index was low at 4.5 per cent
earlier this year and the country's economic slowdown is starting
to affect financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Raising interest rates is not likely to please borrowers, said
the daily in a report, adding that if the economic slowdown
continues, banks will be in even deeper trouble.

MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Two polling precincts in a northern
Philippine province were bombed hours before Filipinos voters

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: G-15 of Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Eighth Summit of the Group of 15
(G-15) opened here Monday with the aim of promoting South-South
cooperation and activating South-North dialog.
</P>
<P>
The Summit Level Group for South-South Consultation and
Cooperation known as the G-15 came into being during the Ninth
Non-Aligned Summit in Belgrade in September 1989.
</P>
<P>
As a group of developing countries from Latin America, Africa
and Asia, the G-15 was founded with the aim of boosting economic
cooperation among the member states as well as developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
The organization retains its name after Kenya became its 16th
member in 1997, joining Egypt, India, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Algeria, Nigeria, Senegal, Zimbabwe, Argentina, Brazil, Chile,
Jamaica, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
The setting up of the G-15 coincided with the beginning of what
is now commonly referred to as globalization of the world economy,
and the group emerged as a response to the challenges and
opportunities it poses to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the G-15 countries have been in the throes of
global integration and have adopted South-South cooperation in the
sub-regional, regional and trans-regional context as a viable
strategy for serving their interests.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 members, accounting for 30 percent of the world's
population and 27 percent of land area, represent the emerging
economies of the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
They have been trying to expand their intra-trade, investment,
technology transfer and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Inter-trade exchange among the G-15 countries represented about
9 percent of their overall trade volume which amounted to about
796 billion U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Their total gross domestic product makes up 39 percent of the
third world and exports, 31 percent of the developing countries'
total.
</P>
<P>
The first and last G-15 summits were held in the Malaysian
capital Kuala Lumpur in 1990 and 1997.

<HEADLINE> Disease Kills Over 1,300 Cattle in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 11 (Xinhua) -- At least 1,300 cattle have died of
trypanosomiasis, black leg and other cattle diseases in the
tsetse infested Zambezi Valley in north Zimbabwe and the
northeastern districts.
</P>
<P>
This has heightened fears of a tsetse fly re-invasion of areas
along the border with Mozambique, The Herald daily reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Veterinary Services has quickly swung into
action, mounting some 70,000 baits in affected areas and spending
about 1.7 million Zimbabwean Dollars (100,000 U.S. Dollars) on
insecticides in the hope of detecting and exterminating the
disease-carrying fly.
</P>
<P>
Another 500,000 cattle in other areas are facing a serious
threat from red water, January disease and other tsetse-related
diseases.
</P>
<P>
There are growing fears, however, that large tracts of farming
land which had been cleared of the tsetse fly could be re-invaded
by the fly from neighbouring Mozambique where there are no
effective tsetse control programs.
</P>
<P>
In an interview in Harare at the weekend, Stuart Hargreaves,
Director of the Department of Veterinary Services, said the
tsetse fly is still a major threat to animal husbandry in the
Zambezi valley.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Introduces Market Mechanisms for Coal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The coal industry in northwest
China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region witnessed a profit upsurge
in the first quarter of this year due to the introduction of a
market-oritented system.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ning, director of the Ningxia Coal Administration,
said the region's coal industry currently operates on the basis of
market changes. The region produced and sold 16 million tons of
coal in 1997, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
The coal industry in Ningxia, one of China's major coal
producers, had operated on a loss-making basis since the
mid-1980s due to the region's limited railways transportation
capacity and obsolete technology and equipment.
</P>
<P>
However, the sector reversed its loss-making history in
1996. Its pretax income increased to 182 million yuan in 1997, up
40 million yuan on 1996.
</P>
<P>
Chen said coal enterprises in Ningxia laid-off 2,400-odd miners
during 1997, and the average annual income for miners rose to
8,876 yuan, up 9.28 percent on 1996.

<HEADLINE> World Champion Jones Laid on High Hopes to Break World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, Sichuan Province, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The women's
100-meter world record of 10.49 seconds set by Griffith Joyner has
stood there frimly for 10 years, but today few believe it will
last too long.
</P>
<P>
Just because there has been another American Marion Jones.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old basketball-turned-sprinter, who arrived here on
Sunday to take part in Tuesday's Topsonic International Flying
Woman Challenge, looks set to win the race along with a remarkable
time.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps to win the race need 10.76 seconds (her personal
best), but maybe 10.49 will be appreciated a lot tomorrow,' she
halfjoked at a news conference on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Joke is Joke, but there is little doubt that setting a new
world record is just a matter of time for the rising star.
</P>
<P>
Turning to track and field just two years ago, she had showed
how short ime for a cinderrella need to become to swan.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996 U.S. Trials, Jones, who just left basketball court
for track, failed to make the U.S. Olympic team because of an
injury. In the national trials for the World Championships last
June, she emerged to become the most glittering star in the United
States, clocking the fifth best time in history of 10.92.
</P>
<P>
The lengend continued when she brought home the women's 100m
gold in the world championships in Athens with an unblievable
time of 10.76. the second best time in history only after the
world record of 10.49.
</P>
<P>
"My secret is hard work,' Jones said, indicating there is no
shortcut behind her success.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, she set a year-best time of 10.79 seconds to
prevail in the Grand Prix in Osaka, Japan, proving she had been
ready to win the Flyilng Women Challenge, first of its kind in the
world.
</P>
<P>
"She is sure to break the world record, but not now, it is not
the right time," said her coach Graham, but he claimed that it
will not be difficult to register a time of 10.60 for Jones.
</P>
<P>
But Jones herself might be patient enough to wait for the day
to come, "I cannot put the day on when the world record will be
broken," she said. "I only want to try best tomorrow to put up a
successful performance."
</P>
<P>
Everybody knows that basketball is more popular in the United
States than track and field, which has gone downhill since Carl
Lewis retired. But Jones, who led her North Carlolana University
to the title of national university basketbhall championships,
cherished special love on track and field instead of basketball.
</P>
<P>
"Track is her first love," Coach Graham said.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps not only the track, but the field. The double world
champion, a member of the winning U.S. 4x100m relay team in the
world championships in Athens, has showed she was a born jumper
after winning the long jump event in last years' world
championships trials and got a nickname of "Woman Carl Lewis".
</P>
<P>
Early last week, she returned to the field in Japan by long
jumping a fabulous 7.05 meters. The best women athlete of the year
in 1997, is now believed to repeat Carl Lewis' achievements to win
four gold medals in one Olympic Games, and on the other hand to
help improve the status of women's athletics.
</P>
<P>
"I hope to compete at the 2000 Olympic Games in 100, 200, long
jump and maybe 4x100m relay, but who knows whether i can win?" she
said.
</P>
<P>
"For so long, the attention has been placed on the male
sprinters and male athletes and I think it's about the time for
women to get the recognition to deserve the sport," she
said. "It's wonderful for IAAF to consider me that Woman of the
Year, I deserve it."

<HEADLINE> Elections Postponed in Southern Philippine Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine police Monday postponed
elections in eight towns in a southern Philippine province after
election officers went missing and left precincts without ballots,
local television reports said.
</P>
<P>
Municipal officers in these towns in Lanao del Sur province in
Mindanao were supposed to distribute election materials to
precinct clerks, but they went missing early Monday, Police
Superintendent Bagumbaran Barraocor was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Barraocor said officials had already declared a
"failure of elections" in these areas. But he declined to comment
on why these election officers went missing.
</P>
<P>
Also in the province, an earlier report of the Philippine News
Agency said more than 1,000 fully armed men of the Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF) are roaming in at least nine towns to
instill fear among voters.
</P>
<P>
Abdulgani Marohombsar, provincial chairman of the National
Movement for Free Elections (Namfrel), was quoted as saying these
affected towns are Molondo, Buadi Puso Buntong, Tugaya, Lumbatan,
Kapai, Dumalundong, Ganassi, Masiu and Lumba Bayabao.
</P>
<P>
Marohombsar said these armed members of the former rebel group
are in a mere show of force and at the same time battling for "no
elections" in the area.
</P>
<P>
"They definitely do not want elections to take place," he said.
</P>
<P>
MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari earlier demanded "no elections" in
the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao. But the demand was
turned down by President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Namfrel is the only citizen arm of the Commission on Elections
(Comelec) allowed to dispatch principal watchers to precincts and
conduct unofficial quick count of the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in San Nicolas town in northern Pangasinan province,
elections have not yet started and may not be held at all Monday
as some 1,000 followers of a town mayoral candidate held the
ballots hostage in the municipal hall.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of incumbent Mayor Conrado Rodrigo of San Nicolas in
Pangasinan province barricaded the town hall since early morning
Monday in protest against the disqualification of the mayor by the
Comelec.
</P>
<P>
Voting has been in progress in most parts of the country since
seven o'clock in the morning for the election of a successor to
President Fidel Ramos, a new vice president, governors, mayors,
and national and local legislators, totaling 17,510.
</P>
<P>
According to the Philippine News Agency, Rodrigo is personally
spearheading the protest action which many believed is tantamount
to sedition or inciting to sedition, causing disenfranchisement to
more than 14,000 registered voters in the town.
</P>
<P>
Ranjit Ramos Shahani, a member of the House of Representatives
and a nephew of President Ramos, has rushed to the town to
persuade Rodrigo's supporters to withdraw so that the ballots can
be released to the various precincts.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that Rodrigo padlocked the municipal
treasurer's office to prevent the release and distribution of
ballots to the 70 voting centers in 33 communities.
</P>
<P>
Up to 9:30 a.m. no voting has taken place because of the high
tension in the municipal building, said Asuncion Espiritu, lone
opponent of Rodrigo.
</P>
<P>
Voting will close at three o'clock in the afternoon in line
with the election law.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu was the one who initiated the petition seeking
Rodrigo's disqualification, contending that the mayor already
served for three consecutive terms.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Indian scientists have
successfully combined a photocopier with an X-ray machine to
produce X-ray images on ordinary paper, the Indian Express
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that images produced by this xero-radiography
(XR) machine would help detect even hair-line cracks and it would
also be able to produce images of soft tissues and hard bones
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
The X-ray obtained on plain paper would be one fifth the price
of normal X-ray, claimed Suresh Chand, head of the project at
Indian National Physical Laboratory in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
The machine has its limitations, the paper said. For
radiological application, it needs a higher X-ray exposure
compared with conventional radiology.

<HEADLINE> Marcos Loyalists Rally in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of loyalists of former
Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos held a protest rally Monday
morning in front of the Commission on Elections (Comelec), the
only government agency overseeing elections.
</P>
<P>
Marcos's supporters protested the replacement of his widow,
Imelda Marcos, by one of her fellow party member as the official
candidate for the country's next president who is being elected
Monday by Filipino voters.
</P>
<P>
Imelda announced her official withdrawal from the presidential
race last Saturday despite strong opposition from her stalwart
supporters who even threatened to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
In line with the election law, Imelda's party KBL (New Society
Movement) fielded an unknown Francisco Tajanan as its new
presidential candidate to replace her.
</P>
<P>
But the substitution was strongly opposed by Imelda's
supporters, according to Cherry Cobarrubias, spokesman for the
Marcos Loyalists Movement which launched the protest rally.
</P>
<P>
After Imelda's withdrawal, there are still 10 presidential
candidates, including Vice President Joseph Estrada of the main
opposition and Speaker of the House of Representatives Jose de
Venecia of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
But Imelda's name remains on ballots and many of her stout
supporters are expected to vote for her.
</P>
<P>
Gloria Carluya, an old housewife and a long-time Imelda
loyalist, told reporters that she still chose Imelda as the
president despite her withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"She is a nice lady," Carluya said. "I believe she is for the
poor."
</P>
<P>
Imelda, who still has an estimated three to four million
supporters, declared her support for Estrada after withdrawing
from the presidential race. Estrada and De Venecia are widely see
as the two major contenders for the next presidency.
</P>
<P>
More than 34 million Filipino voters are also electing a new
vice president, 12 out of 24 senators, all 260 members of the
House of Representatives and more than 17,000 local government
officials and local councilors.

<HEADLINE> Poland's Foreign Exchange Reserves Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Poland's foreign exchange reserves
hit a new high to 23.4 billion U.S. dollars on April 10, according
to the National Bank of Poland's latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
During the last three years, the country's reserves have been
rising by 3 billion dollars each year, reaching 15.1, 18 and 21
billion dollars respectively from 1995 to 1997, and increased by
2.2 billion dollars in January alone this year.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank's foreign reserves reached 22.9 billion
dollars on March 20, and in the past two months, the bank bought
hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars with the national currency
zloty.
</P>
<P>
The foreign reserves have been rising sharply due to a growth
of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The national economy has been growing by 6 to 7 percent for
three consecutive years and the momentum of high economic growth
and massive foreign investment is expected to continue this year.
</P>
<P>
In the first three months of this year, as much as 4 billion
U.S. dollars flowed into Poland, including 1.5 billion direct
investment. Foreign investment now totals 22.1 billion dollars,
according to reports.
</P>
<P>
The sound economic growth and massive inflow of foreign
investment have also contributed to the revaluation of zloty.
</P>
<P>
After Poland revalued the zloty on February 26, the currency
has grown even stronger. The Central Bank has bought dollars in
large amounts in order to relieve the revaluation pressure on the
zloty.

<HEADLINE> Steps Urged to Revitalize Jute Industry in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh' jute industry is facing
an acute financial crisis, and urgent steps are needed to revamp
this ailing sector, M.A. Behrouz Ispahani, chairman of the
Bangladesh Jute Mills Association (BJMA) said.
</P>
<P>
The local production cost of jute goods was higher than the
export price due to various reasons, and in the export markets,
the jute sector was facing stiff competition form other jute
exporting countries and also from synthetics, Ispahani said
recently in his pre-budget proposal, the Daily Star newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
To revitalize the declining sector, the government should
provide the private jute mills with fiscal support, such as
reduced bank interest rates as provided to other export-oriented
sectors -- frozen food, leather and garments, he said.
</P>
<P>
The BJMA chairman demanded withdrawal of value-added tax on
electricity produced by the jute mills for their own consumption,
and on local sale of jute goods, noting the competition from
synthetics even in the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The jute industry, which helped earn nearly half of
Bangladesh's hard currency in the 1970s, accounted for only 8
percent of its export in 1996.

Representatives and all local positions.
</P>
<P>
The voting is orderly and peaceful with a high voter turnout,
the poll watchers said. Long queues of voters are seen in almost
every voting place. Shops and offices are closed to allow the
employees to vote, and few vehicles are seen running on roads
which were usually crowded.
</P>
<P>
In Pasay, one of the cities in Metro Manila, some voters began
to wait outside their precincts as early as 6 a.m. (22:00 GMT
Sunday), one hour before the voting starts. Thus, elections even
began earlier than scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Emilia Mansilugan, 27, a poll watcher at a public elementary
school on Sadiago street, Samp, Manila, told Xinhua that all major
parties had assigned poll watchers to every precinct at the
school, checking everything before the voting started and
preventing fraud and cheating in the process of voting.
</P>
<P>
Voters at the school are in a fiesta mode. Candidates' pictures
are hung everywhere. Boys and girls with broad smiles are handing
out sample ballots to people entering the school. Latecomers are
seen falling in line to wait for their turn while others are
casting their ballots in an orderly manner.
</P>
<P>
Outside a precinct, Hartha Avestiitla, 76, said she voted for
Vice President Joseph Estrada of the Laban ng Makabayang Masang
Pilipino (Fight of Patriotic Filipino Masses) because he was
"pro-poor" and did a good job when he was the mayor of San Juan in
Metro Manila from 1969 to 1986.
</P>
<P>
Estrada had a wide lead in opinion polls, leading with a 33
percent support rating in a latest survey, followed by House
Speaker Jose de Venecia of the ruling Lakas-NUCD party with 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
Casting his ballot in San Juan, Estrada said he was confident
he would win the election, adding "I feel good to be one of the
chosen."
</P>
<P>
Some other voters said they voted for former Manila mayor
Alfredo Lim of the Liberal Party because he would crack down on
heinous crimes including kidnapping and drug trafficking that were
widespread in the country.
</P>
<P>
Lim trailed de Venecia in the latest survey but might appear as
a dark horse in the elections, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The voting has been smooth and peaceful since the very
beginning, the poll watchers said, adding that they believed the
voting can be completed by 3 p.m. (07:00 GMT) as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
There has been only one minor violence incident reported in
Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested two gunmen and seized two firearms following a
shoot-out between the gunmen and policemen in a northern Manila
suburb before dawn. No one was killed in the incidents.

<HEADLINE> Polling Delayed in Northern Philippine Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The national and local elections
have not started and may not be held at all in a northern
Philippine town Monday as some 1,000 followers of a town mayor
candidate held the ballots hostage in the municipal hall.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of incumbent Conrado Rodrigo, mayor of San Nicolas
in Pangasinan province, barricaded the town hall since early
morning Monday in protest over the disqualification of the mayor
by the Commission on Elections (Comelec).
</P>
<P>
Voting has already began in most parts of the country since
7:00 a.m. (23:00 GMT Sunday) for the election of a successor to
President Fidel Ramos, a new vice president and more than 17,000
legislators down from senators to municipal councilors and local
officials.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that Rodrigo is personally spearheading the
protest which many believed is tantamount to sedition and or
inciting to sedition, causing disenfranchisement to more than
14,000 registered voters in the town, according to the Philippine
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Ranjit Ramos Shahani, a member of the House of Representatives
and a nephew of President Ramos, has rushed to the town to
persuade Rodrigo's supporters to withdraw so that the ballots can
be released to the various precincts.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Rodrigo padlocked the municipal treasurer's
office that prevented the release and distribution of ballots to
the 70 voting centers in 33 communities.
</P>
<P>
Up to 9:30 a.m. (01:30 GMT), no voting has taken place because
of the high tension in the municipal building, said Asuncion
Espiritu, lone opponent of Rodrigo.
</P>
<P>
Voting will end at three o'clock in the afternoon in line with
the election law.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu was the one who initiated the petition seeking
Rodrigo's disqualification, contending that the mayor already
served for three consecutive terms.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Turnout in Philippine Polls, Voting Relatively </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Despite technical hitches, minor
incidents and violence, Monday's general elections in the
Philippines have been conducted in a relatively peaceful and
orderly manner since it began at 7:00 a.m. (23:00 GMT Sunday).
</P>
<P>
A heavy voter turnout has been reported in many parts of the
country. There are an estimated 34 million registered voters in
the country and the Commission on Election, which oversees the
election, projected a 85 percent turnout in Monday's election, 10
percent higher than in the 1992 elections.
</P>
<P>
The most encouraging news for all the Filipinos is that
Monday's voting could be proved as the most peaceful and orderly
in the country's election history.
</P>
<P>
In the 1992 general elections, over 100 people were killed in
election related violence, while in the 1995 senate elections, 210
people died.
</P>
<P>
Although 36 people have been killed since the election period
began in January, this year's election could be relatively
peaceful and orderly.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city of Manila, no major incident has been
reported since the voting began early in the morning.
</P>
<P>
"So far, it is generally peaceful and the peace and order
situation is okay," said Joseph Castro, the police spokesman in
the capital.
</P>
<P>
In other regions of the country, including Mindanao in the
southern Philippines, voting has also been conducted in an orderly
manner, except for some technical hitches, such as missing of
voters lists and election documents.
</P>
<P>
But in Malabang town, Lanao del Sur province in Mindanao,
unidentified gunmen shot dead two campaigners just two hours after
voting began early in the morning, in the first major violence
incident reported in the country.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, an official of the election commission predicted
an election failure in many parts of the country, particularly in
the Southern Mindanao, where ballot-rigging would spark
large-scale violence.
</P>
<P>
To ensure an "honest, peaceful and orderly election," the
government has identified 425 towns and cities in the country as
"hot spots," or violence-prone areas, and deployed 11,600
government troops and policeman in these areas.
</P>
<P>
However, some incidents have also been reported during the
election. Gunmen attacked voters in the Southern Philippine Island
of Basilan Monday morning when they trooped to a polling station,
but no casualties have been reported.
</P>
<P>
In Iligan, Mindanao, at least 400 Muslim guerrillas surrounded
polling precincts in six towns, preventing voting in the national
and local elections.
</P>
<P>
In Zamboanga, the Southern Philippines, a former Muslim
guerrilla running for mayor was ambushed, reports said.
</P>
<P>
In San Nicolas, Pangasinan Province, protest actions led by an
incumbent mayor prevented election officials from distributing
election documents and materials. The election there could be
ruined.
</P>
<P>
In Tayug, Pangasinan Province, five towns remained without
power since Saturday, delaying the start of the polls.
</P>
<P>
The Filipinos are choosing a new president, as well as a vice
president, 12 out of the 24 senators, all the 260 members of the
House of Representatives and 17,000 local officials.
</P>
<P>
Ten candidates are contending the presidency to replace
President Fidel Ramos, who is barred from a second term by the
constitution and will step down on June 30.
</P>
<P>
The top front runners in the presidential race, according to
the latest opinion polls, are Vice President Joseph Estrada from
Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino (Fight of Patriotic Filipino
Masses), and Speaker Jose de Venecia from the ruling
Lakas-National Union of Christian Democrats (Lakas-NUCD).

MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
flew to the northern province of Pangasinan Monday morning and
cast his vote at his hometown in Asingan city.
</P>
<P>
After casting his ballot, Ramos will monitor the counting which
will start at three o'clock in the afternoon after voting is

</P>
<P>
Ramos, who will step down as president on June 30 after a
six-year term, has called on all Filipinos to help ensure honest,

</P>
<P>
"The eyes of the world will be upon us," the president said at

<P>
Among the 10 official presidential candidates, Ramos supports
Speaker of the House of Representatives Jose de Venecia whom Ramos
picked as his successor late last year.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia's main rival for the presidency is Vice President
Joseph Estrada, the main opposition candidate who has been leading

</P>
<P>
It is expected that Pangasinan, a vote-rich province with more

BANGKOK, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Port Authority of Thailand
(PAT) plans to transform itself from being a state enterprise into
a holding company which will be listed on the Stock Exchange of
Thailand in the next two years, according to PAT director Thavorn
Chunnanon.
</P>
<P>
Thavorn was quoted Monday by the Bangkok Post as saying that
the PAT would set up subsidiaries to run different operations
currently under its control. The subsidiaries will lead to more
flexible operations while the PAT will remain as a state
enterprise for a while to supervise them.
</P>
<P>
The PAT will hire Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand
(IFCT) for 30 million baht (789,473 U.S. dollars) to study the
privatization plan, IFCT would suggest how many subsidiaries the
PAT should have for its various operations, Thavorn said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, IFCT would set an appropriate price of PAT shares to
be issued to the private sector. Thavorn said that after
supervising the operations of its subsidiaries for a while, the
PAT would seek listing in the Stock Exchange of Thailand to become
a holding company and would sell its shares under the move. He
set the time frame at two years.

<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Filipino voters go to the polls
Monday to elect a new president, a new vice president, 12 out of
24 senators, 260 members of the House of Representatives, and more
than 17,000 local government officials and councilors.
</P>
<P>
Under the election law, the president is elected by direct
popular vote for a single term of six years. The vice president is
elected for a six-year term in a separate election at the same
time as the president and can serve a maximum of two terms.
</P>
<P>
The canvass of the votes for the president and the vice
president is conducted by the National Board of Canvassers
composed of all members of the bicameral Congress.
</P>
<P>
The candidates obtaining the highest number of votes for the
president and for the vice president shall be declared elected.
The president of the Senate, who is chairman of the National Board
of Canvassers, shall be the one to proclaim the winning
candidates.
</P>
<P>
In case two or more candidates lead with an equal number of
votes, one of them shall be chosen as president or vice president
by a majority vote of all the members of Congress in a joint
session assembled.
</P>
<P>
All 24 Senators are directly elected for six years by national
vote. But one half of the membership of the Senate shall be
elected every three years.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's constitution adopted in 1987, there are a
maximum of 250 members of the House of Representatives. But in the
current elections Monday, there are 260 seats of the lower house
of parliament at stake, according to a guide issued in April this
year by the Commission on Elections (Comelec).
</P>
<P>
Among the 260 representatives, 80 percent or 208 shall be
elected by district, while the remaining 20 percent or 52 shall be
elected under a party-list system which is implemented Monday for
the first time in the country, the Comelec said.
</P>
<P>
In the previous and current legislatures, the party-list or
sectoral representatives were appointed by the president from
lists of nominees proposed by indigenous, but non-religious,
minority groups.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, each voter casts two votes for the House of
Representatives -- one for the district representative and the
other for the party the voter wants represented in the lower
chamber.
</P>
<P>
More than 120 parties which have been accredited by the Comelec
 participate in the country's first ever party-list election
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Party-list Law, the party-list system is a mechanism
of proportional representation in the election of members to the
lower house.
</P>
<P>
The system is designed to enable small political parties and
marginalized and under-represented sectors to obtain possible
representation in the lower chamber, which traditionally, is
dominated by parties with big political machinery.
</P>
<P>
Instead of individual candidates, only registered organized
groups such as the peasantry, urban poor, youth, indigenous
cultural communities and veterans can participate in the
party-list election.
</P>
<P>
A party submits to the Comelec a list of at least five nominees
to represent it. Once the party obtains the required number of
votes, the Comelec shall proclaim the party-list representatives
according to their rankings in the list of nominees.
</P>
<P>
A party should obtain at least 2 percent of the total votes
cast for the party-list system nationwide in order to be allocated
one seat.
</P>
<P>
Only a maximum of three seats may be allowed per party. Seats
are allocated at the rate of one seat per 2 percent of votes
obtained.
</P>
<P>
Five major political parties, which have largest party
representation in the lower house at the start of the current
Congress, are disqualified from participating in Monday's
party-list election.
</P>
<P>
The five parties are the ruling Lakas-NUCD (People's
Power-National Union of Christian Democrats), the Liberal Party
(LP), the LDP (Fight of Democratic Filipinos), the National
People's Coalition (NPC) and the KBL (New Society Movement).
</P>
<P>
Party-list representatives are entitled to the same
deliberative rights as the regular members of the lower chamber.
They shall serve for a term of three years with a maximum of three
consecutive terms.
</P>
<P>
Also up for grabs are 78 provincial governors and an equal
number of vice-governors, 81 city mayors and the same number of
city vice-mayors, 1,526 for both municipal mayors and municipal
vice-mayors, 722 provincial board members, 912 city councilors and
12,232 municipal councilors.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Aid Group Meeting to Open Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Bangladesh Aid Group
will meet here Tuesday for a one-day mid-term review of the
country's economic performance and reform progress, particularly
its privatization program.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to be presided by the World Bank resident director
in Dhaka and attended by senior officials of the donors' missions
here, was expected to press the Bangladeshi government to expedite
its privatization process, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government approved 20 state-owned enterprises
for sale, but only four have been handed over to the private
sector for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
With the slow pace of privatization, the donors would seek a
commitment from a government to offer for sale more units, both
profit-making and loss-making ones, in the next fiscal year
beginning July 1 this year, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
The donors would also discuss the slow progress in improving
the quality of public expenditure and the government's lack of
progress in expediting the resources utilization capacity against
the annual development program, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The donors at a meeting in Dhaka last November allocated 1.92
billion U.S. dollars in aid for Bangladesh. A full-scale Aid Group
meeting would be held in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Aid Group comprises 15 countries, including the
United State, Britain, France and Japan, and 12 international
organizations such as the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund.

<HEADLINE> Thai Ministry to Carry Out Job-Create Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Finance Ministry to carry
out a investment project worth 16,000 million baht (about 400
million U.S. dollars) in this fiscal year to help jobless people,
according to Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda.
</P>
<P>
The money will be from world bank loan of about 300 million
dollars and an overseas economic and cooperation fund loan of
about 100 million dollars, Tarrin was quoted Monday by the Bangkok
Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said part of the money will reach the people through
government agencies and the rest via the government savings bank.
</P>
<P>
The money will be supplementary to the 1998 budget that will
create jobs for the jobless and laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry will seek cabinet approval for the project
on Tuesday. Tarrin said the project will begin immediately after
getting cabinet approval, initially with the government's own
budget.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said there have been consultations over seeking a larger
loan to continue with the project in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The intention is mainly to provide training for jobless workers
and new graduates to prepare them for jobs at the time the economy
recovers. About 5,000 million baht will be spent for this purpose
and it is expected to help about 750,000 people affected by the
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Labor and Social Welfare Ministry expected that number
of jobless people in Thailand will reach two million at the end of
this year due to economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Vice President Casts Vote, Predicting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Vice President Joseph
Estrada cast his vote Monday morning in a suburban Manila
elementary school, predicting again that he will win the
presidential polls by "a landslide"
victory.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, a constant front runner in the presidential race, cast
his ballot before dozens of foreign and local newsmen in a crowded
classroom.
</P>
<P>
"There are many who are called but few who are chosen," the
optimistic Estrada said after casting the vote. "I feel good to be
one of the chosen."
</P>
<P>
Estrada, the standard-bearer of the main opposition LAMMP
(Fight of Patriotic Filipino Masses) party, has held an impressive
lead in various public opinion polls since January.
</P>
<P>
If the opinion polls are right, Estrada is expected to garner
28 to 33 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
Among the other nine presidential hopefuls, Speaker of the
House of Representatives Joseph de Venecia is Estrada's main
rival.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia, who already cast his vote in another Manila
precinct, is supported by President Fidel Ramos who will step down
on June 30 after a six-year term. De Venecia has pinned his hopes
on the ruling party's powerful political machinery.
</P>
<P>
The highly popular Estrada, who turned 61 last month, is also
the most controversial of the ten presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who made a household name in the 1960s for playing
Robin Hood-style heroes fighting for the poor, has a broad
following among the country's middle-lower classes which accounts
for two-thirds of its 70 million population.
</P>
<P>
Orlando Austrin, a 51-year-old jobless worker, told reporters
in a Manila precinct that he voted for Estrada because "he is the
best among the candidates and he is pro-poor."
</P>
<P>
"I think he will create jobs for me and other jobless people,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Estrada, who dropped out of college for the movie
world, was repugnant to the business community, the intellectuals
and the country's influential Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
The business community doubts Estrada's intelligence and
ability to govern the country which is still suffering from the
effects of the regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
His rivals have long accused him of having a series of "vices",
which include heavy drinking, womanizing and gambling.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the influential Roman Catholic Church, including
Manila Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin, have also suggested that the
ex-movie star is not morally fit to govern.
</P>
<P>
Estrada admitted to drinking, womanizing and gambling, but
insisted these "vices" are all flings in the past.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also admitted he is an ignoramus in economics. But he
asked the business community not to worry an Estrada presidency
since his running mate Senator Angara Edgardo is a lawyer and a
recognized economist.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to continue Ramos' economic reforms which have
turned the Philippines into "an emerging tiger."
</P>
<P>
Also for grabs in Monday's elections are a new vice president,
12 of 24 senators, 260 members of the House of Representatives and
more than 17,000 local government officials and local councilors.

constitution adopted in October 1986 and ratified by the Filipino
voters in February 1987.
</P>
<P>
Executive: The head of state and commander-in-chief of the
armed forces is the President, who is elected by direct popular
vote for a single term of six years. The President appoints a
cabinet subject to approval by the Commission of Appointments,
which is derived from both chambers of Congress. The President may
declare martial law in a national emergency but the Congress is
empowered to revoke such an order at any time. The Vice President

<P>
BANGKOK, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Thais traveling to the United
States will be able to enjoy a much shorter flight in the future
as the country is planning a direct route via the North Pole.
</P>
<P>
Monday's Bangkok Post said the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) has agreed on the direct route between
Thailand and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The new route passes over Laos, Myanmar, China, Mongolia,
Russia and the North Pole and will take only 12 hours. The current
route over India takes 22 to 23 hours.
</P>
<P>
The Aeronautical Radio of Thailand Co. (AeroThai), which
proposed the route and incorporated it into the flight route
development plan of ICAO members, said it has yet to seek approval
from the countries en route to install air traffic control
equipment.
</P>
<P>
AeroThai expects to introduce the new route to airlines within
two years.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Voting has been going on in a
relatively peaceful and orderly manner in most parts of the
Philippines since it began early, with incidents blocking the
election reported in some places.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest reports from different parts of the
country, voting began at 07:00 (GMT 2300 Sunday) in most of
174,374 precincts in the nation and has been proceeded smoothly.
</P>
<P>
However, incidents blocking the polling have been reported in
some parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
In Iligan, Mindanao, at least 400 Muslim guerrillas surrounded
polling precincts in six towns, preventing voting in the national
and local elections.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen described themselves as Muslim guerrillas and told
voters that they "do not want elections to take place."
</P>
<P>
In Zamboanga, the Southern Philippines, a former Muslim
guerrilla running for mayor was ambushed, reports said.
</P>
<P>
In Manila, ABS-CBN television said, a shoot-out between gunmen
and police erupted before dawn, leading to two arrests but no
casualties.
</P>
<P>
In San Nicolas, Pangasinan Province, protest actions led by an
incumbent mayor has prevented election officials from distributing
election documents and materials. The election there could be
ruined.
</P>
<P>
In Tayug of the same province, five towns have remained without
powers since last Saturday, delaying the start of the polls.
</P>
<P>
Election officials and poll watchers in Manila and the southern
cities of Cebu and Davao warned that more incidents or
election-related violence would likely take place during the day.
</P>
<P>
In Cebu, thousands of troops and policemen have been deployed
in violence-prone areas. However, election officials warned of
possible violence in several areas of the city.
</P>
<P>
As voting is going on, thousands upon thousands of Filipinos
are trooping to the polling stations to choose new national and
local leaders, including a president who will lead the nation into
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Monday was declared as "a special holiday" nationwide. Offices,
schools, shops and stock markets were closed to enable a big
turnout of voters.
</P>
<P>
There are 34 million registered voters in the country and the
Commission on Election, which oversees the election, projected an
85 percent turnout in Monday's election, 10 percent higher than in
the 1992 elections.
</P>
<P>
The voters choose a new president as well as a vice president,
12 out of the 24 senators, all the 260 members of the House of
Representatives and 17,000 local officials.
</P>
<P>
Ten candidates are contending the presidency to replace
President Fidel Ramos, who is barred from a second term by the
constitution and will step down on June 30.
</P>
<P>
The top front runners in the presidential race, according to
the latest opinion polls, are Vice President Joseph Estrada from
Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino (Fight of Patriotic Filipino
Masses), and Speaker Jose de Venecia from the ruling
Lakas-National Union of Christian Democrats (Lakas-NUCD).
</P>
<P>
A poll by the Social Weather Station published last Thursday
put Estrada's support rating at 33 percent, and De Venecia trailed
in second place with 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other front runners include former Manila mayor Alfredo Lim
from the Liberal Party, Senator Raul Roco from Aksyon Demokratiko
(Democratic Action) Party and ex-governor Emilio Osmena from
Progressive Movement for Devolution of Initiative (PROMODI).
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here said that as ten candidates are running
in the presidential race, none of them could get the majority
support, and a dark horse might emerge in the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Official results of the polls from the election commission
would not come out in less than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
To prevent election-related violence, the government has
deployed thousands of policemen and soldiers at hundreds of "hot
spots," or violence-prone areas, in the capital city of Manila and
other regions.
</P>
<P>
During the 1992 elections, over 100 people were killed in
election-related violence.
</P>
<P>
The situation has improved in the current elections compared
with the previous ones. Since the election period started in
January, 33 people have been killed in election-related violence.
</P>
<P>
As a final step to ensure Monday's political exercise to be the
"best and the most credible" in the Philippine history, Ramos
invited all the presidential and vice presidential candidates to a
breakfast meeting last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, the presidential candidates and
their running mates signed the Statement of Affirmation of
"Honest, Orderly and Peaceful" Elections, while Ramos also affixed
his signature on the document as a witness.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, an official of the election commission predicted
an election failure in many parts of the country, particularly in
the Southern Mindanao, where ballot-rigging would spark
large-scale violence.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Finds Little Common Ground on Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke, on a shuttle mission to reduce the ethnic tensions in
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, said he found that all parties
concerned had little common ground on solving the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He made the observation late Sunday after holding discussions
with Albanian President Rexhep Meidani and Prime Minister Fatos
Nano.
</P>
<P>
He and Robert Gelbard, another U.S. special envoy traveling
with him, had earlier met with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and Kosovo ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke told a press conference here that the only common
ground they have found over the Kosovo issue is that all parties
agree the situation in Kosovo is "extremely critical."
</P>
<P>
"All three of the leaders agreed on one thing, the situation is
dangerous. After that agreement, of course, there is no agreement
on what to do next," Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
But he said Rugova has reiterated his commitment to finding a
peaceful solution to the crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Gelbard said Albania also expressed its clear-cut support for
Yugoslavia's territorial integrity, just as the international
community backs the territorial integrity of Albania and other
countries in the region,
</P>
<P>
For his part, Nano said his country had "decided to exert
positive influence on the Kosovo representatives so that a real
process can start, allowing a political solution to be reached".
</P>
<P>
The two U.S. diplomats are to return to Belgrade on Monday to
meet Milosevic again.

<HEADLINE> Attack on Voters Reported in Southern Philippine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Gunmen attacked voters on the
Southern Philippine Island of Basilan Monday morning when they
trooped to a polling station to elect national and local
officials, but no casualties have been reported so far.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Basilan, the gunmen shot at voters
near the town of Sumisip.
</P>
<P>
Voting has been going on in a relatively peaceful and orderly
manner in most parts of the Philippines since it began at 07:00
(GMT 2300 Sunday) Monday, but incidents or violence have been
reported in some parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
In Iligan, Mindanao, at least 400 Muslim guerrillas surrounded
polling precincts in six towns, preventing voting in the national
and local elections.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen described themselves as Muslim guerrillas and told
voters that they "do not want elections to take place."
</P>
<P>
In Zamboanga, the Southern Philippines, a former Muslim
guerrilla running for mayor was ambushed, reports said.
</P>
<P>
In Manila, ABS-CBN television said, a shoot-out between gunmen
and police erupted before dawn, leading to two arrests but no
casualties.
</P>
<P>
In San Nicolas, Pangasinan province, protest actions led by an
incumbent mayor prevented election officials from distributing
election documents and materials. The election there could be
ruined.
</P>
<P>
In Tayug of the same province, five towns have remained without
power supply since last Saturday, delaying the start of the polls.
</P>
<P>
Election officials and poll watchers in Manila and the southern
cities of Cebu and Davao warned that more incidents or
election-related violence would likely take place during the day.
</P>
<P>
Monday was declared as "a special holiday" nationwide. Offices,
schools, shops and stock markets were closed to enable a big
turnout of voters.
</P>
<P>
There are 34 million registered voters in the country and the
Commission on Election, which oversees the elections, projected an

NANNING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Air pollution is expected to be
reduced in Liuzhou, capital of south China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region and one of the China's four regions suffering
the most from acid rain.
</P>
<P>
The city will invest 210 million yuan (about 86 million U.S.

The project will provide gas to 126,000 households, or 85
percent of urban residents, the access to gas.
</P>
<P>
Residents of the region used to burn coal-fueled ovens in their
daily lives, which contributed to the increase of sulfur dioxide

China's acid-rain control zones extend to 14 provinces,
autonomous regions and cities, taking up 800,000 square

<P>
ROME, May 10 (Xinhua) -- President Luigi Scalfaro and Prime
Minister Romano Prodi Sunday called for solidarity of the Italian
people at the funeral services for the 97 victims of the recent
massive mudslides in southern Italy.
</P>
<P>
"We are with you and will continue to be with you," Scalfaro
said to thousands of mourners gathered at the stadium in Sarno, a
community in the Campania region worst hit by the mudslides .
</P>
<P>
"We came here today because of the need to bring, at this time,
the solidarity of all the people of Italy," said Scalfaro, looking
pale and moved with eyes glistening.
</P>
<P>
The mudslides have put environmental issues under the political
spotlight, increasing pressure on the government to end decades of
negligence.
</P>
<P>
Between 50,000 and 100,000 people demonstrated in Rome on
Saturday following last week's disaster, the largest environmental
protest ever held in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Unregulated property development has been blamed for the
disaster. Deforestation in the mountain regions, such as where the
mudslides struck last week, is also said to have disrupted the
fragile hydrological system.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Prodi, after inspecting the areas devastated by
the mudslides, told the people crowed in the operations center in
the City Hall that the government will respond to their concern.
</P>
<P>
Monday has been declared a national day of mourning.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Provide More Housing Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai will provide an
additional seven billion yuan (843 million U.S. dollars) in home
mortgage loans this year, tripling the city's outstanding mortgage
loan portfolio from the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Mao Yingliang, president of the People's Bank of China Shanghai
branch, was quoted by today's China Daily as saying that the move
to enlarge the supply of mortgage loans is part of the efforts to
boost the city's economic growth by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the bank lending will shift support from
commercial housing development projects to financing home buyers,
who now can borrow from the city's Public Housing Fund through all
of the city's banks.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Branch of China Construction Bank used to be the
only bank authorized to provide home mortgage loans in the
city. Now more local banks are allowed to do the business.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks will further prolong the lending time in a bid
to stimulate demand for commercial housing. And the city cut
borrowing interest rates twice during the second half of last year.
</P>
<P>
Besides home mortgage loans, the priority of the bank lending
will be placed in public infrastructure, such as the
Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway and the Pudong International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Officials said increased investment in fixed assets and
accelerated capital construction will create more markets,
particularly for heavy industries.
</P>
<P>
Most of the money will also be spent on new and high-tech
industries, including areas dealing with information and modern
medicine, the paper added.

<HEADLINE> Protest May Ruin Election in Northern Philippine City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The elections may not push through
in San Nicolas, a city in the Northern Philippine province of
Pangasinan, as 250 followers of the incumbent municipal mayor
blocked the municipal hall early Monday, preventing the release of
election paraphernalias for different electoral precincts.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the city said that tension there is high as Mayor
Conrado Rodrigo is personally leading the protest action, which he
did after he received the resolution from the Commission on
Elections (Comelec) stating that he was disqualified from running
for re-election as he already served three consecutive terms in
full.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that San Nicolas Municipal Elections Officer
Leocadio Gines asked representatives of political parties to
proceed to the municipal hall at 02:00 (GMT 1800 Sunday) Monday to
witness the release of elections paraphernalia to the different
precincts.
</P>
<P>
But this did not take place because the municipal hall was
already blocked by Rodrigo's men who also deplored the
disqualification of the mayor by the Comelec, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Voting began at 07:00 (GMT 2300 Sunday) at most of 174,000
polling stations across the country. The voters choose a new
president, a vice president, 12 out of 24 senators, 260 members of
the House of Representatives, 1,600 mayors and other local
officials.
</P>
<P>
In most parts of the country, the voting has been smooth so
far.

MADRID, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Spain clinched the
apparatus titles on the final day of the world rhythmic gymnastics
championships in Seville, Spain on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Spain won the hoop-and-ribbon gold, while Russia took the
honours on the five-balls mat. Belarus finished second in both
apparatus, adding two silver medals to the overall world title won
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Belarus had looked likely to take their second gold medal after
scoring 19.800 with a fine performance with hoops and ribbons.
</P>
<P>
But the Spanish girls, competing last, eliminated the mistakes
that had hit them on Friday, and were given 19.850, to the delight
of the home crowd.
</P>
<P>
It was the same story for Belarus in the five-ball competition.
</P>
<P>
Spain were the favourites for the gold after putting in the
best performance in the overall competition.
</P>
<P>
But, on a day of few mistakes, two slip-ups put them back into
seventh place, and Russia scored 19.850 to pip Belarus for first
place.
</P>
<P>
The Masters exhibition competition was dominated by Alina
Kabaeva of Russia and Ukraine's Elena Vitrichenko. Each gymnast
won two of the four apparatus, and finished second in the others.

<HEADLINE> Two Died in Cable Car Crash in Northern Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BANGKOK, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed and 36
injured after a steel wire pulling two cable cars at Doi Suthep
Mountain in Thailand's northern province of Chiang Mai snapped
Sunday, the Bangkok Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said the steel cable used to pull the two cars
snapped when the cars were about 50 meters high, causing them to
plunge to the ground.
</P>
<P>
The two cable cars were packed with tourists who visited a
temple on top of the mountain on the Visaka Bucha Buddist Holiday
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The temple, close to central Chiang Mai town, is considered to
be a highly venerated and most visited religious place in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Two Thai visitors died in hospital, while 15 of the injured
were reported to be in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
The accident was the second since the system was installed by
the temple 15 years ago. Last July the cable broke in a similar
accident, injuring 30 passengers.
</P>
<P>
Police officers said it was suspected that the cable, which
had been in use for a long time, had snapped under the strain of
the "overload" of tourists.
</P>
<P>
The cable car service has been suspended for an indefinite
period, pending the outcome of the investigation and an
improvement of safety standards.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian government Saturday
welcomed the six-nation Contact Group's decision to impose new
sanctions on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
A foreign ministry statement said the Albanian government will
continue to follow closely the conflict between local police and
the ethnic Albanians in the Kosovo province of Serbia, a republic
of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
To end the violence, the Yugoslav government must sit at the
negotiating table with the Albanians and a third party from the
international community, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Albanian government will continue to cooperate
with the international community and make further contributions to
the peace and stability in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministers of the six member states of the Contact Group
met in London on May 5 and decided to take measures to block any
kind of investment in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Russia was the only member to oppose the decision. Other
members, the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Italy,

<HEADLINE> IMF to Resume Lending to Moldova </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has decided to resume lending to Moldova soon, the Media
news agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
John Olding-Smme, the fund's Deputy President of European
Affairs, indicated after his meeting with newly-elected Moldovan
Speaker Dumitru Diacov over the weekend that a new agreement on
the resumption of IMF lending will be signed with the country
after a new government is formed and its policy statement is
released.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement concluded in 1996, the IMF would provide 190
million U.S. dollars in loans to Moldova within two years. In
fact, only 37.5 million dollars were disbursed.
</P>
<P>
The fund unilaterally suspended the lending in the second half
of last year on the ground that the Moldovan economy was in a mess.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has provided a total of 240 million dollars in loans to
Moldova since 1992.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Wins Second Clay Title of 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Martina Hingis earned revenge for a
defeat six weeks ago when she beat Venus Williams 6-3, 2-6, 6-3
to win the 926,250 dollars Italian Open here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In late March at Key Biscayne, Florida -- the last time the
pair met -- world No.1 Hingis lost to fellow 17-year-old American
Williams, going out in the semi-finals on hard court. Williams
also beat Hingis in their first match of the year in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, those defeats were forgotten as Hingis improved to
5-2 in the series.
</P>
<P>
Hingis won the first set, but dropped serve twice in the second
as Williams forced a decider. The Swiss player began the third
set with a break but had to fight to emerge victorious after four
more breaks of serve before the end.
</P>
<P>
The match lasted nearly two hours.
</P>
<P>
The trophy was the fourth for Hingis this year and her second
in as many weeks on the clay.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, winner of three of last year's four Grand Slams, has
now triumphed at the Australian Open, Indian Wells, Hamburg and
Rome so far this year.

<HEADLINE> China's Special Economic Zones Maintain Rapid Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China's five special economic zones
(SEZ) are maintaining rapid and stable economic growth at a time
when favorable policies it enjoyed are less attractive.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the State Economic Restructuring Office show
that Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen, and Hainan had a total of
252.2 billion yuan in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) last year, a
year-on-year rise of 15.4 percent, higher than the national
average of 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The SEZs also had a lower retail sales price index. And their
industrial sectors were improving. Shenzhen and Zhuhai, for
example, reported industrial efficiency indexes of 178 and 136,
respectively, compared with the nation's average index of 88.9.
</P>
<P>
Huang Taihe, an economic official, attributed the upbeat
momentum to industrial restructuring, readjustments of
enterprises' organizational structures, and other reform polices.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen's high and new technology sector had grown to
contribute 36 percent to its total industrial output, much higher
than the national average.
</P>
<P>
The SEZs all have set up some large enterprise groups, with 36
in Shenzhen having a more rapid growth rate than local
overseas-funded businesses.
</P>
<P>
They have also cultivated their own pillar industries, such as
Shenzhen's home appliances, information, and bioengineering;
Xiamen's machinery and electronics; and Hainan's tropical
agriculture, petrochemicals and tourism.
</P>
<P>
The SEZs have established trade contacts with 150 countries and
regions, and had nearly 69 billion U.S. dollars worth of imports
and exports last year, accounting for 21.2 percent of the
country's total. And they used 6.69 billion U.S. dollars of
overseas investment, up 15.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The SEZs still serve as China's testing ground for reform
policies. Shenzhen, for example, tried a new port management
system to meet internationally accepted practices.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoys Meets Kosovo Albanian Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke met Kosovo ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova on
Sunday to explore solutions to the crisis in the troubled province
of Serbia, a republic of the federal Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Pristina, Kosovo, Holbrooke said, "We
are here to listen and to learn, and what we heard today have been
very useful."
</P>
<P>
Robert Gelbard, another U.S. special envoy traveling with
Holbrooke, said, "We think that a lot more work needs to be done
on both sides to get them to talk on the same lines to each other
and there is a real urgency to that."
</P>
<P>
Both Holbrooke and Gelbard will return to Belgrade on Monday to
meet Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic again.
</P>
<P>
Before arriving in Kosovo, the two envoys had talks with
Milosevic in Belgrade on Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic said that the referendum result in Serbia last month
demonstrated that it was impossible for the country to accept any
foreign mediation in the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The president said the position of the Yugoslav leadership and
people was that the issue was an internal affair of Serbia and
could only be resolved within Serbia through political means.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, five members of the six-nation Contact Group
decided to impose new sanctions on Yugoslavia, which includes the
Serbia and Montenegro republics. They are Britain, France,
Germany, Italy and the United States. The other member, Russia,
was against the decision.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo has sunk into chaos since ethnic Albanians calling for
independence clashed with the local Serb police in
February. Ethnic Albanians account for a majority of the residents
in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Voting Continues in Philippines, Hitches Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The national and local elections in
the Philippines have been relatively peaceful and smooth since it
started at 07:00 Monday (GMT2300 Sunday), but technical hitches
have also been reported in some polling stations across the
country.
</P>
<P>
In most polling centers in the capital city of Manila, voting
has been going on peacefully and orderly. No single incident has
been reported so far.
</P>
<P>
Even in Mindanao, where election-related violence is most
likely to take place, most polling centers opened promptly at
07:00 and voters fell in lines to wait for their turn. The voting
has been conducted smoothly.
</P>
<P>
In the General Santos City, Mindanao, the turnout seems very
high and voting is continuing smoothly without any incident,
election officials said.
</P>
<P>
However, in some polling centers in Manila and other parts of
the country, voters took a long time to find their names in the
voters' list before they could get ballots.
</P>
<P>
Some people failed to find their names in the voters' list
although they had registered, poll watchers said.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest reports from most parts of the country,
election officials and poll watchers are expecting relatively
orderly and peaceful elections.
</P>
<P>
But in the southern part of the country, particularly in
Mindanao, election-related violence is still expected despite the
deployment of troops and policemen in violence-prone areas, the
reports said
</P>
<P>
The casting of votes started at 07:00 in most of 174,374
precincts across the nation, and is scheduled to end at 15:00 (GMT
0700).
</P>
<P>
Monday was declared as "a special holiday" nationwide. Offices,
schools, shops and stock markets were closed to enable a big
turnout of voters.
</P>
<P>
There are 34 million registered voters in the country and the
Commission on Election, which oversees the election, projected an
85 percent turnout in Monday's election, 10 percent higher than in
the 1992 elections.
</P>
<P>
The voters choose a new president as well as a vice president,
12 out of the 24 senators, all the 260 members of the House of
Representatives and 17,000 local officials.
</P>
<P>
Ten candidates are contending the presidency to replace
President Fidel Ramos, who is barred from a second term by the
constitution and will step down on June 30.
</P>
<P>
The top front runners in the presidential race, according to
the latest opinion polls, are Vice President Joseph Estrada from
Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino (Fight of Patriotic Filipino
Masses), and Speaker Jose de Venecia from the ruling
Lakas-National Union of Christian Democrats (Lakas-NUCD).
</P>
<P>
Other front runners include former Manila mayor Alfredo Lim
from the Liberal Party, Senator Raul Roco from Aksyon Demokratiko
(Democratic Action) Party and ex-governor Emilio Osmena from
Progressive Movement for Devolution of Initiative (PROMODI).

BUENOS AIRES, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The presidential candidate for
Paraguay's ruling Colorado Party, Raul Cubas, is heading for a
victory in Sunday's general election, exit polls indicated.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Paraguay's capital Asuncion, Cubas, a
54-year-old engineer, carried a lead of 4 and 5 percentage points
over rival Domingo Laino of the Democratic Alliance in the exit
polls conducted by Paraguayan radio, television and newspapers.
</P>

Cubas was a last-minute replacement for former army chief Lino
Oviedo who was charged with leading an abortive coup in
1996. Oviedo was sentenced to 10 years in prison last December.
</P>
<P>
The winner will succeed President Juan Carlos Wasmosy for a

<HEADLINE> Profile: Fidel Ramos - Outgoing Philippine President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Fifty days after Monday's elections,
Fidel Ramos will complete his six-year term as the 8th president
of the Republic of the Philippines after the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
The 70-year-old Ramos, who is constitutionally barred from
seeking a second term, will step down on June 30.
</P>
<P>
A career armyman, Ramos served successively as deputy chief of
the armed forces, chief of staff, director-general of the police
and secretary of national defense in the 1980s before succeeding
Corazon Aquino as president in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Ramos held the political spotlight when he and defense
secretary Juan Enrile rebelled against Ferdinand Marcos in 1986.
An ensuing popular revolt forced Marcos, who had ruled the country
for more than 20 years, to flee to Hawaii, the United States, and
he died there three years later.
</P>
<P>
During the Aquino administration, Ramos' forces foiled seven
coups d'etat against the government. In the 1992 elections, he won
the presidency with 23.6 percent of the votes cast.
</P>
<P>
On assuming power, Ramos gave priority to the restoration of
peace and order by persuading many mutinous right-wing soldiers,
communist rebels and Muslim separatists to abandon their armed
struggles.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Moro National Liberation Front, the largest
Muslim rebel group, signed a peace pact with the government in
1996 after 24 years of war.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government negotiators started talks with the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front and the National Democratic Front.
Although little progress has been made so far in the talks, the
two "comparatively small" rebel groups no longer pose serious
threats to the country's stability.
</P>
<P>
Born in Central Luzon, the northern Philippines, Ramos attended
National University of Manila and the U.S. Military Academy at
West Point, and acquired a master's degree at University of
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
Economic development was another main thrust of the Ramos
administration. In the past six years, the government has
implemented a series of economic reforms, including the
deregulation of foreign exchange, the entry of 10 foreign banks
and the privatization of state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to these efforts, the economy, which was stagnant after
years of political turmoil and natural disasters, recovered in
1993 and grew by 5.1 percent in 1994. In 1996, it culminated with
a growth rate of 6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Citing the economic gains and the successful hosting of the
fourth informal leadership meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum in 1996, supporters said Ramos should be
allowed a second term. They launched several campaigns trying to
erase the six-year single term limit in the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Ramos allegedly supported these drives, but under mounting
pressure from the masses and the Church, last September he gave up
seeking a second term and anointed House Speaker Jose de Venecia
as the presidential candidate of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
The Ramos government may take some credit for reviving the
economy, but it has also left behind a host of problems unsolved,
including rampant crimes, massive poverty and a high employment
rate. One out of three people in the Philippines is living in
poverty and 10 percent of the Filipinos remain jobless. Kidnapping
cases are also widespread in the country.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the financial crisis sweeping Southeast Asia
last July, the peso has depreciated about a third of its value,
and the economy is slowing down and is expected to slide further
this year. All these are also becoming part of the legacy of the
Ramos government.

<HEADLINE> Profile: De Venecia - Ramos's Choice in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the House of
Representatives Jose de Venecia is the presidential bet picked by
President Fidel Ramos for the Philippines' ruling Lakas-NUCD
(National Union of Christian Democrats) party in the May 11
elections.
</P>
<P>
Although having lagged far behind the main opposition candidate
Vice President Joseph Estrada in many opinion polls, the
62-year-old veteran politician has not been discounted by his
rivals and many pundits.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who has been campaigning madly for De Venecia, last
Saturday even predicted a landslide victory for his endorsed
successor because of the ruling party's powerful political
machine.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia gained Ramos' support late last year after beating a
number of other contenders, including former defense secretary
Renato de Villa who later bolted the Lakas-NUCD to make his own
bid for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
The endorsement of Ramos alone, who remains a popular figure in
the country, is expected to bring one to two million extra votes
for De Venecia, which may make a lot of difference in a tight
race.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide grassroots organizations of the ruling party is
another advantage of the house speaker, which none of his nine
opponents, including Estrada of the LAMMP (Fight of Patriotic
Filipino Masses), can match.
</P>
<P>
The Lakas-NUCD was merely a paper organization when it was
founded by De Venecia and Ramos for the 1992 presidential ballots.
But after six years of expansion, it is currently the country's
largest political party with an estimated membership of 6.5
million.
</P>
<P>
As secretary general of the Lakas-NUCD, De Venecia is credited
with increasing the party's strength and has a broad following
within the party.
</P>
<P>
Being speaker of the lower house for six years, De Venecia also
has the support of many congressmen, governors and local
officials.
</P>
<P>
By making the Lakas-NUCD the majority party in the lower house,
De Venecia takes much credit for pushing through the Ramos
administration's economic reform measures.
</P>
<P>
A veteran politician, he is well known for his considerable
skills in negotiating and in consensus- and coalition-building.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, however, De Venecia is widely seen as a
"trapo" (Filipino parlance for the traditional politician) who is
good at backroom deals and has no ideals or interests other than
staying in power. His "trapo" image is the main cause of his low
popularity.
</P>
<P>
In his platform, De Venecia vows to complete the Ramos
administration's economic reforms and lead the country to full
modernization.
</P>
<P>
But the business community dislikes him and doubts his ability
to run balanced budgets.
</P>
<P>
In the latest poll conducted by the highly reliable polling
group, the Social Weather Station (SWS), De Venecia came in second
place with a 15-percent support rating, the best showing for him
since January. Estrada retained his commanding lead with 33
percent.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Estrada - Front Runner in Philippine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Vice President Joseph
Estrada, a long-retired action movie star, is widely seen as an
odds-on contender in the Philippines' presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, the standard-bearer of the main opposition LAMMP
(Fight of Patriotic Filipino Masses) party, has held an impressive
lead in various public opinion polls since January.
</P>
<P>
But the highly popular Estrada, who turned 61 last month, is
also the most controversial one of the ten presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who made a household name in the 1960s for playing
Robin Hood-style heroes fighting for the poor, has a broad
following among the country's middle-lower classes which account
for two-thirds of its 70 million population.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to his popularity among the ordinary masses, Estrada has
never lost a single election since 1973 when he entered politics
and was elected mayor of San Juan, Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
Estrada's popularity also enabled him to become a member of the
Senate in 1989 and, six years later, guaranteed his landslide
victory in the 1992 vice-presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has his own explanation of his mass support.
</P>
<P>
"As a movie star, I played the roles of poor people: a jeepney
(a kind of mini bus) driver, slum dweller, a farmer. It is the
poor who watch my movies and they identify with me," he said.
"That really has changed me, and my heart and soul has been with
the poor."
</P>
<P>
Campaigning on a populist pro-poor platform, the stout and
mustached former movie star, who usually wears blue jeans and a
sleeveless T-shirt, is trying to make himself "a real savior" for
the poor.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has promised that an Estrada presidency will reduce
drastically the 35-percent national poverty rate, give priority to
agriculture and food security and restore peace and order in the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, Estrada, who dropped out of college for the movie
world, was repugnant to the business community, the intellectuals,
and the country's influential Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
The business community doubts Estrada's intelligence and
ability to govern the country which is still suffering from the
effects of the regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
His rivals have long accused him of having a series of "vices",
which include heavy drinking, womanizing and gambling.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the influential Roman Catholic Church have also
suggested that the ex-movie star is not morally fit to govern.
</P>
<P>
Estrada admitted to drinking, womanizing and gambling, but
insisted these "vices" are all flings in the past.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also admitted he is an ignoramus in economics. But he
asked the business community not to worry an Estrada presidency
since his running mate Senator Angara Edgardo is a lawyer and a
recognized economist.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to continue Ramos' economic reforms which have
turned the Philippines into "an emerging tiger."
</P>
<P>
But all these attacks did not make any detraction on Estrada's
popularity among the ordinary masses who account for more than
two-thirds of the country's 71 million population.
</P>
<P>
In a May opinion poll conducted by the country's most respected
polling group, the Social Weather Station (SWS), Estrada
strengthened his massive lead with a 33-percent approval rating.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the House of Representatives Jose de Venecia of the
ruling party trailed him behind with 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
With the massive and stalwart support from the masses, the
former movie heartthrob may be again unbeatable.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Alfredo Lim - A Likely Dark Horse in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Former Manila mayor Alfredo Lim, the
presidential candidate of the Liberal Party, is one of the major
contenders in the Philippines' presidential elections now
underway.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other presidential contenders who have prepared for the
derby for years, Lim threw his hat in the ring last December, less
than three months before the start of the official campaign
period.
</P>
<P>
But the late-comer, who campaigns on peace and order, a clean
government and a free college education system, emerged as a dark
horse in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
In four opinion polls conducted between January and April this
year by the country's most respected polling group, the Social
Weather Station (SWS), Lim emerged as the closest rival to Vice
President Joseph Estrada, with a support rating of 13 to 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
Lim's late surge is due to his anti-crime record and the open
backing of former president Corazon Aquino, who still has a great
number of followers.
</P>
<P>
Lim, who resigned as Manila mayor in March for his presidential
bid, also has the tacit support of the influential Manila
Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin, the country's leading prelate.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "Dirty Harry" after the fictional Hollywood detective,
Lim was well known for his tough methods in dealing with criminals
in the 1980s when he was a police chief of a Manila district and
then the director of the National Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
After being elected Manila mayor in 1992, the retired police
general continued his aggressive pursue against criminals which
was highlighted by an unprecedented campaign of painting the doors
of suspected drug dealers with warning signs last year.
</P>
<P>
Although criticized for being a one-issue candidate with little
knowledge of economic issues, Lim enjoys high popularity among the
middle-upper class and the business community because of his
charisma and strong leadership.
</P>
<P>
"I vote for Lim because of his tough leadership. He is a
no-nonsense leader, a disciplinarian, and that's the right man for
our country at this difficult time," said John Giburea, a Filipino
journalist.
</P>
<P>
Lim's presidential bid was further boosted last Friday when the
Commission on Elections (Comelec) dismissed a petition seeking to
disqualify him from the race.
</P>
<P>
The petition was filed last month by a lawyer, allegedly at the
instigation of the ruling party, saying that Lim was not a
natural-born Filipino since his parents were Chinese mestizos.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, only natural-born Filipinos may seek
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
The citizenship issue made some dent on Lim's support rating,
which dipped to 10 percent in a May SWS poll from 13 percent
showed in an April SWS poll.
</P>
<P>
With the detractive citizenship issue resolved and his charisma
advantage over most of his rivals, Lim could be a real dark horse
in the presidential race.

<HEADLINE> Auctioneer: Booming Profession in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- "Two hundred thousand yuan, it's a
deal," Ye Zhaoxian slammed the auction desk with his hammer.
</P>
<P>
The middle-aged Ye could hardly remember how many times he
presided over auction. Although having been an auctioneer for only
three years, he has achieved a certain fame in Shanghai, China's
most populous metropolis and an economic powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
"I began this career auctioning consumer goods at a square in
Jiading District," Ye said. "At that time, I felt very nervous.
</P>
<P>
Before his auctioning fame, Ye had farmed in rural areas and
performed on stage as a singer for 10 years. But now as one of
China's first batch of registered national auctioneers, Ye also
leads auctions in Guangdong, Fujian, Shaanxi and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"It's a challenging job; there's too many things for me to
learn," he said.
</P>
<P>
His words represent the aspirations of all Shanghai
auctioneers, a new profession which developed rapidly in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, the birthplace of the business in China, has become
one of the three auction centers in China since the beginning of
the market economy.
</P>
<P>
The city's 37 houses annually organize about 1,000 auctions to
sell artwork, public property, consumer goods and other items.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai also has China's first female auctioneer, Xiao Jinqi.
</P>
<P>
One of Shanghai's leading auctioneers, Lin Yiping, was invited
to China Central Television, the country's most influential TV
station, early this year to preside over the auction of commercial
time.

<P>
GENEVA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A 1-1 draw against Slovakia in
Basle, Switzerland on Sunday propelled Switzerland to the
semi-finals of the World Ice Hockey Championships.
</P>
<P>
After beating Russia 4-2 on Friday and then seeing them draw
2-2 with the Czech Republic on Sunday, the draw gave the Swiss an
identical 1-1-1 record with Olympic silver medalists Russia, but a
head-to-head result system knocked Russians out of the top four.
</P>
<P>
For Switzerland, who qualified for pool A only as hosts, Misko
Antisin's goal midway through the first period was enough to put
his team through to the final four for the first time since 1992
and only the second time in 45 years.
</P>
<P>
Jan Pardavy had the lone strike for Slovakia, who bowed out of
the qualifying round with three losses.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss face Sweden in the two-game semifinals starting on
Tuesday, while the Czech Republic will play Finland, who beat
Belarus 5-2 to go through.

<HEADLINE> Voting in Philippines Could Be Relatively Peaceful, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Voting for national and local
leaders began early Monday across the Philippines and could
proceed relatively orderly and peaceful, but violence is still
expected in some parts of the country, election officials and poll
watchers said.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest reports from different parts of the
country, voting began at 07:00 (GMT 2300 Sunday) in most of
174,374 precincts in the nation and is expected to proceed
relatively peaceful.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of voters have lined up inside and outside polling
stations since 05:00 and 06:00 to wait for the beginning of the
voting, which will end at 15:00 (GMT 0700).
</P>
<P>
But election officials and poll watchers in Manila and the
Southern cities of Cebu and Davao warned that election-related
violence would likely take place during the day.
</P>
<P>
In Cebu, thousands of troops and policemen have been deployed
in violence-prone areas. However, election officials warned of
possible violence in several areas of the city.
</P>
<P>
As voting is underway, thousands upon thousands of Filipinos
are trooping to the polling stations to choose new national and
local leaders, including a president who will lead the nation into
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Monday was declared as "a special holiday" nationwide. Offices,
schools, shops and stock markets were closed to enable a big
turnout of voters.
</P>
<P>
There are 34 million registered voters in the country and the
Commission on Election, which oversees the election, projected an
85 percent turnout in Monday's election, 10 percent higher than in
the 1992 elections.
</P>
<P>
The voters choose a new president as well as a vice president,
12 out of the 24 senators, all the 260 members of the House of
Representatives and 17,000 local officials.
</P>
<P>
Ten candidates are contending the presidency to replace
President Fidel Ramos, who is barred from a second term by the
constitution and will step down on June 30.
</P>
<P>
The top front runners in the presidential race, according to
the latest opinion polls, are Vice President Joseph Estrada from
Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino (Fight of Patriotic Filipino
Masses), and House Speaker Jose de Venecia from the ruling
Lakas-National Union of Christian Democrats (Lakas-NUCD).
</P>
<P>
A poll by the Social Weather Station published last Thursday
put Estrada's support rating at 33 percent, and De Venecia trailed
in second place with 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other front runners include former Manila mayor Alfredo Lim
from the Liberal Party, Senator Raul Roco from Aksyon Demokratiko
(Democratic Action) Party and ex-governor Emilio Osmena from
Progressive Movement for Devolution of Initiative (PROMODI).
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here said that as ten candidates are running
in the presidential race, none of them could get the majority
support, and a dark horse might emerge in the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
The election commission is not expected to come out with the
official results of the polls in less than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
To prevent election-related violence, the government has
deployed thousands of policemen and soldiers at hundreds of "hot
spots," or violence-prone areas, in the capital city of Manila and
other regions.
</P>
<P>
During the 1992 elections, over 100 people were killed in
election-related violence.
</P>
<P>
The situation has improved in the current elections compared
with the previous ones. Since the election period started in
January, 33 people have been killed in election-related violence.
</P>
<P>
As a final step to ensure Monday's political exercise the "best
and the most credible" in the Philippine history, Ramos invited
all the presidential and vice presidential candidates to a
breakfast meeting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, the presidential candidates and
their running mates signed the Statement of Affirmation of
"Honest, Orderly and Peaceful" Elections, while Ramos also affixed
his signature on the document as a witness.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, an official of the election commission predicted
an election failure in many parts of the country, particularly in
the Southern Mindanao, where ballot-rigging would spark
large-scale violence.

"Honest, Orderly and Peaceful" Elections, while Ramos also affixed
his signature on the document as a witness.

<P>
Two weeks ago, an official of the election commission predicted
an election failure in many parts of the country, particularly in
the Southern Mindanao, where ballot-rigging would spark
large-scale violence.

<HEADLINE> Elections Begin in Philippines, Violence Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine general elections,
which began early Monday, could be relatively peaceful and
orderly, but violence in the Southern part of the country is
likely to take place.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest reports from most parts of the country,
election officials and poll watchers are expecting relatively
orderly and peaceful elections.
</P>
<P>
But in the southern part of the country, particularly in
Mindanao, election-related violence is still expected despite the
deployment of troops and policemen in violence-prone areas, the
reports said
</P>
<P>
The casting of votes started at 07:00 local time (GMT 2300
Sunday) in most of 174,374 precincts across the nation, and is
scheduled to end at 15:00 (GMT 0700 Monday).
</P>
<P>
In Davao, a city in Mindanao, violence could take place in at
least three areas, but most of the two million registered voters
will cast their votes, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
In the Southern city of Cebu, violence could not be avoided in
some parts, observers there said.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, an official of the election commission predicted
an election failure in many parts of the country, particularly in
the Southern Mindanao, where ballot-rigging would spark
large-scale violence.
</P>
<P>
Monday was declared as "a special holiday" nationwide. Offices,
schools, shops and stock markets were closed to enable a big
turnout of voters.
</P>
<P>
There are 34 million registered voters in the country and the
Commission on Election, which oversees the election, projected an
85 percent turnout in Monday's election, 10 percent higher than in
the 1992 elections.
</P>
<P>
The voters choose a new president as well as a vice president,
12 out of the 24 senators, all the 260 members of the House of
Representatives and 17,000 local officials.
</P>
<P>
Ten candidates are contending the presidency to replace
President Fidel Ramos, who is barred from a second term by the
constitution and will step down on June 30.
</P>
<P>
The top front runners in the presidential race, according to
the latest opinion polls, are Vice President Joseph Estrada from
Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino (Fight of Patriotic Filipino
Masses), and House Speaker Jose de Venecia from the ruling
Lakas-National Union of Christian Democrats (Lakas-NUCD).
</P>
<P>
Other front runners include former Manila mayor Alfredo Lim
from the Liberal Party, Senator Raul Roco from Aksyon Demokratiko
(Democratic Action) Party and ex-governor Emilio Osmena from
Progressive Movement for Devolution of Initiative (PROMODI).
</P>
<P>
To prevent election-related violence, the government has
deployed thousands of policemen and soldiers at hundreds of "hot
spots," or violence-prone areas, in the capital city of Manila and
other regions.
</P>
<P>
During the 1992 elections, over 100 people were killed in
election-related violence.
</P>
<P>
The situation has improved in the current elections compared
with the previous ones. Since the election period started in
January, 33 people have been killed in election-related violence.

<P>
Political analysts here say as ten candidates are running in
the presidential race, none of them could get the majority
support, and a dark horse could emerge in the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
The election commission is not expected to come out with the
results of the presidential polls in less than two weeks.

<HEADLINE> 8 Woman Senators Elected in Nigerian Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Eight women are among the 109
senators elected in the April 25 National Assembly (parliament)
election, the News Agency of Nigeria reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Only one woman was elected senator when the west African
country introduced the presidential system of government in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The election of the eight woman senators came as excitement to
the National council of Women Societies (NCWS), which said it
shows that women in the country are ready to fight for their
rights democratically.
</P>
<P>
"We are comfortable with the number of female senators," said
NCWS Public Relations Official Salome Jankada, adding that "we
are ready to stand by them."
</P>
<P>
With them and the support of their male counterparts, issues
affecting women will be adequately taken care of, she noted.
