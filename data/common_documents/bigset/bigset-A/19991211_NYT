PICKUP POSSIBLY USED BY ESCAPED KILLER AND PRISON GUARD IS FOUND 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The pickup truck thought to have been used
in the October disappearance of a convicted murderer and a prison
guard was found near Joplin, Mo., investigators said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are searching the 1989 Ford F-150 for clues to the
whereabouts of Terry Banks, the killer, and Lynette Barnett, the
corrections officer who authorities think helped Banks escape from
the Crossroads Correctional Center in Cameron, Mo., on Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
   The truck was sold by relatives of Banks for about $2,000 to a
woman near Joplin on Nov. 18, said FBI agent Kurt Lipanovich, who
is working on the case. Authorities found the truck Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just an innocent third party in this,'' Lipanovich said
of the truck's buyer, whom he would not identify.
</P>
<P>
   Lipanovich would not say whether Banks' relatives would be
charged in connection with the case.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Barnett's belongings were found in the truck, said
Lipanovich. He would not describe the items.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett's mother, Faye Moots, said she had not been told what
items were found in the truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly hope this means there's a breakthrough,'' Moots
said, ``that there's hope she may come back alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett had cashed her $1,400 paycheck in a Kansas City, Mo.,
liquor store the night of the disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us a direction of travel,'' Lipanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Lipanovich said the couple probably were driving another
vehicle, but authorities didn't know what it could be.
</P>
<P>
   Banks, 26, was convicted of first-degree murder in 1995 and was
serving a life term without parole. The murder occurred in Rocky
Comfort, Mo., just southeast of where the truck was found. Banks
lived in southwest Missouri when he killed Tim Eastburn on Nov. 19,
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Banks is white, 6 feet tall and weighs about 190 pounds. He has
fair skin, red hair and hazel eyes. He has several tattoos,
including a Tasmanian devil on his left arm and the Roman numeral
IV on his left hand. He has a scar on his right hand and a scar
from a stab wound on his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett, 27, is white, with green eyes and red hair that may be
dyed blonde. She is 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighs about 120
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The pair will be featured on the television show ``America's
Most Wanted'' tonight.

COLLEGE OF OZARKS MOURNS SIX KILLED IN CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW SCHOFIELD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POINT LOOKOUT, Mo. -- On Wednesday afternoon, Jerry Watson sent
a memo around to teachers and co-workers in his building at College
of the Ozarks.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, an associate professor of graphic arts and head of the
College Press, simply said, ``Tomorrow...I will be gone all day.
Please continue on the work grades...don't forget to pick up your
Christmas gift...see you on Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a note he wrote the day before he would be one of six
members of the College of the Ozarks family to die in a plane crash
less than four miles from the campus airstrip.
</P>
<P>
   The memory was also, according to those who knew him, a classic
example of the way Watson, 55, looked at life. Nowhere in the note,
nor in conversations he had with colleagues before the trip, did he
mention he would be in St. Louis on Thursday accepting a
prestigious Governor's Award for Excellence in Teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no gloat in that man,'' said colleague and former
Watson student Craig Cogdill. ``Instead of bragging, he was
worrying that someone might forget their Christmas turkey. That's
just who he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Also killed were Watson's wife, Pat, 55; Marvin Oetting, 61, the
school's chairman of technical and applied sciences, and his wife,
Judy, 59; Joe Brinell, the 54-year-old airport director who was
piloting the Cessna Citation; and student and co-pilot Bart Moore,
22.
</P>
<P>
   Watson joined the College of the Ozarks faculty in 1971. In the
past three decades he became an institution on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Campus Press is Jerry Watson,'' Cogdill said. ``He had
printer's ink in his blood. It was what he loved. How do you ever
replace a man like that?''
</P>
<P>
   That's a question a lot of people -- faculty, students,
employees -- at this small Ozarks school are asking about all six.
Crash investigation
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators on Friday began scouring the crash site.
Debris from the crash was scattered over about 100 yards on the
Ruth and Paul Henning Conservation Area, a heavily wooded nature
reserve west of downtown Branson.
</P>
<P>
   Officials had determined that the plane crashed in the reserve
about 3.7 miles from the runway. Both wings were dislodged, and the
plane's impact started a small fire. Investigators have ruled out
an explosion on the plane, according to David Bowling, an air and
safety investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage will be removed with a crane this morning and taken
to the campus airport's hangar to be searched for further clues.
</P>
<P>
   The six bodies were taken to a Branson funeral home, where
autopsies will be performed, city spokesman Jerry Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's pilots last communicated with the school's airport
tower at 3:08 p.m. Central time, said Ed Washington, duty officer
with the Federal Aviation Administration's office in Kansas City,
Mo. The wreckage was found about 6:20 p.m. by a Branson police
officer.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known if the foggy weather played a role in the
crash, but the weather did affect the travel plans of others
attending the Governor's Conference on Higher Education.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mel Carnahan was scheduled to fly back to Jefferson City,
Mo., from St. Louis on Thursday evening after a campaign event. But
his son, Randy, who was piloting his plane, decided the weather was
too bad to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Other pilots trying to leave St. Louis after the conference also
had to change their plans because of fog and rain in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Hubbard, president of Northwest Missouri State University,
rented a car and drove back to Maryville with his provost. His
pilot decided not to fly the university's plane, and commercial
airlines at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport were grounded,
too.
A college's loss
</P>
<P>
   The College of the Ozarks campus was quiet on Friday, both in
mourning and by design. Friday was a day for studying, the day
between classes and final exams, which begin today.
</P>
<P>
   It's normally a day when students leave their studies only for
on-campus jobs and meals. But this day found students gathering on
sidewalks, echoing each other in saying, ``I can't believe it.''
Eyes were wet or bloodshot from recent tears.
</P>
<P>
   On a campus this small, with 1,500 students and 235 faculty and
staff, there is no escaping reminders of this loss. Walk one way
and there is a section of campus devoted to agriculture. A section
synonymous with Marvin and Judy Oetting. The Oettings, who lived in
a college house just beyond the campus dairy barn, were well-known
and well-liked.
</P>
<P>
   Herb Keith, associate professor of agriculture, said he'd worked
with Marvin Oetting for 29 years. Oetting designed the academic
portion of the agriculture curriculum, Keith said.
</P>
<P>
   But his true love was always the nuts and bolts of it. Until the
day he died Oetting was frequently seen among the dairy cattle,
where he stopped to chat with students and offer advice. Even more,
he spent his off hours tending to his personal beef cattle herd.
</P>
<P>
   Keith said, ``Judy retired about a year ago, and both of them
were just really enjoying spending time with the grandkids. He was
getting ready to retire himself, although in his heart he was a
farmer and I'm not really sure what the difference between a
retired farmer and a nonretired farmer really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the agriculture section of campus, roads wander out to
the airport where Joe Brinell and Bart Moore were fixtures. Eric
Middleton, a 19-year-old sophomore from Wichita, Kan., said
everyone involved in aviation liked and respected Brinell and
Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were both up here a lot, and they flew together all the
time,'' he said. ``They were both really experienced, really good
pilots.''
</P>
<P>
   Middleton recalled helping start the plane Thursday morning. In
fact, he said he thinks he's the last person at the school to see
the six that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out there, starting the auxiliary units to get the jets
running. Everything looked great. They were doing well, and the
plane was running beautifully. There is no way we can speculate on
what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   From where he helped them take off Thursday morning to where
they crashed on return Thursday afternoon is only a few miles
across the Ozarks hills.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the center of campus, there's the administration
building where Pat Watson had begun working in the mid-1990s and
quickly became a student favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Roberts, a 21-year-old senior from Kansas City, Mo., said
he found it hard to believe Friday morning when he arrived at work
that Watson's smiling face wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a mother figure to a lot of us here,'' he said. ``Kids
were constantly in her office, just chatting or asking for advice.
She never turned anyone away.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials were waiting for family members to decide on
memorial services for the victims. The campus chapel held a prayer
service Friday night for students who needed to grieve.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for working on the 930-acre campus, students at
College of the Ozarks attend for free. Students maintain the
school's classrooms, raise food on campus and even run the school's
fire department and airport _ earning the school the nickname,
``Hard Work U.''
</P>
<P>
   Enoch Smith, a junior from Fort Pierce, Fla., said the deaths of
six such well-known and well-liked people from campus had left
everyone in shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always hear about accidents like this but then it happens
right where you live and to someone you're close to,'' he said.
``You just never know how to react.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess what it does is it makes you realize that life is
precious and sweet and you have to take advantage of every day just
like our friends who won't be returning now. Keep your heart and
life in order.''

A COMMON HEART CONDITION, OF AN UNKNOWN CAUSE, BUT TREATABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (REMOVES reference to Bush in lede; ADDS information on Bradley's
case in 2nd, 8th and last graf) 
(With BRADLEY-HEART)  
(mcd) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is one of 2.2 million Americans who suffer from
atrial fibrillation, an erratic beating in the atria, the upper
chambers of the heart. While in many people it can cause a rapid
heartbeat, in Mr. Brad- ley's case his heart rate is only mild- ly
increased.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who have atrial fibrillation often feel it as a
heartbeat that races one moment and feels sluggish the next, though
Bradley apparently has no such symptoms. If the fibrillation is
severe enough to interfere with the heart's pumping ability, other
symptoms like dizziness, faintness, shortness of breath and fatigue
can result.
</P>
<P>
   The condition itself is not an emergency, and it does not signal
an impending heart attack. Its cause is often unclear. Dr. Robert
H. Heissenbuttel, who examined the Democratic presidential
candidate on Dec. 3, said in a letter dated Dec. 9 and made public
Friday by the Bradley campaign, ``In 1996, you were found to have
atrial fibrillation with no precipitating cause, nor any cardiac
disease identified.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors may treat the fibrillation with drugs or an electrical
shock, called cardioversion, to restore normal rhythm. In Bradley's
case, according to Heissenbuttel, he received cardioversion in
1996, when the condition was first diagnosed; he had four episodes
of fibrillation over the next two years, and in 1998 received two
cardioversions.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, the doctor said in his letter, Bradley began
receiving the drug Procanbid; since that time the candidate had
``had two brief episodes of atrial fibrillation,'' which converted
to normal rhythm by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, Heissenbuttel continued, ``has been effective in
preventing or shortening the duration of episodes and has been well
tolerated with no side effects.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that in the Dec. 3 examination Bradley's heart
function was normal. ``Other than the arrhythmia, you have no other
health issues,'' Heissenbuttel said.
</P>
<P>
   While fibrillation is not life-threatening in itself, when it is
not fully corrected it can cause blood to pool in the atria,
increasing the likelihood of clots and the risk of stroke, although
Mr. Bradley does not. The odds of stroke are practically
nonexistent in young people and minimal in middle age, but the risk
greatly increases in the elderly. For that reason, older people are
strongly urged to take a blood-thinning drug to prevent blood clots
and ward off a stroke. The most commonly used blood thinner is the
drug warfarin, also known as coumadin.
</P>
<P>
   The atria are the upper chambers of the heart. One collects
oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and the other collects
oxygen-poor, used blood from the rest of the body. The atria pump
their blood into the ventricles below. The right ventricle sends
blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen, and the left ventricle pumps
oxygen-rich blood to the body and the brain. Normally, the atria
contract just before the ventricles do, in a strong, synchronized
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   In atrial fibrillation, the atrial rhythm becomes rapid and
irregular, and the abnormal rhythms can disrupt the beating of the
ventricles, causing an irregular or racing pulse.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors cannot always tell why a patient develops atrial
fibrillation. In some cases it is caused by some other form of
underlying heart disease, including coronary artery disease, a
heart attack or diseased heart valves. Lung disease, thyroid
disorders, diabetes and high blood pressure can also bring on the
condition.

SENATOR'S BILL WOULD KEEP DRIVERS OFF CELL PHONES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAX JARMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - State Sen. Tom Smith wants Arizonans to follow the
suggestion on a popular bumper sticker: ``Hang up and drive.''
</P>
<P>
   The east Phoenix Republican has drafted a bill that would make
it illegal to talk on the telephone or use a computer while driving
a motorized vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has prefiled the measure and expects to be debated when
the Legislature convenes in January. He's the only sponsor, but
says the bill has the backing of a groundswell of constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'm surprised at the amount of support I've
received,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona chapter of the Automobile Association of America,
however, remains neutral on the bill. It encourages its members to
use handless communications devices in vehicles and believes more
research is needed on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular phone companies contacted oppose the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Janine Liscic, a spokeswoman for US West Wireless in Denver,
said her firm opposes legislating the way people use telephones. It
advocates education that stresses the safe use of such devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the bill is not necessary,'' said Jim McPhearson, a
spokesman for AT&AMP;T Wireless in Phoenix. ``Drivers' safety is
essential, but restricting the use of this tool goes beyond the
scope of proper public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he drafted the measure in response to repeated
concerns from constituents over the safety issues posed by the
growing use of wireless telephones in vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have told me horror stories about people
talking on cell phones while driving,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would give drivers a two-minute grace period to get off
the roadway and park their vehicle after receiving or initiating a
phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers, emergency vehicle drivers and operators of
commercial vehicles that use electronic devices in the scope of
their work would be exempt. Also exempt would be drivers who used
their phones to report reckless drivers or a dangerous situation.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Arizona Department of Transportation nor the Phoenix
Police Department track the incidence of cell phone-related traffic
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an item on the accident reports we use,'' said Lt.
Geary Brasi in the Phoenix Police Department's Traffic Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Brasi doesn't believe cell phones are a significant cause of
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking on a cell phone would fall under `inattention,' which
is a relatively insignificant cause of accidents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speeding and red-light running remain the most frequent culprits
in accidents, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that it's reasonable for lawmakers to say no one
can talk on the phone and drive,'' Brasi said.
</P>
<P>
   But Brasi noted that lawmakers have banned video screens from
the front seats of moving vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of vehicular phone use is part of a dramatic increase
in wireless phones in general. The Cellular Telecommunications
Industry Association in Washington, D.C., says that from 1994 to
1999, U.S. wireless customers have increased from 19 million to 80
million.
</P>
<P>
   That increased usage has led to a spate of proposed bills to
prohibit talking and driving.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Lisa Ihde, a cell phone trade group
spokeswoman, the only area in the United States that has banned the
practice for the general public is the Cleveland suburb of
Brooklyn, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In September, it began to ticket those who chat and drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming a popular thing for legislators to propose,''
Ihde said.
</P>
<P>
   Many other cities around the country, including Chicago, are
considering similar bans. New York City already prohibits
cabdrivers from phoning while driving.
</P>
<P>
   Several foreign countries have banned or limited cell phone use
while driving.
</P>
<P>
   In England, Singapore and Brazil, drivers must use hands-free
attachments on their phones. Israel, Spain, Germany, Switzerland,
Japan Italy, Portugal and Chile and parts of Australia have imposed
cell phone bans or restrictions on all drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Some states have attempted to address the issue. California
requires rental cars with phones to have safety instructions on
operating the device.
</P>
<P>
   The cell phone trade group has launched a vigorous campaign
aimed at educating drivers how to safely use their car phones.
</P>
<P>
   The association encourages the use of handless devices, such as
earpieces, head phones or car kits that act like speaker phones.
</P>
<P>
   Other tips include keeping the phone within reach; not looking
up numbers while driving; and not using a car phone for stressful
or angry conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The association stresses that wireless phones are important
safety devices. Ihde said wireless phones are used to make almost
100,000 calls to 911 each day, most of them from vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Last session, Smith sponsored a bill that the Legislature passed
into law that gave consumers more powers against annoying and
fraudulent telemarketers. &QL;

INDIAN RELIGIONS CLASH WITH PROPOSED TELESCOPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER
 &HT;     c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
(TUCSON) - In a quiet canyon south of Tucson, Indian religious
observances and the study of qua sars appear to be on a collision
course.
<P>
   Smithsonian scientists next week will submit another application
to build a giant gamma ray telescope array at the Fred Lawrence
Whipple Observatory at the base of Mount Hopkins. The site is about
a quarter-mile from a Navajo-style sweat lodge, whose operator
fears it will interfere with his ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service denied the observatory's first request,
submit ted last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just submitted one site, which wasn't enough to do an
analysis,'' Forest Service spokes woman Gail Aschenbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   But Trevor Weekes, a senior astrophysicist, said the service
cited several reasons for the initial denial, including the
objections of Native Americans and incompatibility of use with the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Aschenbrenner and Weekes said they believe the telescope and the
sweat lodge can share the site in Montosa Canyon, about 35 miles
south of Tucson in the Santa Rita Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   But sweat lodge operator Cayce Boone, a Navajo, said he feels
betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they made a ruling and they couldn't re-appeal it,''
he said. ``But somehow, it went through the loophole.''
</P>
<P>
   Resolving the conflict could be tricky. The Whipple Observatory
has been operating on the site since 1968; the lodge began
performing traditional purifying ceremonies and weddings nearly a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The $16 million gamma ray telescope would be composed of six
dishes arranged at the corners of a hexagon. A seventh telescope
would be placed in the center of the hexagon.
</P>
<P>
   Each 34-foot dish would be used to study quasars, pulsars,
superno vae and other bodies that emit the highest radiation in the
cosmos. The telescope is designed to shed light on high-energy
physics, or physics under extreme conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The observatory is a member of the prestigious
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cam bridge, Mass.
The center operates several telescopes on Mount Hop kins, one of
the premier spots for astronomical observation in the con tinental
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Weekes believes the sweat lodge has ``a misconception that the
telescope will disturb its aura.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the main road to the existing telescope passes
within 50 yards of the lodge. A smaller road to the proposed
telescope would be farther away, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to modify our design to make it the least possible
impact on their activitieekes said. ``It's by no means an
ancient site, and there are no archaeological remains there.''
</P>
<P>
   Weekes and other astronomers involved in the project hope to
meet with Boone and representatives of his group, To All Our
Relations, to iron out any disagreements. Boone's objections to the
earlier proposal were supported by the Tohono O'odham, Hopi,
Navajo, Yaqui and other tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Aschenbrenner said the Forest Service supports such talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be best to come to the table, find common ground and
share the canyon,'' she said. ``We'd like to find room for both
uses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service will have the final say on whether the new
telescope is allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Weekes would not say what the observatory will do if its request
is denied a second time. ``We haven't crossed that road yet.'' The

DOCTOR FAULTS STUDY SHOWING THAT THOUSANDS DIE FROM MEDICAL
MISTAKES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- A Kansas City area physician says recent
claims that hospital medical errors kill 44,000 to 98,000 patients
a year is the result of suspect research.
</P>
<P>
   James Ruhlen, an internist practicing in Olathe, Kan., since
1975, related in a recent letter how the figures were so at odds
with his own experience he decided to review the research.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine report attributed massive numbers of
deaths to medical malpractice, which has prompted the National
Academy of Sciences to urge creation of a federal agency to monitor
medical safety.
</P>
<P>
   One of the institute's most puzzling charges was that health
care is significantly behind other high-risk industries in its
attention to safety issues. For most who have had recent experience
with America's health-care system, this revelation must certainly
have been as shocking as it was surprising. The occasional
anecdotal horror story aside, the general level of safety in the
U.S. health-care system has been widely perceived as the standard
by which systems throughout the world are measured.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, as a matter of fairness, it also seems anyone trying
to quantify malpractice deaths should also try to quantify lives
saved. It's possible, after all, that physicians in the United
States are victims of too much success. Life-saving procedures
considered miracles a generation ago have become routine. Americans
are living longer lives of higher quality because physicians and
their hospital support staffs are better trained and their
equipment is more advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Ruhlen criticizes the two studies as too few and too narrowly
based. Moreover, he says, they weren't based on random selection as
claimed. Therefore, the results appear to be extrapolations from
higher-risk patient samples.
</P>
<P>
   Ruhlen said that because one study selected only 31,000 of a
pool of 2.6 million records, the overweighting of high-risk
patients hugely amplified the potential for the sort of negative
numbers the research produced. In the other study, a similar
exclusion of lower-risk subjects ``tended to enrich the pool for
adverse outcomes.''
</P>
<P>
   What calls the project's motivation into question was the swift
call for creation of more government oversight, particularly the
proposed mandate to report and publicly disclose medical errors.
This may sound reasonable, but it might put physicians in a box
that would diminish the quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of Big Brother looking over everyone's shoulder is
how it would further encourage defensive medicine of the sort that
proliferating lawsuits already promote. The less willing physicians
are to treat serious ailments aggressively, the more such
reluctance might be to the patient's detriment.
</P>
<P>
   Ruhlen's bottom-line contention is that the study vastly
overstated the problem because statistics from the Institute of
Medicine itself already showed a 50 percent reduction in
preventable deaths from 1984-92.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Congress does feel a need to do more,'' Ruhlen suggests,
``funding a truly random study of adverse events in hospital
admissions in 2001 might be a good place to start, to see if
another 50 percent reduction in preventable deaths and injuries has
already taken place, as I suspect (any such) study would show.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a 59- count indictment in federal court in
Albuquerque, the government today accused Wen Ho Lee not just of
being a scientist who inadvertently mis- handled classified
materials but also of being someone who repeatedly and willfully
compromised Ameri- ca's most sensitive nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The effort, which officials said would ultimately involve reams
of technical evidence of illegal computer transfers, was intended
to counter what prosecutors fear might be Lee's best defense: the
argument that scientists routinely mishandled sensitive, classified
materials at the government's weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and federal prosecutors are expected to offer evidence
that they say will show that the magni- tude of the transfers, and
the way in which they were done, fits a pattern of illegal activity
that differentiates Lee from other federal employ- ees who have
inadvertently mishan- dled classified materials.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not accuse Lee, a former scientist at Los Alamos
National Laboratory, of giving nuclear information to another
country or even to any unauthorized individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, prosecutors said he transferred secret information from
a classified computer network at Los Alamos into an unsecure
system, then copied much of the information onto portable,
high-volume computer tapes, some of which are missing.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the files included thousands of pages of
documents related to the design, construction and testing of
America's nuclear weapons arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyers and other supporters have said that he is the
victim of a selective, racist and highly politicized prosecution by
a government that has ignored other cases involving the mishandling
of classified documents.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Mark Holscher, on Friday indirectly attacked
Republicans in Congress who have pushed for a more aggressive
investigation of Lee, saying that ``it is particularly unfortunate
that the prosecutive decisions in this case have been influenced by
other branches of government whose political motives and agendas
are suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Holscher and other supporters of Lee's have pointed
to the case of John M. Deutch, the former CIA director, who was
investigated for mishandling classified information on his personal
computer. Deutch had his security clearance removed but was not
charged with any crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's position in the X Division at Los Alamos, which handled
the laboratory's secret work on nuclear weapons design, gave him
access to a computer network containing classified nuclear weapons
designs and related materials.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, investigators said, he had access to an
unclassified, or open network, and a third computer, known as
Machine C, that served as a bridge between the classified and
unclassified networks. Machine C was used by bomb designers when
they needed to use both classified and unclassified materials. It
allowed them to bring both kinds of materials together without
declassifying the secret material. When they were finished, the
designers were required to return the classified and unclassified
materials to their respective systems, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges that Lee misused Machine C in order to
unilaterally declassify thousands of pages of nuclear weapons
documents. He moved classified documents onto Machine C, erased the
classification markings on the documents and then moved them into
the unsecure, or open computer system, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a massive amount of declassifying without authority to
do so,'' a government official said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee then copied the files onto high-volume computer tapes, the
indictment said. In 1993 and 1994, Lee copied about 380 of those
computer files onto nine portable computer tapes. Of those tapes,
two have been recovered by the FBI, while the other seven are
missing. In 1997, Lee copied classified data onto a 10th tape, but
that tape has been recovered, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Included on the copied documents were the so-called Legacy
codes, which provide mathematical approximations of U.S. weapons
designs.
</P>
<P>
   The government has charged that the transfers covered a range of
secret documents, including ``data files that contain information
relating to the physical and radioactive properties used to
construct nuclear weapons,'' information ``that includes
descriptions of the exact dimensions and geometry of nuclear
weapons used in connection with the design and simulated testing of
nuclear weapons, and the computer instructions to set up a
simulated nuclear weapons detonation.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, the indictment said, Lee transferred information
concerning nuclear bomb test problems and yield calculations from
actual bomb tests as well as the computer programs needed to run
the design and testing files.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not random files, this is not general information,''
a senior government official said.
</P>
<P>
   The government began its investigation of Lee in connection with
China's apparent theft of secret data related to the W-88 warhead,
which was designed at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Lee had been the main suspect in that investigation for nearly
three years, but the FBI never found evidence that he committed
espionage.
</P>
<P>
   In September, after determining that the initial inquiry into
the W-88 theft had been flawed and that it prematurely focused on
Lee, the FBI and Justice Department widened its investigation to
look for other possible sources for the leak.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the government said it determined that Lee had
violated security regulations at Los Alamos, and he was fired in
March. After he was dismissed, investigators said a search of his
computer turned up evidence of unauthorized transfers of classified
data and the government started a new inquiry to determine the
extent and possible damage from Lee's computer activities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The FBI assigned teams of forensic computer experts to
reconstruct and review Lee's computer activities across several
networks throughout the Los Alamos complex.
</P>
<P>
   What the computer experts found, according to officials, was
that on Feb. 10, within two hours of when Lee had been told that he
had failed a polygraph examination, he began to delete hundreds of
computer files in the open system that contained the classified
data he had transferred.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Lee also took one of the portable computer
tapes containing classified material, loaded the data onto a
server, deleted the information from the tape and then returned the
tape to his office. The result was that the tape did not appear to
contain any classified information.
</P>
<P>
   But FBI experts were able to reconstruct all of the deleted
files on that tape and elsewhere in the computer system, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a search of his office, the FBI also found two of the
computer tapes containing classified data and handwritten
instructions explaining how to accomplish many of the computer
transfers that Lee apparently had conducted, officials added.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors have asked Lee's attorneys to account for
the missing tapes, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Holscher said in a statement that he had offered ``to make Dr.
Lee available to a mutually agreeable polygraph examiner to prove
that at no time did he criminally mishandle any classified material
that was in his possession and that he did not provide any
classified information to any unauthorized parties.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Lee was innocent and that he was ``extremely
disappointed by the Justice Department's refusal to explore
approaches which would establish that Lee did not in any way
criminally violate the laws of the United States while working as
an employee at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.''
</P>
<P>
   To prove that Lee was not singled out unfairly by being
prosecuted for routine computer activities, government officials
said the FBI interviewed 700 employees at Los Alamos, including 400
current and former employees in the division where Lee worked.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, whose department oversees the
nuclear laboratories, has agreed to declassify some nuclear-related
information, in part to allow scientists from Los Alamos to testify
about the significance of the classified material transferred by
Lee.

FONTANA HIGH PLAYERS FACE CRIMINAL CHARGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL OBERJUERGE  
 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five Fontana High School football players face criminal charges
after allegedly attacking coaches of an opposing football team last
month, according to officials.
</P>
<P>
   One of the five players, 18-year-old fullback Anthony Robinson,
was charged Friday with one count of ``battery on school grounds,''
for allegedly attacking a Loyola High School football coach during
a melee after a Nov.19 game at Pierce College in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The crime is punishable by up to one year in jail ine/or a
$2,000 fine, according to the office of Los Angeles City Attorney
Jim Hahn.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson is scheduled for arraignment Jan.4 in Van Nuys
Municipal Court.
</P>
<P>
   The other four`hi plaqess, described as ``arrestees,'' are
juveniles, and were not identified by authorities because of their
age. Their cases have been referred to the Los Angeles County
Probation Department.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the highly publicized incident, which came after
Fontana's 28-7 playoffs loss to Loyola, four Fohi players were
recommended for expulsion by principal Mike Demmer, and nine were
suspended from school for one week for their part in the postgame
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is clear that not only the district doesn't
tolerate (fighting), the law doesn't either,'' said Gus Hawthorne,
a member of the Fontana school board.
</P>
<P>
   The five Fohi players ``are accused of attacking members of the
Loyola coaching staff on the field ... as the two teams were lining
up for a postgame handshake,'' according to a news release from
Hahn's office. ``Investigators said the attack appeared to have
been unprovoked.''
</P>
<P>
   The release indicated ``four Loyola coaches suffered injuries in
the attack, ranging from a chipped tooth (to a) cut lip, bruises,
concussions and neck sprains.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who rushed for 174 yards and a touchdown this season
as the team's No.1 fullback, was not one of the four players
recommended for expulsion from school, principal Demmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was one of the nine players suspended, and he has
returned to campus. ``He was at school today,'' Demmer said Friday
night. ``I feel bad for Anthony because I know him, and this isn't
typical for him. He'll get through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Demmer could not explain why the Los Angeles Police Department,
which handled the investigation, arrested a player Fohi
administrators recommended only for suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to draw the line somewhere,'' Demmer said. ``We set our
criteria, and we went by that. The police do what they have to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Fohi officials based their disciplinary recommendations
aftersxudying videotape of the postgame melee, which at least one
Fohi player said came after Loyola coaches used racial slurs.
</P>
<P>
   Demmer said the district ``over the next several weeks'' will
review policies for handling football postgame situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to put your kids in this kind of situation
again, especially in a high-pressure game,'' Demmer said. ``You get
'em all wound up, and then expect them to drop to the bottom and go
out and shake hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make coaches more attentive to what people are
saying on sidelines and what the mood of the team is so we can make
a betteR pecision at the end of game.''
</P>
<P>
   Fontana coach Bob Stangel Jr. was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Demmer said he was ``stunned'' when he heard late Friday of the
players' arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some points this becomes counterproductive,'' he said.
``They're kids. They made a mistake. And we're still dragging this
out three weeks later ...
</P>
<P>
   ``A tew players really made a mess, and there's no way you can
get around it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne, the school board member, said school district
officials ``need to pick up from this point and go on. We have the
job of educating 37,000 kids, and we need to concentrate on that
and the future.''

PINCAY BREAKS RECORD
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Laffit Pincay's 8,834th winner, a colt named
Irish Nip running in a mere maiden race, arrived shortly after 3
o'clock Friday afternoon with a winter wind blowing in the jockey's
face and fewer than 6,000 fans cheering from a Hollywood Park
grandstand built for four times that many.
</P>
<P>
   Not the setting you'd choose for what Hollywood Park executives
were calling ``the last great sporting achievement of the 20th
century.''
</P>
<P>
   But perfectly fitting for Pincay, the 52-year-old Panamanian who
has proven the adage that 90 percent of greatness is showing up _
fit and ready to ride any horse in any weather on any day big or
small.
</P>
<P>
   ``He rode in rain, snow, sleet, it didn't matter,'' Bill
Shoemaker, whose record had just been broken, said in the
celebration that followed. ``He wouldn't take off, like most jocks
would do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a blue-collar guy,'' said Bob Meldahl, Pincay's agent for
most of a decade in which his dedication has often been tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it mattered what kind of race it was,'' said
Laffit Pincay III, the jockey's 24-year-old son, ``as long as he
got it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The record that Pincay has called ``my dream,'' the milestone
that has kept him in competition as the oldest jockey at a major
American racetrack, fell in the sixth race when Irish Nip outran 11
other horses to the finish on the turf course.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, Pincay described the feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I won the Kentucky Derby all over again,'' said
the man who rode Swale to a Derby victory in 1984. He expressed a
long list of thank yous _ to his wife, Jeanine, to his family, to
Meldahl, to Fred Hooper, the owner who brought Pincay to the United
States in 1966, and to ``the trainers and owners that supported me
all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   Pincay had tied Shoemaker's record Thursday with a victory
aboard I Be Casual, marking his fourth consecutive day with at
least one winner.
</P>
<P>
   He finished fifth, third and third in earlier races Friday,
picking up one mount because scheduled rider Victor Espinoza was
late, saying he overslept. Pincay went into the Irish Nip race as a
5-2 favorite, bet down from 6-1 morning-line odds by
souvenir-hunters and sentimentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mandella-trained Irish Nip, fifth in his only previous
outing, shot out of the gate at the start of the 1 1/16-mile race,
and Pincay found himself dueling for the lead with jockey Iggy
Puglisi and Laps n'Bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Irish Nip actually was headed by Laps n'Bounds while racing near
the rail on the second turn. But straightening for home, Pincay
pushed to the front and, whipping his colt right-handed, drew off
to what would become a two-length victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's history at Hollywood Park!'' track announcer Michael
Wrona shouted as Pincay waved his whip overhead and his family and
fellow jockeys surged toward the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   Winning trainer Mandella, a Pincay loyalist in the jockey's
leanest years, beamed as he greeted the horse and jockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I studied (Friday's) races last night, I thought the
Mandella horse would be my best chance,'' Pincay said later. ``He'd
run on turf, and he didn't run bad.'' Indeed, it was Pincay's only
winner of the day in six tries.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Park was hard-pressed to top Thursday's celebration of
the record-tying win, but track management succeeded. Fireworks
spelled out ``Congratulations'' atop the tote board. Balloons
tumbled from the grandstand roof. Fellow jockeys sprayed champagne,
soaking Pincay's gold and green silks. Then they carried him and
his 6-year-old son Jean-Laffit on their shoulders to the scale. As
always, Pincay weighed in at 117 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Video messages from other jockeys, including Johnny Longden _
who held the record for 14 years before Shoemaker broke it in 1970
_ were unspooled on the infield television screen.
</P>
<P>
   Deadpanned Braulio Baeza, another riding great from Panama:
``It's about time you did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Park president Rich Baedeker took the microphone and
presented Pincay with his next great ride _ a $50,000 Porsche
purchased by the Southern California racetracks.
</P>
<P>
   At the postrace press conference, a track chef walked in with a
steak dinner, because Pincay has been saying he'd celebrate the
record with that rare treat. Pincay said he'd eat it later. He'd
waited this long.
</P>
<P>
   As for the horseflesh: Irish Nip was the 44,646th ride of a
35-year career in which Pincay has won seven national earnings
titles, been voted a record five Eclipse Awards as the nation's
outstanding jockey, and endured the most celebrated diets in
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lifetime of sacrifice and hard work, this is the
dividend,'' Laffit III, a budding sportscaster in New York, said of
his father. ``After 35 years of starving, you have to ask yourself,
`Was it worth it?' This leaves no question it was.''

LIPINSKI LEADS WOMEN, URAMNOV LEADS MEN

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The youngest athletes performed the best when the
Metabolife world professional figure skating championships began
Friday night at the MCI Center. But before and during the
competition, the hearts of many of the 10,622 spectators seemed to
belong to the two oldest skaters here _ Denise Biellmann of
Switzerland, who will turn 37 Saturday, and Brian Boitano, 36, of
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday night's technical program, with Saturday night's
artistic program to come, the leaders were the 17-year-old Tara
Lipinski of Sugar Land, Texas, among the women and the 26-year-old
Aleksei Urmanov of Russia among the men. Biellmann ranked second
among the five women; Ilya Kulik, 22, of Russia was second and
Brian Boitano was third among the five men.
</P>
<P>
   Lipinski, the 1977 world and 1988 Olympic champion, skated a
sound technical program marred only by a shaky landing on a triple
lutz. She did three triple jumps, but no jump combinations. Surya
Bonaly of France and Biellmann did solid combinations. Lipinski
said she was not trying to play it safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a combination scheduled,'' said the young master
of combinations. ``If I tried one, I'd be off my music and would
have stopped the flow of my program. I have three triples tomorrow,
but no combinations.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without a combination jump, Lipinski's 14 scores showed
eight 9.9s and six 9.8s. In the complex scoring system, she totaled
98.6 points to 97.7 for Biellmann, 97.4 for Bonaly, 97.3 for Oksana
Baiul and 96.3 for Tonia Kwiatkowski.
</P>
<P>
   Biellmann's three triples were clean, and when she did a single
axel instead of a planned double, she did a double seconds later.
``I was very comfortable with the way I skated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When Biellmann won the 1981 world amateur championship in
Hartford, Conn., she dazzled the crowd by spinning on one skate,
with the other skate behind her back and high over her head. She
still does that body-bending move in competition and exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   Boitano does not perform such maneuvers. For the last 13 months,
he has suffered from a curvature of the spine that has led to
pressure on the sciatic nerve and resulting pain. He has had to
temporarily abandon triple and double axels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to do everything else better,'' Boitano said, but
in this new program he did not. A shoulder was out of position for
his first jump, and he did a double lutz instead of a triple.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that,'' he said, ``it was tough. It was a hard program
where I had to hit everything, so when you miss one, it hurts.''

BULLS HAND VICTORY NO. 2 TO BULLS, 71-69 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The rebuilding project of the New Jersey Nets crumbled
Friday night against the ultimate rebuilding project, as the Nets
handed the Chicago Bulls their second victory of the season in the
United Center, 71-69.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, now 4-16, showed few signs of the rhythm they had
found in recent routs of Sacramento and Milwaukee. The Nets were
outshot, outrebounded and outhustled by the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   And these were not your father's Chicago Bulls, nor even your
son's. Forget Jordan, Pippen, Rodman and company, whose six
championship banners hung overhead.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the first half, the Nets were losing by 13 to
the team of Ruffin, Artest, Benjamin, Simpkins and Willoughby. The
security guards, deep in the bowels of the United Center, were
watching hockey on TV.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets could manage only four points in the last four minutes,
and only nine points in the final quarter. The Nets managed only
two fast-break points all night.
</P>
<P>
   With 30 seconds remaining and the score tied at 67-67, Elton
Brand, the No. 1 pick for the Bulls, hit a turnaround from four
feet against Jamie Feick.
</P>
<P>
   Stephon Marbury drove the lane for the Nets, throwing up a shot
with 20 seconds to go. It banked in softly, but Marbury landed on
Dickie Simpkins and was called for an offensive foul.
</P>
<P>
   After Brand hit 1 of 2 free throws to make the lead 70-67 with
17 seconds left, Marbury put up a 3-point shot with 10 seconds to
play. It glanced off the front of the rim, and the Chicago crowd of
22,112 exulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elton played with tremendous energy down the stretch,'' said
Bulls coach Tim Floyd. ``When he doesn't have to think and can
shoot it, he's better off.''
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Armstrong hit another free throw to put it out of reach at
71-67. Marbury then put in a meaningless shot.
</P>
<P>
   The game was slow and ugly. The Nets shot 38 percent, the Bulls
36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The main stinker for the Nets was Marbury, who was 7 of 20 from
the field and finished with 18 points and nine assists, below his
recent output. Keith Van Horn made 9 of 18 for 19 points, and Kerry
Kittles 6 of 10 for 17. The Bulls were let by Brand with 16 and Ron
Artest with 14.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets usually got only one shot per trip, and usually that
shot was from afar, as on offense the Nets were dominated by Will
Perdue and Brand in the post. The Bulls outrebounded the Nets, 54
to 38. The difference showed especially on the offensive boards,
with the Bulls leading 17-7.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period the Nets began to hit more of their shots,
closing to 41-39 at halftime. The run continued after the half. A
slam by Van Horn off a Kendall Gill miss at 6:15 in the 3rd quarter
extended the run to 14-6, with the Nets leading 53-47.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls played without the injured Toni Kukoc, who sat
somberly in black street clothes, and Hersey Hawkins, who missed
his first game since 1993.

BIG CITY: IN FUTURE, TAILOR MAY LOOK A LOT LIKE PLASTIC SURGEON
</HEADLINE>
   (ko)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York's avant-garde has already tackled the first great
question of the 21st century: what to wear? Fashion designers have
issued long-range forecasts for the next millennium that are even
more Delphic than their ones for the next season.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar de la Renta: ``The 21st century will be the very first
century in which we celebrate the power of a woman and the essence
of her femininity.''
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Mizrahi: ``For executives and working people I think it's
going to be about cleanliness. It will be pared down. Very few
details. There will be very few colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Oldham: ``In the future, clothes will be desensitized, less
fraught with social significance.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan: ``I see fashion becoming more holistic. Combining
our spiritual needs with our earthy ones.'' If that's not clear,
keep in mind some theoretical background from Ms. Karan: ``When you
talk about the next millennium, you're talking about the here and
now. Because the future grows out of the present. It's an
evolutionary process.'' Hmm.
</P>
<P>
   Besides those revelations, you can find a few intriguing
predictions in ``Millennium Mode'' (Rizzoli; $50), the new
illustrated book of future fashion assembled by Roberta Wolf and
Trudy Schlacter. Historian Richard Martin discusses clothes that
change color like mood rings. Designer Stephen Strouse envisions
clothes you put on as a liquid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just get in the shower and press the clothing sprocket,''
Strouse says. ``You dip yourself in the clothes and they're
hot-wired to computers to keep you warm or cool, change colors,
whatever.'' If it gets cold, you can grow a hood and some sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the big names, though, make disappointing prophets.
``Fashion,'' Manolo Blahnik declares, ``should become more personal
and more private.'' Mary McFadden predicts that blue jeans will
still rule. Tommy Hilfilger promises ``a balance between high and
low technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   What's needed, obviously, is a prophet who knows nothing about
designing clothes. It takes the unfettered ignorance of a
journalist to make specific forecasts for the next 1,000 years:
</P>
<P>
   CASUAL FRIDAYS WILL DIE. As more people spend more time working
at home dressed in third-millennium sweat pants, they'll experience
a feeling already known to free-lancers: the desire to put on
something dignified on those rare occasions you venture into an
office.
</P>
<P>
   DRESS CODES WILL MAKE A COMEBACK IN CHURCHES AND THEATERS. As
people have more money and time to pursue spiritual and cultural
bliss, they'll notice that communal experiences are not so
transcendent when the people next to them are wearing shorts and
sandals. The trend will begin with rules printed on tickets at
opera houses (``Sports warm-up jackets are not permitted in the
parterre boxes.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``STAR TREK'' CLOTHES WILL FINALLY BECOME A REALISTIC OPTION.
For most of this century, futurists have been imagining everyone in
tight-fitting jump suits, but until now there has been an
insuperable obstacle: the aging human body. Those futurists
obviously never tried to imagine a 60-year-old William Shatner
squeezing into his old uniform. But bioengineering will make
body-sculpturing affordable for the masses, allowing anyone to wear
skin-tight clothes without shame.
</P>
<P>
   THE BIG MONEY WILL BE IN DESIGNER BODY PARTS. Synthetic breasts
will be adorned with initials and little polo ponies as designers
team up with plastic surgeons and say things like, ``Skin is the
ultimate in high-end fabrics.'' The fashion press will cover the
perpetual anxiety over the proper shape of buttocks: ``Is round
finally finished? The spring look in Milan was trim and tapered.''
</P>
<P>
   Once women can design any kind of body, what will men find
sexually appealing? The answer from high-fashion designers will be
a resounding ``Who cares?'' Their socialite clients will continue
dressing for other women, not men. But mass fashions will cater to
men's tastes, which will get very, very kinky.
</P>
<P>
   NATURE WILL MAKE A COMEBACK, SORT OF. As the anatomical fashions
get bolder _ extra breasts on the back, stiletto-shaped feet _
there will be periodic returns to the ``natural'' look (two legs,
two arms). Once wrinkles can be easily eliminated by anyone, some
people will discover a cachet to crow's-feet.
</P>
<P>
   ALL OF THESE FASHION CHOICES WILL TURN OUT TO BE MISTAKES. In
2999, a group of universe-class designers in touch with the
evolutionary nature of history will announce that the next
millennium requires an entirely new wardrobe. And it will not be
cheap.

STARS START, FINISH STRONG TO BEAT PANTHERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Forget the Dallas Stars team that played so well in the
first period to grab a three-goal lead, and forget the one that did
whatever it was they were doing in the second period to cough that
lead up.
</P>
<P>
   They are neither that good or that bad, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, focus on the Stars team that grabbed a go-ahead goal
early in the third period and hung on for a 4-3 victory against the
Florida Panthers on Friday night at Reunion Arena. That is the team
the Stars excel at being, a tight-checking, low-scoring, and yes,
winning hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually thought our third period was better than our
first,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``I thought the first and
third were just solid periods.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that they'd mind if every period for the rest of the season
was like the first period.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars scored three goals, with Sergei Zubov, Joe Nieuwendyk
and Mike Modano all lighting the lamp. There have been 20 games
this season where the Stars didn't score three goals in the entire
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it was the first time in a while we scored three
goals,'' Stars winger Grant Marshall said. ``It surprised us
probably. We just got complacent like we did in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Florida Panthers scored three goals in a span of 1
minute, 40 seconds near the end of the second period to wipe out
the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Mellanby followed by Paul Laus followed by Viktor Kozlov
sent the Stars into the second intermission with their heads
hanging.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are playing a team and you get a 3-0 lead that early,
you start playing finesse. You're looking, you're poaching trying
to get that fourth goal,'' Hitchcock said. ``The next thing you
know you are buried in your own end. It's hard to regroup during a
period. I thought we regrouped for the third.''
</P>
<P>
   The meltdown would have been a lot worse and a lot more
dissected had it not been for Stars winger Jamie Langenbrunner
scoring 2:52 into the third period to get back what had been lost.
</P>
<P>
   Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher had drawn three Panthers
defenders to him. Hatcher then found Langenbrunner alone in the
circle, and he hammered it past Panthers goalie Mikhail Shtalenkov.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was left wide open and I just kind of saw a lane and shot
it,'' Langenbrunner said. ``And it found a way through.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything the Stars shot in the first period seemed to find a
way through.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov began by firing in a power-play goal at 4:10 of the first
period. The play began when Panthers winger Radek Dvorak had a
short-handed breakaway that Stars backup goalie Manny Fernandez
stopped and started the break the other way.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other day, Nieuwendyk had been saying the Stars'
problem was they didn't stay hungry after scoring the first goal.
They let up, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, they saw the Panthers struggling and went in for
the knock-out punch. They got two.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk deflected a shot by Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor in
for a 2-0 lead at 10:55 of the second period. Less than two minutes
later, Stars forward Mike Modano weaved through a bunch of Florida
defenders and then roofed a backhand pass Panthers goalie Trevor
Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   It was the last save he didn't make all night.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers pulled him in favor of recently acquired
Shtalenkov. Kidd faced seven shots, stopping only four of them. The
Stars only allowed Fernandez two goals before pulling him in favor
of Ed Belfour after Laus' goal, his first of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has confidence in Eddie, and why shouldn't he,'' Fernandez
said of Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   But Hitchcock said it was less about Fernandez or Belfour and
more about sending a wake-up call to the team.
</P>
<P>
   They heard it, getting their second consecutive victory and
their seventh in nine games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it's not what they did but what we didn't do,''
Marshall said. ``We knew we screwed up and we went back and just
battled hard for 20 minutes.''

JURY FAULTS ELECTRIC-FAN MAKER, WAL-MART IN DEATH OF TODDLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH E. IGOE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- In mid-July 1995, the Mason family of
Chillicothe, Mo., made some warm- weather adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   Family members slept in the basement, a cool spot in the non-air
conditioned home. But one night Kevin and Laura Mason didn't want
to wake Ryan, their 15-month-old who had fallen asleep while
playing on his bedroom floor. So Kevin Mason put a fan about three
feet away, placed a pillow under Ryan's head and closed the door,
the family's attorney recalled Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That night a blanket or a piece of clothing blocked the blades
of the whirring fan, and the next morning Kevin Mason found the
room ravaged by flames, lawyer Kent Emison said.
</P>
<P>
   The fan did not have a common fire-safety device, he told
Jackson County jurors this week, and that cost Ryan Mason his life.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County jurors on Thursday evening found the Taiwanese
fan manufacturer and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which sold the fan,
partially responsible for Ryan Mason's death and ordered them to
pay the Masons about $3.6 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   A Wal-Mart spokesman criticized the verdict and said the company
plans to appeal. There was no definitive proof in Wal-Mart's own
investigation that the fan caused the fire, John Bisio said.
</P>
<P>
   He added no attorneys or officials from the manufacturer -- Han
Chi Hang Company Ltd. -- showed up for trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sympathize for the family,'' Bisio said Friday. ``But at
the same time, we have to question this decision. The (jurors) are
acting on emotion. Unfortunately, by affiliation, we are being
punished.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We vouch for the products we carry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Masons contended that the fan started the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic theme of this case is very simple: These fans have
no safety features in the event of an electrical failure,'' said
Emison, referring to a device that can shut off a machine during a
malfunction. ``These could have been put into the fan for less than
a quarter per fan.''
</P>
<P>
   That technology, Emison said Friday, has been available since
the 1950s and is installed in appliances from coffee makers to hair
dryers.
</P>
<P>
   The Masons' ``hope is that this (verdict) will force all
manufacturers to put these safety features in fans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Giles, a spokesman with the Consumer Product Safety
Commission in Washington, D.C., said the federal regulatory agency
had recalled several automatic coffee makers because they had been
built without thermal cut-offs and were deemed a risk to users.
Currently, he said, there are no mandatory federal standards for
electric fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are concerned about any electrical appliance or fan
that causes fires,'' Giles said. ``We would like to get the case on
this.''

NBA RICHES HAVE ONLY BOUGHT LEON SMITH MORE TROUBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Bill Green is sitting in the second-floor conference
room of the Sullivan House group home where Leon Smith spent the
past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall, where Smith used to sleep, Green remembers
warning Smith about the ``street agents'' who were out to hustle
the young basketball star.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was hanging around those street agents, he'd sit down
and talk with me and agree not to go out with them any more,''
Green said. ``Then the guys would blow their horn, and out the back
door he would go.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys would come around and pick him up in a Lexus, or pick
him up in a brand new station wagon.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, the director of the Sullivan House, has always believed
that Smith, a Mavericks rookie who was a first-round draft choice,
was extremely susceptible to those ``street agents'' and anyone
else trying to cash in on his new wealth. Green also believes that
the feeding frenzy among those people, including his family and
friends, who are out to get their share of the three-year, $1.447
million contract the 6-10 forward signed with the Mavericks last
month, has added to the worries of a young man trying to grow up
alone in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   That might explain at least part of Smith's unsettling behavior
in the past month, from a reported suicide attempt with an aspirin
overdose to being arrested twice in a 24-hour period in Chicago
last week. Smith is currently enrolled in a Dallas-area psychiatric
facility.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Linda Smith, also is of the belief her son is the
target of unscrupulous people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep saying that Leon doesn't have a family, but that's
not true,'' Linda Smith said. ``I have been here, I have tried to
contact him, I have contacted Dallas, I contacted the hospital, and
they treat me as if I have no rights at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sounds like a money thing. People are trying to control
him for their own selfish reasons. It's a money thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Smith, however, has been an absentee mother for most of
her son's life. Leon Smith, 19, was a ward of the state of Illinois
from age 4 through 18. The Sullivan House was one of five group
homes in which he was raised. Linda Smith popped back into Leon's
life about the time he became a basketball star at Chicago's Martin
Luther King High School.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, Leon Smith fell in love with Cappie
Pondexter, whose name is tattooed on his arm.
</P>
<P>
   When Smith received a telephone call from Pondexter's new suitor
informing him that his relationship with Pondexter was over,
friends said Smith had a difficult time handling it, which led to
some of his puzzling actions.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was arrested after police said he threatened Pondexter
with a gun at the girl's Chicago high school on Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Pondexter plays on the Marshall High School basketball team with
two of Smith's sisters _ Angela and Lekeshia.
</P>
<P>
   The Smith sisters have had a strained relationship with
Pondexter for some time _ a relationship that has almost polarized
the Marshall team.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Marshall coach Dorothy Gaters is left to try to put the
shattered pieces back together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difficult situation for me,'' said Gaters, a legendary
coach who has won seven state titles and 19 city championships in
Chicago. ``I'm concerned for Leon, as well as for my players. It's
so much stuff happening with teen-agers today with violence and
guns, and that's always in the back of your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaters thinks Smith's life would take a positive turn if he
looked to God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I genuinely like Leon,'' Gaters said. ``He's been to so many
group homes, he's very suspicious of people, and now that he's come
into so much money he doesn't trust anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks everybody is after his money, and I'm sure a lot of
people are.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall principal Don Pittman said the worst thing that
happened to Smith was being a first-round draft pick. After San
Antonio drafted Smith with the last pick of the first round, the
Mavericks traded for his rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leon wasn't ready for the NBA from a maturity standpoint or a
physical standpoint,'' Pittman said. ``Leon was a victim of
himself, because Dallas didn't do their homework. But they took him
on the first round, and that means guaranteed money, and that
really turned out to be a negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had to work for that, maybe he would have decided this
is not for me. Or, he would have been more focused. But all of this
stuff was laid in his lap, and he just couldn't handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith was so out of control Dec. 3 that he was back in jail only
hours after being bailed out by his former high school coach,
Landon Cox.
</P>
<P>
   This time he was charged with busting the windows and ramming a
car that belonged to Pondexter's mother, Vanessa Pondexter, and of
violating a restraining order to stay away from Cappie Pondexter.
</P>
<P>
   With the assistance of the NBA Players Association, Smith is
currently receiving psychiatric treatment at a Dallas-area clinic.
The Mavericks have suspended him without pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has definitely been a crazy situation,'' Pittman said.
``I knew Leon before all of this happened, and hopefully he's going
to receive the help he needs that he can get on with his life.
Hopefully, he hasn't done too much damage to this career.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox, who twice bailed Smith out of jail last week, said Smith
has been treated unfairly ever since the June 30 NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why in the world would Dallas draft him if they don't want
him?'' Cox asked. ``Why would you want to send a kid like that to
Europe, or to some other league?
</P>
<P>
   ``This boy has a lot of talent, and he can help any team win
some games.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, according to a police report, allegedly swallowed more
than 200 aspirin on Nov. 14 in a failed suicide attempt. Billy
Hunter, the executive director of the Players Association, said
Smith now is receiving the help he needs to turn his life around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leon has some issues that he has to deal with, and issues he
should have dealt with a long time ago,'' Hunter said. ``This stuff
has built up over his life. I know what Leon's basketball skills
are. I've got to clean up that other situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, the group home director, tried to absolve the Mavericks
of the negative press they've received during Smith's recent
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure it wouldn't have happened with any other
organizaiton,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Green did not totally let the Mavericks off the hook.
Mavericks coach/general manager Don Nelson did not bring Smith in
for a workout or an interview before the draft, and Green said
Smith's problems would have been clearly noticeable had that taken
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some preplanning should have taken place before the draft,''
Green said. ``But I think they assumed that any kid coming out of
high school that received one and a half million bucks would run
through a wall for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But money has never meant anything to Leon. Basketball is the
thing Leon wanted to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaters is hoping that Smith will finally realize his dream, and
one day play in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a kid who just been kicked around the system,'' Gaters
said. ``I'm praying for him, and I hope everything works out for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a sad, sad series of events. I'm really concerned if
he's ever going to come back, and if he's ever going to be a
productive citizen again.'' nn

INJURIES PAVE THE WAY FOR EX-HORNED FROG

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Former TCU standout Jason Tucker will earn the
first start of his career when the Cowboys take on the Philadelphia
Eagles on Sunday at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It's a continuation of a whirlwind year for Tucker, who spent
the spring and early part of the summer playing in NFL Europe. He
took a couple of days off before joining the Cowboys in training
camp, but Tucker has played approximately 33 weeks of continuous
football since March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing that position is a lot of running, especially when you
consider how much he's played in the last year,'' said Cowboys
coach Tommie Robinson, who also coached Tucker at TCU. ``It's a lot
of wear and tear on your body. But he's been able to maintain his
strength and stamina. He is running better now than I've seen him
run before.''
</P>
<P>
   Since training camp, Tucker has risen from being the bottom
receiver on the depth chart because of the late start and is now
the group's most versatile player. He initially got the Cowboys'
attention for his play on special teams _ first as a coverman, then
as a kickoff returner. Tucker's quick adaptation to the Cowboys'
offense has allowed him to become a valuable backup at all four
receiver positions.
</P>
<P>
   Because of several injuries at split end _ Michael Irvin, Ernie
Mills and Wane McGarity _ Tucker will start opposite flanker Raghib
Ismail against the Eagles. Tucker, 23, was a fifth-round pick of
the Cincinnati Bengals last season but was released during training
camp. At Robinson's urging, the Cowboys signed him to a free-agent
contract during the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you told me back in training camp that I'd start this
season, I would have said you were lying,'' Tucker said. ``With
Michael and all the guys here, I never expected to be a starter.
But with all the injuries we've had, this is a big opportunity to
showcase what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker has caught 9 passes for 152 yards this season. His 16.9
yards-per-catch average leads the team. He also leads the team in
average yards per kickoff return _ 22.8 _ and has the longest
return of 50 yards. He is fourth on the team in special-teams
tackles with 10. BACK TO WICHITA FALLS
</P>
<P>
   It's official.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are going back to Wichita Falls for training camp
for a third consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Jerry Jones made the announcement at a news
conference Friday, when he also said that the Cowboys would spend
the entire training camp at Midwestern State University, ending
speculation that the Cowboys would split training time between a
site in Texas and one in California.
</P>
<P>
   No dates have been set but training camp is expected to open in
mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the decision to nix the California plans was based on
the team's inability to find a suitable training site there, a
preseason game scheduling conflict and a shortened length of stay
in Japan for their trip to the American Bowl in early August.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had hoped training in California would help cut down
on the travel to Japan. However, he said the Cowboys' trip to the
American Bowl will be just an ``extended weekend'' and last only
five days.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Midwestern State is concerned, Jones said it was the
logical choice considering the excellent facilities there and the
hospitality the Cowboys have received the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   The only other Texas site that was being considered was one in
the Rio Grande Valley. A lucrative proposal for a permanent
training home there was passed over because of concerns about when
construction would be completed.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he makes training camp decisions on a year-to-year
basis and going to the South Texas or anywhere else is a
possibility for 2001. But the next training camp will be in Wichita
Falls. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Center Mark Stepnoski (strained calf) practiced Friday for the
first time in more than a week. As a result, Cowboys coach Chan
Gailey is optimistic that he will be ready for Sunday's game
against the Eagles. Gailey said it will be a game time decision. If
Stepnoski can't play, Tom Myslinski will start for the second
consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cornerback Kevin Mathis will start opposite Deion Sanders in
place of Kevin Smith, who will miss his third consecutive game with
a strained hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   _ Surgery to repair Wane McGarity's fractured right ring finger
was more extensive than anticipated, ending his season. The Cowboys
placed him on injured reserve Friday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Receiver Chris Brazzell was signed from the practice squad to
the active roster Friday to replace McGarity. nn

PINCAY SETS RECORD FOR WINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Laffit Pincay tied Bill Shoemaker's world record for most
victories by a jockey on Thursday, the jockeys at Hollywood Park
carried Pincay through the winner's circle. They did it again
Friday, and then they popped the cork.
</P>
<P>
   They opened bottles of champagne and sprayed it in the winner's
circle because Pincay rode Irish Nip to a 21/4-length victory in
the sixth race, overcoming a speed duel with another horse and
becoming the all-time leading jockey with 8,834 wins. Shoemaker,
who retired in 1989, rode 8,833 winners.
</P>
<P>
   It might be the closest horse racing can come to baseball's
home-run competition in 1998 between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa.
When McGwire broke Roger Maris' home-run record, the Maris family
was in attendance. And Shoemaker was at Hollywood watching Pincay
break his record.
</P>
<P>
   When McGwire broke the record, he came to home plate and hugged
his son. After Pincay dismounted, he was carried to the jockey's
weigh scale on the shoulders of his fellow riders. They also
carried Pincay's preteen son, Jean-Laffit, on their shoulders next
to Pincay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll enjoy this as long as it stands,'' Pincay, 52, said.
</P>
<P>
   That figures to be a while. First, Pincay said he intends to
keep riding for at least another year _ if not three years.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the closest active jockey is Pat Day, He's 46 and is at
7,600 winners. He's winning between 250 and 300 races a year. At
that rate it would take him at least six years _ or age 52 _ to
reach 9,000 victories.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Baze, third-leading active jockey, has a little more
than 6,775 winners. He's been the hottest jockey in the past five
years, winning more than 400 races each year.
</P>
<P>
   He could hit 9,000 in less than six years if he stays at that
pace, and he's five years younger than Day.
</P>
<P>
   Baze rides strictly on the Northern California circuit. In horse
racing, Northern California is considered less competitive than
Pincay's home turf of Southern California, and Pincay's backers
already were putting an asterisk to anyone who would break the
record in an area such as Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone breaks it somewhere else,'' Southern
California-based trainer Mike Mitchell said, ``I don't think it'll
be the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think Laffit can break 9,000. That'll be his next
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the only number that mattered Friday was 8,834. Shoemaker,
confined to a wheelchair since an automobile accident about eight
years ago, was able to sit in the paddock and watch the
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great friend, a great person,'' Shoemaker said. ``I
couldn't have picked a better guy to break the record.''
</P>
<P>
   The record-breaker was another vintage Pincay ride. Just as
Thursday when he tied the record, Pincay got his horse to break
sharply from the starting gate before he settled him into a running
style that the race dictated once the gates opened.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Pincay was on the rail, so he allowed Irish Nip to
run toward the lead in the 11/16 mile race on the turf. By the time
they hit the backstretch, Pincay was in a speed duel with 25-to-1
longshot Laps N'bounds. It stayed that way through the backstretch
when both runners cut through a half mile in an honest 47 seconds
and three-quarters in 1:11.
</P>
<P>
   Laps N'bounds proved to be cheap speed and started backing up,
but Irish Nip had more underneath Pincay. Under one of his strong,
arm-pumping hand rides _ he hit the colt sparingly with the whip _
Irish Nip repulsed a late challenge from the Kent Desormeaux-ridden
Quiet One and won drawing away.
</P>
<P>
   After the race, members of Hollywood Park's front office
presented Pincay with a trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trophy is nice, but you can't drive it,'' Hollywood
president Rick Baedecker said. ``We bought you a toy. Enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when they drove out a new Porsche for Pincay to take
home. nn

FORMER STEELERS STAR MEL BLOUNT HAS IT COVERED IN CUTTING HORSE
EVENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT HOFFMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The rider who placed third in the limited
nonprofessional division finals of the National Cutting Horse
Futurity yesterday had compiled quite a resume before ever mounting
a horse.
</P>
<P>
   He manages boys homes in Pennsylvania and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   He's building a state-of-the-art arena for rodeos and horse
shows on his 268-acre ranch in Claysville, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   He has four Super Bowl rings and is in the Pro Football Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   The budding cutting star is former Pittsburgh Steelers
cornerback Mel Blount, who insists this is no Deionesque, two-sport
endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``After you've played in front of the world like I have in Super
Bowls, there's no jitters when I ride into the arena to cut,'' said
Blount, 51, who played for the Pittsburgh Steelers from 1970-83 and
was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1989. ``Cutting really
relaxes me. It's not even close to football. When you make your
living in a sport where everybody judges you on every play and
talks about you on radio and TV, the pressures of cutting is
minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Blount has ridden cutting horses since the late 1960s after
first watching them work when he played college football at
Southern University in Baton Rouge, La. In 1977, he attended a
cutting clinic in Middlebrook, Va., that was conducted by five-time
Futurity champion Buster Welch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put me on a gray mare called Grace,'' Blount said.
``After I rode, Buster said, `I don't know where he came from, but
he sure can ride a horse good,' and that meant a lot. It was like a
confirmation that I had ability to ride.''
</P>
<P>
   After he retired from football, Blount competed in the celebrity
cutting classes at the Futurity in the early 1990s. This year marks
his first time to compete in a regular class at the Futurity. He
finished fourth in the nonpro division.
</P>
<P>
   The commitment to excellence has carried over from his former
arena to his current one. His 3-year-old mount, Doc Pers Dodger,
was sired by the 1984 Futurity open division champion Doc Per.
</P>
<P>
   But cutting across a football field to chase a wide receiver and
cutting across Will Rogers Memorial Coliseum are different athletic
feats for Blount.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a cutting show, you have to prepare yourself, you have to
be tough and mentally focused,'' he said. ``The thing about this
game is there isn't anybody that can back you up. In football, you
have a strong safety to back you up if you let a receiver get by.
In cutting, there's nobody to back you up when a cow gets away from
you.
</P>
<P>
   ``In football, you get a penalty and you get backed up for only
15 yards, and you can recover on the next series. Your team can get
a lot of penalties and still win a game. But if you get penalized
in cutting, you don't recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Blount's trainer, Tracy Barton, of Rocky Mountain, Va., said the
ex-football star has a knack for competing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before he came to the Futurity, he only practiced on this
horse twice, in July, and that was right before he showed it in the
first go-round,'' Barton said. ``So, it was great to see him be so
competitive. He's a natural on a horse, and cutting really fits
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his days of stopping receivers short of catching a clutch
pass, Blount hopes to make big plays in cutting and said he's going
to spur his cutting horse for the big money this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a guy like me who doesn't show a whole lot, I easily can
say that I'm satisfied with making the semifinals,'' Blount said.
``But I still have a lot of work to do, and my ultimate goal is to
win it. In football, I'd rather not make the playoffs if we weren't
going to win the Super Bowl. You want to get to the big dance. At
this show, I want to get to the big dance, which is the finals.''

AYALA GOES AGAINST MENEFEE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE SANCHEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tony Ayala Jr.'s improbable boxing comeback continues Saturday
in San Antonio. He's confident, but admits he doesn't know exactly
what or who's next in the ring after the night's final bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have an agenda,'' Ayala, 36, said. ``I'm a free agent.
I'll fight whoever it is. The plan is to fight at whatever weight I
can get a good fight at.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala (24-0, 22 knockouts) is scheduled for a 10-round
middleweight bout against Tony Menefee on Saturday at Freeman
Coliseum. It's Ayala's third bout since being released from prison
in April.
</P>
<P>
   He was a once a junior middleweight phenom on the eve of a world
title fight, when fueled by alcohol and drugs, he broke into a home
and raped a woman on Jan. 1, 1983. He spent the next 16 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   An older Ayala says he is reformed, but still lives with the
guilt of a ``horrible and horrendous crime'' every day. His life
now is boxing and providing for his family, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that I am still competitive and expect to keep
winning,'' Ayala said.
</P>
<P>
   His father and trainer, Tony Ayala Sr., has watched his son's
boxing skills improve since his release. The elder Ayala claims his
son still has the punching power that scored 20 knockouts before
his incarceration. But he also stressed that a new style will be
needed if his son expects to win a world title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony will be aggressive, but more defensive,'' Ayala Sr. said.
``I compare it to George Foreman's comeback. Tony knows he can't
waste any punches or energy like he used to when he was younger.''
</P>
<P>
   In his two previous bouts, Ayala stopped Manuel Esparaza in the
third round on Aug. 20 in San Antonio and stopped Robert Koon in
the fourth round on Sept. 23 in Corpus Christi. His plan is to
fight for at least two years, meanwhile ``taking it slow to get a
series of wins.''
</P>
<P>
   In Menefee (67-6-1, 37 knockouts), Ayala faces an experienced
boxer who has been in the ring with two former world champions. He
was stopped in the eighth round by Roberto Duran in 1993 and lost a
12-round decision to Hector Camacho in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Menefee said winning in Ayala's hometown will be a tough task,
but could be a big boost for a career that has been limited to
fighting in Nebraska, Iowa, and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan on turning it up in last rounds to get a knockdown or
stop him,'' Menefee, 27, said.''It would be an excellent
steppingstone back to full-time training and hopefully a title
fight.''

ANGELS STRATEGIZE ABOUT DEALING OUTFIELDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Baseball's winter meetings began quietly for
the Anaheim Angels, but they promise to get more interesting soon.
</P>
<P>
   Angels general manager Bill Stoneman wasn't much for small talk,
instead checking into his hotel room at about 3 p.m., then meeting
with his scouting staff.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman said it is ``very important'' the Angels make a deal
during these meetings, which end Tuesday. And it's no secret what
he wants and what he'll give up.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman plans to trade one of his four outfielders _ Jim
Edmonds, Garret Anderson, Darin Erstad or Tim Salmon _ to get a
starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our situation is that we have four legitimate starting
outfielders,'' Stoneman said. ``Our position is that any of the
four could start in any outfield in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Stoneman has said no Angel is untouchable, he hinted
that Salmon and Erstad won't be going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty much a left-handed hitting ballclub,'' Stoneman
said. ``That in itself makes it tougher to deal Tim Salmon. But it
doesn't mean we won't listen to offers.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad isn't likely to go because he's he's young (25),
relatively inexpensive ($2.5 million for 2000) and talented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those young guys that are good players are very valuable,''
Stoneman said, including third baseman Troy Glaus in that group.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Edmonds and Anderson, both of whom are free agents
after the 2000 season. They have heard the rumors in past years.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds has said he'd like to stay but realizes his time may
have come.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is open minded about it,'' Edmonds' agent Paul Cohen said.
``He's certainly not ruling out remaining an Angel, but he's more
open minded to the possibility of what might happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams showing the most interest in Edmonds are the Rockies,
Cubs, Mets and Devil Rays. Those teams also might have an interest
in Anderson. Stoneman acknowledged there are two ways he could go
about working out a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way is to hold an auction _ listen to all the offers and
pick the best one,'' he said. ``But if you have an opportunity to
do something and you like it, do it. Because those things can go
away, too. That offer may not be there tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   While there have been rumors that even a Mo Vaughn could be
traded, despite having five years and about $65 million left on his
contract, Stoneman said don't expect it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I'd listen to anything, but I'd be surprised if anybody
asked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Angels general manager Bill Bavasi attended the meetings
and expects to remain here all week. He's still officially a Disney
employee, but is working on other baseball related activities as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he's been up to lately, Bavasi said: ``Nothing ... I
built my son a skateboard ramp.''
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi has watched Stoneman tear down and rebuild what was his
player development staff, scouting department and major league
coaching staff, but wouldn't criticize him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to put together a unit they're comfortable with,''
Bavasi said.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Angels named Darrell Miller as director of player
development. Miller, 41, has been with the Angels for 21 years as a
player, community relations director and scouting supervisor....
The Mariners are said to have taken the lead in the Chuck Finley
sweepstakes. Still in the race for the former Angels pitcher are
the Indians, Red Sox, Mets and Diamondbacks.

COUNCIL OKs EXPANSION AT LAX 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Beth Barrett 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the objections of labor groups and criticism that
environmental concerns have not been fully addressed, the Los
Angeles City Council on Friday approved a 23-year lease and major
expansion of United Airlines' cargo facility.
</P>
<P>
   The council voted 8-4 in favor of the 187,000-square-foot
replacement cargo building at Los Angeles International Airport,
saying it was satisfied with a limited review of environmental
impacts and United's promise to spend about $5million to reduce
them.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting members said they were concerned the project
represented piecemeal development at Los Angeles International
Airport without a full environmental impact report being done. The
expansion is anticipated to triple the number of truck trips and
add to air pollution, among other impacts.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Ruth Galanter of Venice, whose district includes
LAX, argued adequate environmental studies of the cargo complex
weren't done _ two days after casting a deciding vote for the
Sunshine Canyon Landfill expansion in Granada Hills, in which the
inadequacy of studies also was at the heart of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's decision is an insult to the communities surrounding
LAX, who bear an unfair share of the diesel fuel emissions and
traffic congestion associated with the airport,'' Galanter said
after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine Canyon Landfill and the community uproar over that
decision was a different situation, Galanter said. She said the
city owns other airports where cargo expansion could occur, while
it would have been ``morally unjust'' to force other communities to
take L.A.'s trash.
</P>
<P>
   Alan B. Wayne, regional director of public affairs for United
Airlines, said the company was elated by the decision and that it
will improve working conditions for employees while improving
customer service.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will give us a better competitive stance,'' Wayne said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the expansion, including the cities of El Segundo
and Inglewood, vowed to press ahead in court with a series of
lawsuits already filed against Los Angeles World Airports and its
Board of Airport Commissioners over their approvals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see them in court and make them go back and do the
EIR,'' said Michael Wall with the San Francisco law firm Altshuler,
Berzon, Nussbaum, Berzon &AMP; Rubin, who's representing parties in
Inglewood and Lennox, as well as some labor interest.
</P>
<P>
   El Segundo Mayor Mike Gordon, whose city has filed a broader
lawsuit claiming LAX is engaging in a deliberate policy of
piece-meal growth at the airport to avoid master plan review, said
the council made a statement that ``negative impacts don't matter
to you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An EIR is right and just and the people of Los Angeles deserve
to know what the negative impacts are,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   The council vote on the cargo expansion was further complicated
by a fractious labor argument.
</P>
<P>
   The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers and the United Brotherhood of Carpenters sided with United,
arguing employee worker conditions would be enhanced by the
expansion. In longstanding opposition was the Service Employees
International Union, which has been trying to organize one of
United's subcontractors, Argenbright Security Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a labor dispute with a sister union,'' said Stephen
Cooke, assistant general chairman of the machinists and aerospace
workers, District Lodge 141, in arguing for the cargo facility.
</P>
<P>
   United has already made a series of concessions, including
guaranteeing its subcontractors will comply with the city's
``living wage'' ordinance, but has steadfastly maintained it would
be inappropriate, if not illegal, to interfere in organizing
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The result of the labor split, however, was that council
members' typical pro-labor sentiments were somewhat neutralized,
with alliances shifting until the final vote.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately it was council President John Ferraro, whose district
laps into the San Fernando Valley, who changed his position and
concluded an environmental impact report was not required.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro was joined by council members Hal Bernson, Laura Chick,
Nate Holden, Cindy Miscikowski, Nick Pacheco, Rudy Svorinich and
Rita Walters.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing the expansion were Galanter, Michael Feuer, Mike
Hernandez and Alex Padilla. Absent were Jackie Goldberg, Joel Wachs
and Mark Ridley-Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan has said he supports the United
expansion.!end! &QL;

MURDER DEFENDANT'S RECORD ORDERED WIPED CLEAN OF ARREST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jesse Hiestand 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Found not guilty by a jury of clubbing her husband to death,
Jeanie Adair won greater vindication Friday when a judge took a
rare step of declaring her innocent, allowing her to say she was
never arrested or even charged with the crime.
</P>
<P>
   San Fernando Superior Court Judge L. Jeffrey Wiatt cited six
reasons why he believes Adair did not kill Robert Adair on Nov. 5,
1996, including what he said was contradictory blood evidence and
her lack of motive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reasonable cause to believe that Jeanie Adair
committed the offense for which the arrest was made,'' Wiatt said.
He allowed prosecutors time to appeal before finalizing his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old mother of two did not attend the hearing, but
through her attorney said she was pleased with Wiatt's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did the right thing, thank God,'' Adair was quoted as
telling her attorney, Richard Plotin. ``This is the second-best
Christmas present we've received this year.''
</P>
<P>
   A jury acquitted her Oct. 18 of murdering her husband in their
Sylmar condominium, but that meant only that the prosecution failed
to establish her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Not satisfied, Adair sought to be declared factually innocent in
a bid to clear her record for employment and other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   With Wiatt's ruling, police must destroy any record of Adair's
arrest and seal the trial file.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely rare,'' said Erwin Chemerinsky, professor of
law at the University of Southern California. ``Most criminal
defendants are satisfied to be found not guilty. They have their
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, by the time a case goes to trial, the courts usually are
satisfied that enough evidence exists to justify the arrest and
prosecution, he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Adair's attorney, she hopes the ruling will quell
public suspicion that she got away with murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if she had never been arrested, as if she never had
gone through this nightmare,'' Plotin said. ``It really vindicates
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Adair did not attend the hearing because she had the flu, said
Plotin, who told her of the ruling by cell phone as TV news crews
filmed the call.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of court, the relatives of Robert Adair still insist she
is the killer, even though doing so may put them at risk of being
sued for slander by Adair.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's guilty until the day she dies,'' said the victim's
mother, Margarita Ruffino-Sutcliffe.
</P>
<P>
   After declaring her innocent, Wiatt suspended the destruction
and sealing of records until at least Jan. 7, when prosecutors are
expected to announce if they will appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``To find her factually innocent to me is an outrage,'' said Los
Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Marsh Goldstein, who has
repeatedly complained that Wiatt's rulings against the prosecution
on various motions cost them the case. ``It adds insult to
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt did not require Adair to testify, as the prosecutor urged,
but instead relied on evidence from the trial, which included the
information that Adair stood to receive about $400,000 in life
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Adair claimed a home-invasion robber beat her husband to death
and injured her, but prosecutors said she faked her injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, Plotin hinted at a dark conspiracy whereby
Adair's affair with a doctor angered the man's wife so much that
she sent a thug to rough up Adair. Robert Adair was killed, Plotin
has suggested, when he inadvertently interrupted the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see there's any motivation on the part of Jeanie Adair
to murder her husband based on the grounds of Jeanie Adair's
infidelity,'' Wiatt said. ``It might be the other case if Robert
Adair was cheating on his wife, but that wasn't the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Having presided over the trial and taken copious notes, Wiatt
said he had heard enough to believe Adair was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   First off, he said it was significant that none of the victim's
blood was found on Adair, which seemed unlikely had she just
crushed his skull with violent blows from a bat at close range.
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt said he did not believe Adair had enough time to change
into fresh clothes and drive somewhere to dispose of blood-soaked
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   And he did not believe Adair inflicted her own injuries,
including a severe back injury.
</P>
<P>
   The case is far from over, as seen by the latest twists in this
drawn-out legal saga.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the hearing was concluding Friday, Goldstein said Adair
is under criminal investigation, although he refused to say for
what or which agency is involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may very well be a parallel investigation into other
charges against the defendant,'' Goldstein said, who declined to
elaborate. Double jeopardy laws shield Adair from being charged
again with the murder.
</P>
<P>
   An outraged Plotin shot back that he is doing his own
investigation into the murder to find the killer, and he will
forward the results to the state Attorney General's Office if
county prosecutors refuse to act on his findings. &QL;

amount of air traffic out of the airport that was founded as a tiny

CELTICS HANG ON TO BEAT ROCKETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early in the third quarter Friday night, Celtics guard Paul
Pierce misfired on an alley-oop attempt, then jogged up court
laughing at his blunder. At the time, you could hardly blame him
for the lightheartedness. The Celtics-Rockets tilt had all the
suspense and drama of a Teletubbies plot. The Celtics led, 67-52,
and appeared to be on their way to a laughable rout.
</P>
<P>
   By early in the fourth quarter, the laughing had long given way
to flushed faces as the lead slowly dwindled. When Houston tied it,
89-89, on a tip-in by former Celtic Thomas Hamilton with 4:42 to go
_ and the sound of boos began bouncing off the FleetCenter walls _
the home team sought to regroup to ensure another solid effort
didn't go to waste.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Pierce, Kenny Anderson, and Adrian Griffin came up
with big plays for Boston, which scored 5 unanswered points after
Houston tied it and held off another Houston rally for a 100-96
triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, most of the players said that despite the fact they
didn't win as convincingly as many figured (they led by as many as
25 points in the first half), the bottom line is that they won.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of tough,'' said Griffin, ``but we pulled it out
at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pierce, who tallied 19 points and 7 rebounds,
acknowledged that during the third quarter, he figured the Celtics'
lead was insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout the course of the game, I never thought we would
relinquish our lead, but we did,'' said Pierce. ``But even when
they tied the game, I had that feeling that we were going to get
this game and this is not going to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics failed to convert after Houston tied it, but at the
other end, Shandon Anderson (15 points), missed a baseline jumper,
Griffin got the rebound, and Pierce drained a trey.
</P>
<P>
   Then with 3:33 left, Houston's Cuttino Mobley (a game-high 23
points) missed, Antoine Walker got the rebound, and Kenny Anderson
hit a pull-up jumper to give the Celtics a 94-89 lead with 3:25
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made the run, but we just started playing ball again,''
said Anderson. ``It wasn't like we were going to run and hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston surged again, however, as Mobley (formerly of the
University of Rhode Island) scored on a reverse layup and a 17-foot
jumper to pull the Rockets to 94-93 with 1:14 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Rockets) were down a lot of points, but they showed a lot
of gumption and a lot of heart to get themselves back into the
game,'' said Celtics coach Rick Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite Houston's rges, Pierce wasorrect. The Celtics
merely stepped up their play after each Houston run and kept the
Rockets at bay. After Houston cut the lead to 1, Kenny Anderson
missed on a short attempt, but Walker got the rebound, and the
Celtics reset. Then Anderson sank two free throws with 20.4 seconds
left, giving the Celtics a 96-93 lead. Carlos Rogers sank one of
two free throws with 14.4 seconds to go. With 12.9 seconds left,
Griffin (who got three boards after Houston tied it), sank 4 of 4
free throw attempts the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson had a team-high 20 points, Walker added 16, and Griffin
led all Celtics rebounders with 10. Houston (7-14), which had 27
turnovers lead to 32 Celtics points, had four players in double
figures.
</P>
<P>
   The win improved Boston to 10-8. Although Pitino may share in
his team's adage that a win is a win, and credited Houston for
making a game of it, he criticized his team for getting away from
the play that led to an NBA record-tying 11 steals in the first
quarter and 64 percent shooting in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were spectacular in the first quarter, we were good in the
second quarter and, as usual, with our young basketball team, we
lost our memory of what got us the lead,'' said Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get hypnotized into a different kind of game, an isolation
game, a one-on-one game, and we lose it. We're brilliant, and we
don't comprehend why we're brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, they were able to recapture enough of that brilliance to
avoid what would have been an embarrassing defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics play in New York Sunday. ``We had to take advantage
of homecourt,'' said Waer. ``We need to get up to three t four
games on our road trip, and it's going to be hard.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the spring of 1984 and the championship-bound Boston
Celtics were in Milwaukee for a game against the Bucks. Danny
Ainge, Kevin McHale, Quinn Buckner, and Larry Bird were sitting in
the Milwaukee Hyatt's atrium coffee shop when assistant coach Chris
Ford walked into the hotel lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Ford had a travel bag slung over his shoulder. He had just come
from a scouting mission at the SEC tournament and he approached the
group, most of whom were sampling the hotel's ice cream sundae bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where you been, Doc?'' McHale asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you where I've been, Kevin,'' said Ford. ``I've just
seen the guy who's going to kick your ass for the next 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an exaggeration, but not by much. Barkley and McHale
wound up being two of the best forwards in NBA history. They used
to sit together on the team bus when they joined forces for the NBA
All-Star Game. When he retired this week, Barkley said McHale was
the toughest player he ever guarded.

   The Celtics saluted Sir Charles at the New Garden Friday night
at halftime of their 100-96 victory over the Rockets. There was a
false rumor that Bill Russell would do the honors, but the task
fell to Cedric Maxwell.
</P>
<P>
   Dred in black, limping in the wake of his ruptured quadriceps
tendon sustained Wednesday, Barkley accepted a piece of the
Garden's parquet floor (``I'll put it in my pool room''), and a
photo of himself jousting with Larry Bird. Bird sent a message via
video and told Barkley, ``When you look up and see those
championship banners, just think of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the Garden masses, Sir Chuck said, ``T reason I
wanted to be here tonight is this: One day I was sitting around
with some old guys, big sports fans. One of them said, `I played
against the New York Yankees _ you ever heard of the Yankees?'
Another guy, a hockey player, said, `I played against the Montreal
Canadiens.' I said to them, `yeah, but I played against the
Celtics.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell was in his final season with the Celtics when Charles
came out of Auburn _ billed as the Round Mound of Rebound. ``He
might have een the most unique player I ever saw,'' Max recalled.
``He played like he was 6-10. We heard about this guy coming into
the league, 6-5, 260 pounds, and we thought, `How is he going to
guard anybody on the Celtics?' But he could. He could do anything.
He was so explosive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the size of the man. It's the size of the man's
heart. I was talking with Randy Brown, a Bulls player, and he said,
`Elton Brand reminds me of Charles Barkley,' and I said, `yeah,
Charles Barkley's sister, maybe.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Heinsohn, one of the greatest NBA forwards in history said,
``I voted for him as one of the top five active players when they
had that top-50 vote. That's how much I thought of him.''
</P>
<P>
   A man without a ring, perhaps the Ernie Banks of basketball,
Charles was in the midst of his 16th and final season when he hurt
his left leg Wednesday in Philadelphia. Nice symmetry there. Philly
is where Barkley started his NBA career, and his mother and
grandmother attended his 1,072d and final NBA game.
</P>
<P>
   He had already said this would be his final season. The injury
derailed a farewell tour that would have been Yaz-like. But he
wanted to come to Boston one lat time, and it was at the Hub's
Ritz-Carlton Hotel that he formally annouced his retirement
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The fierce Celtic-Sixer rivalry of the early 1980s was starting
to fizzle when Charles came into the league. He was a rookie when
Bird and Julius Erving tried to strangle one another on the Garden
floor in 1984 (``I got in trouble for holding Larry''), and that
same season featured the final Boston-Philly playoff matchup of
this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got respect for what the Celtics accomplished,'' he said.
``I'm not surprised about tonight. I've always thought these were
great fans. I'm not sure the players on this team understand what
it means to be a Celtic.''
</P>
<P>
   Never silent or politically correct (on the night he retired he
said, ``Just what this country needs _ another unemployed black
man''), Barkley was a fierce competitor and retires as a
card-carrying member of the NBA's All-Time Top 50 and the 1992 US
Olympic gold-medal-winning Dream Team.
</P>
<P>
   The Dream Team was probably the most idolized and isolated
assemblage in sports history. Players were sequestered in five-star
hotel, guarded by police, apart from the Olympic Village. Most of
the players had no contact with other athletes or competitions.
Charles was different. He was everywhere in Barcelona _ eating,
drinking, going to events, and mingling with fellow-athletes and
Barcelonese. Nobody got more out of their Olympic experience. It is
the same way he lived and played for 16 years in the NBA, and we
will miss him.

EDITORIAL: BURYING THE PAST IN MOZAMBIQUE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, December
11:
</P>
<P>
   With little fanfare, seven million Mozambicans went to the polls
over the last weekend to re-elect a president and overhaul a
Parliament. Those elections represented more than a modest
reconfiguration of government in an obscure corner of the globe.
They were welcome evidence of one of the most important if
little-appreciated benefits of the end of white rule in southern
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   During the years of protest and repression in South Africa in
the 1980s, the nightmare was that the struggle to bring down
apartheid might degenerate into a race war. No such war came to
pass. But a nightmare did come to pass in neighboring Angola and
Mozambique, where hundreds of thousands died in ruinous civil wars.
</P>
<P>
   In those countries, the combatants and victims on all sides were
black, and little attention was paid. Few understood that blacks
killed blacks in part because of meddlesome behavior by whites in
both South Africa and the country then called Rhodesia, and because
some blacks cynically allowed themselves to be used as instruments
of white tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   In Mozambique, for example, the notorious rebel movement Renamo
was created by the Rhodesian secret police to counter black
nationalist guerrillas fighting Rhodesia's white-settler rule.
Renamo developed a reputation as an African Khmer Rouge, and
between 1977 and 1992 as many as a million Mozambicans died from
fighting and famine in a war that laid waste to the economy and
much of the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   After Rhodesia became independent as Zimbabwe in 1980, Renamo
was inherited by South Africa's military intelligence, which used
it to bludgeon Mozambique into expelling exiled South Africans
aligned with the African National Congress. Although the war
developed local agendas and took on its own momentum, Pretoria
continued to back Renamo until 1990, when President F.W. de Klerk
began clearing the way for the end of white rule.
</P>
<P>
   Angola's war rages on, fueled by diamonds and oil. Mozambique,
remarkably, is at peace. Its war finally ended with a negotiated
settlement in 1992. An election was held in 1994. Mozambique now
has one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Foreign
investment is flowing in. Tourism is thriving. Inflation is close
to zero.
</P>
<P>
   In October a stock exchange opened in Maputo, the seaside
capital that used to feature billboards proclaiming that
``Imperialism is the enemy of the people'' and still has streets
named for Lenin, Mao and Kim Il Sung. After years of relying on
donated food, Mozambique now grows nearly enough to feed itself.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit goes to President Joaquim Chissano, who
scrapped his ruling Frelimo Party's original collectivist creed
and, with Western backing, has adhered to a program of fiscal
austerity. He is expected to retain the presidency but may lose the
legislature to Renamo, which transformed itself into a loyal
opposition and exploits the issues of corruption and enduring rural
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   One disquieting feature of Mozambique's peace is that there has
been no attempt to hold anyone accountable for the many heinous
crimes committed during the war. There have been no war crimes
trials and nothing like South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation
Commission. But Mozambique deserves continued Western support after
bearing a disproportionate share of suffering for the injustices of
what is thankfully a bygone era.

KINGS FALL TO RED WINGS

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ It's not hard to see who wears the rings in this
house.
</P>
<P>
   Scotty Bowman has won eight Stanley Cups, including two with the
Detroit Red Wings. His influence over a game sometimes can drive
the little people crazy, and Friday night the little people were
Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Andy Murray wasn't about to say that the Los Angeles
Kings' 3-1 loss in front of 19,983 at Joe Louis Arena was the
result of the respect officials have for Bowman's place in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   But Murray's hearty postgame charge into the referee's room with
general manager Dave Taylor was a more lasting image than the
absence of captain Rob Blake, who is injured again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying they changed the course of the game or that
Scotty gets calls because of his stature,'' Murray said. ``I have
too much respect for him, the game and its tradition to say
anything like that. But late in a close game, let the players
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray was referring to a slashing penalty on Glen Murray with
4:53 remaining and the Kings mounting one of their few rallies of
the night. They were still trailing 2-1, but with the man
advantage, the Red Wings scored again. Suddenly the Kings were 0-1
in the first of four games on this trip and leading Dallas by just
three points in the Pacific Division.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, who has been injured throughout much of his career, is
sidelined with a groin strain and not expected to play tonight in
Montreal. And the Kings already were playing without leading scorer
Ziggy Palffy, who is back in Los Angeles nursing a sore lower back.
It was the first game Blake has missed this season, but a whopping
120 by the team overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly when you are missing top players from your lineup it
is going to take its toll,'' said Glen Murray, who scored the Kings
only goal, his seventh in six games. ``But all you want at the end
of the game is to play. I didn't think I deserved a penalty in that
spot. If I did I shouldn't have been the only one.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Murray acknowledged that the Kings' second line, which did
not take a shot in the first period, was sluggish coming out. Not a
good thing with the first line already missing Jozef Stumpel
(abdominal surgery) and minus Palffy for at least one more game.
</P>
<P>
   But he was happy with the Kings' power play, which entered the
game with just four goals in their last 46 attempts. Aki Berg
assumed Blake's role as point man on the power play and overall
physical presence and played perhaps his best game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   And Glen Murray's goal came with the man advantage early in the
second period, beating former Kings goaltender Manny Legace on a
pass from Bryan Smolinski that tied the game 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   But less than a minute later, Steve Yzerman scored his second
goal of the game. The Kings never had an answer for that.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Blake and Palffy, they played even with Detroit the
rest of the way. Which is why they kept wondering why they weren't
give a chance at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman, who recorded his 1,110th career win last month, recently
has been critical of officials.
</P>
<P>
   There was a call on Mattias Norstrom midway through the second
period that many in the Kings locker room thought was undeserved
and shattered momentum.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing compared to the Kings' final penalty. The play began
with a crushing hit by Berg on Pat Verbeek, who got up and struck
Smolinski. Murray admitted he slashed Verbeek, but thought Verbeek
deserved a penalty for whacking Smolinski.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to give one you have to give the other,'' Glen
Murray said. ``Those things shouldn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   With Glen Murray in the penalty box, Vyacheslav Kozlov scored
the final goal.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, Andy Murray always addresses the club after the
game. This time he left the chore to assistant Dave Tippett and
joined Taylor for a lengthy talk with the officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that room is generally off limits,'' Murray said.
``And it is always is important to say something to the team. This
was the first time I haven't all season. I wanted the players to
know that I wasn't going to put up with this.''

ZEILE WILL LIKELY SLIP AWAY FROM DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Barring some extraordinary turn of events,
free-agent third baseman Todd Zeile won't be returning to the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile's agent, Seth Levinson, said the Van Nuys native would
sign in the next 48 hours and the Dodgers said they won't make a
decision on what to do about third base until Adrian Beltre's
situation is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a third baseman right now and we're in a holding
pattern until we get a decision from Major League Baseball,''
Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said Friday upon arriving at
the winter meetings. ``We can't do anything because we have a third
baseman. We !ital!have!off! a third baseman. I don't know why
people expect us to go out and get another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, 20, is asking to be declared a free agent because the
Dodgers allegedly signed him at the age of 15, illegal by baseball
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile, who just moved to Thousand Oaks, has make clear his
desire to play again for the Dodgers, who traded him in the Mike
Piazza deal to Florida early last season. And the Dodgers front
office likes him so much that one source said new Dodgers chairman
and CEO Robert Daly personally spoke with Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile's most ardent suitor, the Texas Rangers, are offering a
two-year deal with an option for a third year to keep him. Levinson
is scheduled to meet with Rangers general manager Doug Melvin
today. Sources said if Zeile doesn't give an answer by the end of
the weekend, the Rangers would pull the offer back and go with
rookie Mike Lamb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd Zeile will sign this weekend,'' Levinson said. ``He came
to the winter meetings unsigned, and he's leaving signed.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeile batted .293 with 24 homers and 98 RBI with Texas last
season, but also made 25 errors.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile may not be the only free agent the Dodgers pass on during
the meetings. It's been mandated that Malone not sign any until
payroll is sliced, and that could mean Terry Shumpert or Kurt
Abbott also sign with other teams before that happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to do what's in their best interest,'' Malone said
of other players. ``They can't wait on us. Some of them have to
make decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have Kevin Orie, acquired last month in a trade with
Florida, but could trade for a third baseman if they lose Beltre. A
combination of Orie, Dave Hansen and Jose Vizcaino could also play
third.
</P>
<P>
   Contract talk: Financially, the Dodgers aren't in position to
negotiate contract extensions with any of their three players _
Eric Karros, Ismael Valdes and Darren Dreifort _ who will be free
agents after the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Dodgers can knock payroll off during these meetings,
they may sit down and try to do something with Karros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric's first choice would be to play his whole career in Los
Angeles,'' Jeff Moorad, Karros' agent, said earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would only be down if Karros was given a no-trade
clause through the first two years of the contract. After that,
Karros would have veto power of trades as a player with 10 years
major-league experience, including five with his current team.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's likely Dreifort will be more than willing to test
the free-agent market next winter. Valdes remains on the trade
block.

DUCKS BEATEN BY AVALANCHE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The once-mighty Colorado Avalanche came into
the Pond on Friday night just another .500 team and were missing
Joe Sakic to boot.
</P>
<P>
   But the Anaheim Mighty Ducks are just another .500 team
themselves and they found out in a 2-1 loss before 13,927 that two
mistakes can still be two too many in today's NHL.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that the Ducks played a bad game _ they actually
turned in one of their more spirited performances of the season.
But one mistake by the penalty killing unit and a soft goal allowed
by Guy Hebert was all Patrick Roy and the Avalanche needed.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado took a 2-0 lead on goals by Chris Drury and Jeff Odgers
and then held on. Ruslan Salei pulled the Ducks within one late in
the second period, but Anaheim couldn't get another by Roy, who
stopped 24 of 25 shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' best shot at tying the game came midway through the
third period when Jeff Nielsen's point-blank shot was stopped Roy,
who was hugging the right post.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks, who failed to convert their only power-play chance of
the third period then all but lost any chance of evening things up
when Marty McInnis was hit with a questionable hooking call at
17:57.
</P>
<P>
   But it was major mistakes in the first and second periods that
cost the Ducks dearly.
</P>
<P>
   After killing off 19 consecutive penalties, Anaheim penalty
killers gave the league's best power play one too many chances and
the Ducks paid the price.
</P>
<P>
   Pascal Trepanier had plenty of time to clear the puck, but
failed to do so. Guy Hebert then stopped Milan Hejduk's shot from
the left circle, but after a wild scramble Salei accidently pushed
the rebound under his goalie and right on the stick of Chris Drury.
The Colorado center calmly lifted a shot over the pile at 18:46 for
his eighth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be Odgers' first goal since Dec. 12, 1998 that
would prove to be the real backbreaker. The Ducks, with the help of
two consecutive power plays had dominated the first 5{ minutes,
only to have a harmless looking backhander by Odgers somehow sneak
between Hebert's pads.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne both had great chances early in
the period and Nielsen rang a one-timer off the crossbar less than
a minute before Odgers gave the Avalanche a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks did continue to apply the pressure and their
persistence finally paid off at 15:04 when Salei scored his first
goal since Jan. 1 on a rising shot from the left point. The goal
came after the line of Kariya, Temmu Selanne and Steve Rucchin had
begun to wear down Colorado, a job that the trio of Mike Leclerc,
Tony Hrkac and Nielsen finished off.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Drury's goal, the scoring chances were few and far
between, and the first 10 minutes seemed to be an extension of
Wednesday night's snooze fest with Vancouver. When the game finally
did open up late in the period, nobody could hit the net.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Forsberg sent Brian Rolston in all alone on Hebert, but
the winger whipped it over the top of the net. At the other end,
both McInnis and Kariya were left unattended in the slot, but
neither was able to test Roy with their shots.

MOISO ADMITS HE HAS NBA ON THE BRAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sophomore forward Jerome Moiso leads UCLA in
scoring and rebounding and has, for the moment, established himself
as one of the Pacific-10's top players. The coaches attribute
Moiso's improvement to maturity, but there's a higher calling at
work: the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso, a projected first-round pick, said he's considering
leaving school after this season. Several UCLA sources said Moiso
intends to leave, with injury the lone obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The NBA) is the main reason, I'm not going to lie,'' Moiso
said when asked about his inspired play. ``I've got to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are in a quandary. If Moiso plays well, they probably
will, too. But if he plays well, he'll probably leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell the staff we don't want to develop them (Moiso and
center Dan Gadzuric) too quickly, because we don't want them to
leave,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA might be Moiso's primary motivation, but maturity has
clearly aided his performance. Last year, he was tentative on the
court and lacked confidence off it. A native of Guadeloupe who was
educated in France and speaks moderate English, Moiso continually
disparaged himself. He even asked to come off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he's more confident, more aggressive, and more
consistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new year for him,'' said UCLA assistant coach Jim Saia,
who recruited Moiso. ``He's acclimated socially, he's more
comfortable around the coaching staff and he knows what to
expect.''
</P>
<P>
   And he knows what the NBA scouts like _ and don't like. No one
questions Moiso's skills. He's 6-foot-10, athletic and capable of
scoring from the low post or 3-point line. But he hasn't shown the
aggressiveness needed to compete against NBA power forwards. Scouts
think he's soft, and that a tough tag to shake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have periods where I'm wondering if I should do this
or do that, but I'm more confident more often,'' said Moiso, who's
averaging 16 points and 7.7 rebounds. ``I'm more aggressive more
often. I want to dominate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lineup update: The Bruins didn't have enough bodies Friday for a
five-on-five scrimmage, so assistant coaches Jim Saia and Michael
Holton suited up.
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric rested his tender knees. Guard Ryan Bailey has
tendinitis in his foot and is questionable for today's game against
Gonzaga. JaRon Rush is suspended, and forward Todd Ramasar is out
several months with a shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   The probable starters are Moiso, forwards Jason Kapono and Rico
Hines, and guards Earl Watson and Ray Young.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Gadzuric, forward Sean Farnham and guard Billy
Knight as the lone reserves if Bailey can't play.

RECORD IS IN GOOD HANDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Sometimes the record makes the man, cloaks
an athlete in history, dresses up the career of an otherwise
unremarkable figure.
</P>
<P>
   You could say Roger Maris set one of those records when he hit
61 home runs. The mark was so much bigger than the player it
practically consumed him.
</P>
<P>
   And then, sometimes, the man makes the record.
</P>
<P>
   Laffit Pincay set one of those records Friday at Hollywood Park
by riding the 8,834th winner of his unbelievable career.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Shoemaker had held one of those records for 29 years before
Pincay. Johnny Longden had held one of those records for 14 years
before Shoemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Why is the record for career victories by a thoroughbred jockey
significant? Because of the greatness of the riders who passed it
down and the greatness of the rider who owns it for the foreseeable
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any feeling about the record,'' Shoemaker said
from his wheelchair after Pincay rode the maiden colt Irish Nip to
victory in the sixth race. ``Any feeling I had was about Laffit
being the one to break it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker, who has always cheered Pincay on, praised his friend
as ``a great family man and a great rider.''
</P>
<P>
   Pincay, as always, returned the compliment, saying his friend
the Shoe ``is still No. 1 in my book.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact they've played guardian to the record has made 8,834
the most revered number in the world of horse racing.
</P>
<P>
   But the record might not always be in such worthy hands. Its
future is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay, 52, has said he aims to get to 9,000 before retiring.
Even if he reaches that milestone, though, it probably won't be too
many years before his record is under assault.
</P>
<P>
   A worthy challenger would be leading Midwestern rider Pat Day,
third on the all-time list, some 1,220 behind Pincay.
</P>
<P>
   But a more likely _ and more controversial _ threat to the
record comes from the San Francisco Bay Area's Russell Baze, eighth
on the list, 2,043 behind Pincay and gaining every day.
</P>
<P>
   Baze is 41-years-old and had been winning at a rate of more than
400 a year at Bay Meadows, Golden Gate Fields and the Northern
California county fair tracks. At that pace, with good health, he'd
catch Pincay in the middle of the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Returning Wednesday, six weeks from a back fracture that was
supposed to sideline him for three months, Baze rode four winners
at Golden Gate to show he's still the King of the Bay.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether Baze's winners at the lower-quality northern
tracks should count as much as the victories Pincay and Shoemaker
achieved against the nation's toughest competition. And whether a
man who has never sniffed victory in a Triple Crown or Breeders'
Cup race deserves mention alongside them.
</P>
<P>
   Baze, a pleasant man from a family of horsemen, argues firmly
that he wouldn't cheapen the record, that there's nothing wrong
with his sport's unique policy of counting statistics recorded at
minor-league tracks just the same as those earned in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, a win is a win, no matter what kind
of animal it is or where it happens, whether it's Timbuktu or Santa
Anita,'' Baze said on the phone this week. He says anybody calling
his competition second-rate should ``say that to the face of the
guys I'm riding against.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes that in the three years he rode against a jockeys'
room full of Hall of Famers and Kentucky Derby winners in Southern
California, he held his own when given worthy horses.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains that Baze had to go back north in 1991, to a
room of far less accomplished jockeys, to attract the daily supply
of favorites he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a pointless debate. Try to distinguish
``legitimate'' and ``illegitimate'' racing records because of the
quality of the competition or any of an infinite number of other
reasons and you'd end up with 8,834 asterisks on the stat sheet.
</P>
<P>
   But thinking about Baze's potential record run helps one to
appreciate what Pincay accomplished in the past 35 years while
rarely straying from the big-league diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact he did it competing against the best, that's pretty
neat,'' trainer Bob Baffert said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It's neat record because it was held by Longden. It's a neat
record because it was held by Shoemaker. Now it's a neat record
because it's held by Pincay.

KINGS PLACE PALFFY ON INJURED RESERVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Although the Los Angeles Kings are hopeful Ziggy
Palffy can play Tuesday night in New Jersey, they placed him on
injured reserve Friday night so they can add a player to their
depleted roster.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, sidelined since last Saturday with back spasms, was
placed on the seven-day IR to give the Kings options on defense
after Rob Blake could not play Friday because of a strained groin.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Jaroslav Modry dressed for the game and played 19
minutes and 56 seconds. Newcomer Jere Karalahti made the trip, but
did not play.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, who leads the club in scoring with 26 points, remains in
Los Angeles undergoing physical therapy at the club's Iceoplex
training facility. He has skated for 10 minutes each of the past
two days and is scheduled to rejoin the team Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still up in the air,'' Kings coach Andy Murray said.
``He hasn't skated much and definitely not with the team. We're
hoping for Tuesday, but it is hard to say right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Payback for Manny: Former Kings goaltender Manny Legace recorded
his second victory for the Red Wings. He faced only 16 shots in the
first two periods, but withstood 12 shots in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Legace, who defeated Nashville 6-3 Wednesday, was the Kings'
starting goalie last season after Jamie Storr and Stephane Fiset
went out with injuries just seven minutes apart in the fourth game
of the year. The Kings won just two of the next 16 games and never
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings tried to re-sign Legace during the off-season, but
with Storr and Fiset returning, Legace opted for free agency and
signed with Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset getting close: Murray thought injured goalie Fiset might
be ready to back up Storr tonight in Montreal. But Fiset, out five
weeks with a deep bone bruised yo his right hand, isn't ready even
though Friday's workout went well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first one with the team,'' Fiset said. ``I took a
couple shots off the hand and it felt OK. I think the guys were a
little nervous shooting at it than I was. It felt OK and I could
squeeze the stick better. That is the most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcel Cousineau, who replaced Fiset on the roster Nov. 6,
remains the backup.
</P>
<P>
   Luc stays: Luc Robitaille will remain in his native Montreal
after the team leaves Saturday night to be part of a ceremony to
retire his junior hockey jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille wore No. 15 for nearby Hull, Quebec for three years
and had 68 goals and 123 assist for 191 points during the 1985-86
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pretty special,'' said Robitaille, who will rejoin the
Kings on Monday in New Jersey. ``It has been a while since I was
there, so it's going to be fun to go back Sunday. I was quite
surprised when they called me. It's quite an honor to have your
jersey up in a building.''

JERRY'S PROPOSES REVERSE STOCK SPLIT

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES -- In an attempt to boost its stock price to avoid
being delisted from the Nasdaq National Market, Jerry's Famous Deli
Inc. says its board of directors has approved a 1-for-3 reverse
stock split.
</P>
<P>
   The chain of delicatessens based in the Los Angeles-area
community of Studio City also said it would ask to have its stock
moved to the Nasdaq SmallCap Market instead of the OTC market while
it awaits a decision on the national market listing.
</P>
<P>
   As previously reported by the Los Angeles Daily News, Nasdaq
officials notified the company last month that its stock would be
delisted Dec. 27 if it couldn't come into compliance with listing
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Jerry's stock does not currently maintain the
minimum bid price of $1 sufficient to allow it to move to the
Nasdaq SmallCap Market.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, unless the company files an appeal, its stock will be
delisted from the Nasdaq and placed on the OTC Bulletin Board, an
exchange with less stringent listing requirements and, thus, fewer
traders.
</P>
<P>
   The company intends to file an appeal with Nasdaq, in order to
try to maintain its listing on the Nasdaq National Market while it
executes the plan to move to the Nasdaq SmallCap Market, said Issac
Starkman, Jerry's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully anticipate that Nasdaq will go along with our plan,''
said Starkman. ``We hope and we think the stock split will have the
right impact and the stock should be over a dollar and in no threat
of being delisted.''
</P>
<P>
   Starkman said he expects shareholders to approve the reverse
stock split when they vote on the plan in a couple of weeks. The
plan calls for stockholders to receive one share for every three
shares they own, which will decrease the number of outstanding
shares from 14.6 million to around 4 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1978, Jerry's Deli operates seven restaurants under
the Jerry's Famous Deli name and one restaurant as Solley's Deli in
Southern California. Jerry's also owns Rascal House and Epicure
Market in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Jerry's Deli closed down 3 cents Friday at 75 cents.

DUCKS BEATEN BY AVALANCHE

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The once-mighty Colorado Avalanche came into
Friday night's game just another .500 team, struggling without the
services of captain Joe Sakic.
</P>
<P>
   But the Anaheim Mighty Ducks are just another .500 team
themselves and they found out in a 2-1 loss before 13,927 at the
Pond that two mistakes can still be two too many against a team
that still has Peter Forsberg and Patrick Roy.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that the Ducks played poorly _ they actually turned in
a spirited performance over the last 50 minutes. But the penalty
killing unit's failure to clear a puck against the NHL's No.
1-ranked power play and a soft goal allowed by the normally
reliable Guy Herbert doomed the Ducks and sent them back to .500
(13-13-4-1) for the 11th time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we played a pretty good game,'' said Ducks coach
Craig Hartsburg. ``But we need to get some momentum going early,
force the tempo of the game, instead of waiting for the other team
to dictate the game to us. We can't wait until we get behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado (14-13-3-1) took a 2-0 lead on goals by Chris Drury and
Jeff Odgers and then held on. Ruslan Salei pulled the Ducks within
one late in the second period, but Anaheim couldn't get another by
Roy, who stopped 24 of 25 shots and tied Hall of Famer Tony
Esposito for third on the NHL all-time victory list by goalies with
423.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks, especially Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne, seemed to
be one step away from scoring all night. But the Avalanche blocked
several great chances at the defense and its defensemen were always
there to clear away the few rebounds Roy left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had scoring chances, but we didn't get second or third
opportunities,'' said Kariya of the Ducks, who outshot Colorado,
25-20. ``It was always one shot and clear.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was Pascal Trepanier's failure to clear the puck that put
the Ducks behind the eight-ball at 18:46 of the first period. The
Anaheim defenseman had plenty of time to clear the zone, but
couldn't do so and within seconds Drury scored over a pileup in
front of the Ducks' net.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do that you give them a second chance,'' Hartsburg
said. ``And when a good power play gets a second chance it usually
burns you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebert stopped Milan Hejduk's shot from the left circle, but
after a scramble Salei accidentally pushed the rebound under his
goalie and right to Drury, who ended Anaheim's penalty-killing
streak at 19.
</P>
<P>
   Odgers' first goal since Dec. 12, 1998 proved to be the real
backbreaker. The Ducks, with the help of two consecutive power
plays, had dominated the first 5{ minutes, only to have a
harmless-looking backhander by Odgers somehow sneak between
Hebert's pads.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't a great goal,'' Hartsburg said. ``It was
unfortunate since he has played so well lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Kariya and Selanne both had great chances to tie the game early
in the second period and Jeff Nielsen rang a one-timer off the
crossbar less than a minute before Odgers scored at 5:44.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks did continue to apply the pressure and their
persistence finally paid off at 15:04 when Salei scored his first
goal since Jan. 1 on a rising shot from the left point. The goal
came after the line of Kariya, Selanne and Steve Rucchin had begun
to wear down Colorado, a job that the trio of Mike Leclerc, Tony
Hrkac and Nielsen finished off.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Drury's goal, the scoring chances were few and far
between, and the first 10 minutes seemed to be an extension of
Wednesday night's snoozefest with Vancouver. When the game finally
did open up late in the period, nobody could hit the net.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Forsberg sent Brian Rolston in all alone on Hebert, but
the winger whipped it over the top of the net. At the other end,
both Marty McInnis and Kariya were left unattended in the slot, but
neither was able to test Roy with their shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get the puck on net before you can score,'' said
Hartsburg.

<P>
   In 1994, when Chevie was 21, Kirby and Gloria Kehoe moved their
family to Kingston, Ark., in the Ozarks. There, they became friends
with a gun dealer, William Mueller, and his wife, Nancy. They
traveled the same gun show circuit, shared anti-government views,
and identified with the Christian Identity religion.
</P>
<P>
   But friendship did not stand in the way of profit. In January
1995, Kirby and Chevie Kehoe burglarized the Muellers' home in
Tilly, Ark., and took thousands of dollars' worth of guns and gold
and silver coins.
</P>
<P>
   Chevie Kehoe then returned to Washington, on the way stopping at
Elohim City, a Christian Identity community in Oklahoma, where he
asked an escaped convict, Faron Lovelace, to accompany him for
protection.
</P>
<P>
   On June 12, 1995, Kirby and Chevie Kehoe mounted another
fund-raising operation in Colville, Wash., sending Lovelace into
the home of two well-to-do grocery store owners, Malcolm and
Jillian Friedman. Lovelace later said he targeted the Friedmans
because he thought they were Jewish and would be easy to kill if
something went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Lovelace held Friedman hostage and ordered Mrs. Friedman to go
out and collect cash. Then he forced the Friedmans to go to
Spokane, where he set them free.
</P>
<P>
   The money from the Arkansas and Washington crimes went to buy
land near Priest River, Idaho, where Chevie Kehoe planned to set up
a training camp for revolutionaries, prosecutors in his trial said.
</P>
<P>
   By winter, the money was gone, and knowing that William Mueller
had come into a $50,000 inheritance, Chevie Kehoe decided to rob
him again. This time, his accomplice was Danny Lee, a skinhead from
Oklahoma with lightning bolts tattooed on his neck. Lee was known
as ``Cyclops'' because he had lost an eye in a bar fight.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 11, 1996, Kehoe and Lee, disguised as federal agents,
broke into the Muellers' home and waited for the family to return.
It was almost summer by the time the remains of the family _ the
father, mother and 8-year-old daughter, Sarah _ were found in the
Illinois Bayou near Russellville. A woman who was fishing hooked a
shoe and a bone.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kehoe later told investigators that her son told her about
his role in the Mueller murders shortly after the crime, but that
she kept quiet. That July 1996, the Kehoe family had moved to
another remote home, in Yaak, Mont. Cheyne and his wife and son
lived nearby until that winter, when Chevie came to get them. The
two brothers and their families drove south together to look for
work in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Cheyne knew nothing about the murders until they were traveling
together and Chevie began selling guns because they could not find
work. At that point his brother told him, Cheyne later told
investigators, because some of the guns had been stolen from the
Muellers.
</P>
<P>
   By then, investigators were tracing other Mueller guns to the
Kehoes. Shortly after the family disappeared, the pistol from an
empty gun box found in the house was recovered at a Seattle pawn
shop and traced to Kirby Kehoe. Months later, another Mueller gun,
an AR-15 rifle, was recovered from Sean Haines, a former Aryan
Nations youth leader. It had been sold by Chevie Kehoe.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers' luck ran out as they traveled through Ohio, where
a state trooper stopped them for driving with expired plates.
Chevie broke away from being searched because he was carrying a
gun, and Cheyne opened fire. The ensuing gun battle, caught on
videotape by a camera on the trooper's dashboard, was broadcast
nationwide. But both brothers escaped.
</P>
<P>
   With help from their parents, the brothers and their families
escaped to Utah, where the men found work under assumed names. But
according to Cheyne Kehoe and his wife, Tanna, Chevie's behavior
became more violent and erratic. When Chevie said he was thinking
of killing his parents so he could raise his younger brothers
himself, Cheyne decided he had to be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Cheyne surrendered on June 16, 1997. The next day, using his
information, the FBI arrested Chevie Kehoe.
</P>
<P>
   Chevie Kehoe was charged with federal racketeering counts that
included the three murders. At his trial in Little Rock this year,
the principal witnesses for the prosecution were his brother Cheyne
and his mother, Gloria.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Gloria Kehoe had called the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms and said her husband had struck her and pointed an
AR-15 rifle at her. ``My husband was going to kill me,'' she said.
``I knew too much. I wanted my nightmare to be over.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria and Cheyne Kehoe told the jury that Chevie Kehoe
confessed to them that he and Danny Lee had surprised the Muellers,
handcuffed the parents, stunned them with an electric stun gun and
taped plastic bags over their heads to suffocate. Then they had
forced 8-year-old Sarah to tell them where her parents' valuables
were hidden. Then, when Danny Lee said he could not kill a child,
Chevie Kehoe killed her.
</P>
<P>
   Chevie Kehoe was sentenced to three life terms. Lee was
sentenced to death. Cheyne had been sentenced to 24 years for the
Ohio shootout, and Kirby Kehoe had been sentenced to 44 months in
prison after pleading guilty to racketeering charges and admitting
he belonged to his son's white supremacist organization.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Chevie Kehoe said afterward that his mother's testimony
shattered him. ``What more powerful witness can you put on the
stand than a person's mother?'' he asked. He said he told himself:
``It's not Mom up there. It's somebody I don't know. Mom wouldn't
do this to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He contended that his mother, with six sons still at home,
agreed to testify because she was afraid the government would
prosecute her for tax evasion in the sale of the family's property
in Arkansas, where she had used a false Social Security number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her husband was in prison,'' Chevie Kehoe said. ``My brother
was in prison. I'm in prison. If she's in prison, where do her six
children go? I was the sacrifice to save my other brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In August, when Kirby Kehoe was sentenced, Judge G. Thomas
Eisele of U.S. District Court said he was sorry that sentencing
guidelines would not let him impose a longer sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're dealing with here is the man who is the father of
Chevie Kehoe, the man who raised Chevie Kehoe,'' he said. Although
Kirby Kehoe was not responsible for all his son's deeds, Eisele
said, ``he was a major factor in his son's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Chevie Kehoe put it this way: ``I'm the one left at the end of
the chain of these people's beliefs.''

CHEATING ON TESTS: THE HIGHER THE STAKES, THE GREATER THE

<P>
   Last week, investigators in New York City said they had
uncovered the most widespread public-school cheating scandal in the
nation, encompassing 32 schools, dozens of teachers and two
principals. The methods _ from teachers using palm cards to
overzealous test coaching _ were so varied and so widespread that
they might only be the tip of the iceberg, investigators contended.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same sort of thing occurred recently in Texas, where
school officials and politicians like Gov. George W. Bush were
brandishing the results of a standardized test to claim victory
over ignorance. There, too, a cheating scandal has erupted which
calls some of the achievement into doubt.
</P>
<P>
   While officials trumpet higher scores, it also appears that an
old staple of education is gaining ground: cheating. And it is not
just students who are the culprits, but adults: the teachers,
principals, superintendents and other administrators charged with
watching over them.
</P>
<P>
   This rash of dishonesty has spread at the same time that
superintendents and politicians across the country have set tough
new test-score targets for their school systems. A ``standards''
revolution is sweeping through the classroom, tying promotion and
graduation of students and even cash bonuses for everyone from
principals to cafeteria workers to measurable achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The current scandals have emboldened critics who question the
validity of standardized testing, in particular high-stakes,
high-pressure tests tied to promotion and graduation. And they have
sharpened the argument over whether it is possible to have
accountability without some form of testing.
</P>
<P>
   At one end of the spectrum are organizations like Fair Test,
based in Boston, a group that monitors testing abuses and has been
a staunch critic of the testing industry. They see the new
accountability measures _ from publishing test scores in local
newspapers to state takeovers of failing schools _ as a way of
encouraging abuses. ``It's sort of like the Soviet Union; everybody
ends up lying,'' said Monty Neill, executive director of Fair Test.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-test groups oppose even the newest tests, which require
children to organize their ideas into a coherent essay and, in
math, ask them to explain their reasoning, not just present
answers.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the fence are educators and scholars like
Diane Ravitch, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who
passionately defends testing. ``To say that tests create cheating
is wrong,'' Dr. Ravitch said. ``What creates cheating is people who
cheat. If we spent as much time teaching kids as showing them the
answer, they might have learned to read.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of standards, tests and stark consequences for
failing to meet them _ like withholding high school diplomas _ say
that for too long, an officially sanctioned system of low
expectations has consigned many poor and disadvantaged children to
a second-class education.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about how hard it is to raise test scores, it
sounds like you are defending current practice,'' says Seymour
Fliegel, president of the Center for Educational Innovation in New
York City. New tests that require 9-year-olds to write essays with
correct spelling, grammar and punctuation are a far cry from the
multiple choice bubbles of the past, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the idea that kids should be able to find a main idea;
that they should know how to find supporting details; how to draw
an inference, vocabulary,'' Fliegel said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is evidence that testing has always encouraged
cheating, at least where the stakes were high enough.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Haney, a professor at the Center for the Study of Testing
at Boston College, points out that the current debate is following
a pattern established in 19th century England. A program called
``Payment by Results'' reigned in English and Welsh elementary
schools from 1862 to 1897. Every student was examined annually by a
royal inspector, and teachers received government grants if their
students performed well. Among the results were that teachers
school-hopped, looking for positions that would pay better.
</P>
<P>
   There were also complaints that teachers tried to get copies of
arithmetic questions used in other schools, and then drilled their
students in them, in the hope of raising test scores.
</P>
<P>
   Test preparation is one of those ethical gray areas, where the
line between what is legitimate and illegitimate may be ill
defined. In fact, many school districts not only sanction test
preparation but spend large portions of their budgets paying for
it.
</P>
<P>
   The public schools have embarked on a new mission _ or at least
begun a new fad. Suddenly, teachers and students are expected to
produce results. But the reality is that real change and real
progress in the schools is hard to produce and takes time. Cheating
may be one of the unintended consequences of the increasing
reliance on standardized tests and the pressure to perform better,
fast.
</P>
<P>
   That is one motivation behind the accusations in New York and
Texas. Last January, the Texas Education Agency sent letters to
Houston and 10 other school districts saying that an analysis of
test results showed that unusually high numbers of wrong answers
had been erased and replaced with correct ones. In April, the
county attorney in Austin charged the city's school district and a
top administrator with test tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Texas officials have publicized statistics showing a narrowing
achievement gap between white students, who typically score higher,
and blacks and Hispanics. But in a legal challenge to the tests, an
expert witness has testified that 10th-grade test scores among
black and Hispanic children have been inflated by holding back
those who are failing, so they are not counted in the results.
</P>
<P>
   Even when tests are conducted honestly and scores do go up
sharply, it is often for reasons that have little to do with
improvements in teaching or learning. More commonly, the big jumps
_ what statisticians call statistical outliers _ betray something
more insidious at work: a new magnet program that attracts more
affluent or gifted students, perhaps, or test preparation mania.
Ultimately, standardized tests are probably most useful in
measuring the improvement, or decline, of an educational system
over an extended period of time.

arithmetic questions used in other schools, and then drilled their
students in them, in the hope of raising test scores.
</P>
<P>
   Test preparation is one of those ethical gray areas, where the
line between what is legitimate and illegitimate may be ill
defined. In fact, many school districts not only sanction test
preparation but spend large portions of their budgets paying for
it.
</P>
<P>
   The public schools have embarked on a new mission _ or at least
begun a new fad. Suddenly, teachers and students are expected to
produce results. But the reality is that real change and real
progress in the schools is hard to produce and takes time. Cheating
may be one of the unintended consequences of the increasing
reliance on standardized tests and the pressure to perform better,
fast.
</P>
<P>
   That is one motivation behind the accusations in New York and
Texas. Last January, the Texas Education Agency sent letters to
Houston and 10 other school districts saying that an analysis of
test results showed that unusually high numbers of wrong answers
had been erased and replaced with correct ones. In April, the
county attorney in Austin charged the city's school district and a
top administrator with test tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Texas officials have publicized statistics showing a narrowing
achievement gap between white students, who typically score higher,
and blacks and Hispanics. But in a legal challenge to the tests, an
expert witness has testified that 10th-grade test scores among
black and Hispanic children have been inflated by holding back
those who are failing, so they are not counted in the results.
</P>
<P>
   Even when tests are conducted honestly and scores do go up
sharply, it is often for reasons that have little to do with
improvements in teaching or learning. More commonly, the big jumps
_ what statisticians call statistical outliers _ betray something
more insidious at work: a new magnet program that attracts more
affluent or gifted students, perhaps, or test preparation mania.
Ultimately, standardized tests are probably most useful in
measuring the improvement, or decline, of an educational system
over an extended period of time.

<P>
   The opening of ``Y2K,'' a new play by Arthur Kopit, in a New
York theater last week was notable in a couple of ways, not the
least of which was the continued abuse of the millennium's most
overused catch phrase.
</P>
<P>
   But Kopit's thriller stands out for another reason as well: its
villain. The character, Costa Astrakhan, is an evil computer genius
who methodically eliminates the hero's credit rating and bank
accounts and frames him as a child molester, all the while hissing
lines like: ``When I'm on the hunt, I'm as relentless as the wrath
of God.''
</P>
<P>
   While critical reaction to the play has been largely negative,
the emergence of Astrakhan seems to mark the continued evolution of
a uniquely modern character in film, television and, now, in
theater: the hacker. And it is a character _ some would say a
stereotype _ that has undergone a radical makeover since its birth
sometime in the dark ages known as the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is the bespectacled, plaid-shirted, pizza-stained wretch
who guzzles soda while fumbling through cyberspace. Astrakhan wears
leather, dyes his hair blonde and dons strawberry-tinted
sunglasses. If he weren't busy destroying lives via his laptop, he
could pass for a fashionista. The same style is also evident in
this year's uber-hacker hit, ``The Matrix,'' which had its heroes
swathed in trench coats, form-fitting vests and pants _ all in
black leather and latex.
</P>
<P>
   But not only are the hackers dressing better, they've also taken
on a distinctly new attitude. And more often than not, there's a
reason the characters are dressed in black. They're the bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Kopit's creation, consider the recent NBC movie,
also called ``Y2K,'' in which two teen-age hackers caddishly
abandon a teen-age girl after the fabled millennial glitch causes a
blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Films, in particular, have grabbed hold of the hacker as a handy
villain. In 1995 ``The Net'' featured a sinister conspiracy that
destroyed Sandra Bullock's identity and tried to kill her.
</P>
<P>
   Even James Bond hates hackers. ``Goldeneye'' featured the
character of Boris, a Russian hacker, who fulfilled a
double-villain quotient by combining a Cold War bad guy with a
cyber world one. Not only does Boris betray his best friend, but he
also has the obnoxious habit of screaming ``I am invincible!'' (To
the contrary, he is frozen by a plume of liquid hydrogen.)
</P>
<P>
   Hacker advocates complained to Miramax Films last year about the
early version of a screenplay of ``Takedown,'' which is based on
the 1996 book by Tsutomu Shimomura with John Markoff of The New
York Times about the capture of Kevin Mitnick, who pleaded guilty
in March to computer fraud and wire fraud and was sentenced to 46
months. They were concerned about a scene in which the Mitnick
character attacked a pursuer with a garbage can lid and several
others they say were invented. Emmanuel Goldstein, who publishes
2600, a hacker magazine, called the initial depiction of Mitnick a
``low blow'' but added that the film company had been receptive to
the hackers' complaints and made changes in the script. Miramax
spokesman Andrew Stengel had no comment on the film, which is in
post-production.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein and others who cover the hacker world say negative
depictions are part of the media's and the public's limited grasp
of what computers _ and the people who master them _ can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has a tendency to vilify what they don't
understand,'' said Luke Reiter, a reporter for the interactive
cable channel ZDTV, which covers the Internet. ``And there's a
certain amount of unknown about what happens with a hacker: who he
is, what he looks like. People simply don't know what that person
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Wellen, who also covers the hacker community for ZDTV,
pointed out that while hackers often work in positive ways _
testing computer security and tracking down child pornography
rings, for example _ much of the news the public gets is bad. Last
week, a New Jersey hacker, David Lee Smith, pleaded guilty to
creating the ``Melissa'' virus, the most widely spread, disruptive
and costly computer virus in history.
</P>
<P>
   The daily annoyances of the computer age perhaps contribute to
the artist's distrust of those who glibly navigate cyberspace. The
demise of the hero in ``Y2K'' was inspired by an actual incident in
which Kopit's hard drive crashed while he was writing the play.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe computer bad guys are just more fun to watch, Wellen said.
``Portraying someone as a villain is much more interesting than
someone who can recognize a security flaw in a computer system,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always like this. Take ``War Games,'' the 1983 movie
that is arguably the parent of all hacker movies, plays or
television shows. The film starred Matthew Broderick as David
Lightman, a nerdy but nice computer enthusiast whose idea of making
trouble was changing a chemistry grade. Granted, he nearly starts
World War III looking for free video games, but in the end he
outsmarts a supercomputer to avert a global thermonuclear
catastrophe and teach us a valuable lesson about the futility of
armed conflict. (``The only way to win is not to play.'')
</P>
<P>
   The cinematic watershed seemed to occur around 1995, which
brought not only ``The Net'' and ``Goldeneye,'' but also
``Hackers,'' a B-movie about a gang of high school computer
whizzes. But it wasn't the subject matter that was important, it
was the lifestyle. The hackers in ``Hackers'' smoked. They listened
to techno music. They had sex. They were, well, hip.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Keanu Reeves (``The Matrix'') and Tom Cruise
(``Mission: Impossible'') were playing characters who hack. Things
would never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the growing pantheon of characters matches the
reality is an open question. ``There really are no absolutes in
personality, style or viewpoint in the hacker community,'' said
Reiter. ``I mean, some wear leather jackets, some wear Armani
suits.''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the character is still open for writers. Hackers in
bikinis? Why not? Hackers in love? Let the writing begin.
</P>
<P>
   All of which seems to support the credo of Kopit's beleaguered
hero in ``Y2K.'' Quoting Gustave Flaubert, he says, ``Everything
you invent is true.''

CHILDREN

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ By some measures, the Xingzhi primary school in
western Beijing is a huge success. Started in 1994 with just nine
students, it now has 1,266 students from all over the country, and
had to turn away hundreds of applicants this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Its founder, Li Shumei, and her husband, Yi Benyao, who both
moved here from a dead-end town in central China, have taken this
private school from a hut in a vegetable patch to the converted
grounds of a paint factory in just five years. While its classrooms
may be crowded and a bit shabby, the sing-song recitations and the
happy riot at recess testify to real school spirit.
</P>
<P>
   But the school is unlicensed and illegal, and its booming growth
attests to one of China's most enduring social tensions: the
degrading treatment of the tens of millions of rural Chinese who
seek better lives in the cities but are consigned by law and habit
to second-class citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Li, 38, and Yi, 37, run their school on a shoestring, trying
to provide education for some of Beijing's 100,000 children of
so-called migrant workers _ most of whom are actually long-term
residents of the city whose work in construction, vending, garbage
collecting and other low-end jobs is vital to the city's life.
</P>
<P>
   Schooling is supposed to be compulsory for Chinese children, and
cities are supposed to make sure migrant children get an education.
Beijing and other cities have complied with the letter of the law _
by allowing migrant children to attend public schools if they pay
stiff fees that few can afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely not fair, but we all feel there's nothing we
can do about it,'' said Yi, whose school _ named, hopefully, after
a famous early 20th century educator _ gets no government aid. More
than once, the school has been driven off a new site by police.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, according to one recent survey by
government researchers, more than 100 unlicensed schools, most of
them much smaller than Xingzhi and some run by people with no more
than a junior high school education, have sprung up in Beijing. The
educational plight of the migrant children is so acute that some
official newspapers have carried exposes, and students and faculty
members from teacher colleges have given volunteer help.
</P>
<P>
   A horrified journalist, chronicling a visit to an especially
desolate migrant school for The Beijing Youth Daily, was stunned to
see how far removed from the mainstream the children were.
``Suddenly,'' the writer noted, ``I realized that they were not
wearing the red scarf,'' the near-ubiquitous Young Pioneer kerchief
that is obligatory for Chinese schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the reporter added, these pupils were ``luckier than the
children still playing in the vegetable markets every day.''
</P>
<P>
   While many of the 3 million or so migrants in Beijing are single
and work here temporarily, a growing number stay on for years, if
not for good. Lacking the treasured permanent residence
certificate, they must annually prove that they have a job and
apply for new temporary permits. Others, unable to obtain the
needed papers, must dodge the periodic police sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   The country's system of residential permits was originally
established by the Communist government to control the movements of
people and prevent the growth of vast urban shantytowns. Now, in a
freer society and a fast-developing economy that demands labor
mobility, it appears increasingly outdated, and the authorities
seem to be at a loss to cope with a ``floating population'' that
may surpass 100 million people nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   For China's leaders, the permit system still serves a crucial
political purpose: It protects urban workers from competition that
would push down wages and spread both unemployment and the urban
worker unrest that the authorities most fear.
</P>
<P>
   The legalized privileges of official urban residents, who make
up less than one-third of the national population, seem certain to
rankle more and more in the years ahead, especially after China
enters the World Trade Organization and opens up markets for
agricultural products. The new global competition is expected to
kill off marginal producers and force farming to become more
efficient _ driving more rural people to search for work in the
cities.
</P>
<P>
   The migrants already face a raft of prejudices. They are blamed
in official residents' everyday conversations for virtually all of
Beijing's crime, crowding and dirt. Even in official discourse,
they are invariably referred to as ``outsiders,'' and social mixing
with permanent residents is rare. Many migrants live in illegally
built rented rooms, subject to demolition during crackdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But the discrimination is more than cultural. To protect the
incomes of natives, some cities, including Beijing, have legally
banned the hiring of nonresidents for many jobs above the lower
rungs.
</P>
<P>
   An article in The Economic Daily this month stated baldly:
``Workers without an urban residence permit suffer from general
social discrimination. They are not only treated unequally in
wages, housing, medical care, unemployment insurance and schooling
for their children, they also face the risk of being fired at any
time.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Li and Yi are trying to make the best of a bad situation.
Ms. Li, a former teacher in their home province of Henan, was
working in a Beijing street market in 1994 when some relatives'
children needed schooling. She started with just nine children, but
was soon besieged by other migrant parents.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1995, with enrollment at 50 and rising, her
husband moved from Henan to become principal of the expanding
school. They were finally able to rent the former paint factory off
a litter-strewn alley through the $10,000 gift of a
Chinese-American in Los Angeles who had read about their struggles
in a newspaper for Chinese overseas. They have transformed the
factory into something approaching a school, with classrooms
surrounding a well-used exercise yard, and have rented a separate
building for teaching fifth- and sixth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   But the budget, built from the grateful payments of migrants who
want their children to have a chance at better lives, remains
paltry. ``We are eating next year's food to get by this year,'' Yi
said. ``We can barely manage.''
</P>
<P>
   The tuition for each child is $36 per semester, plus $7 for
books. Adding up to $86 per year, this is just feasible for the
workers, who are often earning less than $100 a month.
</P>
<P>
   To attend public schools nearby on the outskirts of Beijing,
migrant applicants must pay special fees of at least $360 per year,
as well as the $80 for books and fees that official residents pay.
In the city center, all these fees can be much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Yi is the first to admit that a lower budget takes a toll. Only
one-fourth of the school's teachers are certified, teaching classes
with more than 50 children each _ ``but we still have to reject so
many students who want to come in,'' he said. Only with volunteer
teachers can nonbasic subjects like art and music be taught.
</P>
<P>
   The school uses some of the same textbooks as the public
schools, and gives the same final exams as a way to check on
progress. In the early grades, the migrant children at Xingzhi do
just about as well as public school students, Yi said, but by fifth
grade they are falling behind.
</P>
<P>
   Since the school is not certified, even the best students may
not be able to gain entry to high school. A few cities in China
have begun to give accreditation to similar migrant schools, Yi
said, but in Beijing, he added, the response to numerous
applications has been, ``be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Without any legal status, the school was driven out of several
previous locations by developers or the police. The education
department still refuses to license the school, but with the help
of some well-connected sympathizers, Xinzhi has obtained tenuous
permission from the police to keep operating at the factory site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the students and the teachers constantly worry that this
school may be closed down,'' Yi said. ``They always feel ill at
ease, and it's not good for either of them.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of the biggest obstacles to educational progress, Yi
said, may be a less tangible one, resulting from the pervasive
ostracism and ridicule of poor, rural migrants in the big city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids feel they must be inferior to the public school
kids,'' he said. ``We spend a lot of time telling the students that
they don't have to feel inferior.''

BRAZIL CARNIVAL'S FABLED AMITY MAY HIDE BIGOTRY

<TEXT>
<P>
   SALVADOR, Brazil _ To outsiders, this alluring port city of 2
million appears to be a model of racial harmony, a place where
blacks and whites can mingle and marry without friction. Its
residents have long prided themselves on that image, propagated by
the novels of Jorge Amado and countless Brazilian pop songs, and
made it a promotional tool for their booming tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
   But now a spate of complaints of blatant racial discrimination
has sparked court cases and a municipal investigation, forcing a
re-examination of that cherished belief. Even worse, the focal
point of the furor is the famed pre-Lenten Carnival in this
predominantly black city, an annual festival in which all barriers
and inhibitions are supposed to melt away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows racism exists here, but when you go to talk
about it, no one wants to recognize it exists, much less recognize
that it is structural,'' said Juca Ferreira, the city councilman
who initiated the official investigation. ``The myth of racial
democracy is so strongly ensconced here that it has become an
instrument of social hypocrisy and stratification, which is
precisely why we need to undertake this exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy began just before last February's celebrations,
when a pair of college friends, Venusemar Andrade and Adriana
Marambaia, went to sign up to parade in a Carnival club called A
Barca, which has about 2,000 members. Miss Andrade is black, Miss
Marambaia white; Miss Andrade's application to join was rejected
without explanation, while Miss Marambaia was immediately admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Miss Marambaia recalled in an interview here, a
leader of the club, one of more than 100 ``blocos'' who enroll
revelers in return for fees of up to $300, approached her and said:
``Are you crazy? Blacks can't join this bloc.'' Another, whom she
has known since childhood, scolded her, asking, ``How many more
darkies are you planning to bring around?''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Andrade said she was ``shocked, hurt and wounded'' when she
learned the reason for her exclusion and decided to file a criminal
complaint of racial discrimination against the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't remain silent, because it was a question of honor,
not just for me, but for all black people,'' she said. ``As a
citizen and a consumer, I have the right not to be blocked by my
color.''
</P>
<P>
   Her tenacity has since spurred other blacks to come forward to
complain of incidents of prejudice and bigotry during Carnival,
which rolls around again in early March.
</P>
<P>
   In another court case, a black teacher married to a white man
was prevented from joining her lighter-skinned child at a ball when
a private security officer grabbed her by the arm, her complaint
alleges, and said, ``Look at this blackie trying to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the club that turned down Miss Andrade deny any
violation of Brazil's 1997 antiracism statute, and her case has
only begun to wind its way through the country's notoriously slow
court system. But her suit has already brought about changes:
nearly 40 of the principal clubs have signed a ``code of conduct''
that severely limits their right to reject applicants and requires
a published explanation, which can be appealed, if they do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carnival reflects the way this city feels and thinks about
itself, and so this is a decisive moment for us,'' said Lidivaldo
Britto, a special government prosecutor who is in charge of
pursuing all complaints of racism here. ``It is high time we
resolve this question so that the black majority can begin to fully
partake in and enjoy all aspects of civic life.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But nothing about race in Brazil is ever as simple as black and
white, beginning with those categories themselves. In contrast to
the United States, where a person with even a trace of African
heritage is almost always considered black, Brazil considers itself
a racial rainbow, with more than 60 terms to designate shades of
skin color. They range from ``preto'' for someone as dark as Pele
to ``brancarao'' for an extremely light-skinned person of mixed
race.
</P>
<P>
   Given that flexibility, many Brazilians who in the United States
would be regarded as black prefer not to classify themselves as
such. The majority of the country's 165 million people may have
some degree of African descent _ even President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso claims a black ancestor _ but they often choose to identify
themselves with vaguer, all-purpose designations like ``moreno,''
or brown-skinned.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Usually, as the court cases here suggest, being lighter-skinned
brings with it more privileges. But now the city's traditional,
white-run blocs are complaining vehemently that they are being
discriminated against and are victims of a double standard, since
Ile Aiye, the main ``bloco Afro,'' as some 20 black Carnival groups
are called, continues to be allowed to forbid the entry of whites.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at Ile Aiye's headquarters in a working-class
neighborhood on the outskirts of town, Antonio Carlos dos Santos, a
founder of the 25-year-old group and its current president,
acknowledged that such a restriction exists. But he was
unapologetic, saying the group was a private cultural association
rather than a public business and therefore entitled to choose its
members.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We formed this group as a reaction to the separation of the
races, to the perverse cultural apartheid that exists here, and we
are not going to give up our black-only policy until we achieve our
objectives and prejudice no longer exists,'' he said. ``If we let
whites and foreigners join, do you think that is going to improve
conditions in the neighborhood or get the police to change their
attitude toward blacks?''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the tensions between white and black clubs also have
to do with the color of money. Carnival here has been transformed
in recent years from a casual neighborhood-focused event into a big
business, with supermarket chains, beverage distributors and
cellular telephone companies paying $250,000 or more to underwrite
the best-known clubs and their balls and parades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carnival is the epicenter of the entire musical and cultural
economy, with everyone wanting exposure so that their name gets
known in the media and their songs get publicized and played on the
radio,'' Ferreira explained. ``It has become a real industry.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, there is fierce competition among the groups to
be able to parade during nationwide prime-time television
broadcasts, when corporate sponsors are likely to have their
affiliation seen by the largest number of people, especially
middle-class revelers who might want to travel here in the future
and enroll in their favorite club. But in contrast to most
Brazilian cities, the order in which the groups parade here is not
determined by a draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Year after year, the same old blocos have a monopoly on prime
time,'' dos Santos complained. ``The Afro blocs, like us and Olodum
and Filhos de Gandhi, we always end up going out at two or three in
the morning, and so it is hard to attract sponsors, a lot of whom
in any case seem to think that black people don't buy cell phones
or refrigerators.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With the annual three-month run-up to the Carnival festivities
beginning, both black and white clubs are already busy designing
their costumes and floats and rehearsing the songs they will be
singing.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Britto said he expects ``we will not have a problem
with discrimination, because society has been mobilized.'' But Miss
Andrade, who started the whole furor, seemed less confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, the clubs are all going to be more cautious from now on,
because they have been given a good scare,'' she said. ``But the
problem doesn't end on Ash Wednesday. I know, for instance, that
when I go into certain boutiques to shop for clothes, I am still
going to have trouble getting salesclerks to wait on me, and it
will be because I am black.''

DEFEAT FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS UNDERSCORES RIFT IN KUWAIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT _ In the galleries of Kuwait's Parliament late last
month, scores of women in bright orange T-shirts cheered every vote
in favor of a historic proposition that would have made this tiny
Persian Gulf country the first among its close neighbors to grant
full political rights to women.
</P>
<P>
   But in the next gallery over, an even larger group of men
wearing traditional dishdasha robes cheered even louder every time
a member of the all-male Parliament announced that he was voting
no.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry reflected the depth of a division that has left
Kuwait a split society, and the outcome of the ballot left little
doubt about which side retains the political upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat of the plan dealt a sharp rebuff to Kuwait's emir,
Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, who had cast his lot with modernists
last spring by issuing a decree that forced Parliament to address
the issue head-on.
</P>
<P>
   His plan would have allowed women to vote and run for office by
the next scheduled parliamentary elections, in 2003. But Parliament
unceremoniously rejected both the measure and a substitute,
embittering those who had hoped that Kuwait, still the only Persian
Gulf country with an elected Parliament, would set a broader
example of reform.
</P>
<P>
   Ali al-Baghli, a former oil minister who is a member of
Parliament, condemned what he called ``the fanatic mentality'' of
Islamist and tribalist members of Parliament whose views have held
sway. ``I wish to convey to my colleagues that all Western women do
not work in strip clubs and bars,'' Baghli wrote last week in a
sarcastic newspaper commentary, cast as a response to months of
dark warnings that allowing Kuwaiti women to enter politics would
invite their moral downfall.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat comes at a time of increasingly open tensions between
reformists and conservatives across the region on the issue of
women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   In Saudi Arabia, where women are still not permitted to drive,
Prince Walid bin Talal, the billionaire financier, was quoted last
week as calling for an end to that law _ even though such a change
was ruled out last May by his uncle, Prince Nayef bin Abdel Aziz,
the interior minister.
</P>
<P>
   And in the United Arab Emirates, Sheika Fatima, the wife of the
president, Sheik Zaid bin Sultan al-Nahayan, was quoted recently as
saying that women should be allowed to become Cabinet ministers.
That step has not been taken in any Persian Gulf country, and it
would be a particular departure in Emirates, which cultivates
deeply conservative traditions.
</P>
<P>
   In Kuwait, more than anywhere else in the region, some women
already play prominent roles in professional life, working side by
side with men as lawyers, diplomats and financiers. Many shun head
coverings, and some younger women dress in a provocative Western
style that would be seen as scandalous or even illegal in most
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   But among Kuwait's 350,000 or so women, a less-visible majority
still hews toward more traditional values, symbolized by the
covering of their hair, bodies and sometimes even faces in keeping
with conservative interpretations of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   While modernists like Baghli have been outspoken in bemoaning
the defeat of women's rights measures, other prominent Kuwaitis
defend the Nov. 30 vote as a true gauge of public sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would you have expected me to feel if a candidate called
to tell me, `I need to speak with your wife and daughter,''' said
Saadoun al-Otaibi, a lawmaker who voted against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   His comments reflected a deep aversion among many Kuwaitis to
allowing women to mix with men to whom they are not related, even
at campaign rallies or polling booths.
</P>
<P>
   The government, led by Sheik Saad al-Sabah, the crown prince and
prime minister, has vowed to introduce the measure again as early
as next year, and one prominent supporter, Muhammad al-Saqer, has
said he has no doubt that Kuwaiti women will be able to exercise
political rights in time for the 2003 elections.
</P>
<P>
   For now, as a kind of consolation prize, the government said
last week that it would extend limited ministerial duties for the
first time to a woman, Sheika Rasha al-Sabah, who is undersecretary
of education and a member of the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some of the same women who crowded into the
galleries wearing T-shirts that read ``Vote in 2003'' have vowed to
become more aggressive. Until now, the most radical protest by
Kuwaiti women took place in 1996, when about 500 stopped working
for an hour. But some women, including Kawthar al-Jowan, a
prominent member of a women's trade association, now say they are
considering ``different tactics'' in a bid to secure greater
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The defeated plan lost by just two votes, 32-30, with two
abstentions, but the closeness may have been misleading, and
Kuwait-based diplomats and analysts say they do not expect any
renewed drive for the measure to begin until late next year. Even
then, some say, it is no sure bet that the proposal will be
approved. Among Kuwait's 50 elected members of Parliament, they
note, only 15 voted in favor of the provision, while 32 voted
against.
</P>
<P>
   The contest was close only because of a provision built into
Kuwait's Constitution, which allowed a bloc of 15 government
ministers appointed by the royal family to join in voting in favor
of the emir's plan.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, many Kuwaitis have reacted with raised eyebrows
to a recent complaint by the State Department spokesman, James
Rubin, that the defeat of the women's rights measure represented a
``regrettable setback'' to democratic development.
</P>
<P>
   That analysis reflected ``a low opinion of Kuwaitis,'' said
Abdulhamid al-Bilali, a commentator for the Kuwaiti daily al-Qabas,
noting that it was the popularly elected members of Parliament
rather than the emir and his government who opposed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to smooth the way for passage of the measure, the
emir, who is 73, had first disbanded Kuwait's existing Parliament
and ordered new elections that were held in July. In those
contests, liberal candidates made strong gains, convincing most
observers of Kuwaiti politics that the government would win the
votes necessary to pass the women's rights measure.
</P>
<P>
   Those calculations underestimated the strength of traditionalist
sentiment in Kuwait and the depth of resentment among members of
Parliament who felt betrayed by the emir's tactics. Among those who
turned against the measure were many conservative tribalists who
usually support the government, while those who abstained in
protest at the government's tactics included Ahmed al-Saadoun, a
former speaker who had been seen as a supporter of women's rights.

TURKS SEE THEIR DESTINY IN CLOSER TIES WITH EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Turks woke up Saturday feeling a bit closer
to Europe. Few could say exactly what that meant, but nearly
everyone seemed to like it.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit flew to Helsinki, Finland, where
leaders of the 15-nation European Union were concluding a summit
meeting. There, at an afternoon ceremony, he saw Turkey declared
``a candidate state destined to join the union on the basis of the
same criteria as applied to the other candidate states.''
</P>
<P>
   That declaration vindicated a dream that has been on the minds
of growing numbers of Turks for nearly 200 years. It was as strong
a statement of Turkey's European vocation as any European power has
ever made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision carries great importance for Turkey,'' Ecevit
said before boarding his plane to Helsinki. ``It is now understood
that there can be no Europe without Turkey and no Turkey without
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am of the opinion that our preparations for full membership
will take place much faster than expected,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit flew to Helsinki, however, only after the European
Union's senior security official, Javier Solana, had traveled to
Ankara late on Friday to meet and reassure Turkish leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In its carefully worded invitation, the European Union reminded
Turkey that it admits only countries that ``share the values and
objectives of the union.'' It stressed that applicants are screened
``with particular reference to the issue of human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey will have to undertake sweeping political and economic
reforms if it hopes to have a realistic chance of joining Europe's
powerful trading bloc. Yet that prospect seems to have wide
political support, even within the ruling elite.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit considers himself a nationalist of the left, and Deputy
Prime Minister Devlet Bahceli heads a party that has for decades
embodied nationalism of the right. The fact that the coalition
government is now embracing Europe's offer reflects the breadth of
political consensus on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday the largest Turkish newspaper, Hurriyet, carried a
banner headline reading ``First Muslim Candidate!'' Its lead
article declared, ``Turkey, which has been trying for two centuries
to integrate with Western civilization, has taken a historic
step.''
</P>
<P>
   A Hurriyet columnist, Cuneyt Ulsever, predicted in a television
commentary that the pace of political reform would now start to
quicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must admit that this nation is unable to make reforms on
its own,'' Ulsever said. ``It always changes under external
pressure. Once we sign the candidacy document, we will have to be
open to every form of monitoring. In the years to come, Turkey will
be under a microscope. Much will be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers that serve observant Muslims and Kurdish
nationalists, two groups that have complained of government
repression, hailed the decision from Helsinki. They said Turkey
would have to begin tolerating forms of speech and expression that
are currently illegal.
</P>
<P>
   While some Turks hoped the Helsinki deal would lead to a
loosening of the political system, others worried about its impact
on foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   At the insistence of Greece, European Union leaders suggested
that they would impose two conditions on Turkey as it moves toward
membership. Turkey may have to submit its disputes with Greece to
the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, and
might someday have to stand by and watch the ethnic Greek regime on
Cyprus join the European Union, without the ethnically Turkish
north.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit brushed aside suggestions that these were harsh
conditions, but they provoked a flurry of protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkey is being asked to pay a heavy price,'' said Kamran
Inan, chairman of the foreign affairs committee in Parliament.
``This statement is brokered to serve the interests of Greece, not
Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Those views seemed in the minority, however, as Turks looked
forward to what could become a period of reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in Europe want this to succeed,'' said one
European ambassador. ``They want to show the Muslim world that a
country can prosper by being democratic and pro-Western. Their
dream is that people in a place like Libya will notice what's
happening and maybe start to think, `This is the way to go.'''

CHECHNYA: THE NO MAN'S LAND IN THE FIGHT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS

<P>
   Grozny means ``terrible'' in Russian, and the capital of
Chechnya is once again living up to its name.
</P>
<P>
   As the Russian army reduces the already ruined city to rubble,
warning 40,000 civilians to get out or be ``destroyed'' with the
Muslim fundamentalist terrorists who Moscow says are its real
targets, a feeling of outrage and impotence spreads in countries
that went to war against Yugoslavia over similar outrages in Kosovo
only a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   So the question arises: What is the world to make of the new
doctrine it thought was emerging _ a doctrine that seemed, after
Bosnia and Kosovo and East Timor, to be empowering the bulk of the
world to intervene in countries that abused their own citizens?
Large parts of the world, it seemed, were embracing the idea that
universal standards of human rights were putting at least some
limits on sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   But now comes the harshest test of that doctrine: Russia, a
humbled superpower desperate to hold together its very territory,
not to mention its national pride, in the face of international
condemnation of its methods. ``Human rights are no reason to
interfere in the internal affairs of a state,'' Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov protested last week, offering the same
argument that Russia and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic made
during last spring's NATO air war against the Serbian attempt at
``ethnic cleansing'' in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, of course, is that some countries are more
sovereign than others. Sheer power still counts.
</P>
<P>
   Partly out of respect for its power, the European countries and
the United States have made some allowances for Moscow's conduct of
the war, recognizing that what Russia is trying to do in Chechnya
is very different from what the Serbs tried to do in Kosovo. But
they still point out that the ham-fisted Russian tactics could cost
thousands of innocent lives. ``The continuation of it and the
amassing of hundreds of thousands of refugees,'' President Clinton
said Wednesday night, ``will further alienate the global community
from Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those mild remarks, hinting at the prospect of a freeze on
International Monetary Fund loans to Russia and mostly verbal
criticism by the European Union, provoked chilling ire from
President Boris Yeltsin as he was visiting China on Thursday.
``Clinton allowed himself to pressure Russia yesterday,'' he said.
``He must have forgotten for a moment what Russia is. It has a full
arsenal of nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin knew full well when he sent Russian troops into Chechnya
that international criticism of Russian actions there was likely to
be limited to finger-wagging.
</P>
<P>
   But does that mean the interventionist doctrine is being dealt a
mortal blow? Is there still room for Kosovo-like operations when
dictators _ or democrats, for that matter _ commit war crimes on
their own territory? In fact, human rights are likely to remain a
strong reason to interfere in the internal affairs of some states,
as two examples show: East Timor, where Australia led an
international peacekeeping force that went in after Indonesian
atrocities were committed against the people for voting in favor of
independence, and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia and Yugoslavia do not have nuclear weapons, a fact
that allowed stronger nations to reach a consensus and step in to
halt the outrages. Still, for every Kosovo or East Timor the world
eventually bestirs itself to save, there is some Rwanda that the
``international community'' stays out of, or a Somalia that it just
gives up on.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of inaction in Chechnya _ like critics of inaction in
Rwanda _ argue that there's a double standard, and so there is.
President Clinton offered an answer to that objection early in the
Kosovo operation last spring, when he laid out his sense of
America's obligation to intervene: when it can.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't respond to every tragedy in every corner of the
world, but just because we can't do everything for everyone doesn't
mean that, for the sake of consistency, we should do nothing for no
one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From a moral standpoint, of course, that rationale is more
questionable when the failure to intervene is in a place like
Africa. There, it is easy to imagine that the rich nations of the
West often stay aloof more for their own convenience or out of
prejudice than because they see no way to help. In Chechnya,
though, it is obvious that the risks really do preclude military
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite having stood by during an equally brutal, if
utterly unsuccessful, Russian campaign to subdue Chechnya five
years ago, countries in both hemispheres have shown a growing
willingness to use military means to force states to respect human
rights. And having now built a couple of precedents, one result is
that even mere words may carry more weight against abuses than they
did during the Cold War, when the option of military action was
immobilized virtually everywhere, so the words of outrage were
mostly empty.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, under international pressure, even Russia showed some
sensitivity, softening its ultimatum and assuring civilians in
Grozny that they would have time and transports to take them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will remember 1999 as the year in which sovereignty gave
way in places where crimes against humanity were being committed,''
said Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch,
the New York-based organization.
</P>
<P>
   With Russia (and China) having a veto in the Security Council,
consensus on outside intervention to protect civilians in Chechnya
is as unlikely as it would be in Tibet, but that does not mean
Western nations are hypocritical in refraining from an intervention
that could prove suicidal, so long as they urge Russia to stop and
think again.

   ``You know, most of life's greatest wounds _ for individuals and
for countries _ are self-inflicted,'' said Clinton. ``I don't think
the strategy will work.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if Yeltsin knows that the allies are not going to risk
military confrontation over Chechnya, the world seems to have come
a long way from the early 1990s, when the fragile pretense of
civilization began to fall apart in Bosnia and every outside power
remained impotent until 1995. Many people paid for that indecision
with their lives, and hundreds of thousands more did in Rwanda in
1994 when the United States and the world turned their eyes aside
from genocide.
</P>
<P>
   After it became clear that inaction in Rwanda had only allowed
the chaos there to engulf neighboring Congo, Clinton admitted that
it had been a colossal mistake for the United States to block a
U.N. mandate for a stronger international force. Now there is a
U.N. tribunal to assess criminal responsibility and try to ensure
that nothing like that bloodletting happens again.
</P>
<P>
   That does not, of course, mean every atrocity will now be
stopped. Realistically, it still seems likely that the major powers
will let internal politics and domestic constraints make their
interventions selective. Just last week, the chief U.S. delegate to
the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, was telling Africans that
while America wants to help with their problems, it remains
unwilling to send U.S. troops there.
</P>
<P>
   So increasingly, regional security organizations seem likely to
become the first defense against atrocities. Europe and the United
States have told African countries that it is up to them,
primarily, to organize international forces to intervene, as they
have in Sierra Leone and Liberia. And the European Union, wary of
having to rely on the United States again, is moving rapidly to
acquire the ability to raise and send peacekeeping forces on its
own. But as all of these examples show, it still takes too long for
the world to get its act together.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan may have done the best at
defining the uncertain progress in a speech last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we recall tragic events such as those of Bosnia or Rwanda
and ask, `Why did no one intervene?' the question should not be
addressed only to the United Nations, or even to its member
states,'' he said. ``Each of us as an individual has to take his or
her share of responsibility. No one can claim ignorance of what
happened. All of us should recall how we responded, and ask: `What
did I do? Could I have done more? Did I let my prejudice, my
indifference, or my fear overwhelm my reasoning? Above all, how
would I react next time?'''
</P>
<P>
   It takes time to rouse the world to anger, which sometimes comes
too late to do any good. So Annan's challenge applies perfectly
well in Chechnya _ not just to Americans or Western Europeans but,
above all, to the ordinary Russians in whose name Yeltsin's
government is issuing unacceptable ultimatums to innocent
civilians.

MUCH OF BOSNIA STILL A HAVEN FOR WAR CRIMINALS 
</HEADLINE>

 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As NATO peacekeeping troops enter their fifth year
on patrol in the former war zone of Bosnia-Herzegovina, dozens of
Bosnians accused of genocide, rape and other war crimes have not
only eluded capture, but are reported to live openly with little
fear of arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats, human rights advocates and Balkans
specialists say much of Bosnia has become a virtual safe haven for
war crimes suspects, especially southeastern Bosnia, which is under
the command of French peacekeeping troops and is a stronghold of
the Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the most notorious suspects are known to live in the
French zone, including the former Bosnian Serb civilian leader,
Radovan Karadzic, who has been indicted for genocide. In the
American zone in northern Bosnia, only three suspects have been
arrested since NATO troops arrived in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 63 people named in public indictments for their part in
the ethnic violence that convulsed Bosnia between 1992 and 1995,
only 14 have been captured by NATO peacekeepers. Another 21 have
surrendered or have been forcibly apprehended outside Bosnia and
turned over to the international war crimes tribunal in the Hague,
Netherlands. All but two of the dozens left on the loose, in the
midst of the large NATO peacekeeping force deployed in Bosnia since
December 1995, are ethnic Serbs; the two others are Croats.
</P>
<P>
   The French have not forcibly apprehended any war crimes suspects
on their own in the sector, where thousands of other European
soldiers are also stationed. Two suspects were captured in the
zone. But senior Western officials say the arrests were carried out
by German special forces.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. troops also have come under harsh criticism from human
rights groups and Balkans experts. The most important suspect they
have arrested was a Bosnian Serb commander caught last December a
few hours after he crossed into the American sector from the French
zone.
</P>
<P>
   The British record stands in sharp contrast. Since Prime
Minister Tony Blair came to power in 1997 with a pledge to track
down war criminals, the British military has aggressively pursued
suspects in western Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven suspects have been arrested in the British sector;
another was killed in a shootout with the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst of the worst war criminals are in the French
sector,'' said Nina Bang-Jensen, executive director of the
Coalition for International Justice, a Washington-based group that
tries to monitor the whereabouts of war crimes suspects. ``The
record speaks for itself. It's hard not to conclude that the French
have decided to protect these people.''
</P>
<P>
   The French government insists that it is eager to apprehend war
criminals, but that its attempts to capture suspects have been
hampered by the mountainous terrain of southeastern Bosnia, where
it is easier for suspects to hide.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Defense Minister Alain Richard of France
denied that France had created a safe haven. But he would not
discuss details of French involvement in the arrest of any
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the NATO force in Bosnia, U.S. Army Col. David
Raney, refuted suggestions that French or U.S. peacekeeping troops
turned a blind eye to war crimes suspects. ``Nothing could be
further from the truth,'' he said, adding that many suspects
captured so far were violent and well-armed.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Western officials and human rights groups say that
indicted war crimes suspects living in the American and British
sectors are generally in hiding, moving from house to house and
even village to village to avoid detection.
</P>
<P>
   The most notorious war crimes suspect known to have lived in the
American sector, Ratko Mladic, the wartime Bosnian Serb military
commander, is said to have left his top-security military facility
in eastern Bosnia and moved to Serbia more than a year ago because
of powerful connections in its capital, Belgrade, and the risk of
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In the French zone, diplomats say, there is evidence that
suspects living in the American and British sectors have recently
moved in, apparently believing they will be safe.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups allege that the French are failing to arrest
war criminals both because of longstanding French sympathy toward
the Serbs and because of fear of revenge attacks on French
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bang-Jensen said that while American soldiers may have
turned a blind eye to war crimes suspects, ``you didn't see them
fraternizing with these criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the peacekeeping operation, human rights monitors and
other witnesses found French troops drinking alongside war crimes
suspects in bars and walking alongside them in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, France acknowledged that it had transferred a French
army officer out of Bosnia because of what were described as
unauthorized secret meetings with Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb
president now under indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Another French officer is now facing trial on charges that he
spied for the government of Yugoslavia and provided it with
information on likely military targets in the NATO bombing campaign
over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the one incident in which French soldiers were reported ready
to arrest a war crimes suspect in their zone, they ended up killing
him in what U.S. and other Western officials view as alarming and
suspicious circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Dragan Gagovic, former police chief of the city of Foca, which
is in the French sector, was gunned down at a French military
roadblock while he was in his car with at least two and as many as
five children, none of whom was seriously injured, on their way
home from a judo exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials say that Gagovic, 38, had lived openly in Foca
despite his indictment.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has insisted that the French soldiers involved in the
operation were not to blame for the death and could not avoid
violence because it appeared Gagovic was going to mow them down
with his car.
</P>
<P>
   But Western diplomats say the death was mysterious given
widespread reports at the time that Gagovic was only weeks away
from surrendering to the war crimes tribunal _ a fact, they say,
that the French military should have known.
</P>
<P>
   Nikola Kostich, a Serbian-American lawyer from Milwaukee who has
represented several defendants before the tribunal, said in an
interview that he was contacted by Gagovic early last year and
asked for help in arranging his surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Gagovic, he said, had planned to turn himself in later in the
winter, shortly after his pregnant wife had given birth.
</P>
<P>
   He said the French military would have been aware of Gagovic's
plans since he freely discussed them over the telephone. Western
diplomats say the French intelligence services closely monitor
phone communications in their sector.

 WHAT IF McCAIN GAINS THE WORLD, BUT LOSES THE PARTY?

   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain is the rage in Republican
presidential politics, so much so that Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
the untouchable pace-setter for months who has been taking his
lumps of late, last week declared that McCain may be the
front-runner in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was clearly trying to dampen expectations for himself. But
it wasn't all spin: McCain did breeze ahead of the Texas governor
in polls in New Hampshire, which holds the first primary. He won
acclaim for besting Bush in two televised debates. He also made the
cover of Time magazine, which trumpeted ``his heroic life story and
passion for reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the deluge of hype about the rise of the senator from
Arizona overshadows a fundamental question and a challenge that
many Republicans say is all but insurmountable: Can a politician
win the Republican nomination by bashing the Republican Party?
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, some prominent Republicans say they could
imagine McCain winning a string of primaries _ and even snatching
his party's nomination _ although they considered that a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   But the odd reality is that McCain's appeal to the contrarian
voters of New Hampshire and to the press, which showers him with
flattering coverage, is that he is a brusque maverick (and war
hero) who dares to take on his party: He championed a campaign
finance measure that conservative groups say would kill them. He
supported a tax on tobacco that is anathema to Republicans. On
issue after issue, McCain has collided with leaders of his party.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for McCain is that in the history of the Republican
Party, far more so than in the Democratic Party, the presidential
nominee has rarely been an insurgent. It is almost always the
person with the most institutional support. Once the party settles
on a front-runner, whether Bob Dole or the elder George Bush, it
rallies behind him even if he stumbles _ or flubs a debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This party has a more settled sensibility,'' said former
Education Secretary William Bennett, who is advising both Bush and
McCain. ``It tends not to go out on a limb and take a chance and
turn things upside down in the middle. It's the daddy party; it
makes up its mind where it's going and goes there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett did not entirely reject a McCain upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics is changing,'' he said, ``we all know that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's predicament is not merely that he is lacking his
party's support; rather, he is actively disliked by everyone from
the Republican leadership in the Senate to the heads of influential
groups like the National Right to Life Committee, the Christian
Coalition and Americans for Tax Reform.
</P>
<P>
   These and other groups, complaining that McCain's campaign
finance plan could cripple them, traveled to New Hampshire in
September to hold a press conference denouncing McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's moniker is that he is bucking the trends of his own
party,'' said Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., who backs Bush. ``That's
great if you're running for the Senate from Arizona. I'm not sure
it's great running for the nomination of your party by running
against your party.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio said bluntly: ``There are
groups on our side of the aisle that view this guy as the outright
enemy. They would try to trip him up every chance they got.''
</P>
<P>
   The peril for McCain is that he has offended so many important
constituencies and power centers in his own party that the better
he does, the more likely it could trigger a backlash: his enemies
might try to stop him from capturing the nomination _ or, at least
rough him up in the process, causing disunity within the ranks
during the general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In another departure from the traditional method for winning the
nomination, McCain is concentrating on wooing independents and
Democrats instead of first building a foundation among
conservatives, who are critical in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating his challenge is the degree to which the
party establishment _ from governors to members of Congress to
state party leaders _ are invested in Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of politicians have staked their future on George
Bush's success,'' said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, who withdrew from
the race and endorsed Bush. ``This is where their next job comes
from. What are they going to do if he doesn't win?''
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain poses a formidable threat to Bush in New
Hampshire, his success in the state is magnified in part by the
media, which are always looking for a race.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is not so rosy, at least not yet. McCain is not
competing in the important Iowa caucuses. His only other
organizations are in South Carolina and his home state of Arizona.
By contrast, Bush has a national operation and, in the polls, is
beating McCain everywhere outside of New Hampshire. And while the
McCain boomlet has been a boon to his fund raising, Bush has still
amassed nearly five times more money.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's hope is that he will triumph in New Hampshire, and that
the win will somehow provide the momentum to prevail in the
compressed schedule of contests, from South Carolina to Arizona to
the critical California primary of March 7 _ and that Bush will
have little time to recover from early defeats.

   ``I wouldn't place a bet on it as a sure thing, that's for
sure,'' said Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, of the
prospects for winning the nomination. ``It's a tough deal. George
Bush has an overwhelming financial advantage. If we win early, the
clock works for us.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire Republican Party chairman Steve Duprey said he
believes that no matter what happens in his state, Bush has such
financial and institutional advantages that he will be virtually
unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard for the insurgent strategy to win,'' he said.
``Is McCain doing it as well as anyone can? Yes. But it's a very
uphill battle.''
</P>
<P>
   But for many Republicans, the bottom line is winning back the
White House. And if McCain sweeps the primaries, his foes just
might forgive him in the name of victory. Kieran Mahoney, a
Republican strategist who worked for former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
R-N.Y., pointed out that his boss was hardly the party favorite
when he was first elected in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in a New York political environment working for a
guy who the entire Republican establishment hated,'' he said. ``We
had virtually no structural support in the states whatsoever. But
what is going to matter is purely the votes of the electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   If McCain outlasts Bush and wins the nomination, the challenge
would be for Republicans to unite behind him in the general
election _ and work aggressively for his election. In 1972, Sen.
George McGovern managed to win the Democratic nomination _ and defy
the entire party establishment. (He, of course, lost overwhelmingly
to President Richard M. Nixon in November.)
</P>
<P>
   But many conservatives, like American Conservative Union
chairman David Keene, wince at the thought. Keene said the
hostility toward McCain was ``a shame'' because the senator is
quite conservative on many issues. ``The problem,'' he said, ``is
that if you disagree with him, it turns into a holy war.''
</P>
<P>
   If the McCain surge continues, Republicans should brace for
their most rancorous holy war yet.

RASH TALK BY WASCALS FROWNED ON IN CANADA

 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNIPEG, Manitoba _ Just inside the entrance of the city zoo
here, stands Winnie, a 3-foot-tall statue of this prairie city's
most famous namesake: an orphaned Canadian bear cub that found a
home in the London Zoo and 20th century immortality as Winnie the
Pooh.
</P>
<P>
   In silent witness to Winnie's enduring appeal, his bronze metal
paws here have been polished gold by the caresses of millions of
little visitors. ``Winnie,'' burbled Hayley Gusdal, age 4, as she
toddled, bundled against the cold, hands outstretched to the bear
statue.
</P>
<P>
   But carried on the political winds blowing out of Ottawa, the
argument could be made that since Winnie is a human name, the
plaque here should be changed to Ursus Americanus.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest battle between free expression and political
sensitivities, the Agriculture Museum, a federal farm museum that
draws 140,000 visitors yearly, had banned giving human names to
newborn cows, sheep, and horses. The policy was adopted in the
spring of 1998, after a woman visiting the site was mortified to
encounter a cow bearing her name.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadians erupted with a barrage of telephone calls and
letters that eventually forced the farm officials to backtrack, and
in October they repealed the policy.
</P>
<P>
   For many people here, however, the episode was a familiar story
of bureaucrats, in their reluctance to offend any constituency,
imposing practices that increasingly attempt to turn what could be
deemed incorrect speech into illegal speech.
</P>
<P>
   Only three months ago, Bugs Bunny escaped _ with slightly singed
fur _ from a year-long inquest into a formal complaint that the
wascally wabbit had violated Canadian television's Sex Role
Portrayal Code.
</P>
<P>
   What brought Global Television's ``Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show''
into the dock was a 1954 episode entitled ``Bewitched Bunny,'' in
which Bugs uses magic powder to transform a witch into a voluptuous
lady bunny. As they walk arm in arm into the sunset, he turns to
viewers and says with a wink: ``Ah, sure, I know! But aren't they
all witches inside?''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Hansel, a viewer from Ontario, wrote to the private
television network, saying she was ``horrified'' by the rabbit's
closing line and demanded a televised apology.
</P>
<P>
   After the network refused, she complained to the Canadian
Broadcast Standards Council, the industry's oversight group. After
a year-long investigation, the six-member panel wrote that it was
``sympathetic'' but that there was nothing in the cartoon that
``could be broadly interpreted as constituting `negative or
degrading comments on the role and nature of women.'''
</P>
<P>
   In another case, here in Winnipeg, the largest city in the
prairies, a local radio station, CFST, almost lost its license
after two talk show hosts made anti-gay remarks, drawing an
investigation from the Canadian Radio-Television Telecommunications
Commission. In a move that would leave many American talk show
hosts tongue-tied, the station kept its license by banning on air
``badgering, ridicule, or insult'' and remarks likely to offend ``a
considerable portion of the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   These kinds of decisions increasingly raise free speech
concerns. ``Politically, it is a very bad thing when silencing,
rather than debate, is the first tactic,'' Paul Fromm, a director
of the Canadian Association for Free Expression, a libertarian
group, said from Toronto. ``It creates a lot of rage and a
stultified body politic.''
</P>
<P>
   But such cases are piling up. In Saskatchewan, The Star Phoenix
is awaiting a ruling by a Human Rights Commission on a complaint
that the newspaper promoted hate by printing an ad that used Bible
quotations to condemn homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   In Alberta, Ted Byfield, a conservative magazine publisher, has
been charged with violating the Alberta Human Rights, Citizenship
and Multiculturalism Act for printing an article saying that while
abuses took place at Canada's Indian boarding schools, many Indians
were grateful for the education they received there.
</P>
<P>
   In Toronto, a now earnest city that once carried the nickname
``Hogtown,'' the District School Board has prepared a draft human
rights law that would effectively ban students from cracking jokes
about the city.
</P>
<P>
   And the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., the state-run network,
recently rejected an American-made commercial that showed a goofy
white man in a fake Indian headdress trying to teach elderly people
to perform a ``rain dance.'' A CBC spokeswoman said the ad made fun
of Indians and old people.
</P>
<P>
   The ad has aired in the United States, said Harold Mollin, the
chief executive officer of World Wide Weather Insurance Agency,
Inc. ``You would expect this sort of censorship from a Communist
country,'' he complained, ``not from a progressive democracy such
as Canada.''

the entire party establishment. (He, of course, lost overwhelmingly
to President Richard M. Nixon in November.)
</P>
<P>
   But many conservatives, like American Conservative Union
chairman David Keene, wince at the thought. Keene said the
hostility toward McCain was ``a shame'' because the senator is
quite conservative on many issues. ``The problem,'' he said, ``is
that if you disagree with him, it turns into a holy war.''
</P>
<P>
   If the McCain surge continues, Republicans should brace for
their most rancorous holy war yet.

<P>
   On the first day of Christmas my true love sent to me ... a cow?
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe it doesn't roll off the tongue like partridge in a
pear tree. But believe it or not, it's the kind of gift you can
send, thanks to what is surely one of the world's oddest holiday
catalogs, that of Heifer Project International (www.heifer.org).
</P>
<P>
   Since 1944, the nonprofit charity, based in Little Rock, Ark.,
has shipped livestock to poverty-stricken areas all over the world
(inspiring a memorable 1987 headline in this very newspaper:
``Doomed Cows Get Foreign Homes'').
</P>
<P>
   The Heifer Project's holiday gift program, begun about 10 years
ago, seems rather like those adopt-an-adorable-Third-World-urchin
ads you see in magazines:
</P>
<P>
   1) You decide to spring for, say, a $120 goat in honor of dear
Aunt Gertrude (actually, each nominal livestock ``purchase'' goes
to the charity's entire program).
</P>
<P>
   2) Aunt Gertie receives a handsome gift card, describing your
generous contribution in her honor: a lovely goat!
</P>
<P>
   3) Hard-up family A in country X gets goat and agrees to donate
the animal's first female offspring to destitute family B, which
agrees to do the same thing and so forth in a continuing process of
rural enrichment.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it: This is the gift that keeps on smelling
funky. Here's a sampling of what else is available from the
catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Gift of a Pig: $120
</P>
<P>
   Share of a Pig: $10
</P>
<P>
   Catalog copy: The holidays are right around the corner, and it's
time for more piglet gifts for your mother. Something about their
cute, squishy faces and their curlicue tails brings a smile to
Mom's face. Over the years, her holiday gifts have ranged from pig
T-shirts to pig doorstops to pig weather vanes _ and everything in
between. This year, how about the gift of a real live pig to put a
smile on Mom's face and brighten the future for a struggling
community?
</P>
<P>
   Gift of a Sheep: $120
</P>
<P>
   Share of a Sheep: $10
</P>
<P>
   Catalog copy: When you were just a wee thing, Aunt Dee Dee
taught you the basics of knitting. And the wool sweaters you
created together were nothing short of wonderful. This holiday
season, let her know what all of those knitting sessions by the
fire meant to you: give the gift of a sheep through Heifer Project
and share those moments of ``shear'' pleasure with a family in
need.
</P>
<P>
   Flock of chicks: $20
</P>
<P>
   Catalog copy: It's time to buy the kids' favorite teacher a
holiday present _ but you suspect that Mrs. Lynley doesn't need
another engraved Christmas tree ornament. How about the gift of a
flock of chicks in Mrs. Lynley's name to wish her happy holidays
and to thank her for giving your ``chickadees'' the gift of wisdom
throughout the school year?
</P>
<P>
   Gift of a Llama: $150
</P>
<P>
   Share of a Llama: $20
</P>
<P>
   Catalog copy: Uncle Gene has traveled the world. His incredible
stories and eccentric gifts were always the highlight of Christmas
morning festivities. Remember the camel saddle he brought you when
you were 9?
</P>
<P>
   Now it's your turn to provide your adventurous uncle with a
present he'll never forget: a rugged llama that will mean the world
to a family in need.
</P>
<P>
   Gift of a Water Buffalo: $250
</P>
<P>
   Share of a Water Buffalo: $25
</P>
<P>

</P>

pail to the shed. In the early morning chill, Parmatma carries out
a routine chore that is changing his family's life: He milks the
buffalo.

CLINTON'S TOP FUND-RAISER MADE PILES FOR HIMSELF, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Mo., Calif., Ohio)   (EDS: A short version of this story, MCAULIFFE-PROFILE-SHORT, will
also move.)  
(js) 
 By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On a sweltering June evening this year President
Clinton headlined yet another Democratic Party fund-raiser, but
this time the guest of honor was Terry McAuliffe, Clinton's closest
and most loyal Washington friend as well as his tireless money man.
</P>
<P>
   Shedding his prepared remarks, the president said, ``I love this
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to understand why. The ebullient McAuliffe says he
and his staff have raised about $275 million, an unprecedented sum,
for Clinton's causes: election campaigns, the 1997 inaugural
celebration, a legal defense trust, the millennium festivities, the
presidential library and Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry's more wired than your local electric plant,'' Mrs.
Clinton said at the fund-raising dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Many of McAuliffe's connections were at the dinner _
billionaires, labor union bosses, Democratic Party leaders and
lobbyists. These contacts are at the center of Clinton's political
organization, the fund-raising causes McAuliffe loves to talk
about.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe's political clout and profile have grown significantly
during the Clinton presidency. He is a frequent White House guest
and often hits the links with the president. Their close
relationship was once again highlighted in the summer, when
McAuliffe temporarily agreed to guarantee the Clintons' mortgage on
the New York house they were buying.
</P>
<P>
   His closeness to the first couple and the expanding network of
political contacts he has built in the Clinton years have also
enhanced an enterprise that McAuliffe has built more quietly: a web
of business deals, from telecommunications to real estate, that the
fund-raiser keeps far from the public spotlight. His business
confederation, a veritable McAuliffe Inc., has generated tens of
millions of dollars, but McAuliffe keeps his affairs so private
that he does not even have a business listing in the Washington
telephone directory.
</P>
<P>
   His quietly acquired private fortune is illustrative of changes
in the political culture here. Raising money for politicians was
once a ticket to an ambassador's post or other influential job in
the government. Other presidential money men have hung shingles as
lobbyists, openly trading on their access, or peddled influence as
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Charting a new course, McAuliffe has transformed the art of
raising money for public figures into the art of raising money for
himself, leveraging a personal fortune from his political
fund-raising contacts. Although he is a lawyer and once headed a
lobbying firm, he resigned from the firm in 1994 when he began
raising big money for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the past, famous fund-raisers like Lew Wasserman, the MCA
founder, and Walter L. Shorenstein, the San Francisco real estate
magnate, were successful multimillionaires before they became
Democratic kingpins. And former top government officials, like
executives with the well-known Carlyle Group, have done well after
leaving government, though ethics laws restrict some of their
activities.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the energetic McAuliffe has never held a full-time
government post and is not subject to federal ethics laws.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe lives in a Virginia suburb of Washington but calls a
Florida house-building company his main business. And though he is
chairman of the Florida company, he was unable to provide the
company's address in a deposition this year. The aide who handles
his frenetic schedule has been working out of his obscure title
insurance company in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Although the capital is the central nervous system of both his
fund-raising and business dealings, McAuliffe does not have his own
Washington office, so when he is in town he often conducts business
at restaurants like the Palm and the Oval Room. In lengthy
interviews at both restaurants he shed some light on his private
deal-making and its symbiotic relationship with his political
fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've met all of my business contacts through politics,'' he
said. ``It's all interrelated.'' When he meets a new business
contact, he went on, ``then I raise money from them.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether people deal with him because of his close
association with the president, he said, ``No question, that's a
piece of it.'' But he quickly added other reasons, including his
ties to Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the House minority leader, and
Tony Coelho, the director of Vice President Al Gore's presidential
campaign; his Rolodex of 5,000-plus names; and his ability to
personally relate to people. Dozens of associates agreed with
McAuliffe's explanation of his success.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton offered the following remarks, through an
aide, about his friendship with McAuliffe: ``Since Hillary and I
moved to Washington, the time we have spent with Terry and his
family has been wonderful. I wish we all had a fraction of Terry's
energy, his enthusiasm and his belief in the fundamental goodness
of people. It is safe to say that I do not have a more loyal friend
than Terry.''
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe says he uses his influence to get people together with
Clinton or to recommend them for presidential appointments, but he
never discusses substantive issues with the president or tries to
lobby him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stay away from issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His political contacts are myriad and beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   One, a union executive, helped arrange more than $50 million in
union pension fund loans to McAuliffe's real estate ventures. One
loan, for $6 million in 1992, helped McAuliffe clear up his
entanglements with a failed savings and loan, court records show.
This year the Labor Department sued the union executive, calling
the $6 million loan imprudent.
</P>
<P>
   Another McAuliffe contact, a wealthy Cincinnati businessman and
Republican, provided the backing for McAuliffe's 1995 acquisition
of the house-building company. The deal also helped rescue the 1992
pension fund loan, which was then in default, according to records
and people involved in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe's connections also led to his being retained in 1997
by Gary Winnick, a Los Angeles multibillionaire, who in turn
provided the opportunity for McAuliffe to turn a $100,000
investment into an almost $20 million windfall, McAuliffe said.
This year McAuliffe said he arranged a golf game for Winnick with
Clinton, during which Winnick pledged $1 million for the Clinton
presidential library, which is to be built in Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, McAuliffe was no golfing Friend of Bill, and
his finances were less secure. When Clinton, then the governor of
Arkansas, began his quest for the White House, railing against the
``Washington insider establishment,'' McAuliffe headed a Washington
lobbying firm, and he was best known for his ties to Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s McAuliffe was caught up in the collapse of
his father-in-law's savings and loan, and federal regulators were
close to shutting down McAuliffe's politically oriented Washington
bank.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe, 42, retains his boyish enthusiasm after 20 years of
raising money. Mack, as he is often called, was born and raised in
Syracuse, N.Y., the son of middle-class Democrats. He first raised
money for President Jimmy Carter's re-election campaign, masking
his youth by wearing fake glasses.
</P>
<P>
   By 1984, McAuliffe was being profiled in the news media as the
Wunderkind of fund-raising, but less noticed were his budding
business activities. When he was only 30, McAuliffe became chairman
of the Federal City National Bank, a small bank near the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   At the bank, according to public records, McAuliffe arranged
business-related loans that helped Coelho, then the House
Democratic whip, and Jim Wright, then the House speaker.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, McAuliffe raised record amounts of money for
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, headed by Coelho.
The two men broke ground by broadening the ties between the
business community, which had tilted Republican in its political
giving, and the Democratic Party. Coelho and McAuliffe continue to
do business deals and raise political money together.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe was finance director for Gephardt's 1988 presidential
campaign. The committee had millions of dollars in deposits and
loans with the Federal City bank.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1991 the bank was in trouble and was cited by federal
regulators for unsafe or unsound practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we were in terrible trouble,'' McAuliffe said, noting
that ``the liquidators were ready to roll.'' But McAuliffe said his
``greatest business experience'' was to ``rally the board members''
and save the institution through a merger with a bank headed by a
Republican, Richard V. Allen, President Ronald Reagan's former
national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe became vice chairman of the new bank, though some
shareholders later questioned whether McAuliffe was afforded
special treatment, according to papers filed in a lawsuit against
the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said McAuliffe's treatment was proper, given his ability
to bring in business.
</P>
<P>
   Allen and McAuliffe struck up an alliance as a Democratic
president took over in 1993. That year, at Allen's urging,
McAuliffe sought and received the (unpaid) job of U.S. ambassador
to a South Korean trade fair. McAuliffe made Allen's son his deputy
and raised $500,000 for the exposition from one of Allen's clients,
who faced legal troubles in South Korea. After the fair, Allen's
son went to work for McAuliffe's law and lobbying firm.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe's profile in Washington's political and business
circles was growing.
</P>
<P>
   Every night Alecia Dyer sends McAuliffe a long list of phone
messages. To call McAuliffe, people dial a Washington phone number.
Ms. Dyer answers the phone, but for the last two years she has been
based in the central Florida office of Jefferson National Title
Insurance, which is the Florida branch of McAuliffe Inc.
</P>
<P>
   It traces back to Richard R. Swann, an Orlando lawyer who was
overseeing fund-raising in Florida for Carter when he met McAuliffe
in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Much came of that first encounter. McAuliffe married Swann's
daughter. Then he became entangled in the collapse of Swann's
savings and loan. Finally, McAuliffe helped his father-in-law get
back on his feet using his political contacts.
</P>
<P>
   The two men have contrasting styles. Swann said he loves
complicated real estate deals, but ``Terry doesn't like reading
papers'' or ``to sit still.''
</P>
<P>
   Swann hit bottom in 1990 when federal regulators took over his
American Pioneer Savings Bank, based in Orlando. Swann petitioned
for bankruptcy. The court allowed an $8 million claim against Swann
by the government, but the regulators recovered only $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse also hit McAuliffe. He said he lost his $800,000
investment in American Pioneer. In 1991, court records show,
Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency that took over American
Pioneer's assets and liabilities, sued McAuliffe and a former unit
of the bank to foreclose on a real estate loan. Swann says
McAuliffe was named as a defendant to clear title to the land.
</P>
<P>
   There was also opportunity in the thrift's demise. In 1991,
McAuliffe, guided by Swann, bought some American Pioneer real
estate _ once valued by the thrift at $50 million _ from Resolution
Trust Corp. for $39 million, records show.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe's equal partner in the deal was a pension fund
controlled by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
and the National Electrical Contractors Association. McAuliffe put
up $100. The pension fund put up $39 million, but enjoyed a
preferred position on any profits.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe arranged the financing through Jack F. Moore, a
secretary of the union and a trustee of the fund. Moore and
McAuliffe knew each other from the Gephardt presidential campaign
in 1988, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, now retired, praised McAuliffe in an interview and
defended the pension fund's fiduciary care. But he declined to
discuss the fund's dealings with McAuliffe because he and another
former trustee have been sued by the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
   The civil suit, filed last May, accuses Moore of acting
imprudently when the fund bought back shares of McAuliffe's
interest in the partnership. (McAuliffe used some of those proceeds
to buy Jefferson National.)
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department also said that the fund had made an
imprudent $6 million loan in 1992 for a real estate development
company controlled by McAuliffe. The $6 million pension fund loan
was used by McAuliffe to clear up the Resolution Trust Corp.
lawsuit, but the new pension fund loan was soon in default, court
records show. Swann says the problem was a downturn in the Orlando
housing market.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The next step toward recovery _ the acquisition of a distressed
house-building company that was buying some of the troubled land
from McAuliffe's company _ was arranged in late 1995 with the help
of another of McAuliffe's fund-raising contacts.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the house-building company, American Heritage Homes, is
one of Florida's largest and most successful builders. McAuliffe is
its chairman. Most of the money to finance the purchase came from
American Financial Corp., a Cincinnati conglomerate that owns 60
percent of American Heritage, Swann said.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman and chief executive of American Financial is Carl
H. Lindner, a wealthy Republican who also gives money to Democrats.
McAuliffe became close to Lindner, who, along with his company,
gave $350,000 to the Democratic National Committee between 1993 and
1995. (They gave $437,000 to the the Republicans).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe remains close to Moore and Lindner. McAuliffe says the
pension fund came out all right, too _ an overall return of at
least 6.5 percent. But the Labor Department complaint says the
pension fund lost money on the $6 million loan. The case is
expected to go to trial next year.
</P>
<P>
   The trial will not be the first incidence of McAuliffe's name
surfacing in legal matters that mix politics and business.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 the Justice Department began examining Washington real
estate deals involving McAuliffe, court records show. The inquiry
ended in 1997when Prudential Insurance Co. of America paid
$317,500 to settle a civil suit in which it had been accused of
failing to disclose a $375,000 consulting arrangement in 1993 with
McAuliffe in connection with Prudential's lease of office space to
a federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   This year, McAuliffe's role in a questionable plan to swap
contributions in 1996 between the Teamsters union and the
Democratic Party surfaced during the federal trial in New York of
the former political director of the union, who was convicted of
fraud and conspiracy. McAuliffe, in an interview, acknowledged
discussing a potential swap.
</P>
<P>
   ``You help me, I'll help you,'' he said. ``That's politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But he denied doing anything wrong, saying he had not known that
the plan _ which was never implemented _ was meant to aid the 1996
re-election campaign of Ron Carey, the former Teamsters president.

   The inquiry also involved handsome fees McAuliffe earned in 1996
for lobbying union leaders to choose Household Financial Group's
credit card for their members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took the Household guys around, I know most of the union
presidents,'' McAuliffe said.

<P>
   McAuliffe has been a peripheral figure in the inquiries into
Democratic Party campaign finance abuses in the 1996 campaign
because he was the national finance chairman of the Clinton-Gore
re-election committee. But a contentious feature of Democratic
Party practices _ the use of the Lincoln Bedroom as a perk for
donors _ grew out of a memorandum McAuliffe wrote to Clinton's
secretary in early 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The story behind the memorandum explains the roots of the
Clinton-McAuliffe friendship. In late 1994, Clinton was in the
doldrums after the Democratic defeat in the November congressional
elections. Harold Ickes, his politically astute deputy chief of
staff, was trying to persuade the president to put McAuliffe in
charge of his re-election finances.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ickes said Clinton did not know McAuliffe ``that well,'' and
there was ``high-level resistance'' in the White House to McAuliffe
because of his ties to Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I leaned on the president and the president said do what's
best, so I went ahead,'' Ickes said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Ickes was used to maneuvering around opposition when it came to
fund-raising. According to Ickes, senior White House aides had also
opposed McAuliffe's soliciting money from Lindner while the White
House was weighing whether to intervene on his behalf in an
international trade dispute over banana quotas. Ickes says he let
McAuliffe raise the money. McAuliffe said he was not aware of the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In late 1994 McAuliffe and Clinton had breakfast. McAuliffe said
the president asked what he could do to help and McAuliffe replied
that he should be more accessible to donors. A few days later
McAuliffe sent his memorandum asking Clinton's secretary to arrange
breakfast, lunch or coffee for top supporters so they could
``discuss issues and exchange ideas with the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wrote on the back of the memorandum _ words McAuliffe
said he never saw _ that he was ``ready to start overnight visits
right away.''
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton's re-election, his friendship with McAuliffe
continued to deepen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like the president,'' McAuliffe said. ``We like everybody
to like us and we like to like everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, McAuliffe also deepened his private business
activities, operating out of an office in downtown Washington that
belonged to Winnick's Pacific Capital a billion-dollar operation
based in Beverly Hills. Winnick retained McAuliffe as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe, who forged a relationship with Winnick through a
business associate active in Democratic politics, explained the
arrangement this way: ``Gary likes the action. He wanted a stable
of people around him with great contacts'' to ``help him work on
deals.''
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe said the contacts were not political, but he also said
that he was hired in part because ``Winnick was looking for a
little political action.''
</P>
<P>
   After one year with Pacific Capital, McAuliffe had produced no
deals and Winnick ended his retainer. By early 1998 McAuliffe was
consumed with helping Clinton defend himself in the Monica Lewinsky
matter, playing golf most Mondays with Clinton and talking
frequently with reporters to help defend his embattled friend.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997, before the break-up, Winnick had offered McAuliffe
an opportunity to invest in a new Internet-related venture that
would own and operate undersea fiber-optic cables. The venture, now
known as Global Crossing Holdings, had potential risks and rewards.
It also faced myriad regulatory issues in Washington and around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   For McAuliffe and all the other early investors, Global Crossing
turned out to be a bonanza. McAuliffe says his initial $100,000
investment grew to be worth about $18 million, and he made millions
more trading Global's stock and options after it went public last
year. And recently, McAuliffe said he took a telecommunications
deal to Winnick that Global Crossing will put money into.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe says he is a dealmaker and a matchmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to have 25 balls in the air at the same time,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of them: He sits on 10 corporate boards, none of
them public companies. He travels to Africa and Asia, where he
meets with heads of state. He's trying to buy six companies, in
areas like telecommunications. He is an active stock trader. He
speaks and plays golf regularly with his best friend, Clinton. And
his schedule includes family time: McAuliffe and his wife, Dorothy,
have four children.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some of his friends say McAuliffe Inc. is too invisible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've complained to him about his lack of infrastructure _ how
can we get you a fax,'' said Ed Rogers, a Republican lobbyist who
was one of McAuliffe's sources of information during the
impeachment of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe defers to his lawyers and bankers when it comes to
documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've signed thousands of documents, but never read them, '' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's retirement poses a strategic question for McAuliffe:
what happens to his unique mix of politics and business once
Clinton steps down as the titular head of the Democratic Party?
Another Washington confidant of the president, the lawyer Vernon
Jordan, has already made his decision. He is joining a New York
investment bank. However, McAuliffe is likely to remain active in
politics and fund-raising and is already busily raising money for
Mrs. Clinton's Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McAuliffe Inc. may be entering a more visible phase.
Ms. Dyer is moving back to Washington, where she plans to work with
McAuliffe in a downtown office.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe is involved in plans to open a high-powered Washington
restaurant called the Caucus Room. The other investors include such
top Republican and Democratic lobbyists as Rogers, Thomas Boggs and
Haley Barbour, the former chairman of the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a business person,'' Rogers said. ``His ideology derives
from that.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ With a week to go before Russia elects its next
Parliament and rushes headlong toward next summer's presidential
election, the national political debate can be summed up in two
words: mud and war.
</P>
<P>
   If Russians turn on their television sets, they can watch scenes
from the battlefields of Chechnya, where the Russian military has
flattened much of the landscape in pursuit of separatist
guerrillas; or they can be treated to a steady barrage of televised
insults and slugfests, as Russia's warring political camps do their
best to discredit one another with accusations ranging from
ordinary theft to treason and murder.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the way things looked three months ago when Yevgeny
Primakov, the former prime minister and seasoned diplomat, stepped
back into national politics, joining a loosely organized electoral
alliance with the soothing name of Fatherland-All Russia. Back
then, Primakov, now 70, looked ready to ride above Russia's
churlish politics and emerge _ if he decides to run _ as the
leading contender in the race to succeed President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Observers explained Primakov's high popularity ratings as a sign
of the nation's need for a ``father figure'' and its yearning for
social stability. But the war in Chechnya has changed all that,
shifting the focus to long-held hopes for a ``strong hand,'' a
leader who can restore order at home and Russia's greatness abroad.
</P>
<P>
   It is the war and the feelings it has unleashed that have led to
a sudden surge in popularity for Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, a
dour 46-year-old former KGB officer, who was a political unknown
when he was chosen by Yeltsin in August to head his latest
government and run next summer as his preferred successor.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Putin now top the opinion polls, but he has also
sprouted coattails, which have pulled up the ratings for another
new political bloc, known as Unity and nicknamed Bear, which was
concocted by Kremlin strategists as a rival to Primakov's bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Primakov, his political fortunes slipping, is having to
wade, albeit gingerly, into the nasty political battles that have
clouded Russia's political choices as the nation moves inexorably
into the post-Yeltsin era.
</P>
<P>
   Known in the West as the hard-line negotiator from the old
Soviet school, Primakov, a Middle East expert who once ran Russia's
foreign intelligence service, is no shrinking violet. But on a
recent campaign stop in the southern Russian city of Voronezh, he
did not demonstrate the kind of killer instinct that Russian
politics now seem to require.
</P>
<P>
   Answering questions from a mostly elderly audience, Primakov
started with a gentlemanly attack on his arch foe, the financier
Boris Berezovsky, who is the force behind a notorious Sunday night
television program that has for the past month mercilessly attacked
and ridiculed Primakov and his top ally, the mayor of Moscow, Yuri
Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I relate to Berezovsky?'' asked Primakov. ``Badly, and
I have chosen the kindest word.'' He went on to quote an interview
in which Berezovsky said he would leave Russia if Primakov is
elected president. ``I'll agree to that,'' said the former
diplomat, to loud applause.
</P>
<P>
   At another stop at a local retirement home, Primakov paid homage
to Russia's senior citizens. ``I say this as one who is not so
young himself, and maybe will be joining you not so long from
now,'' said the candidate, smiling at his own self-deprecating
joke.
</P>
<P>
   According to recent polls, the Kremlin-orchestrated campaign
against Primakov and his allies has already cost his alliance the
lead in the parliamentary elections _ in which one half of the
chamber's seats will be filled from party lists. Instead, the
Communist Party has moved back into first place, and according to
some polls, Unity has overtaken Fatherland-All Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian politics are a fickle business, as the last year has
shown. In January, Luzhkov looked like the man to beat in the
preliminary jostling for the Kremlin. Then it was Primakov, and now
the lead is Putin's to lose, which he easily could if the military
campaign in Chechnya bogs down, and too many Russian soldiers are
killed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a transitional period like this one, much depends on power _
who has it, and who is likely to claim it. Since the days of the
czars and commissars, Russian officials have slavishly tuned into
the fortunes of their leaders, ever ready to jump ship before it
goes down.
</P>
<P>
   But at this stage, Putin, the Kremlin's first choice, is the man
most heavily courted by politicians of all stripes; his conduct of
the war is being praised on the right by free-market liberals like
Anatoly Chubais, and on the left by leaders of the Communist Party.
Putin is a man of few words, but some of them _ like his coarse
threat to track down the Chechen rebels into their ``outhouses'' _
have been well chosen to correspond to the toughening national
mood.
</P>
<P>
   But many voters also now prefer him to Primakov because, they
say, of his relative youth, his energy and his decisive actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin is a personality whose thinking is more modern, more
lively,'' Irina Veniaminova, a 36-year-old entrepreneur who runs
her own company making and repairing leather clothes, said during
Primakov's campaign stop in Voronezh. ``I read an astrologer
recently who said that in two or three years, Russia will have a
young, energetic leader. That is what I hope for.''
</P>
<P>
   But like many people of her generation, Mrs. Veniaminova is so
disgusted by Russian politics that she says she plans to stay away
from the polls on Dec. 19. The people who are more likely to vote
are the older generation, who make up a significant part of the
electorate in Russia's ``red belt'' _ a region in central and
southern Russia that has traditionally voted for the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   On his tour in Voronezh, Primakov, who included Communists in
his short-lived government last year, made a point of emphasizing
his sympathy for the Communist Party's mainstream leaders. His
program, as he outlined it, also straddles the fence between left
and right, calling for selective renationalization in cases where
private ownership does not correspond to national interests.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers say that Primakov has been shaken by the attacks
against him in the media, particularly on ORT, a top channel
controlled by Berezovsky, who is closely associated with members of
Yeltsin's family and inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov has received the brunt of the attacks, including
allegations that he was behind the killing in Moscow three years
ago of an American businessman, Paul Tatum. But Primakov has also
been targeted _ taunted because of his age and even attacked for
his diplomacy, which was recently portrayed as having sold out
Russia's interests to the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting something,'' said Andrei Kokoshin, a former
Kremlin security adviser who has joined Fatherland-All Russia as a
military affairs adviser. ``But it is hard to avoid being surprised
by the ferocity. At first, our people were in shock, but now they
are furious, and consolidating their forces.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Fatherland-All Russia is still likely to win a
sizable number of seats in the Parliament, maybe as much as 20
percent, or at least enough to play a role in efforts to change the
Russian constitution, which are expected in the months leading up
to next summer's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   But mainly, the parliamentary results will determine the shape
of the presidential election, the first round of which will be held
in June. Since August, Primakov has stated repeatedly that he will
decide to run only after the Parliament is chosen. But his
diplomatic diffidence, which has never been far below the surface,
seems more pronounced these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is against it,'' he told voters in Voronezh. ``My
wife is against it, my grandchildren are against it. I still have
not made up my mind.''

<P>
   Do any Americans with a television not know that they have ``the
right to remain silent,'' ``the right to a lawyer,'' and that
anything they say may be used against them in a court of law?
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to television and its Kojaks and Andy Sipowiczs, these
phrases from the Supreme Court's landmark 1966 Miranda decision are
surely among the best-known phrases in the language.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda was a controversial decision, one that law enforcement
officials, in particular, railed against. They argued that no
criminal in his right mind would talk after being advised that he
didn't have to. A few months after the decision, the legendary
Manhattan district attorney, Frank Hogan, told the U.S. Senate
Judiciary Committee that the Miranda ruling was a ``fundamentally
unsound edict'' that ``significantly inhibits the making of a
statement by a suspect to a police officer.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a surprising number of instances, suspects sing, despite
clear warnings about the pitfalls of self-incriminating comments.
``If you take a look at the Miranda warning and say it slow and
clear to a person with half a brain, you would think why would they
say anything after that,'' said Bob Connelly, a retired New York
City homicide detective who supports Miranda. ``But they do it all
the time. A lot of them just want to take it off their chest.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the warning became standard operating procedure in police
departments, many of the detectives whom Miranda opponents said
were hamstrung by the ruling made their peace with it. It became
ingrained in their routine, drummed into them as academy cadets and
reinforced throughout their careers. ``Our members have accepted
Miranda,'' said James Fotis, executive director of the Law
Enforcement Alliance of America, which represents 65,000 active and
retired officers.
</P>
<P>
   Even detectives express support for Miranda. ``If a friend of
mine was to be arrested for something, I would want him to know his
rights. There's a need for it,'' said Detective Sgt. Michael
Bettin, a narcotics investigator with the Essex County, N.J.,
Sheriff's Department. George Lytwyn, a retired Newark, N.J., police
detective, added: ``It's like when you get up in the morning and
brush your teeth _ it's automatic.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, investigators often get creative delivering the
warning, angling to minimize the possibility that a suspect will
ask for a lawyer and remain silent. ``Some of them get cute about
it, the way they phrase it, the way they time it, the way they try
to maneuver around it,'' said Susan Hendricks, deputy attorney in
charge of the criminal division for the Legal Aid Society in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Hernandez, a retired Newark, N.J., police detective, said
investigators will try to ingratiate themselves, bringing a suspect
coffee or a sandwich, making idle chitchat to make a suspect feel
comfortable _ all with an eye toward drawing out a confession.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling's critics, however, continue to regard Miranda as a
loophole that sets criminals free. Paul Cassell, a University of
Utah law professor who has crusaded against Miranda for years and
will argue for Section 3501 before the Supreme Court, said Miranda
creates a ``mine field'' that allows ``indisputably guilty
criminals'' to go free.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Uviller, a Columbia University law professor who wrote a
book about the year he spent with New York police officers, said
Miranda ``deters confessions or prevents the use of evidence in
some important cases.''
</P>
<P>
   This view has now received its most significant judicial
validation in 33 years. The activist 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, in Richmond, Va., ruled last February, in a case involving
a confession from an accused bank robber, that an obscure 1968 law
permits the admission of confessions in federal court as long as
they were ``voluntary,'' in light of the circumstances and
regardless of any particular warnings.
</P>
<P>
   The law, known as Section 3501 of the Omnibus Crime Control Act,
has been ignored since its passage. But in February, the 4th
Circuit Court ruled that Section 3501 could substitute for the
Miranda rules in federal court because, in the court's opinion, the
rules themselves were not required by the Constitution. That has
opened the way for the U.S. Supreme Court to decide whether Section
3501 could limit or even overturn Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of overturning Miranda are not certain. For one
thing, Miranda warnings are not required in most arrests, which are
racked up by patrol officers on their beats. ``Most arrests are
made when people are caught red-handed,'' said James Fyfe, a Temple
University criminologist and former New York City Police
lieutenant. ``In almost all those cases, the evidence is so strong
that it's not necessary to talk to a suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Miranda comes into play only when the officer _ almost always a
highly experienced detective, more often than not working homicides
_ has arrested a suspect and plans to interrogate. And when the
process moves forward, investigators and criminologists say, good
detectives facing guilty suspects often obtain a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Uviller believes that Section 3501 would be a sensible
alternative. Nonetheless, while detectives don't see Miranda as
flawless, many say it has resulted in better investigations and
stronger cases. They say many of those who remain silent after
being read their rights are often convicted with other evidence,
especially the sort of advanced forensic evidence, such as DNA
analysis, that was undreamed of back in 1966. And then there is the
sense that Miranda is simply fair play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It put the police department on the line, outlined that it had
rules to obey,'' said Detective Peter Killen, who joined the New
York City police four years before the Miranda ruling and now works
in the 68th Precinct in Brooklyn. ``And when it came to the
suspects, well, the suspects were given rights.''

has been ignored since its passage. But in February, the 4th
Circuit Court ruled that Section 3501 could substitute for the
Miranda rules in federal court because, in the court's opinion, the
rules themselves were not required by the Constitution. That has
opened the way for the U.S. Supreme Court to decide whether Section
3501 could limit or even overturn Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of overturning Miranda are not certain. For one
thing, Miranda warnings are not required in most arrests, which are
racked up by patrol officers on their beats. ``Most arrests are
made when people are caught red-handed,'' said James Fyfe, a Temple
University criminologist and former New York City Police
lieutenant. ``In almost all those cases, the evidence is so strong
that it's not necessary to talk to a suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Miranda comes into play only when the officer _ almost always a
highly experienced detective, more often than not working homicides
_ has arrested a suspect and plans to interrogate. And when the
process moves forward, investigators and criminologists say, good
detectives facing guilty suspects often obtain a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Uviller believes that Section 3501 would be a sensible
alternative. Nonetheless, while detectives don't see Miranda as
flawless, many say it has resulted in better investigations and
stronger cases. They say many of those who remain silent after
being read their rights are often convicted with other evidence,
especially the sort of advanced forensic evidence, such as DNA
analysis, that was undreamed of back in 1966. And then there is the
sense that Miranda is simply fair play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It put the police department on the line, outlined that it had
rules to obey,'' said Detective Peter Killen, who joined the New
York City police four years before the Miranda ruling and now works
in the 68th Precinct in Brooklyn. ``And when it came to the
suspects, well, the suspects were given rights.''

   If there is a patron saint of nagging mothers, it is surely
William Henry Harrison, the ninth president of the United States.
Standing in the cold rain on March 4, 1841, too proud to wear a
hat, delivering a 105-minute speech that is still one of the
longest inaugural addresses ever, he caught a cold and died of
pneumonia a month later (becoming the first president to die in
office and thus keeping his campaign promise never to run again).
</P>
<P>
   Such cautionary tales may impress parents and grandparents, but
of course they have no impact on children, who are too busy
escaping without their hats and boots to listen anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But, wait. This is the age of science: Aren't we supposed to
know that colds and flu are caused by viruses? The germ theory may
appeal to the intellect, but don't we know in our hearts that no
good can come from a bare head, wet feet or wearing a coat that, as
our mothers might have said, you could spit through?
</P>
<P>
   How about time-honored scourges like sudden warm spells during
the winter, failing to change out of wet clothes or going back and
forth between sweltering heat and frigid air conditioning?
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not aware of any of those things in particular
predisposing to common colds,'' said Dr. Kristin Nichol, a cold and
flu expert who is chief of medicine at the Veterans Affairs Medical
Center in Minneapolis, and a professor at the University of
Minnesota, a place where they are supposed to know how to dress for
winter. ``I don't think things like stepping in puddles or letting
your head get cold have been linked to catching a cold.''
</P>
<P>
   But isn't it stressful to get very chilled, and mightn't that
lower one's resistance? Maybe just worrying about getting cold and
wet could derange a person's immune system.
</P>
<P>
   A woman of science, Dr. Nichol was dubious. ``But I do think
that if one becomes physically exhausted or overextended or
rundown, one may become more susceptible,'' she finally allowed.
Aha!
</P>
<P>
   For people who really want to avoid colds and flu, Dr. Nichol
had this advice: ``Get a flu shot. Wash your hands a lot. One of
the common modes of transmission is to get virus-infected particles
on your hands from touching a surface or shaking someone's hand.
Then if you touch your nose or eyes, you may become ill.''
</P>
<P>
   If you do get sick, Dr. Nichol added, ``Try to avoid coughing on
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it was still true that a cold will last seven days if
treated and a week if left alone, she laughed politely.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, it seems as if doctors used to have a lot more remedies.
The Merck Manual of 1899 lists plenty of nostrums for ``acute nasal
catarrh,'' including gargling with a carbolic acid solution,
inhaling ammonia or chloroform, adding a bit of arsenic to your
cigarettes or taking hot foot baths before retiring. And if all
else failed, there was always tincture of jaborandi.

   ARMYCORPS-LAUSD (Los Angeles) -- The Army Corps of Engineers --
designated to run Los Angeles Unified's billion-dollar school
construction program _ has suffered failures and missteps on dozens
of occasions in recent years, according to interviews and documents
reviewed by the Daily News. Although experienced in massive
building projects and heralded for its emergency work after natural
disasters, the corps' snafus range from missed deadlines to
million-dollar cost overruns to blatant stealing by engineers. Like
the tales of the corps' good deeds, the horror stories come from
all over the country, as far away as blue-collar New Jersey, as
close to home as Hansen Dam in Lake View Terrace. By Greg Gittrich

   CALDERA-ARMY (Los Angeles) -- Army Secretary Louis Caldera

   CHILDCARE-NIGHTMARE (Los Angeles) _ Fabiola Ayala used to think
it was a joke _ parents so desperate for good quality daycare that
they placed their unborn children on waiting lists that seemed to
stretch into eternity. Now the 31-year-old Burbank mother is living
the nightmare. For the past eight months, Ayala's 2-year-old son,
Dylan, has been on the waiting list for Burbank's Horace Mann Child
Care Center _ and he's still not at the top of the list. Los
Angeles' supercharged economy is a boon for most, unless you are a
parent who has gone back to work and now is on a waiting list for
childcare you can't afford regardless. A new state study found that
there are six children of working parents for every licensed
child-care spot in the state _ and the problem is most acute in Los
Angeles County. By Sherry Joe Crosby (Will move on the ``n''
California and ``a'' national news wires.)

   F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote 75 years ago about trying to economize
in his magazine article, ``How to Live on Practically Nothing a
Year.'' A $100-a-month governess offered to work for $40 a month
``and do the baby's washing.'' Patricia Duff, the most recent
ex-wife of the billionaire Ronald Perelman, may be looking for such
a governess. Justice Franklin Weissberg of New York state Supreme
Court rejected her request for as much as $132,000 a month in child
support, ordering Perelman to pay $12,825 a month for the couple's
4-year-old daughter, Caleigh.
</P>
<P>
   In his 22-page decision, the judge, who takes a brown-bag lunch
to court every day and who showed signs of impatience with Ms. Duff
during hearings in September, dismissed Ms. Duff's demands for more
money with words like ``absurd'' and ``rubbish.''
</P>
<P>
   He also seemed intent on seeing that state child-support
guidelines were not used to redistribute wealth. Perelman's income
ranges from $40 million to $60 million yearly, the judge said,
while Ms. Duff's is about $2.4 million yearly. Her lawyers argued
that having a mere millionaire for a mother would hurt Caleigh
psychologically. ``There is not a shred of evidence in the record
to support these conclusions,'' the judge said. ``There are far
more important things in the life of a young child than private
jets, yachts, obsequious staffs and pandering guests. The reality
is that Caleigh will never suffer a shortage of material
comforts.''

   While decorating a Christmas tree or lighting the candles of the
Hanukkah menorah are joyous activities in most households, many
interfaith couples find December holidays a source of angst.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, couples, especially Christians and Jews, would
forgo one holiday or display all the symbols together. But as the
rate of religious intermarriage increases in America _ today some
50 percent of Jews marry outside their faith, up sharply from
previous decades _ many families have developed an alternative:
religious syncretism, or the blending of two different, dissimilar
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The marketplace has responded by producing dual-faith
decorations: tree ornaments painted with menorahs or Kwanzaa
lights; angels with wings, halos and dreidel-print dresses; and
Christmas lights that have Stars of David.

   The devout deplore such melding. ``It is a terrible sign of
intellectual and religious confusion,'' says Elliott Abrams, who
wrote ``Faith or Fear: How Jews Can Survive in a Christian America

   Testifying in front of Congress in 1996, representatives of
Swiss banks said they knew exactly how many dormant Nazi-era
accounts were still on their books: 775. As the controversy over

ARMY SECRETARY SAYS HE DIDN`T INFLUENCE DECISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Greg Gittrich  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Army Secretary Louis Caldera denies playing any
role in the decision by top Los Angeles Unified School District
administrators to put the Army Corps of Engineers in charge of
overseeing the district's massive school construction project,
including the controversial Belmont Learning Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Daily News reported last week that Caldera was a
strong supporter of the Belmont project when he represented the
area in the state Legislature and previously worked for O'Melveny &AMP;
Myers, the law firm being sued for malpractice by the LAUSD over
its handling of Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera, who has repeatedly declined to be interviewed on the
connections, released a statement through a federal spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consistent with routine U.S. Army Corps of Engineers practice,
the partnership agreement was entered into by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers locally without my knowledge or involvement,'' the
statement read.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not been involved in any way with school construction
in Los Angeles since I left the Legislature in September 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   Caldera's role was questioned because the Corps of Engineers
reports to him and he has close ties to Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1992 and 1997, Caldera wrote several letters to state
and school officials praising the district's innovative plan to
combine a 5,000-student high school with a shopping mall and a
low-income housing development.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Caldera urged the school board to approve it,
specifically praising the legal techniques used by O'Melveny &AMP;
Myers that allowed the district to buy the Belmont property and
select a developer without competitive building.
</P>
<P>
   Those same legal decisions were questioned in a September audit
of the project by the Los Angeles Unified's internal auditor and
are the subject of a malpractice lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   O'Melveny &AMP; Myers has denied that the school district's decision
to recruit the Army was connected in any way to the firm's intense
and ongoing lobbying effort to save Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   LAUSD Chief Operating Officer Howard Miller said he has had no
contact with Caldera or members of his Washington, D.C., staff, and
was unaware of the potential conflict of interest until being
informed by the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   The idea to bring in the Army's services came from Rep. Howard
L. Berman and board member Caprice Young, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Young's top aide told the Los Angeles Daily News she mentioned
the idea to Miller about two weeks ago after Berman suggested it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been following the newspaper stories about the
absolutely astonishing and perhaps scandalous mess in the school
construction program at Los Angeles Unified,'' Berman, D-Mission
Hills, said in an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the Army Corps knows how to build things quickly and
well using private contractors. They can supervise it well and get
it done according to specifications without corruption. I thought
they'd do a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman said he brought in the corps to build Hansen Dam and has
the agency ``checking out a gymnasium at a veteran hospital'' in
his district.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caldera's past never occurred to me,'' he said, adding he
never spoke to the secretary about the idea and doesn't plan to.
</P>
<P>
   As for Belmont, Berman said, he doesn't know ``who would be
better. The Army corps deals with big projects and big messes all
the time.''

   Acting on recommendations from the Institute of Medicine,
President Clinton ordered federal agencies to find ways to reduce

each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insuring patient safety is not about fixing blame,'' Clinton

and an environment where medical errors are not tolerated.''

ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION TO FOCUS SOLELY ON POOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By REED ABELSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In response to the emergence of more powerful
foundations and its own sense that it might have been spreading
itself too thin, the Rockefeller Foundation is changing its mission
to focus exclusively on the world's poor. The foundation, which is
based in New York, gives away about $170 million a year to hundreds
of causes. The foundation expects to announce its plans Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Globalization has the capacity to eliminate poverty, eliminate
hunger and greatly reduce disease and provide excellent education
to everyone,'' said Gordon Conway, a British agricultural ecologist
who joined the foundation last year as its 12th president. ``But it
will only do that if it is steered in that direction. If you are
going to steer globalization, you need a new response from
foundations.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Conway's direction, Rockefeller now plans to take a
globally integrated approach to helping those who have been left
behind as the rest of the world enjoys tremendous prosperity and
huge advances in technology and science. The foundation, which
already spends roughly 70 percent of its money overseas, will no
longer distinguish between its international and domestic
initiatives but will try to develop broad strategies to address the
specific challenges facing the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller's giving will also be much more focused, Conway
said. The foundation used to give in nine areas, ranging from
school reform to the global environment, which may continue in some
fashion or be phased out. Financing for programs involving arms
control and domestic energy will end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foundation had built up a whole range of programs that are
disconnected to each other,'' Conway said. Because those programs
were not related, there was little synergy. ``You were not getting
something that was greater than the sum of the parts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach is also designed to address the widening
disparity between the haves and the have-nots. ``We are in a new
age right now,'' Conway said, as much of the world is becoming
increasingly integrated in finance, trade, culture and technology.
``The rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer, at
least in relative terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Aimed at the poor, giving will now be focused on four major
areas: culture and creativity, employment, food and health care.
</P>
<P>
   This new focus is by no means a radical departure from the work
the foundation has been doing since it was created by John D.
Rockefeller in 1913 ``to promote the well-being of mankind
throughout the world.'' The emphasis is clearly a continuation of
many of the foundation's existing programs and is ``in the absolute
core of the mission,'' said Peggy Dulany, the daughter of David
Rockefeller and a member of the foundation's board until earlier
this year. ``We are very pleased with the shifts in emphasis,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the change does represent an attempt by the foundation, one
of the nation's oldest, to maintain a critical role in philanthropy
at a time when it is no longer one of the largest foundations in
the country. With roughly $3 billion in its endowment, Rockefeller
is dwarfed in size by newer foundations like those of David and
Lucile Packard or Bill and Melinda Gates, which have three to six
times as much money. As these foundations take an increasingly
important role in the world of philanthropy, Rockefeller is
struggling to have a major impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a limited amount of money for what we want to do,''
said Linda Hill, a professor at Harvard Business School and a
member of the Rockefeller board.
</P>
<P>
   What Conway hopes to do is continue to capitalize on
Rockefeller's reputation and its ability to bring together people
from government, business, other foundations and charities to
tackle issues by serving ``as a broker and facilitator,'' he said.
He described the foundation's work as ``more akin to small-scale
business practice: brokering, deal-making, spotting opportunities
early and risk-taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller can also afford to continue to take a longer
perspective than other groups, Conway said. ``In most situations,
we're going for the long haul,'' 10 to 15 years, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to take on this daunting task of making globalization
work for everyone,'' he said. ``It means focusing, partnership and
looking for root causes and exploiting our convening power.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Rockefeller began its search for a new president two years
ago, the institution has been undergoing an extensive review,
including various sessions and retreats for staff members and
outsiders. ``We've had retreat after retreat,'' Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Conway's major challenges will be to have the foundation
develop a coherent strategy for attacking problems in a global
fashion while making sure it works closely with communities to
understand what they need. As a scientist, he learned, early on,
the necessity of gathering information from farmers about their
needs. Already, he is moving people from New York out to the field,
opening offices in Africa, for example.

CARE PROVIDERS AT A PREMIUM IN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Sherry Joe Crosby  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Fabiola Ayala used to think it was a joke _
parents so desperate for good day care that they placed their
unborn offspring on waiting lists that seemed to stretch into
eternity.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Burbank, Calif., mother is living the nightmare. Ayala's
2-year-old son, Dylan, has been on the waiting list for Burbank's
Horace Mann Child Care Center since March _ and he still hasn't
cracked the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I waited too long,'' said Ayala who has since placed her son
in a family child-care home that lacks the educational component
the center offers.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala isn't alone in her struggle to find top-notch day care for
her little one.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study released last week, licensed child care is
in severely short supply throughout California. The shortage is
especially acute in Los Angeles, where supply meets only 17 percent
of the estimated demand for licensed care for children of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   Child care experts attribute the shortage to California's
booming economy and recent welfare reform legislation that has
pushed thousands of parents off the public rolls and into the job
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a greater demand for child care now than there has
been in decades,'' said Laura Escobedo, associate director of
community relations for the Child Care Resource Center in Van Nuys,
a Los Angeles suburb resource and referral agency that provides a
soup-to-nuts array of services for parents and child-care
providers.
</P>
<P>
   Especially hard to find is infant care, school-age care and care
during evening and weekend hours, according to the study. And
quality care isn't cheap.
</P>
<P>
   At Children's Wonderland in Woodland Hills, where parents of
infants and toddlers face a six-month waiting list, the rate for
full-time infant care tops $795 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the demand of the market and we have a such a long
waiting list,'' said Deanna Weigold, chief operating officer of
Children's Wonderland, whose Warner Center facility in suburban Los
Angeles serves about 150 children between 6 weeks and 6 years of
age.
</P>
<P>
   Child-care providers said infant care tends to cost the most
because required child-to-teacher ratios are low, 1 to 4 in
California, and staff members need extra training.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's higher maintenance altogether,'' Weigold said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Northridge Hospital Children's Center in suburban Los
Angeles, the waiting list for infants and toddlers stretches into
summer 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are shocked when they call,'' said Tammy Reich,
director of child-care services at the center, which serves about
60 children each day between the ages of 6 weeks and 5 years. She
urged parents to start searching for day care as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want good quality, you have to start early, unless you
have a special grandma or someone you know who will have an
opening,'' Reich said.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Ng, a suburban Los Angeles pediatrician whose daughter
is enrolled in the program, said she had to wait five months, which
forced her to extend her maternity leave a month longer than
planned, before an opening popped up.
</P>
<P>
   She said the center was well worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so fortunate,'' said Ng, who was attracted to the
center's age-appropriate learning activities and a sign-language
program that starts with infants. ``I have the peace of mind
knowing that my child is in a safe and loving environment.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Ng and her physician husband spend about $6,000 a year
on child-care costs _ less than 10 percent of their yearly income _
she bemoaned the fact that many families are unable to afford the
high-quality care that her daughter enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the difficult and frustrating thing,'' Ng said.
``Everyone wants the best for their child, but it's becoming this
higher-end thing for people who make money. It's not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Day-care providers sympathized with parents' woes over high
prices but said the cost of providing care, especially for
high-maintenance infants, outstrips any revenue they receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is really living high off the hog on child care,'' said
Reich of Northridge Hospital's Children's Center.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, day-care providers said they are forced to offer their
workers low pay and inadequate benefits to compete with other
providers and make care relatively affordable for parents.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles County, the average child-care worker makes about
$16,140 a year. For preschool teachers, the figures rises to
$20,090 and for entry-level public school teachers, the yearly pay
averages $23,835.
</P>
<P>
   Child care often is a ``stopping ground for something bigger and
better,'' Reich said. ``You get people who are really terrific and
who want to be in the field but can't because of the hardship of
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Reich said she recently signed paperwork qualifying three of her
workers for federally-subsidized housing.
</P>
<P>
   However, Reich said she has managed to staunch high turnover
among her employees by offering full medical and dental benefits, a
401(k) retirement investment plan and other perks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to do things to keep employees,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Roland Armstorff, a Burbank writer and production coordinator in
the film industry, said high prices are complicated by substandard
care.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Cherie, pulled their then-infant daughter out
of one family day-care home after discovering the baby alone on a
couch. The provider was in a bathroom, combing her hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just left,'' said Armstorff, who found better care in
Horace Mann, which is operated by the Burbank Unified School
District and accepts infants as young as three months old.
</P>
<P>
   ``We immediately fell in love with the place,'' said Armstorff,
whose 3-year-old son is now enrolled in the center's preschool
program. ``All the teachers are credentialed and the aides, for the
most part, are working on getting their credentials.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala, the Burbank woman who hopes to enroll her son in Horace
Mann, said she is pleased with the provider who looks after him
now, but she yearns for the academic-rich surroundings of a
day-care center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great place, but I'd rather have him in a learning
environment,'' Ayala said.
</P>
<P>
   And after eight months of waiting, the safety and health
consultant for a workers' compensation insurance firm has no plans
to pull her son off the list just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to stay on that list,'' Ayala said. ``It's close.
It's a great school. And he's up to No. 11 (on the list) _ up from
No. 50.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was released by the California Child Care Resource and
Referral Network, a group of 61 state-funded agencies in all 58
counties that provide child-care referrals and information to
parents as well as training to providers, among other services.

   MIAMI _ It is a large predicament for such a small boy.
</P>
<P>
   For 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, who survived for two days adrift
on an inner tube in the Atlantic Ocean, after a failed crossing
from Cuba drowned his mother and 10 others in late November, the
ordeal may be just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   His father in Cuba, and more important, Fidel Castro, want him
home. Relatives in Miami, and many in the politically powerful
exile community here, say he already is home, wrapped in the arms
of the Cuban-Americans who live in Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, which had once seemed content to let
Florida courts decide the case, now seems willing to consider
sending the boy home, this after a week of large demonstrations
outside the U.S. diplomatic mission in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Those demonstrations, coupled with threats from Castro that more
are to come, caused U.S. officials ``to tremble,'' bragged the
boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who has refused to come to the
United States to try and reclaim his son in what he called a
corrupt state court.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, lawyers representing the boy filed a petition for
political asylum in the United States, which could extend his stay
with relatives here for at least 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not turn this into a political thing,'' said his
21-year-old cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, who has become the boy's
closest friend in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But with Elian's face on a billboard in Havana and on T-shirts
in Miami; with marchers chanting his name on either side of the
Florida Straits; and with the Republican presidential hopeful John
McCain taking up his cause during a campaign stop here Friday, that
is an impossible dream.

NEW LAUSD CONTRACTOR HAS SPOTTED RECORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Greg Gittrich  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Army Corps of Engineers _ designated to run Los Angeles
Unified's billion-dollar school construction program _ has suffered
failures and missteps on dozens of occasions in recent years,
according to interviews and documents reviewed by the Los Angeles
Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Although experienced and largely successful in massive building
projects and heralded for its emergency work after natural
disasters, the corps' snafus include missed deadlines,
million-dollar cost overruns and at least one case of blatant
stealing by an engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Like the tales of the corps' good deeds, the horror stories come
from all over the country, as far away as New Jersey, as close as
Hansen Dam.
</P>
<P>
   When L.A. Unified's Chief Operating Officer Howard Miller rolled
out his agreement with the Army last week and later endorsed the
corps to handle a crucial final review of the troubled Belmont
Learning Center, he described the agency as ``unimpeachable.''
</P>
<P>
   He praised the federal engineers for having the ``highest
integrity'' _ a crucial endorsement in the face of growing concern
about corruption and favoritism in LAUSD contracting.
</P>
<P>
   But questions about the corps' performance abound.
</P>
<P>
   The corps' problems also include allegations that its employees
deflated contractor bids in North Carolina, that its officials
sidestepped public processes in Florida when managing a wetland,
and that it wasted millions of taxpayer dollars in Idaho in a
failed attempt to save salmon in the Columbia River.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, the corps exceeded the original budget for restoring
Hansen Dam Recreation Area by $5million, despite creating a lake a
fraction of the size originally approved. The money problems tied
up the project for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion of the Army Corps being a part of saving Belmont is
a bit baffling to me,'' said state Assemblyman Tony Cardenas,
D-Panorama City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked them to put in a couple of swimming pools at the
recreation area and it turned out to be amazingly costly and time
consuming. They are a huge bureaucracy. I wonder how they could be
any solution.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Tom Hayden, chairman of the Senate Natural Resources
and Wildlife Committee, questioned how the Army could be held
accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school district is trying to say they want an agency above
politics. But this agency is generally above democracy,'' said
Hayden, D-Los Angeles, who wants to abandon Belmont because of
costly and potentially dangerous environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you oppose the corps, they act as if they are under attack
from an enemy. There is no way to influence them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fear is that this is pushing forward a construction program
that won't be deterred by the little things, like the environment,
public health, public participation, public input and public
comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns are shared by Barbara Mastrangelo and many of her
neighbors in Paterson, N.J. where the corps' $40 million
flood-control project was supposed to eliminate flooding yet scores
of residents suffered property losses last September after a
tropical storm. The corps was months behind on the flood-control
project but blamed the damage on clogged catch basins and run-off
from a nearby river, resident said.
</P>
<P>
   In July, a corps field manager, John Seldler, pleaded guilty to
charges of soliciting a $25,000 bribe from a contractor competing
for a $250,000 contract in Puerto Rico to provide hurricane relief.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators charged the case was tied to similar problems in
Miami and have started probing bribery schemes by corps employees
in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles office of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has
about 750 employees, mostly civilians, with training and expertise
in architecture, engineering, planning, real estate, research and
environmental regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Fred-Otto Egeler, the chief spokesman for the L.A. office, would
not respond directly to Hayden's criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are environmentally friendly by an act of Congress,''
Egeler said. ``We have environmentalists here who look at each and
every project that we are involved in.''
</P>
<P>
   Egeler said the corps has more than 32,000 employees worldwide
and would not comment on problems elsewhere, noting there was only
one incident where an employee was arrested for misappropriation in
the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Saying this would be the corps' first try at school construction
locally, Egeler noted such projects are not new to the agency,
which builds and maintains many military schools overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will be able to turn a lot of people's opinions
about the corps around. We're doing things to make people's lives
in Los Angeles better.''
</P>
<P>
   The corps also has overseen public school construction and
renovations in Washington D.C. for nearly two years, according to
U.S. Army Col. John Carroll, who signed the school construction
agreement with Los Angeles Unified.
</P>
<P>
   Through special congressional legislation, the corps now manages
the school district's $619million, six-year capital improvement
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of work on our plates and it seems to be a
pretty good partnership,'' said David Morrow, program manager for
the project. ``We're looking at roughly $100 million a year at 147
active schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The corps also repaired public schools in south Florida after
Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and in Puerto Rico following Hurricane
Georges last year.
</P>
<P>
   Egeler and other corps officers would not comment on Belmont,
which sits partially completed in downtown Los Angeles atop an oil
field seeping potentially explosive and deadly gases.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and incoming Superintendent Ramon C. Cortines plan to use
the corps at the complex and several school board members have
indicated support, but no agreement has been signed with the
district or approved by the board.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has proposed paying the corps $200,000 for six weeks work
at Belmont, and $1.2 million for other construction management
services through March 31.
</P>
<P>
   The cost estimates for Belmont are the district's figures since
no deal has been struck,Egeler said.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's school board meeting, Miller and Cortines intend to
recommend that the Army evaluate Belmont and help guide the
district toward a final decision on the fate of the complex.
</P>
<P>
   If their plan is approved, the corps would be asked to determine
how much it would cost to complete the school and whether state
funding would be available.
</P>
<P>
   The corps also would be asked to determine how long it would
take to finish and to seek alternative sites for campuses in the
downtown attendance area.
</P>
<P>
   The board shut down construction at Belmont last month and fired
the developer two weeks ago. It was expected to decide whether to
scrap the project or go forward last week, but delayed the vote to
wait for Miller and Cortines to resolve questions about its safety
and cost.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said a 60-day evaluation of the project by a citizens
commission appointed by the board in August failed to resolve the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The commission voted by a narrow margin to advise the board to
complete Belmont, but submitted a final report raising many
questions about the district's ability to build and operate a
campus safely atop the oil field.
</P>
<P>
   The four commissioners who endorsed moving forward did not
respond to requests for comment. Those opposed criticized the
proposed involvement of the Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of the Army Corps of Engineers in the construction of
the new schools sounds like a good idea. I don't see any downside
to it,'' said former District Attorney Ira Reiner, the commission's
executive director and legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of Belmont, it doesn't change that equation at all.
The task is not to `save' Belmont. ... If the school board tries to
make right a project that everyone agrees was monumental mistake
from the beginning, they will be consumed for the better part of 10
years with making this one project right and not with building the
other 150 desperately needed schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Craig Perkins, director of Environmental and Public
Works Management in Santa Monica, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army Corps of Engineers is very good within their area of
core competency,'' Perkins said. ``Building high schools is not in
their area of core competency.''

BIG TOBACCO'S NEW BILLBOARDS: GLOSSY MAGAZINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Page through The Art of Simple Living, a new magazine published
by a division of Hearst Magazines, and notice that it looks like
most feel-good women's magazines. There is a profile of the pop
singer Sarah McLachlan, an article about growing an indoor herb
garden and step-by-step instructions for brewing tea.
</P>
<P>
   But the careful reader will notice a difference between Simple
Living and, say, Mirabella. Half of the advertising is for
cigarettes: Carlton, Misty Lights, Kool and Capri. And then there
is the tiny paragraph below the table of contents that notes the
corporation, apart from Hearst Magazines, behind this women's
magazine: Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp.
</P>
<P>
   As tobacco companies face increasingly severe restrictions on
how they advertise, they have found other ways to tout their
products, and now they are drawing the major publishers of consumer
magazines into their marketing fold.
</P>
<P>
   Three tobacco giants _ Brown &AMP; Williamson, Philip Morris and
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco _ have recently joined with Time Inc., Hearst
Magazines, Hachette Filipacchi Magazines and EMAP Petersen to
produce five magazines. In this arrangement, known as custom
publishing, consumer publishers print magazines for corporate
clients, which then distribute them free to customers or at nominal
rates to subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Magazine publishers, which limit tobacco advertising in their
consumer magazines, are more than happy to join the ventures as
they ride the boom of custom publishing, a guaranteed profit-maker
that has generated $650 million for the magazine industry so far
this year, according to David Wilkofsky, the chairman of Wilkofsky
Gruen Associates, a consulting firm that studies the magazine
industry.
</P>
<P>
   And custom publishing is expected to generate close to $1
billion in 2000, according to a spokesman for the Custom Publishing
Council, a division of the Magazine Publishers of America.
</P>
<P>
   In most instances, the magazine content is produced by a staff
specifically hired to create custom-published titles. In one case,
Time Inc. has used the staff of the interior-design magazine
Wallpaper _ to produce CML: The Camel Quarterly for R.J. Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   For consumer-magazine publishers, who are paid by the tobacco
companies to create the magazines and are not subjected to the
vagaries of newsstand sales and disappointing subscription levels,
the arrangement is without financial risk.
</P>
<P>
   Brown &AMP; Williamson publishes three magazines. Two are with
Hearst _ Flair and Simple Living _ and the other with EMAP
Petersen, titled Real Edge. Philip Morris publishes Unlimited, an
outdoor sport and adventure magazine, with Hachette Filipacchi. All
were started in the last year, except for Unlimited, which appeared
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The magazines have a total circulation of about 5 million and
are sent free, for now, to consumers whose names are taken from
tobacco company databases. Reynolds and Brown &AMP; Williamson are
considering charging for subscription eventually.
</P>
<P>
   The magazines, which are sent either monthly or quarterly, are
in some cases indistinguishable from their consumer counterparts.
Real Edge reads like Maxim, a raunchy magazine for young men. There
is even a section called ``Stuff,'' the name of the section in
Maxim that features electronic gadgetry and that inspired Maxim's
sister publication, Stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Flair, produced by Brown &AMP; Williamson and Hearst and aimed at
young women, features articles that a reader might find in
Mademoiselle, with titles like ``What `I Love You' Really Means''
and ``How to Have a Cocktail Party.'' Unlimited looks like Outside
or Men's Journal. CML, the only magazine that clearly identifies
itself as a tobacco-sponsored publication, looks like Wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also the magazine that most clearly portrays smoking
as a glamorous activity in its articles. Flair, Simple Living and
Real Edge make a point of never mentioning smoking and depend on
the ample tobacco advertising to get the message across.
</P>
<P>
   Unlimited never mentions cigarettes in the text, but they are
visible in photo displays. Its writers are given a list of
guidelines governing what they can write about, with the intention
of maintaining the appeal to teen-agers: No mention is to be made
of smoking, cancer, illness of any kind, or any activity that
people they are writing about engaged in when they were under the
age of 21.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, by publishing custom magazines the tobacco companies
are using subtle forms of advertising to reach customers. The
tobacco companies clearly find this form of marketing necessary. As
a result of a settlement with 46 states in November 1998, major
tobacco companies were forced to withdraw all advertising from
outdoor billboards. They can no longer sponsor sporting events with
significant youth audiences _ including baseball, basketball,
football, hockey and soccer. With very few exceptions, they can no
longer sponsor concerts.
</P>
<P>
   There is virtually no more of what is known as ``out-of-home''
advertising _ any advertising like a billboard or a banner at a
sporting event that would reach an unwilling, or underage, consumer
outside the home. And the Food and Drug Administration is arguing
before the Supreme Court to be allowed to prohibit the use of color
or images in tobacco advertising in large-circulation magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry has produced magazines before, but the
current crop is clearly different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, they were overt magazines about tobacco, with titles
like `Philip Morris magazine,''' said Dr. Elizabeth Whelan, the
president of the American Council on Science and Health, who has
studied tobacco advertising in magazines for two decades. ``Now
they have created their own set of magazines with their own sets of
rules. They will always find a way of advertising no matter what
the ban.''
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies have been preparing for the day of
curtailed magazine advertising. In an internal memo dated July 8,
1998, R.J. Reynolds laid out its plans for a hip magazine, since
introduced as CML. It listed, as an objective, ``To prepare for a
regulated environment by filling a communication gap among 21- to
34-year-old adult smokers when key pubs may no longer contain
tobacco advertising in color.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo emphasized that ``the Camel presence will be under the
radar, although not invisible.'' The proposed magazine, the memo
said, should not ``come across as a big promotional vehicle which
21- to 34-year-old consumers will resent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regulations or not, this idea works. The magazine is a
targeted vehicle that can be placed into a single consumer's hands.
It's an experience that can last longer than exposure to an ad and
the momentum can be sustained from issue to issue. It's a
relationship-builder.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That relationship is what the the tobacco companies are seeking.
In their own magazines, they get to advertise their products as
much as they want. Most American consumer magazines keep tobacco
advertising to about 3 percent of total advertising, according to
Mary McGeachy, a spokeswoman for the Publishers Information Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Hachette Filipacchi _ which publishes 28 magazines, including
Elle, Mirabella and George _ allotted about 2.5 percent of its
advertising pages for tobacco advertising last year, said a
spokesman for Hachette. About 3.5 percent of the advertising in
Time Inc. magazines is tobacco-related, said a Time Inc. spokesman,
and the figure for Hearst this year is 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   John Heironimus, the vice president for premium niche brands at
Brown &AMP; Williamson, said the company was producing its three
magazines to present consumers with more tobacco advertising in the
context of what looks like a standard consumer magazine. The Brown
&AMP; Williamson magazines do offer other advertising, not related to
the company, making the magazine appear like regular consumer
publications.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the value of the custom publications, Heironimus of
Brown &AMP; Williamson said: ``We are still allowed to advertise in
almost any magazine. The problem with them is that they are
inefficient because at least three-quarters of the readership don't
smoke. By producing our own magazines, we are eliminating a huge
inefficiency right off the bat. The second efficiency is that we
can put any number of our brands in our own magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown &AMP; Williamson's Simple Living and Flair ask readers to fill
out two-page surveys that ask about household income and preferred
cigarette brand, and a two-page ad in Simple Living asks readers to
send in a photocopy of their driver's license in exchange for free
Brown &AMP; Williamson gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ron Davis, the former director of the Office on Smoking and
Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the
director of the Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention
in Detroit, said that as cigarette advertising becomes more
limited, the industry will always look for novel channels through
which to spend its marketing dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the image of the cigarette companies and the industry as a
whole continues to plummet, they will find more under-the-table
methods to promote their views _ subliminal advertising, to borrow
from 1960s jargon,'' he said.

   When asked if there was any discomfort for a company like Time

are always and will always be 20 years ahead of us. I think that is
significant for people who think we are winning the war against the
tobacco companies, because to imagine that we are is just naive.''

CLINTON'S TOP FUND-RAISER MADE PILES FOR HIMSELF, TOO

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On a sweltering June evening this year President
Clinton headlined yet another Democratic Party fund-raiser, but
this time the guest of honor was Terry McAuliffe, Clinton's closest
and most loyal Washington friend as well as his tireless money man.
</P>
<P>
   Shedding his prepared remarks, the president said, ``I love this
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to understand why. The ebullient McAuliffe says he
and his staff have raised about $275 million, an unprecedented sum,
for Clinton's causes: election campaigns, the 1997 inaugural
celebration, a legal defense trust, the millennium festivities, the
presidential library and Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Many of McAuliffe's connections were at the dinner _
billionaires, labor union bosses, Democratic Party leaders and
lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence was a symbol of how McAuliffe's political clout
and profile have grown during the Clinton presidency. His close
relationship with the president was highlighted in the summer, when
McAuliffe temporarily agreed to guarantee the Clintons' mortgage on
the New York house they were buying.
</P>
<P>
   His closeness to the first couple and the expanding network of
political contacts he has built in the Clinton years have also
enhanced an enterprise that McAuliffe has built more quietly: a web
of business deals, from telecommunications to real estate, that the
fund-raiser keeps far from the public spotlight. His business
confederation, a veritable McAuliffe Inc., has generated tens of
millions of dollars, but McAuliffe keeps his affairs so private
that he does not even have a business listing in the Washington
telephone directory.
</P>
<P>
   His quietly acquired private fortune is illustrative of changes
in the political culture here. Raising money for politicians was
once a ticket to an ambassador's post or other influential job in
the government. Other presidential money men have hung shingles as
lobbyists, openly trading on their access, or peddled influence as
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Charting a new course, McAuliffe has transformed the art of
raising money for public figures into the art of raising money for
himself, leveraging a personal fortune from his political
fund-raising contacts. Although he is a lawyer and once headed a
lobbying firm, he resigned from the firm in 1994 when he began
raising big money for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe lives in a Virginia suburb of Washington but calls a
Florida house-building company his main business. But although the
capital is the central nervous system of both his fund-raising and
business dealings, McAuliffe does not have his own Washington
office, so when he is in town he often conducts business at
restaurants like the Palm and the Oval Room. In lengthy interviews
at both restaurants he shed some light on his private deal-making
and its symbiotic relationship with his political fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've met all of my business contacts through politics,'' he
said. ``It's all interrelated.'' When he meets a new business
contact, he went on, ``then I raise money from them.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether people deal with him because of his close
association with the president, he said, ``No question, that's a
piece of it.'' But he quickly added other reasons, including his
ties to Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., the House minority leader,
and Tony Coelho, the director of Vice President Al Gore's
presidential campaign; his Rolodex of 5,000-plus names; and his
ability to personally relate to people. Dozens of associates agreed
with McAuliffe's explanation of his success.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton offered the following remarks, through an
aide, about his friendship with McAuliffe: ``Since Hillary and I
moved to Washington, the time we have spent with Terry and his
family has been wonderful. I wish we all had a fraction of Terry's
energy, his enthusiasm and his belief in the fundamental goodness
of people. It is safe to say that I do not have a more loyal friend
than Terry.''
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe says he uses his influence to get people together with
Clinton or to recommend them for presidential appointments, but he
never discusses substantive issues with the president or tries to
lobby him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stay away from issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His political contacts are myriad and beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   One, a union executive, helped arrange more than $50 million in
union pension fund loans to McAuliffe's real estate ventures. One
loan, for $6 million in 1992, helped McAuliffe clear up his
entanglements with a failed savings and loan, court records show.
This year the Labor Department sued the union executive, calling
the $6 million loan imprudent.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe's connections also led to his being retained in 1997
by Gary Winnick, a Los Angeles multibillionaire, who in turn
provided the opportunity for McAuliffe to turn a $100,000
investment into an almost $20 million windfall, McAuliffe said.
This year McAuliffe said he arranged a golf game for Winnick with
Clinton, during which Winnick pledged $1 million for the Clinton
presidential library, which is to be built in Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, McAuliffe was no golfing Friend of Bill, and
his finances were less secure. When Clinton, then the governor of
Arkansas, began his quest for the White House, McAuliffe headed a
Washington lobbying firm.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe, 42, retains his boyish enthusiasm after 20 years of
raising money. He was born and reared in Syracuse, the son of
middle-class Democrats, and first raised money for President Jimmy
Carter's re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, McAuliffe raised record amounts of money for
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, headed by Coelho.
The two men broke ground by broadening the ties between the
business community, which had tilted Republican in its political
giving, and the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe says he is a dealmaker and a matchmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to have 25 balls in the air at the same time,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of them: He sits on 10 corporate boards, none of
them public companies. He travels to Africa and Asia, where he
meets with heads of state. He's trying to buy six companies, in
areas like telecommunications. He is an active stock trader. He
speaks and plays golf regularly with his best friend, Clinton. And
his schedule includes family time: McAuliffe and his wife, Dorothy,
have four children.
</P>
<P>
   But McAuliffe's name has surfaced in legal matters that mix
politics and business. In 1995, for example, the Justice Department
began examining Washington real estate deals involving McAuliffe,
court records show. The inquiry ended in 1997 when Prudential
Insurance Co. of America paid $317,500 to settle a civil suit in
which it had been accused of failing to disclose a $375,000
consulting arrangement in 1993 with McAuliffe in connection with
Prudential's lease of office space to a federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   For McAuliffe, Clinton's retirement poses a strategic question:
what happens to his unique mix of politics and business once
Clinton steps down as the titular head of the Democratic Party?
McAuliffe is likely to remain active in politics and fund-raising
and is already busily raising money for Mrs. Clinton's Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   He is also involved in plans to open a high-powered Washington
restaurant called the Caucus Room. The other investors include such
top Republican and Democratic lobbyists as Ed Rogers, Thomas Boggs
and Haley Barbour, the former chairman of the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a business person,'' said Rogers, a Republican lobbyist.
``His ideology derives from that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   As incomes of the better-off Americans rise in this age of
prosperity, with the stock market and corporate profits booming,
charities report that both individuals and companies are donating
less to organizations that support the homeless, the young and the
hungry than they did in leaner times.
</P>
<P>
   Leading charitable organizations like the Salvation Army and
United Way say that as a result, they are struggling with a surging
demand for their aid, and the private donations they collect are
falling far short of the need.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is so stunning to me is that people in America have this
image of prosperity and everybody benefits,'' said Deborah Leff,
president of America's Second Harvest in Chicago, which oversees a
network of 189 community food banks nationwide that distribute
nearly $400 million in donated food to 26 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Leff said contributions to Second Harvest's $10 million
annual budget have been rising but by nowhere near enough to meet
the demand. ``I think people just aren't aware of the need,'' she
said. ``They think of hunger as a distended stomach in some
developing country. That's starvation, not hunger.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Jones, director of development and national spokesman for
the Salvation Army, the nation's biggest charity, said, ``In this
era of prosperity, need continues to skyrocket, especially in the
major cities.'' Giving to the Salvation Army is up in some cities
and down in others but nowhere does it meet the need, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I continue to hear from places like Memphis and Houston of how
many more people are coming to ask for help in paying their rent or
utility bills,'' he said. ``The army is facing not only more need
but a more complex kind of need,'' in serving more and more
families than single adults.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Clolery, editor of NonProfit Times, a newspaper for
executives of nonprofit groups, said, ``Demand for services is
through the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   The travails of the nation's purest charities _ those, unlike
colleges, museums, hospitals and churches, that serve the indigent
exclusively _ clash with evidence of a slowly falling poverty rate,
rising incomes, and the overhaul of the welfare system three years
ago that has coaxed many recipients into jobs. The charities say
that with their mostly low-wage jobs, many former recipients earn
less than they collected in welfare checks along with food stamps,
health care and subsidized housing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, better-off Americans who might help are spending and
borrowing more than ever and reaching record levels of bankruptcy
and debt, so they have less to save and to give. ``One would have
expected that at a certain level of prosperity, people might reach
a certain limit of their consumption,'' said Julian Wolpert, a
professor at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University who
specializes in tracking philanthropy. ``But we're not getting
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the nation has never looked so bountiful. Bill
Gates , the chairman of Microsoft Corp., and his wife, Melinda,
have created a foundation that dwarfs even those of the
Rockefellers and Fords, and by the end of this year, Harvard will
have amassed more than $2.3 billion in a single capital fund drive.
Giving USA, which monitors philanthropic giving, reports a
prosperity-driven surge in giving to a record $175 billion last
year, up nearly 11 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But about 90 percent of the money goes to religious
organizations, some of which operate services for the poor, and to
other organizations that cater mostly to the rich and the middle
class, like the opera, ballet, museums and universities. ``They add
nicely to our quality of life,'' Wolpert said of these
organizations, ``but they are also the kinds of things that we
ourselves use.''
</P>
<P>
   No one keeps track of contributions to programs the poor use.
But Giving USA reports that contributions for human services,
including most forms of traditional charity, represented 9.2
percent of all giving last year, a decline from 13.9 percent in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   And by a variety of measures, people are also giving less to all
forms of philanthropy. The Independent Sector, a coalition of
philanthropic organizations, says that households donated 2.1
percent of their incomes last year, compared with 2.5 percent a
decade ago, and that the number of those making any contributions
fell to 70.1 percent last year from 75.1 percent in 1989. After
inflation, the organization reports, a family's average gift to
human service organizations fell to $250 last year from $271 four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Animals get more sympathy than children, said Joyce Strom,
president and chief executive of the Massachusetts Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children in Boston. ``If there's an animal
abused,'' she said, ``people will flock to the cause and raise
money on the spot.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Strom's organization, which serves 100,000 children a year,
must struggle with curbs in government support of its services and
the costs and difficulties of raising money from the public.
</P>
<P>
   State payments for the society's services to children amount to
$24 million of its annual budget of $30 million. While salaries and
other costs rise, the state has frozen the payments of support,
some for as long as 12 years. So in going after private donations,
Ms. Strom said, ``I have to raise money just to fill the hole I'm
in, and it's really, really tough to raise money.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Ms. Strom said, ``We have to turn people away all
the time. People who are reported for child abuse and neglect but
who are screened out because their cases are not serious enough.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Some analysts are unsympathetic with the travails of low-budget
agencies that serve the poor. ``It's their mission to complain,''
said Paul Schervish, director of Boston College's Social Welfare
Research Institute, who sees the nation entering a golden age of
philanthropy, with the baby-boom generation leaving tens of
trillions of dollars to their estates and charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening is these groups are facing competition,''
Schervish said. ``It doesn't mean people are giving any less.''
Part of their contributions to organizations like Harvard and
Boston College is used to educate the poor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Michael Petit, a director of the Child Welfare League of America
and former commissioner for human services for the state of Maine,
said: ``There is a large gap between what these families require to
be whole and what is available to them. The early, front-end
investment in children is not occurring at a sufficient scale to
make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Such charities' accounts of the gap in their resources and needs
vary only in the details. At the United Way, said Tony De
Cristofaro, a spokesman, ``over the last 10 years, we have had
increases virtually every year in contributions.'' But he said the
share that donors designate for health and humans ``is flat at best
or declining.''
</P>
<P>
   Other charities describe similar gaps in needs and resources.
From a 48,000-square-foot warehouse in Washington and a
12,000-square-foot warehouse nearby in Arlington, Va., the Capital
Area Food Bank dispatches almost 2 million tons of food a month to
780 food pantries, like Martha's Table and So Others Might Eat, and
to church kitchens that feed 200,000 people a month in the
Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1988, we were seeing one out of five children'' in the
Washington area, said Linda Brantley, the food bank's president and
chief executive. ``Then five years down the road, it was one out of
four. Now we are seeing one out of three.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Platek, vice president for fund development for Associated
Catholic Charities of Houston, has noticed that supporters now give
for buildings and endowments more readily than for services.
</P>
<P>
   The organization just completed a successful drive for $11
million, mostly for a new central program building. But raising
money for emergency services _ disaster relief, food, shelter and
clothing _ is much harder. In part because of the change in the
welfare system, ``we had a 40 percent increase in the numbers of
people served through emergency assistance from 1996 to 1998,'' Ms.
Platek said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the people we're seeing are the working poor,'' she
said. ``They have full-time jobs, but housing is eating up the
paycheck. We've seen a big increase in that. We're straining.''
</P>
<P>
   Philanthropic contributions by corporations, typically about 1
percent of their profits and about 5 percent of all giving
nationally, have been declining more than those from individuals,
many charities report. This has put a strain on the National Urban
League in New York, whose affiliates provide education and job
training to minority clients.
</P>
<P>
   With mergers and plant closings, said Milton Little, executive
vice president and chief operating officer, ``this has been an
extremely difficult year for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Charity executives say it is hard to determine why Americans do
not share more of their prosperity with the poor. They speculate
that in moving to gated communities in the suburbs, people who
rally to help hurricane victims portrayed on the evening news do
not see the need around the corner. Herman Ewing, president of the
Urban League of Memphis, said prosperity, for all its appeal, can
undermine the sharing and the bonds of neighbors and communities,
and gives people a lot to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result of prosperity is isolation, arrogance and
in-your-face,'' Ewing said. ``This among people who were once
interdependent in terms of basic survival needs. The idea that
you're looking out for me for food and I'm looking out for you for
this or that is all by the boards.''
</P>
<P>
   Gail Ober, executive director of the Children's Aid Society of
Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, said: ``I'm concerned that we are
not a kinder society. Child welfare agencies serve the most at-risk
families. I'm not sure there's a value attached to having some
responsibility for those families.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Boris, director of the Center on Nonprofits and
Philanthropy at the Urban Institute in Washington, said, ``We're
not as generous as we could be.'' But a reason may be that so many
of the decade's newly rich have not turned their attention to
charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be a lag,'' Ms. Boris said. ``Maybe the whole
generation of folks making money are not yet a part of the network
of people who give.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The disturbance that brought snow to many mountains of the
Southwest during the last two days will gather additional moisture
as it reaches the southern Plains Sunday. As a result, locally
heavy rain will fall from northeastern Texas to the lower Ohio
Valley. Meanwhile, milder and more tranquil weather will develop
over the Northeast before conditions begin to deteriorate again
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A plume of moist air will be drawn north through the Mississippi
Valley as low pressure moves east from Texas. As the moisture-laden
air is forced to rise over cooler air, locally heavy rain will
spread from the southern Mississippi Valley early Sunday to the
western part of the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys Sunday night. A few
potent thunderstorms will develop in the humid air near the western
Gulf Coast. In the wake of the low, intermittent rain will linger
in central Texas. Wet snow will gradually end over parts of the
Texas panhandle.
</P>

   The latest in a series of cold fronts will bring coastal and
valley showers along with mountain snow to the Pacific Northwest.
Sunday afternoon and Sunday evening, occasional snow will spread to
west-facing slopes from northern Utah to southern Montana and
western Wyoming. Farther east, gusty breezes from the west will be
warmed as they descend from the Rockies resulting in a warming
trend over the western Plains.
</P>
<P>
   After a chilly dawn, high pressure will promote milder weather
over the Northeast. Sunshine will be ample near the coast, but
afternoon clouds will increase over the interior.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: White Christmas
</P>
<P>
   A white Christmas is an unusual event in most of the nation. It
is not surprising that residents of the southern half of the nation
rarely, if ever, wake up to a covering of snow on Dec. 25. However,
even cities with more wintry reputations from Boston to New York to
Chicago have a covering of white on Christmas morning in only two
or three out of ten years according to climatological records. This
year, the odds of a white Christmas in most of the East may be a
bit less than usual since the weather pattern that has brought
incursions of mild Pacific air shows few signs of changing.

<P>
   Over the past year, 28 cities have filed suits against firearms
manufacturers seeking monetary damages and changes in the ways guns
are sold in the United States. Two states, New York and
Connecticut, have threatened to sue, and last week federal
officials announced that they would help public housing authorities
nationwide file suit to force gun makers to sell safer firearms and
do more to keep them out of criminal hands.
</P>
<P>
   To many, it appears the fight against guns is a sequel to the
tobacco war _ a struggle against products that kill, and against
industries that have dodged or defeated change in Congress. And now
gun makers, like tobacco producers who paid $246 billion and agreed
to change marketing practices to settle state lawsuits, are facing
a reckoning in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The gun industry, with about $1.5 billion in annual U.S. sales,
is tiny relative to the domestic tobacco business, with sales of
$45 billion. So money will not loom nearly so large as it has in
the tobacco settlements. Nonetheless, as with the anti-tobacco
campaign, gun control advocates are using the specter of ruinous
monetary awards to force the gun manufacturers to change the way
they do business. Specifically, they are being asked to place
additional safeguards on guns to prevent accidental shootings, and
to restrict sales to dealers whose guns frequently turn up in the
commission of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But the parallels between guns and tobacco may be overdrawn, and
the success of the tobacco lawsuits may be harder to achieve in a
different industry.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike tobacco, which is harmful when used as intended, guns
have multiple safe and proper uses, from target practice to
collecting to hunting. As a result, legal experts say, the gun
lawsuits appear to be weaker than the anti-tobacco claims.
</P>
<P>
   Cities such as New Orleans, Chicago and Detroit want to be
reimbursed for expenses incurred treating gunshot victims. These
suits are modeled on the cigarette cases, in which states sought to
recover public funds spent treating smoking-related illnesses by
arguing that cigarette makers had not properly disclosed the risks
of smoking. That novel legal theory was never resolved because all
the cases were settled before verdict.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen Gillers, a professor at New York University Law
School, said the cause-and-effect legal claim that underpins the
gun cases appears far weaker than in the tobacco lawsuits.
Manufacturers have little control over what owners do with their
guns. In addition, the expenses that public agencies might have the
right to recover are also unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Public housing authorities, for example, might claim they are
owed money because one person shot another on their premises. But,
Gillers said, ``There is an extra beat because an individual is
involved. The direct causation was more obvious in tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, that may not matter. Gillers and others note
that some manufacturers have already begun to seek compromise at
the bargaining table, faced with their opponents' strategy of legal
attrition. By contrast, it took years before tobacco makers entered
such talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the type of industry that is going to be able to
mount the type of long-term resistance that cigarette producers
were able to do,'' said Peter Schuck, a professor of law at Yale
University.
</P>
<P>
   While cigarette producers are multinational titans, the gun
industry includes only a few sizeable companies like Colt
Manufacturing and Smith &AMP; Wesson, and dozens of small ones.
Moreover, the industry is not unified; some producers have entered
settlement talks, others have shunned them.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, even if gun opponents falter in court, they may
still win their war. Already four smaller manufacturers, citing the
growing litigation, have filed for bankruptcy protection. Colt
Manufacturing, fearful of growing legal costs, has held initial
settlement talks, while other large manufacturers are working on
codes of conduct for dealers, hoping to slow indiscriminate sales.
</P>
<P>
   John Lott, a law professor at the University of Chicago who has
written about the value of guns as a crime deterrent, said that the
lawsuits are simply an effort by public officials to strong arm a
weak industry into submission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy is to maximize the legal costs on the industry so
it will fold,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who are sympathetic to the lawsuits tend to agree.
``That is the way our legal system works,'' said Robert Rabin, a
law professor at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   There are no guarantees that settlement talks will be
successful, even in the event of a broad agreement. That's because
the decentralized nature of the gun industry might frustrate its
effective implementation. Once again, the tobacco industry offers a
useful contrast. Tobacco sales are controlled by only a few
companies, but negotiators still had to carefully construct a deal
that prevented smaller companies or new ones from ignoring
settlement-imposed price hikes and marketing restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The gun industry includes any number of small companies, some of
them based overseas, a large market in used guns, and a national
gun show circuit, all of which may be difficult to monitor and
control.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some gun supporters like Lott believe that
gun control efforts will prove effective, but only in those parts
of the market where guns don't pose a serious risk. Lott sees the
lawsuits as a well-meaning but misguided attempt at social
engineering, which will only make it harder for honest people,
particularly poor ones, to buy guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only see bad things coming out of it,'' he said. ``There is
so much consciousness about the bad things that guns do that people
do not think about the defensive use of guns.''
</P>
<P>
   But others, like Timothy Lytton, a professor at New York Law
School, said that the gun industry found itself on the defensive
because gun control advocates successfully changed the terms of the
debate from the right to bear arms to public health. And, just as
with tobacco, once the debate was reframed to emphasize the cost to
society, the roadblocks to industry regulation began to fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to solve all gun crimes,'' Lytton said.
``But if it is true that a significant number of guns are being
sold irresponsibly then changing the practices of manufacturers can
change that.''

   Recent school gun attacks _ there was another one last week in
Oklahoma in which several students were wounded _ have been carried
out largely by boys angry at being picked on by their peers.
</P>
<P>
   In response, educators are redoubling efforts to discourage
student aggression from an early age. And they are turning to tools
like ``Quit It! A Teacher's Guide on Teasing and Bullying for Use
with Students in Grades K-3.'' The manual was published last year
with Department of Education funding and is distributed by the
National Education Association's Professional Library, which
described it last week as a ``very good seller.''
</P>
<P>
   But some aren't impressed. Christina Hoff Sommers, a scholar at
the American Enterprise Institute who is working on a book called
``The War Against Boys,'' ridicules the guide's suggestion that a
game of tag _ yes, tag _ is too aggressive and psychologically
harmful for children.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent speech, she cited ``Quit It!'' as prime evidence
that the United States is becoming the ``republic of feelings,'' in
which people are encouraged to feel victimized and entitled to
redress, and where values like competitiveness, stoicism and the
quest for excellence are shunned.
</P>
<P>
   Here are excerpts from the guide.
</P>
<P>
   _ By TOM KUNTZ
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The introduction outlines the problem of
bullying by citing studies by two of the manual's co-publishers:
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Recent research conducted by Educational Equity Concepts and the
Wellesley College Center for Research on Women found that teasing
and bullying are a part of the fabric of daily life for students in
kindergarten through grade three. ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Boys initiate most of the teasing and bullying incidents, but
both boys and girls are the recipients;
</P>
<P>
   _ Boys are more likely to respond physically, while girls are
more likely to respond verbally to incidents initiated against
them;
</P>
<P>
   _ Teachers and other adults frequently do not intervene.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) A prime area of bullying behavior is the
playground, the manual says, where play is unstructured and
competitive games are a problem: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have found that aggressive playground behavior of
elementary school students is reduced when unstructured play or
competitive games (i.e. where there is a winner or a loser) are
replaced by organized noncompetitive games.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) With such research in mind, the manual
recommends kinder, gentler forms of tag _ ``tag with a purpose'':
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   In these versions of tag, the focus is shifted away from ``being
chased.'' It is central to all of these games that players are
never ``out.'' Either their roles change or they can be released
back into the game by other players. Sometimes players are on their
own in dodging and running to safety; at other times, they are
helped by one or more people.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) But first, teacher needs to get in touch
with the students' feelings: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Before going outside to play, talk about how students feel when
playing a game of tag. Do they like to be chased? Do they like to
do the chasing? How does it feel to be tagged out? Get their ideas
about other ways the game might be played. Then, tell them that
they are going to be playing different kinds of tag _ ones where
nobody is ever ``out.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) That's right: Today we're playing
``sparrows in the trees.'' Sorry if it's a little more complicated
than plain old tag: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   (The game) starts with one student being the ``tagger.'' She/he
stands in the middle of the yard/room/gym. As the other players
(the ``sparrows'') run from one end of the playing area to the
other, the tagger tries to touch them. If they are tagged, they
become ``trees.'' They cannot move their feet, but they can tag the
other players if they come close. When there are only one or two
runners left, the tagger also becomes a tree. When only a few
sparrows are left, it is important to give them the option of
continuing to run or not. Some students love the challenge of
having to go around everyone, but some can feel intimidated.

so he or she can continue playing. Students can't be tagged while

CONCERN AND CASH RISE FOR BOY WHO LIVED WITH DEAD MOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By EMILY YELLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ As Monica Thomas and Saprena Smith dug into the
fried catfish lunch special at The Cupboard Too restaurant
downtown, their conversation turned to the 9-year-old boy whom many
people here now feel they know on a first-name basis, even though
most have never seen his face.
</P>
<P>
   Travis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had a conversation all week with my friends where
his name hasn't come up,'' said Ms. Thomas, 30, a court reporter.
``That little boy had to be awfully brave, to survive for so long
alone.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith, 32, also a court reporter, added, ``It's so sad.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a family friend who stopped by the East Memphis
apartment where Travis Butler lived discovered that he had been
staying there alone for a month with his mother lying dead on the
living room floor. The boy did not tell anyone about her death, he
said, because he was afraid he would have to go to a foster home.
</P>
<P>
   His mother is said to have been ill, possibly from high blood
pressure. The police do not suspect foul play and are not treating
the death as a homicide. Her funeral is scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, who family and friends say had been taught not to ask
for favors, had managed to get himself to school on time every day,
do his homework and go to the store to buy what he needed with
money that was in the house. On Thanksgiving, he fixed himself a
frozen pizza, but he has said that he had worried he would not have
a Christmas tree this year.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, most of Memphis had heard the boy's story. Now,
his maternal grandparents have taken him to their home in Carthage,
Miss.
</P>
<P>
   But Travis is fast becoming the main focus of this city's
holiday spirit. A local bank has set up a trust fund. A local
transportation company has organized a clothing, toy and gift
donation center for the boy, noting that he wears size 10 slim
pants and size 3 shoes. And local talk radio stations have been
abuzz about the boy's self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   Some are comparing his story to that of the boy who lost his
mother coming over from Cuba. But most of the soul-searching among
residents here is centering on what Travis Butler's story says
about this city and this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just tragic that a little boy is so scared of what's
going to happen to him in the system,'' said Alex Elder, 37, a
lawyer, ``that he won't call for help.''
</P>
<P>
   His lunch companion at The Cupboard Too, Wilson von Kessler, 33,
also a lawyer, said it reminded him of a William Faulkner story he
had read about a son living with his dead mother. ``It's just a
little perverse,'' he said. ``But I think it says something about
what a dysfunctional society we live in.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, on Main Street, Chris Woodears, 40, a print
press operator, was sitting in the sun on his lunch break talking
to a friend about the little boy. ``People are afraid of their
friends, strangers, anybody, these days,'' he said. ``Everybody
just keeps to themselves. When I was coming up everybody took care
of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Family members and neighbors said the boy's mother, Crystal
Wells, 30, did not associate with many people. Travis' grandmother,
Shirley Wilder, told reporters that she had little money and so had
not seen her daughter, Ms. Wells, for more than a year, but had
spoken to her on the phone in October.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials are searching for the boy's father, who has
never had any contact with Travis.
</P>
<P>
   Since picking the boy up on Tuesday, Ms. Wilder and several
cousins and aunts have tried to shield him from television and
newspaper photographers and reporters. On Thursday, when the family
returned to the boy's apartment to gather his things, he wore a ski
mask and pulled his shirt over his face. Most people here do not
know what Travis looks like.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we read the story on Wednesday,'' said Nancy Spoon, a
medical office worker, ``it made us sick to our stomachs. We had
never laid eyes on the boy. We didn't know what color he was. We
just knew he needed help.''
</P>
<P>
   So Ms. Spoon and two others in her office spoke to officials at
the National Bank of Commerce and asked them to start a trust fund
for the boy. As of Friday, the fund had raised more than $13,000
and was expecting much more. Bank officials said the local response
had been overwhelming, and they had received calls from throughout
the country as well as Canada and Europe.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the Wolfchase Galleria shopping mall, Mabel Wall, 75, who was
Christmas shopping with her granddaughter, said: ``I just think it
is one of the saddest things I have ever heard of. It seems the
little boy is just an extra-smart kid, but the world is so wicked
these days. I feel like children are the ones being hurt most.''
</P>
<P>
   Debra Finley, 39, a fingerprint clerk at the county jail, was
hoping she could do a little to stop the boy's pain. On Friday, her
day off, she went to an NBC Bank branch and delivered her $20
donation to the Travis Butler Fund, along with a $10 donation from
her sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hate to see him go through anything like that,'' she
said, ``I'm praying that Travis has a good Christmas, and a good
life.'' &QL;

   CHECHNYA-RIGHTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Chechnya has become the no
man's land in the fight for human rights. As Russia demolishes the
Chechen capital of Grozny, what is the world to make of the new
doctrine it thought was emerging _ a doctrine that seemed, after
Bosnia, Kosovo and East Timor, to be empowering the bulk of the
world to intervene in countries that abused their own citizens? Now
comes the harshest test of that doctrine: Russia, a humbled
superpower desperate to hold together its very territory, not to
mention its national pride, in the face of international
condemnation of its methods. By Craig R. Whitney. (Moved in `i'

   MCCAIN-MAVERICK-REVIEW (Washington) _ The deluge of hype about
the rise of Sen. John McCain overshadows a fundamental question:
Can a politician win the Republican nomination by bashing the
Republican Party? In the history of the Republican Party, far more
so than in the Democratic Party, the presidential nominee has
rarely been an insurgent; it is almost always the man with the most
institutional support. McCain has not only taken stands that are
unpopular within the GOP; he is actively disliked by many within
the party and groups aligned with it. By Richard L. Berke. (Moved

   GUNS-TOBACCO-REVIEW (Undated) _ Is the legal fight against guns
is a sequel to the tobacco war _ a struggle against products that
kill, and against industries that have dodged or defeated change in
Congress? As with the anti-tobacco campaign, the threat of ruinous
monetary awards is supposed to force gun manufacturers to change
their practices. But the parallels between the two may be
overdrawn. Unlike tobacco, which is harmful when used as intended,
guns do have certain legitimate and safe uses, and in order for the
manufacturer's product to harm someone, a third party is usually
involved. Thus, the gun lawsuits appear to be weaker than the
anti-tobacco claims. By Barry Meier. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOLS-CHEATING-REVIEW (Undated) _ A rash of systematic
cheating on school tests, most notably uncovered in New York and
Texas, has spread at the same time that superintendents and
politicians across the U.S. have set tough new test-score targets
for their school systems. The `standards' revolution is tying
promotion and graduation of students and even cash bonuses for
everyone from principals to cafeteria workers to measurable
achievement. Does this make the temptation to cheat even greater
than it would be otherwise?
</P>
<P>
   HACKERS-IMAGE-REVIEW (Undated) _ The computer hacker, a uniquely
modern character in film, television and theater, has undergone a
radical transformation since its birth in the early 1980s. Gone is
the plaid-shirted, pizza-stained nerd who guzzles soda while
fumbling through cyberspace. Today's hacker characters are
portrayed wearing black leather, trench coats, form-fitting vests
and pants, tinted sunglasses .. and they're usually villains. By
Jesse McKinley.

   COLDS-CAUSES-REVIEW (Undated) _ In this age of modern science,
we're supposed to know that colds and flu are caused by viruses.
The germ theory may appeal to the intellect, but don't we know in
our hearts that no good can come from a bare head, wet feet or
wearing an inadequately warm coat? What about time-honored scourges
like sudden warm spells during the winter, failing to change out of
wet clothes or going back and forth between sweltering heat and
frigid air conditioning? By Denise Grady.

<P>
   MIRANDA-RIGHTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Supreme Court's 1966
Miranda ruling, which guarantees certain rights for criminal
suspects, was initially opposed by much of the law enforcement
community. But most detectives have long since accepted it and
incorporated it into their routines. And in a surprising number of
instances, suspects still make self-incriminating statements even
after being told they have the right to remain silent. By Juan
Forero.

Project's holiday gift program, begun about 10 years ago, seems

then, that he has long been seen as the Arab neighbor with whom
Israel most wants to make peace. More than any of his Arab
counterparts, Assad is seen as a man who understands both power and
survival. And he has kept what few bargains he has struck with

   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Americans have never quite figured out Syrian
President Hafez Assad. Most see him as a kind of tyrant, even a
terrorist _ a leader who supports extremists abroad and suppresses
opponents at home. As rendered on those oversized Soviet-style
posters, he can look the part of a dinosaur, a relic from a
pre-global, pre-millennial, pre-New Middle East past.
</P>
<P>
   There is truth to that image; Assad has a record of
ruthlessness, though most of it dates from more than a decade ago.
But he has also ruled with finesse, willing to forgive some foes
when the reward is stability.
</P>
<P>
   Until he took power in a 1969 coup, Syria was fractious; under
Assad, that problem was solved by imposing iron rule rather than
democracy; still, that brought the gift of stability.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder, then, that Assad has long been seen as the Arab
neighbor with whom Israel most wants to make peace. The reason has
only a little to do with Syria's military strength, which is now
faded, and almost everything to do with Assad himself. More than
any of his Arab counterparts, he is seen as a man who understands
both power and survival. And he has a record of keeping what few
bargains he has struck with Israel. So he is viewed as someone who,
if he made a deal, would make one that sticks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he has a great deal to say about what happens in
Lebanon, which ended its civil war in the 1980s only by turning to
Syria as a power broker and inviting in its army. Lebanon remains a
base for guerrilla attacks on Israel, which keeps control of a
tense buffer zone that is the scene of frequent bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, for more than a decade, one of the biggest
questions in the Middle East has been when Assad might see
advantage in aggressively seeking a deal. With the surprise
announcement last week that he was ready to send his foreign
minister to Washington to meet with Israel's prime minister, a new
question looms: Might this really be the moment?
</P>
<P>
   There is good reason to think so, and not just because of the
small shift in his stance that opened the way toward peace talks
when Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited Damascus early
in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Behind that shift lies a broader sense not only of new
opportunity, but of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   Until early this year, Assad had always carried himself as if
time did not matter. He had prided himself on his refusal to
compromise; to win peace, Israel would have to withdraw from every
inch of the Golan Heights. In recent months, his government had
gone further, saying that even to restart talks, Israel would have
to publicly commit itself to borders that existed before the 1967
war, something Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, would not do.
</P>
<P>
   But Assad is 69 now and clearly ill. Since early this year, he
has seemed preoccupied by a need to cement the position of his son,
Bashar, 34, as his heir apparent, and his decision to return to the
talks without such a public Israeli commitment suggests a further
recognition that it would be foolhardy to wait too long.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Assad feels peace with Israel would guarantee his place
in history. But perhaps more important, it could transform Syria's
domestic environment to his son's advantage. The younger Assad is a
staff colonel, but he has little military experience and lacks the
confidence of the former Baath Party bosses and long-serving
generals. His strength is his close ties with Syria's business
community. So it seems logical that a Syria at peace, with an eye
on prosperity rather than security, would be a far easier place in
which to establish himself in power.
</P>
<P>
   To Syrian ears, another clock has begun to tick more loudly than
ever _ the one marking progress toward a final Israeli-Palestinian
peace. With the Israelis and Palestinians now pledging to wind up
their final peace talks by late next year, Assad does not want to
find himself shut completely out of the circle of peace _ including
decisions to be made on the fate of Palestinian refugees, more than
500,000 of whom now live in Syria or Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The winding down of President Clinton's last term is yet another
ticking clock, this one measuring how long the White House might be
willing to put pressure on Israel to cement Clinton's own legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, of course, has been here before. The talks in Washington
are to begin ``at the point where they left off'' nearly four years
ago, when Israel walked out after Islamic militants launched a
bus-bombing campaign in Israel, soon to be followed by an all-out
conflict in southern Lebanon between Israeli forces and the
Syrian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   That history shows how easily peace can be sidetracked by
violence. But this time, as Assad clearly recognizes, changes in
the Middle East have presented Syria with better opportunities _
particularly in Lebanon _ to untangle itself from its conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As one price for peace, Israel has made clear its demand that
Syria rein in Hezbollah, the Lebanese guerrillas whose attacks on
Israeli forces and towns have been used by Damascus to put pressure
on Israel. But doing that is not like turning off a tap.
</P>
<P>
   Armed by Iran and fueled by Iranian-inspired ardor, the
guerrillas are subject only to indirect Syrian control. Four years
ago, a Syrian attempt to shut them down almost surely would have
been met with open rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not the Lebanon of four years ago, in part because
Iran, too, has changed. The Revolutionary Guards who once trained
militants in the art of terror in Lebanon's lawless Bekaa Valley
have long since departed. And since Mohammed Khatami assumed Iran's
presidency in 1997, he has been trying to put an end to Iran's
isolation, even though he still faces opposition on that score from
very powerful conservatives. That power struggle in Tehran
presumably gives Assad some room to maneuver if he wants to curb
the militants.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Assad's government warned Palestinian militants
based in Syria that if peace were to come, it would be time to find
a new line of work. Through Bashar Assad, Syria later sent the same
message to Hezbollah. Among diplomats in Lebanon, the betting is
that if peace were to come soon, the message would be heeded.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even if the new road leads to peace, the path is
unlikely to be straight. Syria and Israel have been enemies for 50
years, and much distrust still lies between them. Many skeptics in
Israel and the United States think Assad's opening was just a
sucker bid, intended to lure Israel into a big concession or,
perhaps, to persuade the United States to end sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's associates say he frowns on the theatrics that have come
to be associated with Middle East peacemaking. Still, simply by
dispatching Farouk al-Sharaa, his foreign minister and closest
adviser, to Washington this week, Assad knows that he is sending a
new signal; never before has so a high-ranking a Syrian official
held direct talks with an Israeli delegation.
</P>
<P>
   If Assad himself joins any talks, diplomats here guess, it will
not be until the final moments, when a deal is ready to be signed.
But for the first time in memory, the diplomats say, that prospect
now seems more real than fanciful.

   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Americans have never quite figured out Syrian
President Hafez Assad. Most see him as a kind of tyrant, even a
terrorist _ a leader who supports extremists abroad and suppresses
opponents at home. As rendered on those oversized Soviet-style

CROATIA MOURNS FOUNDER OF THE NATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia _ As the body of its president, Franjo Tudjman,
lay in state at the presidential palace Saturday, Croatia declared
three days of mourning, canceling sporting events and shutting down
movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Tudjman at 77, after a long struggle with stomach
cancer, was announced at 2 a.m. Saturday on state television, which
immediately began to broadcast somber music and prepared
documentaries about Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
   The country was well prepared for the death of the president,
who had been lying incommunicado in a suburban hospital for the
last six weeks. Still, as his body was driven to the presidential
palace Saturday morning in a hearse, attended by policemen on
motorcycles, many people lined the route in silence, with sober
faces, and some were in tears.
</P>
<P>
   Practically all day long, state television showed his coffin,
covered by a Croatian flag and surrounded by his various medals and
decorations, with a Croatian flag in flowers at the foot of the
bier and a pale wooden cross rising above it. Two guards in bright
red medieval uniforms stood by as various personages of the new
state, in black suits, took turns, by sixes, in standing by the
coffin. Ordinary citizens, many kneeling to cross themselves and
some wiping away tears, filed by to pay their respects.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman, who began his career as a partisan general and
Communist in the service of Tito's Yugoslav Federation, will be
buried as a Roman Catholic and Croatian nationalist. He lay in
state on the grounds of one of the loveliest villas owned by Tito,
whose penchant for the good life and for military uniforms was
emulated by Tudjman once he became one of the leaders who buried
Tito's creation, a Communist Yugoslavia whose ``brotherhood and
unity'' motto only papered over the nationalist rivalries that
later erupted into war.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman's death comes in the middle of an important political
transition for Croatia, which he led to independence in 1991, and
ran with an authoritarian hand through his powerful political
party, the Croatian Democratic Union, known by its local acronym
HDZ.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy in trouble, many people unemployed and with
widespread allegations of corruption, both Tudjman and his party
were at low points in their popularity. Parliamentary elections due
on Jan. 3 were widely expected to result in the defeat of the HDZ
and the victory of an opposition coalition.
</P>
<P>
   During Tudjman's long illness, the party scheduled the elections
to try to take advantage of holiday good feelings, a shortened
campaign and the presence at home of Croats who normally work
abroad and are generally Tudjman supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The party is expected to continue to use the aura of Tudjman _
and the national mourning and state funeral and Mass now scheduled
for Monday _ to try to improve its electoral chances.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning was supposed to begin on Monday, but will now start
only after the funeral. Elections for a new president must be
concluded within 60 days, and it is not clear whether the HDZ will
have the first round of presidential voting on the same day as the
parliamentary election, separate it or even delay the parliamentary
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Ivica Racan, a key opposition leader and leader of the Social
Democratic Party, expressed sorrow for Tudjman's passing and said:
``Without a doubt, Tudjman has marked modern Croatian history and
gave a lot to the creation of independent Croatia.'' At the same
time, Racan said that while he did not expect parliamentary
elections to be postponed, ``they will be on the border of
irregularity.''
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman's party has not said whom it will nominate to succeed
him. The most popular of its possible candidates is the current
foreign minister, Mate Granic, who is Washington's favorite. Granic
praised Tudjman and emphasized his efforts to bring Croatia ``to
the threshold of European integration.'' Granic added, in words
used after Tito's death in 1980: ``We must continue on his way.''
</P>
<P>
   But even HDZ leaders say the new Parliament is now likely to
pass constitutional amendments weakening the role of the president.
Racan and the opposition say they would prefer a parliamentary
democracy, with a figurehead president.
</P>
<P>
   While Tudjman was vital to the settling of the conflict in
Bosnia and the 1995 signing of the Dayton peace accords, he helped
to keep Croatia more isolated from the West and the European Union
through his authoritarian style and repression of dissent and the
independent media.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman's reluctance to cooperate with the International War
Crimes Tribunal in the Hague, his conviction that the West was out
to undermine Croatia's independence, his historical revisionism
about the crimes of Croatia's fascist regime during World War II
and his encouragement of the Bosnian Croats not to cooperate fully
with Bosnian Muslims angered Washington and the West. It is
unlikely that his funeral will be attended by Western officials at
the most senior levels _ in marked contrast to the almost
unparalleled gathering of world leaders when his model, Tito, was
buried.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The acting president, the parliamentary Speaker Vlatko Pavletic,
went on television to announce that ``the big heart of President
Franjo Tudjman has ceased to beat.'' Pavletic, who is said to
harbor his own presidential ambitions, told Croats to ``express
your tears freely,'' then added: ``But let us be prepared to
continue to build Croatia in accordance with her history and future
and faithful to the ideals of freedom and social justice.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the perceived lack of social justice _ with a narrow,
wealthy elite close to the ruling party and widespread poverty
below _ that has done the most harm to the reputation of Tudjman
and his party.
</P>
<P>
   A leader of the opposition Liberal Party, Bozo Kovacevic, said
that Tudjman gave much to the country. But after 1995, Kovacevic
said, ``he did more damage to Croatia than good,'' producing
``widespread corruption, nonfunctioning state institutions and
leading Croatia to international isolation.''
</P>
<P>
   At the European Union summit meeting in Helsinki, Finland,
Javier Solana, the European Union representative for foreign
affairs and security, said Tudjman's death should open the way for
change. ``We have to hope that the elections that will now take
place in Croatia, the new political situation, will help Croatia in
the direction of a democratic country,'' Solana said.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksandra Kolaric, a historian, said that with television so
somber and the theaters closed, she managed to rent three videos
for the mourning period. When she logged on to her internet news
group at just after 2 a.m., when Tudjman's death was announced, one
participant asked: ``What do we do now?'' The answer was immediate:
``Go to the video club.''
</P>
<P>
   But by noon, she said, her local shop was nearly out of videos.

BRUTISH WARS ARE DEVASTATING TO CHILDREN, UNICEF SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ After centuries of great advances in science
and economic development, a rash of brutish, primitive wars is
setting back the lives of millions of the world's poorest people,
mostly children and their mothers, UNICEF says in a new report.
</P>
<P>
   Unicef, the U.N. Children's Fund, gets caught in civil conflict
itself, making it more difficult and dangerous to function where it
is needed most, its director, Carol Bellamy, said in an interview
Thursday before leaving for Berlin, where the report, ``The State
of the World's Children 2000,'' will be released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a figure that continues to fascinate me,'' she said.
``It basically says that 540 million, or one in four children in
the world, live with violence that might erupt at any time, or with
displacement in their own countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside her office, Ms. Bellamy, a former Peace Corps director,
has hung a photograph of UNICEF's ransacked headquarters in East
Timor. Two UNICEF officials have been killed in the last two
months, one a doctor trying to immunize children in Somalia and the
other working with displaced people in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   Conflict in some of the world's poorest nations has led to ``the
virtual dismantling of even modest health and education systems
that existed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She cited the Congo Republic, which in the late '80s and early
'90s, she said, had a reasonably high immunization coverage and
primary school attendance. ``The World Health Organization had
basically their African headquarters there,'' she said, ``but as a
result of the wars over the last few years the systems almost
stopped functioning.''
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF now has to negotiate its way into war zones to immunize
children. Ms. Bellamy said that last year she and Gro Harlem
Brundtland, the director general of the World Health Organization,
sought Secretary-General Kofi Annan's intervention in the Congo
Republic to allow a vaccination project to function. In Somalia,
Sudan, Angola and Afghanistan, UNICEF officials are forced into
political negotiations in order to help children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immunizing kids against polio today is far more than just
sending the vaccines into the country,'' she said. ``You've got to
get to them.''
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF, working upward from the community level, has begun
supporting home schools in Afghanistan while waiting for agreements
with the Taliban government to begin larger education projects,
especially for girls. In other countries at war, UNICEF tries to
reach dislocated children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support even modest education going on in even the worst
conflicts,'' Ms. Bellamy said, ``because who will lead these
countries if you lose a whole generation of kids that haven't gone
to school?''
</P>
<P>
   Civil wars are not unrelated to the other two leading causes of
setbacks for children in recent years, poverty and the spread of
the virus that causes AIDS. Richard Holbrooke, the U.S.
representative at the United Nations, said while on a tour of
Africa last week that the war that has drawn soldiers from all over
Africa to the Congo Republic is sending AIDS back home with them,
worsening a health crisis that is remaking African societies.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bellamy said that AIDS was ``stretching systems'' in several
countries. ``The impact in the worst countries is quite
extraordinary,'' she said, ``and if that is any measure of what it
could be in some other countries, one virtually sees the whole
pulling apart of society.
</P>
<P>
   ``A simple immunization program assumes that there is some kind
of primary caregiver,'' she added. ``A very modest attempt to get
kids into primary school means you are going to have to get
teachers. When you're losing the teachers and you're losing the
mothers _ and grandmothers are taking care of nine kids, or eight
or 11 _ it makes it very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Other factors include government policies that put more money
into the military than into health and education, and the degree of
commitments to improve the lives of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gender is very much a drag on the pace of development in South
Asia,'' Ms. Bellamy said. According to the UNICEF report, that
region, dominated by India, has the lowest literacy rates for women
in the world, the lowest percentage of girls in school, and, with
sub-Saharan Africa, the lowest prevalence of contraception. The
region has more than one-sixth of the world's people, but, the
report says, only Sri Lanka and the Maldives show levels of female
development on a par with industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really are calling for the re-energizing of leadership for
children,'' she said of the report. ``What we are hoping is that
government leaders and community and the private sector will all
take a look at themselves and say, `There is more that can be done;
we can do better than we're doing.'''

 &HT;    Taking note of the NBA Eastern Conference
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The numbers don't work on a trade of the Celtics'
Antoine Walker and Vitaly Potapenko for the 76ers' Theo Ratliff and
Larry Hughes, and the move was never discussed. But the plot
thickened when each side felt the other was floating the rumor in
an attempt to hurt the other.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia assistant coach (and former UMass leader) John
Calipari found himself in the middle of the mess for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a call asking if I did it,'' he said. ``I said, `Me? I
don't deal with those things.' I'm not involved in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixers head coach Larry Brown still remembers being passed by
Rick Pitino at the last second for the Celtics job, and you may
recall the Celts were not pleased with the way Philly backed out of
the Dino Radja trade in the summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   SHAQ'S OUT, 'ZO'S IN
</P>
<P>
   Unless Shaquille O'Neal has a surprising change of heart, center
Alonzo Mourning is expected to join Heat teammate Tim Hardaway on
next summer's U.S. Olympic men's basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal said Wednesday he will not play in the 2000 Olympics
because he wants to spend time with his young daughter. That makes
Mourning's addition to the roster highly likely. Among the nine
players already on the team, Tim Duncan is the only center.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYING THROUGH
</P>
<P>
   How's this for resiliency: Heading into Saturday's games, Miami
is 135-61 over the past four years when playing without one of its
current starters. The Heat is 9-3 over that span without Hardaway,
9-1 without P.J. Brown, 44-16 without Jamal Mashburn, 41-17 without
Dan Majerle and 32-24 without Mourning.
</P>
<P>
   TOO DEPENDENT ON TWO
</P>
<P>
   Among coach Jeff Van Gundy's concerns is how poorly the Knicks
play when either Latrell Sprewell or Allan Houston struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When him and Allan both struggle on the same night, it's going
to be difficult for us,'' Van Gundy said. ``I'm a bit concerned
that they feel the burden to score even when they're double-teamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're being asked to play heavy minutes. There's no doubt
about that. At some point, I'm going to try to get it down to 38-39
minutes, but I know that when we take one of the two out, we go
right down the drain. So, that makes it hard.''
</P>
<P>
   MENDING SLOWLY
</P>
<P>
   Nets center Jayson Williams had hoped to come back in December,
but he recently conceded he won't be back before January, if at
all. ``My kneecap's just swimming around in my leg,'' said
Williams, who is on the mend from a broken leg suffered last
spring. Asked if he has considered missing the entire season,
Williams said, ``That runs in and out of your mind, but I don't
think I can go the whole summer without knowing how my leg feels.''
</P>
<P>
   BIRD'S COMEBACK
</P>
<P>
   Pacers coach Larry Bird made a comeback Wednesday when he played
four on four in what he said was his first competitive basketball
game since retiring in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Bird, assistant Rick Carlisle and veterans Chris Mullin and
Derrick McKey took on Pacers youngsters Jonathan Bender, Al
Harrington, Jeff Foster and Zan Tabak. Bird's team won two of three
games, including the finale when Bird hit the last two shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was going to take the last shot. Even if we got beat,
I was going to take the last shot,'' Bird said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington argued that Bird cheated: ``They were fouling. And
they wouldn't give us the ball when we tried to call a foul. They
only gave us one foul call and that was when Carlisle threw Foster
out of bounds. And they didn't want to give us that.''

 &HT;    Big, bold, Barkley
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With Charles Barkley, the world got the truth, and it
was not always what you wanted to hear. It, in fact, was not always
right. But he said it because he believed it, and he seemed to
never be disillusioned.
</P>
<P>
   So when he looked down at his distorted kneecap Wednesday night
in Philadelphia, Barkley told himself the terrible truth. ``It's
over,'' he said to himself.
</P>
<P>
   The injury, a ruptured knee tendon, was a devastating one that
very well could have ended his career if he were not planning to
quit after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen that type of injury before, but never above the
kneecap,'' said Philadelphia 76ers president Pat Croce, a licensed
physical therapist who was the Sixers' strength and conditioning
coach during the first eight seasons of Barkley's career with the
team. ``I never saw one where the muscle belly rolls up like a
Venetian blind.''
</P>
<P>
   So, returning after such an injury would have been difficult.
``It would take me coming back as his physical therapist,'' Croce
said. ``It would take a good year of rehabilitation. He has the
work ethic. He has a lot of work to do just to get full range of
motion in his knee. We knew we were seeing him for the last time on
a court here, but may have seen the last basketball by him on any
court.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that bad, but not impossible. ``This is something that
happens suddenly and violently, the muscle retracting in a jumping
motion,'' said Dr. Jack McPhilemy, the Sixers' orthopedic
specialist. ``That may have been what happened. He's 36, so it's
certainly going to be harder for him. If anybody could come back,
Charles could. This is not an injury you couldn't come back from.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, McPhilemy said he'd never seen a similar injury
sustained by an NBA player and never even heard of one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might be sitting here and thinking about coming back, but if
I look at reality, God always sends us little subliminal messages
we don't want to listen to,'' Barkley said. ``I do think in my
heart he wanted it to end here, where it started.''
</P>
<P>
   When Barkley went down, close friend Allen Lumpkin, the 76ers'
director of travel and team services, hurried to the locker room.
``I went in to help, as I would with any injured player,'' Lumpkin
said. ``But when I saw his knee, I got queasy. His kneecap wasn't
where it was supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley had the time of his life playing in the NBA, perhaps
like no one who was so good. He enjoyed himself. He talked to fans
at the games, joked with reporters. He laughed with and at his
foes. He clowned with teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The other side of Barkley was less pleasing. He was a night owl
who got into his share of altercations that led him to a court
room. He could be vulgar and insensitive and reactive.
</P>
<P>
   And, boy, could he talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys have seen me go from a boy to a man, do some good
things, some great things, some stupid things,'' he said.
``Everybody does those things. . . . But I have no regrets. I have
nothing but 16 years of great memories. I've been all over the
world, I've met unbelievable people who I would never have gotten
the opportunity to meet. I met some of the best actors in the
world, I met some of the best athletes in the world, I met
presidents, Bishop (Desmond) Tutu. I met just regular people who
made an impact on my life. I played in two Olympics. I've exceeded
all my expectations, all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As confident and as cocky as you have to be to be great at
something, I still never expected to accomplish and do the things I
did. I have no sadness in my heart. I'm proud that I feel like I
was a great player for a long time, helped the league grow, helped
young guys to mature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'll always be a 76er deep in my heart. If I'm
fortunate enough to go to the Hall of Fame, it would be as a 76er.
I guess that's the big fella's way of working things out for you. I
said it was definitely over before the season started. This kind of
seals it.''

 &HT;    Stackhouse makes Mom proud
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Detroit's Jerry Stackhouse left North Carolina
after his second season in 1995, he promised his mother that he
would earn his college degree. Next Saturday, Stackhouse keeps his
promise.
</P>
<P>
   He will participate in the UNC commencement exercises and
receive his B.A. in African American Studies. A potential snafu _
the Pistons play at home against Philadelphia that night _ was
avoided when the team said it was OK for him to fly to Chapel Hill
for the 2 p.m. event and then fly back in time for the 7:30 p.m.
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dream come true for me,'' Stackhouse said. ``This is
really an exciting time for me and my family, and I'm thankful to
the Pistons for helping to make this happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Pistons coach Alvin Gentry said: ``We are really proud of Jerry.
For him to leave school early and be able to complete his degree
this soon is really an accomplishment. It is a testament to his
maturity, and he and his family should be very proud.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons will honor Stackhouse during the game, calling the
event the ``Stackhouse Graduation Party.'' There will be several
related promotions, including free admission to any fan who wears a
graduation cap and gown.
</P>
<P>
   BARKLEY ENEMIES? NOT
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago, Charles Barkley fought with the Lakers'
Shaquille O'Neal. Two years ago, he was one of the more vocal
players lambasting the 76ers' Allen Iverson.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of Barkley's season- and career-ending knee
injury, both players expressed nothing but respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people put in that nonsense that because he doesn't
have a (championship) ring, he's not a great player,'' O'Neal said.
``Barkley's a good friend, good person, good player. I'm going to
miss him. He's always going to be one of the greatest forwards
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Iverson: ``People already think me and Charles are fuming,
and we're not. I talked to him, hugged him, told him I loved him
and that I'm sorry things happened like that. ``It was just sad for
me to see him, knowing I said some negative things about him, some
things I didn't mean, some things I just said out of frustration,
and probably vice-versa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles Barkley is somebody that made me want to play this
game. Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Isiah Thomas, Larry Bird _
those guys made me want to play the game. I have a lot of respect
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS UP
</P>
<P>
   To Houston's Charles Barkley. He could rub you the wrong way,
but he played the game like few others and, in the wake of a
career-ending injury that would have sent many into hiding, held a
news conference where he was his typical revealing self.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   To the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal. He said he'll blow off an
Olympic team invitation so that he can rest in the offseason. Rest
is understandable, but for someone who can't make a foul shot,
you'd think he'd jump at the chance to work at that aspect of his
game _ and represent the U.S.

 &HT;    Taking note of the NBA Western Conference
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Target Center security staff dealt with a couple
of hecklers during a Timberwolves loss to the Dallas Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, sitting at courtside, started the stink by mouthing
off to referee Ron Olesiak, who had ejected Wolves coach Flip
Saunders. Olesiak then asked that the fan be removed. That was when
the real festivities ensued.
</P>
<P>
   From about 20 rows up, a large bald man in a fringed leather
jacket, jeans and sneakers walked toward the court and hollered at
Olesiak, at the security guards and at the Minneapolis police
officers. He wanted Olesiak arrested (he wasn't) and he wanted the
first troublemaker to keep his seat (he did).
</P>
<P>
   While all this is going on ,16,661 were chanting, ``Jesse!
Jesse!''
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Ventura probably would have been locked up himself if he
weren't the governor of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   JUST SQUEAKING BY
</P>
<P>
   Portland won its first six by an average margin of 20.2 points.
Since then, the Blazers have been slowed by injuries, poor shooting
and an inability to get the ball inside consistently. After
shooting 50.8 percent from the field in their first 10 games, they
have shot 41.5 percent in the last 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been feeling good about the wins,'' guard Steve
Smith said. ``We've been sort of lucky. We've just been squeaking
by.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a funk,'' said Brian Grant.
</P>
<P>
   DOUBLE WHAMMY
</P>
<P>
   A flop on the road over the past three seasons at 5-82, imagine
how giddy they were in Denver when the Nuggets beat the Knicks and
76ers in a span of two nights.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets' Ron Mercer, who missed three games with a case of
the flu, badly wanted to play against the Celtics Wednesday. And he
played very badly _ 1-for-6 from the field, two points and two
turnovers, two shots blocked by Paul Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   MAD ABOUT LOSING
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver's road losing streak was stopped at 30, 13 shy of
Sacramento's record. Victory came in Dallas, 104-95. There wasn't
much in the way of celebration, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was funny, the feeling in the locker room wasn't one of
euphoria as you might think, because these guys expected to win a
lot more games than we have,'' beleaguered coach Brian Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a sense of relief, it was almost a sense of anger
that we should have had one last week, which I kind of like because
it shows me the character and competitiveness of the guys in the
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Grizzlies general manager Stu Jackson isn't returning calls so
he won't have to talk about Hill's future.
</P>
<P>
   BRYANT BUMBLES ALONG
</P>
<P>
   After winning seven in a row, the Lakers were undone, in part,
by a rusty Kobe Bryant. Back in the lineup, Bryant scored 27 points
but turned the ball over six times and the triangle offense ground
to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   On his turnovers, Bryant said, ``I hate it, I hate it, I hate
it, I hate it. You want to try so bad to make up for it. Try to
cancel that and get that out of your game as much as you can. But
you just have to study it and see why that happens in certain
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Lakers are looking better and better. After they
romped on Orlando, Magic coach Doc Rivers said, ``I like
</P>
<P>
   them a lot. I told Dave (Wohl, assistant coach) sitting on the
bench, 'Man, they're better than I thought. They're really good.'
They're good because their system is good and they believe in it. I
think (Shaquille O'Neal) 100 percent believes in his coach (Phil
Jackson) for the first time in his career.''
</P>
<P>
   325 POUNDS OF MILLER
</P>
<P>
   Here are Suns center Oliver Miller's numbers: 57 percent
shooting, 5.3 points, 4.5 rebounds, 1.27 blocks, 325 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has made no progress since training camp in his
never-ending battle to control his weight. His goal was to be in
the 290s by opening night.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix coach Danny Ainge, who wants Miller at 300 or less,
says, ``His attitude has been great. He's saying all the right
things.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a but here. ``He hasn't convinced me. You're not going
to convince me completely if you're 25 pounds overweight.''

 &HT;    Hatch's advice to Bush: Stick with me, kid, you'll go places
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The last Republican presidential debate of 1999
gives Texas Gov. George W. Bush a chance to ease growing concerns
about his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley, meanwhile, will meet in
Manchester, N.H., Friday in a debate despite Bradley's recent
monitoring for an irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP debate Monday in Des Moines, Iowa, will be the third in
three weeks for the Republicans. And Bush's performance in the
first two has raised questions about his once seemingly inevitable
march to the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   He now trails Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) in several New
Hampshire polls, although Bush is leading by a wide margin in most
other states.
</P>
<P>
   The debate last Monday in Arizona produced the most memorable
line of the campaign season so far. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah),
barely registering in most polls, told Bush he needs more
experience to be president and could get it as his vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should be president,'' Hatch said. ``You should have eight
years with me and, boy, you'd make a heck of a president after
eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   FORBES HAMMERS BUSH OVER STREET DEDICATION
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes continued jabbing at Bush on the abortion issue,
calling on the governor Thursday to rescind legislation renaming a
portion of a Texas road for a doctor who performed abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no justification for a self-described pro-life
Republican governor to celebrate and honor an abortionist. This
raises serious questions about George W. Bush's commitment to the
pro-life cause,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   But the doctor in question, the late John B. Coleman, was known
for more than his willingness to perform abortions at the Houston
clinic he owned. Coleman was a pioneering African-American
gynecologist whose financial support was essential for black
candidates in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman's clinic was the target of arsonists in 1985, and
anti-abortion groups protested his appointment as a regent of Texas
A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN PLAYING HARDBALL TO GET ON N.Y. STATE BALLOT
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Thursday he will file a lawsuit to force a change in
the ``confusing and Byzantine'' presidential primary process before
New York state's March 7 primary. New York requires that candidates
qualify by obtaining signatures in each of its 31 congressional
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Other states, including Georgia, require only a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Only Bush and Forbes expect to be on the ballot in all 31
districts. Four years ago, Forbes successfully sued to be included
in 25 of the 31 districts.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki and most of the state's GOP leadership are
supporting Bush.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGIA GOP FEELING PINCH FROM BUSH'S FUND-RAISING
</P>
<P>
   Bush's fund-raising juggernaut has made it harder for some state
parties to raise money, Georgia GOP Chairman Chuck Clay said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has raised $1.7 million through just three events in
Georgia, part of the record-setting $60 million his campaign has
taken in this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that a lot of the financial elite in Buckhead that
have really ponied up for Bush haven't given aso the (state)
party,'' Clay said. ``We probably would have received some of that
money at some point this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay said he expects the party will raise $1.2 million in 1999,
no better than what the party raised in 1997, the last year without
a major election in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   GOP POLLSTER OFFERS TIPS ON HOW TO TALK WITH JEWS
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Frank Luntz's latest missive to the
Republican Jewish Coalition suggests a number of unsubtle ways for
GOP candidates to win the votes of Democratic-leaning Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Charlton Heston as Moses graces the cover page of Luntz's
research report, which he calls ``The Four Questions and 10 More.''
The title is a play on a segment of the Passover Seder.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty more schmaltz to be found inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jews listen attentively for the personal angle,'' Luntz writes
in advising candidates to show more heart when they talk to Jews.
</P>
<P>
   His major point is that Republicans must alter their style, not
their policies, to win Jewish votes. ``Republicans show too much
anger and not enough heart for the typical Jewish voter,'' he
writes.
</P>
<P>
   Luntz, who could not be reached for comment, argues that
Republicans can overcome some stands on social issues that many
Jewish voters find distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pro-life Republican candidates, if they use less divisive
social language, can win a significant portion of Jewish support if
they are vocally and unconditionally pro-Israel,'' Luntz says.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish voters are concentrated in California, Florida and New
York, where Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is poised to run for the U.S.
Senate against first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. Giuliani, a Luntz
client, outpolled his Democratic challenger among Jews in the last
mayoral election.
</P>
<P>
   CALIFORNIA DEMOCRAT HOPING TO RECLAIM SEAT
</P>
<P>
   Five seats stand between the Democrats and control of the House
of Representatives next year. The Democrats hope to nearly erase
that gap in just one state, California.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to a crop of candidates that give Democrats a strong shot
in three other California districts, former Rep. Jane Harman said
last week that she will seek her old seat against freshman
Republican Steve Kuykendall in the beachfront communities of Los
Angeles. Harman has plenty of money to make the race. She spent $16
million of her husband's stereo components fortune in a losing bid
for governor last year.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates hold similar views, moderate to conservative on
economic issues, in favor of gun control and abortion rights.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the beginning of the century, President Theodore
Roosevelt not only drove home the importance of the Panama Canal to
America's becoming a great power, he felt so strongly about it that
he drove a steam shovel that helped dig the engineering marvel of
his age.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the century ends, another president, Bill Clinton, is
having trouble finding a U.S. official to give it away, a problem
that more than anything reflects how the canal has receded in
importance _ militarily, economically and, above all, politically.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the administration describes the moment of the handover
as a signal one in relations with Latin America, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said she would not attend the ceremonies,
apparently because she preferred to be in Washington for Middle
East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. delegation will instead be led by Jimmy Carter, who was
president in 1978 when the Senate decided, with only one vote to
spare, to approve the treaties giving away the canal, which cost
the United States $352 million and 5,609 lives to build.
</P>
<P>
   The Panamanians had hoped that the handover ceremony would be
more prestigious. Panama's president, Mireya Moscoso, visited
Washington in October to ask Clinton to come himself this Tuesday
to the Miraflores Locks for the ceremony that will symbolically
transfer power over the canal. The president was noncommittal.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department recommended that the president go. The
National Security Council sent him a memorandum that described the
ceremonies but did not mention whether he should attend. Officials
there would not say what the president's national security adviser,
Sandy Berger, recommended.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he wanted to go,'' Thomas F. McLarty III, formerly the
president's top Latin American adviser, said Friday. ``He did ask
me about it, just in a casual conversation a few weeks ago. He
genuinely wanted to go. I think he felt it was a historic
occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has never told the Panamanians or the U.S. public why he
decided not to attend. White House aides have offered a variety of
explanations, from the need to work on the budget, to tficulty of laying on yet another foreign trip, to his desire to
let Carter take the leading role _ an explanation suggesting a
Clinton affection for Carter previously unknown.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Albright, with whom Berger argued over her decision
to stay away, another obvious fill-in for Clinton is Vice President
Al Gore. But, in a presidential campaign in which Gore clearly
wants to take no chances at all, he never volunteered, knowing that
among the costs of the approval of the canal treaties in 1978 and
1980 were the seats of about a dozen Democratic senators. Nor did
the White House, his staff insisted, ever ask him to go.
</P>
<P>
   By the weekend, the White House was still scrambling to fill the
delegation. While Rodney Slater, secretary of transportation, and
William Daley, secretary of commerce, were included in the
delegation, the State Department said its highest-ranking official
would be Peter Romero, the acting assistant secretary of state for
Western hemisphere affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But if the administration was having trouble stirring up much
enthusiasm for the handover, critics were also failing to stir up
much outrage over what at this stage is a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That was not always the case. In 1976, while President Gerald
Ford was negotiating a pact, he was challenged in the Republican
primaries by Ronald Reagan, who made the canal issue a rallying
cry, saying: ``We built it. We paid for it. It's ours and we're
going to keep it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another California Republican, Sen. S.I. Hayakawa, displayed a
sense of the history of U.S. involvement in Panama's secession from
Colombia when he said, ``we stole it fair and square.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The fight in the Senate in 1978 was bitter, and today's
arguments are pallid in comparison. Sen. Trent Lott, the Republican
leader from Mississippi, and Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a California
Republican, have been complaining that Hutchison-Whampoa, a company
based in Hong Kong, has contracts for container ports at both ends
of the canal _ an implication that the canal could become a
foothold for Chinese meddling, or worse, in the Western hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has called its presence ``a critical national security
issue.'' Rohrabacher said the problem was even worse: ``Mainland
Chinese criminal Triad gangs _ some of whom have ties to Chinese
intelligence agencies _ are active throughout Panama, in
partnership with the Russian mafia, the Cuban intelligence service
and South American cartels in conducting drug and weapons
smuggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pastor, a professor of political science at Emory
University who worked on the treaties under Carter, scoffed at such
complaints, saying Hutchison-Whampoa runs large port operations
around the world
</P>
<P>
   But Pastor also criticized Clinton, saying the president's
absence from the handover ceremony was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   This was the moment, he said, to define U.S. leadership for the
21st century, for ``the transformation of the 20th century is
symbolized by the evolution of our role in Panama, from insisting
on a quasi-colonial presence to defend the canal at the beginning
of the century to recognizing that the best way to defend the canal
in the new century is by a partnership with Panama.''

 &HT;    RUSSIA SUSPENDS ASSAULT ON GROZNY, OFFERS TO EVACUATE RESIDENTS
 &HT;    By Charles W. Holmes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW Bowing to international pressure, Russia temporarily
suspended its siege of the Chechen capital Grozny on Saturday and
offered to help evacuate thousands of residents trapped by weeks of
air and artillery attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The offer came after harsh criticism from the United States and
other western countries of a Saturday deadline Russia had set for
inhabitants of Grozny to flee or else die under a promised
onslaught of invading Russian forces. On Friday, Russian officials
eased that ultimatum and said they were willing to negotiate with
Chechen officials on a settlement to spare civilian lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our ultimatum to the bandits, and a warning to
civilians, so they could leave the city,'' Russian Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin said Saturday. ``We gave a warning, and created
conditions for people to leave,'' he said, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Putin vowed that Russia will resume its offensive ``if (the
militants) do not lay down their arms.'' The Russian news agency
Interfax reported that military operations, including air strikes,
would begin again after midnight Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin is reportedly eager to capture Grozny prior to
national parliamentary elections set for Dec. 19 (next Sunday). The
three-month long war against Chechnya enjoys widespread support
among the Russian public.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 40,000 residents, including many elderly and infirm,
remain in Grozny. Among them are some 4,000 guerrillas, according
to Russian and United Nations estimates.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Russian official, Emergencies Minister Sergei Shoigu,
flew to the border region of Chechnya on Saturday to assemble truck
convoys to meet civilians willing to flee Grozny. He also made a
radio appeal beamed into Chechnya asking locals to assist in
arranging a mass exodus from the city.
</P>
<P>
   A safe passage leading from the city to the town of
Pervomaiskaya, 12 miles northwest of the capital, was opened
Tuesday, but few Chechens have taken the route. Russian officials
said a second route was being arranged on Saturday, southwest
through the Grozny suburb of Chernorechye and the town of
Alkhan-Yurt.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday marked the fifth anniversary since Russian troops
launched their first broad action in Chechnya in 1994 to crush its
bid to create an independent Islamic state. At least 30,000 people
are believed to have died in that conflict - now called the First
Chechen War -- which ended in 1996 with a humiliating retreat by
Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
   The latest war began three months ago after Russian blamed
Chechen militants for a series of bombings of apartment buildings
in Moscow and other cities that left about 300 dead.
</P>
<P>
   Casualty figures resulting from the Russian offensive have been
difficult to assess, but international human rights groups have
condemned the military for indiscriminately bombing civilians and
creating a refugee crisis in neighboring Ingushetia, where more
than 200,000 Chechen refugees have fled.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said the operation would continue until a stable Chechnya
is brought back into the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end-game of Russia's policy in Chechnya is to normalize
the life of the people and restore law and order based on the
constitution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe there is little resistance remaining in Grozny,
as militants have fled into the mountains of southern Chechnya not
controlled by Russia forces. But Russian military commanders want
to avoid a repeat of the fierce street battles with rebels who
inflicted heavy casualties during the 1994-96 war.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of staff, said
Saturday on Russian television that ``unorthodox action'' would be
taken to capture Grozny, but he added that the operation would not
involve ``a frontal storm or massive strikes.'' Leaflets dropped on
Grozny on Monday warning residents to flee the city or die seemed
to promise devastation. According to reports from the city, roughly
80 percent of buildings already have been destroyed or damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Grozny will be taken with minimum losses on December 20, said
Beslan Gantamirov, the commander of Chechen volunteers who are
fighting on the side of Russian forces. He made the remarks in an
interview published Saturday in the newspaper Kommersant.

AN OLD SORE SPOT FURTHER IRRITATES U.S.-CHINESE RELATIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China's strong protest over two recent American laws
promoting Taiwan's participation in the World Health Organization
is the latest sign that Chinese-American relations have soured
since the countries reached a landmark trade agreement less than
one month ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Ministry summoned a senior diplomat from the
American Embassy on Friday and accused the United States of
``seriously infringing upon China's sovereignty and grossly
interfering in China's internal affairs,'' according to a report by
the New China News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taiwan is a province of China,'' the deputy foreign minister,
Yang Jiechi, reportedly told the American charge d'affaires, Eugene
Martin, ``and under international law does not have the right to
join the international organizations for which statehood is
required.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan lost its U.N. seat to the mainland in 1971 and has been
excluded ever since from major affiliated agencies like the health
organization. But China has acquiesced to Taiwan's involvement in
some international technical and economic groups.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States does not recognize Taiwan, in practice
it has close ties and provides defensive military aid. But on
numerous occasions, the United States has assured China that it
will not support Taiwan's membership in the United Nations or its
major agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In signing the recent laws, President Clinton agreed to report
to Congress on efforts to promote Taiwan's participation in the
global health agency and other organizations. The administration is
under pressure from Congress to provide broader support for Taiwan,
and officials apparently hoped to finesse the issue by pushing for
Taiwanese involvement short of formal membership.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, China accused the United States of ``playing
semantics in order to help Taiwan squeeze into'' such
organizations. Yang said the laws ``completely violate'' American
commitments.
</P>
<P>
   China knows that hostile sentiment is rising in Congress, but it
appeared to feel especially betrayed by President Clinton's signing
of the bills, which Friday's protest mentioned specifically.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 15, top American and Chinese officials toasted their
sweeping agreement on terms for China's entry into the World Trade
Organization. But the afterglow was short-lived. American
condemnation of China's all-out suppression of pro-democracy
activities and of the Falun Gong spiritual group has caused
tension. Last week, the American Embassy here protested when it
became known that a democracy advocate, Fu Sheng, had been detained
and beaten after meeting the embassy's human rights officer.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, at the close of a short visit by President Boris Yeltsin
of Russia, China and Russia issued a joint statement filled with
attacks on American foreign policy. The statement said that
unidentified parties, obviously the United States, are trying to
force on the world ``a single model of culture, value concepts and
ideology'' and are violating the sovereignty of countries under the
guise of ``humanitarian intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials hope that the November trade agreement will
provide a concrete ``anchor'' for Chinese-American relations. On
his arrival in Beijing on Thursday night, Joseph Prueher, the newly
appointed ambassador, said, ``Our common interests transcend the
issues that keep us apart.''

FRENCH SAY ARMS PLAN FINALLY MAKES EUROPE A PLAYER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ By equipping itself with the ability to send up to
60,000 troops to a crisis zone like Bosnia or Kosovo, the 15-nation
European Union will finally become a strategic player that the
United States will have to reckon with, say French defense
officials, who have long chafed under U.S. military and strategic
dominance.
</P>
<P>
   European leaders adopted the plan in Helsinki, Finland, on
Friday, giving themselves until 2003 to build the command and
planning staffs, the intelligence bases, and the decision-making
and deployment apparatus needed to realize their new ambition.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have cautiously welcomed the plan, but put the
Europeans on guard against diluting the strength of the U.S.-led
NATO alliance by duplicating its structures.
</P>
<P>
   ``What fear of duplication really conceals is worry about the
appearance of a new political partner, the European Union,'' the
French defense minister, Alain Richard, said in an interview.
``It's a new situation that's a bit disturbing, that upsets old
habits, because at the moment, inside the Atlantic Alliance, there
are only dispersed European states _ the only common, cohesive
element is NATO itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The allied military structure is led and dominated by the United
States, so much so that Richard said it would eventually sap the
alliance unless Europeans pulled themselves up by their bootstraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Europe takes on more responsibility by building up its
military strength, that will contribute to the long-term
equilibrium of the Alliance,'' he said. ``Now the European Union is
stepping up to its responsibilities and over the next few years
will become a genuine actor on the scene, one that didn't exist
before.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other French officials said that the military
headquarters that the European Union would set up in Brussels,
Belgium, would be nowhere near the size of the NATO military staff.
A European military secretariat reporting to Javier Solana, former
secretary-general of the alliance, will decide how many military
planners the European Union needed, Richard said. ``I'm persuaded
that it should be basically rather modest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other French officials said a small European general staff would
probably number no more than a few hundred officers, who would draw
heavily on planning done by their counterparts in the member
states.
</P>
<P>
   The new European defense structure would also include a military
committee of chiefs of participating national defense staffs to
advise the European political leaders, who would decide when and
where to send forces. The 60,000 troops earmarked for European use
in a crisis would be the same ones that NATO could use if it
decided to get involved, French officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to depend in part on national resources, and in part
on NATO,'' Richard said, adding that the European plan was fully
consistent with a plan adopted at the NATO summit meeting in
Washington last April to improve the effectiveness of future
multinational military operations like the bombing campaign in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The requirements, the performance levels, the expected
specifications are all the same,'' Richard said. ``There will still
be a little duplication,'' he conceded, but he said it would be
minimal.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should help contribute to a new strategic
balance within the alliance by allowing the U.S. military to buy
more arms from European defense industries, Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have told our American friends several times that in our
opinion, and this isn't just a French view, even if it's
unintended, security regulations and limits on access to the
American market are a real impediment to the existence of a
trans-Atlantic market,'' he said. ``It's a delicate subject,
because it has to do with national security concerns that are
legitimate and respectable, and it's not a subject that will be
solved with loud public discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials in Europe agree. But strong European uneasiness
and resentment of U.S. strategic, technological and economic
superiority has led to fears of a resurgence of anti-Americanism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiery rhetoric and anti-American tirades by some senior
leaders in Europe complicate this situation immensely, and are
difficult to ignore on our side of the Atlantic,'' Jacques Gansler,
a senior Pentagon official, warned a gathering of French defense
industrialists in Toulouse the week before last.
</P>
<P>
   Gansler said the United States wanted more trans-Atlantic
defense industry cooperation but insisted that effective safeguards
by the allies over the U.S. technology they wanted were ``an
absolute prerequisite.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard said, ``I think the United States side needs to think
about this to see if they aren't in danger of closing the American
market to European producers.'' In Washington, France has not been
seen as being as trustworthy as Britain in handling U.S. defense
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Britain, which long refused to discuss with its
European partners any security arrangements outside NATO, that
finally allowed France to achieve its longstanding ambition to lead
Europe to a modest autonomous defense capability.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain agreed on that objective
with President Jacques Chirac more than a year ago, setting the
stage for European leaders to adopt the plan last June in Cologne,
Germany, and spell it out this weekend in Helsinki.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   At the insistence of Britain and other allies, including Germany
and the Netherlands, the leaders agreed that Europe would deploy
forces on its own only in situations where the alliance, meaning in
effect the United States, had decided not to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the condition, that's the agreement,'' Richard said,
adding that he had told Secretary of Defense William Cohen in
Brussels early this month that France and the United States were
pulling on the same string by insisting that some of the allies
should increase defense spending, for NATO's sake as well as
Europe's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's not realistic for Europeans to say we are
spending enough and that all we need to do is create more synergy
and achieve more efficient cooperation,'' Richard said. ``I think
that in spending on new equipment we are falling short.
Pragmatically, without forcing them, we have to persuade a certain
number of our partners to make a bit bigger commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   According to alliance figures, the United States spends about
3.2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense, down from 6
percent during the Cold War, with France and Britain spending 2.8
percent and 2.6 percent respectively. But Germany spends only 1.5
percent and Spain only 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Richard said that Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping of Germany
was arguing against continued defense cuts. ``There are political
obligations, and the defense system, by its size and the level of
resources that it has, must be consistent with them,'' Richard said
of the defense spending debate in Germany. ``I'm convinced that
will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   France, another French defense official said, would press its
European partners to set spending targets for buying the new
satellite-based navigation and guidance systems, fighter planes,
and transport aircraft that would be needed to make a European
fighting force fully deployable within 60 days, the target set by
the Helsinki plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be easier, actually, for the Europeans to agree not to
fall below these spending targets than it would be for them to
agree to them as part of a NATO plan,'' this official said. ``There
they could always fall short and say the United States had pressed
them to accept unrealistic goals.''

 &HT;    One thumb down
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At least one team was against the NHL's plan to go
with two referees per game: Tampa Bay, which is the unofficial
league leaders in whining about penalties this season.
</P>
<P>
   Several Lightning players are convinced referees are out to get
them, and coach Steve Ludzik said the lack of consistency on calls
between the two game officials in the two-ref system creates more
harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a game earlier this year when Fredrik Modin was pulled
down in our end by Eric Lindros and nothing was called and that was
fine,'' Ludzik said. ``But then Modin, to catch up to Lindros in
the other end, hooked Lindros and he was called for a penalty. The
one referee let go the Lindros penalty but the other in his half of
the ice called one on Modin. It should've been a (tit for tat) type
of thing. I've seen that a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Team captain Chris Gratton said of the team's recent rash of
penalties, ``We're on a really tight leash. We've had a couple of
incidents, but we have to forget all that. We're not going to get
any close calls go our way it seems but we have to get past that.''
This comes from a guy who yelled at referee Lance Roberts to,
``Open your eyes!'' after a non-call. A fine example by the team
captain.
</P>
<P>
   AN ARM FOR AN ARM?
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Maple Leafs, upset after Pittsburgh goalie Tom
Barrasso slashed leading scorer Yanick Perreault, breaking a bone
in the center's left forearm, were livid after Colin Campbell
suspended Barrasso for only four games. Perreault could be out two
months. ``I'm glad the league did something,'' Perreault said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But four games? I will be out 20 to 22 games. ... My goal was
to score. His goal didn't seem to be to stop me because he wasn't
going for the puck. I'm not saying he intended to break my arm, but
he didn't go for my skates, which is usually what the goalies do on
that play.''
</P>
<P>
   Perreault had surgery that used a metal plate and six screws to
help mend the bone. He will need another operation to remove the
plate later this winter.
</P>
<P>
   SHEPPARD NOT HAPPY
</P>
<P>
   The honeymoon is over for Ray Sheppard in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Signed as an unrestricted free agent, Sheppard now is
complaining about not getting enough ice time with the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   At least one teammate or coach wasn't thrilled with him. They
stuck a press credential in his locker, as in, ``Take a seat in the
box.'' ... The comments from Sheppard that upset coach Terry
Murray: ``I'm not used in the (same) capacity that I've been for
all of my career. I've always played the first or second line and
have always played on the first unit on the power play.''

 &HT;    Looking for a miracle
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Twenty years ago, mere months before the miracle,
aspiring members of the U.S. Olympic hockey team had a Christmas
gift exchange. The idea was that each player would draw a name out
of a hat and buy a present for that person.
</P>
<P>
   Don Waddell, then a talented defenseman from Northern Michigan,
drew Herb Brooks. It goes without saying that several teammates
jumped at the opportunity to aid Waddell in his gift selection. The
final decision was about what you would expect: a whip and a sign
reading, ``Ayatollah.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' reaction?
</P>
<P>
   ``Interesting,'' was all Waddell, now the Thrashers general
manager, would say.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' work at the ensuing 1980 Olympics in Lake Placid is
woven in gold in sports history. The U.S. victory over the Soviet
Union and the gold medal recently was chosen as the No. 1 sports
moment of the century by Sports Illustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach hasn't been involved in a miracle since _ unless you
count what happened last week. Pittsburgh general manager Craig
Patrick, an assistant to Brooks on the '80 team, fired a terrific
coach, Kevin Constantine, and replaced him with Brooks, who had
been scouting for the Penguins the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to give the game back to the players,'' Brooks
said. ``I don't believe in suffocating them and treating them like
a bunch of robots. Hockey should be fun. We're in the entertainment
business, let's face it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Patrick plans for this to be a short-term solution, it might
work. Jaromir Jagr despised Constantine and his structured,
defensive systems and seemingly had quit playing the past few
games. The change will serve as a natural motivator for several
players who felt the same way.
</P>
<P>
   But long term? Forget it. Brooks is 62 and hasn't coached in the
NHL since going 40-37-7 with New Jersey in 1992-93. Even with that,
he is under .500 all-time (190-198-61) in stints with the Devils,
New York Rangers (1981-85) and Minnesota North Stars (1987-88).
</P>
<P>
   Constantine knew he was cooked when Patrick never offered him a
contract extension beyond this season. But what more could this guy
have done?
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins don't have the talent they had during their Stanley
Cup years and goalie Tom Barrasso no longer ranks among the
league's elite. Constantine got Pittsburgh to the playoffs the past
two years with records of 40-24-18 (a Northeast Division title) and
38-30-14 despite Mario Lemieux's retirement, Ron Francis's exit,
Petr Nedved's yearlong holdout, a mediocre defense and, oh yes,
severe financial constraints that eventually led to bankruptcy and
rumors of a franchise relocation.
</P>
<P>
   This season? Things weren't great. But the inmates were starting
to run the asylum. Constantine sensed his players had quit on him
last week, yelling to them following a 5-2 loss to San Jose: ``If
you're trying to get me fired, you're doing a good job of it.''
</P>
<P>
   They succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Expect Brooks to try to step up the tempo. More forechecking,
more wide-open play. ``We agree on a lot of philosophies,'' Patrick
said, ``and I believe he is a better fit for what we have on the
ice. I believe he can get the best out of what we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks was at a transmission shop last week getting the fluid
changed in his car when he was told by somebody at the station he
had a phone call. It was Patrick, the only person other than
Brooks' wife who knew where he was.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunity knocks again. The Penguins need a miracle.

 &HT;    Unhappy Czech mates
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two short-term Thrashers, Vladimir Vujtek and Martin
Prochazka, were among the Czech natives who sounded off about their
negative experiences in the NHL to the Prague Post. Vujtek suffered
a 200-stitch gash and a concussion in an exhibition game and did
not recover enough physically or mentally to satisfy coach Curt
Fraser or general manager Don Waddell. The two also believed
Prochazka didn't adapt to the NHL game after several good years in
the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Prochazka said, ``I've played on the left wing for seven years,
but when I came to Atlanta, they had me on some paper as a right
wing, and no one cared any more. Their attitude toward us was just
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Vujtek, who also had brief stops with Montreal, Edmonton and
Tampa Bay, said, ``I won't ever try to play overseas again. I'm
taking the gash as a final warning.''
</P>
<P>
   He also felt he was misled by the team: ``The coaches claimed at
training camp that they would count on me and Martin and that we
would play in one front line. Unfortunately, it wasn't true.''
</P>
<P>
   SIX PACKS
</P>
<P>
   There is not a direct correlation between success and penalty
minutes (or lack there of). Consider the Kings and Sharks, who are
two of the league's better teams but are among the most penalized.

 &HT;    Potvin on the block
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Anybody who saw Felix Potvin give up a goal on a clear
50-foot slap shot by the Thrashers' Mike Stapleton might conclude
the Islanders goalie has lost it.
</P>
<P>
   But rumors that Vancouver general manager Brian Burke is
pursuing Potvin have merit. The Canucks are believed to be offering
the No. 1 pick that they acquired from Florida as part of the Pavel
Bure trade and goalie Garth Snow. The Islanders will take the pick
but would prefer a young forward over Snow.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: Snow doesn't like being the yo-yo in trade
talks. ``I like being in Vancouver. I thought I made great strides
last year. I'm definitely better this year and I know I can make
that jump to the next level. I don't mean to sound cocky or
arrogant but I know I can make it to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   RULES OF THE ROAD
</P>
<P>
   The night before every road game, a member of the Los Angeles
coaching staff slips a scouting report under each player's hotel
room door. Something is working. The Kings have an 8-4-3 road
record. Last season, they were 14-25-2 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of training camp, I really keyed on that first game in
Nashville (Tenn.),'' coach Andy Murray said. ``All through camp we
had Nashville signs all over the dressing room. We had their lineup
up about 10 days before the game. This was a measuring stick for
our team. We wanted to be a harder working team. Last year, they
outworked us and beat us three times. We felt that might be as
important a game as we played all year.''
</P>
<P>
   MARSHMALLOW MAN
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Tony Amonte, on owning the second-longest active
playing streak in the league (192 games, behind Phoenix's Teppo
Numminen's 326): ``It must be the body. It's chiseled out of
marshmallows.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   The continued absence of injured defensive specialist Jere
Lehtinen has led Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock to stopping matching
Mike Modano's line against opponent's top offensive trio. Lehtinen
and Modano usually would outplay the opposition, but the absence of
Lehtinen has led Modano to wear down. ``I don't think at the end of
the day, without Lehtinen, (the strategy) has been very
productive,'' Hitchcock said. . . . Lehtinen, who was hoping to
come back a week ago, hasn't skated on his fractured right ankle
since Nov. 28 and is trying to rest it so it will heal completely.
He might be out until late December. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Darren McCarty is undergoing experimental laser
treatment on his groin. If it fails, he will become the fourth Red
Wing in two years to have surgery for a lower-abdominal injury. . .
. Pat Verbeek is clicking with new Wing linemates Steve Yzerman and
Brendan Shanahan, recording seven points in a span of four games.

U.S. VIOLATED NUCLEAR ARMS PLEDGE IN JAPAN, RECORDS SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newly declassified documents show that while the United States
publicly vowed not to keep nuclear weapons in Japan, it secretly
stored them not only on Okinawa but also on the islands of
Chichi-jima and Iwo Jima, and was prepared to do the same at as
many as 11 other Japanese sites.
</P>
<P>
   An article describing the documents and what its authors say is
the first comprehensive account of the largely secret history of
America's use of Japan in its nuclear-war planning is being
published in the January-February issue of The Bulletin of the
Atomic Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on these documents, we now see for the first time a much
fuller picture of how Japan was integrated into the U.S. nuclear
system,'' said William Arkin, a nuclear-weapons analyst and a
co-author of the article.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its stated policy as a nonnuclear nation, Japan stored
``an extensive nuclear infrastructure _ at its peak, as large as
that of other American allies,'' the article states.
</P>
<P>
   The article says that between 1956 and 1966, the United States,
apparently with Japanese agreement, kept nuclear weapons and in the
latter years nuclear bombs without their fissile cores on
Chichi-jima, about 500 miles southeast of the Japanese mainland,
and on Iwo Jima, the scene of one of the bloodiest battles in World
War II, about 670 miles southeast of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   It says that the United States also kept nuclear weapons on
Okinawa until 1972, and, when the U.S. occupation ended, also
stored nuclear bombs without their fissile cores on the island and
on some other islands.
</P>
<P>
   Such coreless bombs and other components were also stored on the
Japanese mainland at Misawa and Itazuki air bases, and possibly
elsewhere, the article maintains. In addition, nuclear-armed Navy
ships were stationed in Sasebo and Yokosuka.
</P>
<P>
   Because Chichi-jima, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa were under U.S.
occupation at the time and the bombs kept on the mainland did not
have their plutonium or uranium centers, the United States was able
to maintain that it had honored its agreements with Japan and did
not have nuclear weapons ``in Japan.'' But ``this elaborate
stratagem,'' the authors assert, showed that the ostensible lack of
a nuclear presence in Japan was a mere ``technicality.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a Defense Department spokesman noted that even the
article did not accuse Washington of violating any of its legal
obligations to Japan. ``Our position is that there have been no
violations of our obligations under the security treaty and related
arrangements,'' said Walter Slocombe, undersecretary of defense for
policy, in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman and Slocombe also reiterated the
United States' traditional refusal to disclose where, and what kind
of nuclear arms the administration stores or deploys overseas in
keeping with long-standing U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Pentagon and the State Department spokesmen drew a
distinction between the documents and the authors' interpretation
of them. ``We don't dispute the authenticity of the documents,''
one official said. ``They are what they are. But we're not going to
comment on anything about what they say.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Pentagon and State Department officials asserted that the
United States has always been ``very sensitive to the special
Japanese concerns about nuclear weapons,'' a reference to Japan's
status as the only nation to have been bombed with atomic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Arkin and his co-authors say that the ``wall of silence'' on
such nuclear matters serves both sides well. ``For the Japanese
nation and Japanese political leaders, the elaborate stratagem
maintained the illusion of nuclear purity,'' the article states.
``Japanese political leaders could either deny everything or plead
ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   The article, which along with the supporting documentation is
being posted Sunday on the publication's Web site
(www.thebulletin.org), is the second written by the authors in what
has been a protracted effort to fill in the large blanks in the
history of America's nuclear weapons programs and military
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the authors reported that the United States had
stored 12,000 nuclear weapons and components in at least 23
countries and five U.S. territories during the Cold War _ including
Morocco, Japan, Puerto Rico and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   That article was based on detective work and documents obtained
under the Freedom of Information Act as the result of a 16-year
effort by the co-authors _ Arkin, assisted by Robert Norris, a
senior research analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council,
in Washington, and William Burr, a senior analyst at the National
Security Archive and director of its nuclear-history documentation
project.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman and senior Pentagon officials
stressed that nuclear deployment policies have significantly
changed in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've drastically reduced the number of nuclear weapons that
are deployed overseas to 10 percent of what they were as recently
as 10-15 years ago,'' a Defense Department official said. And as a
matter of policy, the United States has not deployed nuclear
weapons aboard surface ships under what the official called
``normal conditions'' since 1991, though it reserves the right to
do so.

   KAVKAZ CHECKPOINT, Russia _ A top commander of Russian forces in
Chechnya said Saturday that the Russian military was determined to

signaling that while the Russians have backed off from threats to
bombard the Chechen capital this weekend, they still seek an early
and decisive victory over the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't allow them to survive the winter,'' Maj. Gen.
Vladimir A. Shamanov, who commands the Western Group of Russian
Forces, said of the rebel force in Grozny, which was heavily hit in
the 1994-96 war in Chechnya and whose marketplace has been reduced
to rubble by the current bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military units have surrounded the Chechen capital. And
early last week, the Russian military spurred an international
outcry by dropping thousands of leaflets in the besieged Chechen
capital urging the unknown number of civilians there to leave by
Saturday or risk terrifying bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military quickly backed away from the ultimatum. But
it has not changed its overall strategy: seizing Grozny and chasing
the remnants of the Chechen rebel force and its core of Islamic
militants into the mountains near Georgia, Chechnya's southern
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Shamanov is one of the leading architects of Russia's military
campaign in Chechnya and a hawk on the Chechen question. He met
with a small group of reporters at a checkpoint at the border
between the Chechen republic and Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He is a popular figure in the army and said last month that he
would rip the epaulets off his uniform in protest if the military
is stopped from completing its campaign in Chechnya. He has
described the 1994-1996 war as a betrayal. He was recently
hospitalized with exhaustion, but appeared vigorous Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the current war, Shamanov's force entered Chechnya from
Ingushetia, driving to the Argun river to link up with the Eastern
Group. That link effectively blocked Grozny and separated Chechnya
into two theaters: Grozny, and the settlements to the south that
stretch to the mountainous border with Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, cars and buses of Chechen refugees shuttled back
and forth across the border. About 79,000 Chechen refugees have
fled to Ingushetia through this checkpoint, but about 56,000 have
since returned, according to Col. Anatoly N. Khrulyov, the
commander of the Kavkaz checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers would suggest that conditions are rough in the
refugee camps in Ingushetia, and that many people feel the
situation in Chechnya may be stable enough _ under Russian control
_ to return. The colonel added, however, that some refugees do
appear afraid to go back to Chechnya until it is clear who is in
charge in the breakaway region, where the 1994-96 war ended with an
agreement only to leave its status _ officially that of a Russian
republic _ in limbo until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   There still appears to be much fighting ahead, however,
particularly over Grozny. Shamanov said that the city remains a
strategic objective, not because it is the Chechen capital but
because several thousand rebels are believed to have taken refuge
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grozny is not gold,'' he said. ``Our task is to destroy the
organized resistance of the bandits and terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the thousands of civilians in Grozny, however, has
complicated that task. Nobody knows for sure how many people reside
in Grozny. Shamanov estimated that there were up to 7,000 civilians
in the city, but Nikolai Koshman, Russia's deputy prime minister
for Chechnya, has said there may be as many as 50,000. Grozny was
home to almost 400,000 people in the 1980s. A large but unknown
number of its residents have left since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the Russian military hoped to scare residents in
Grozny to leave by issuing its ultimatum. Now, it has dropped its
explicit threats and has sought instead to expedite the evacuation
of the city.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A corridor for refugees has been established leading north from
the city through the town of Pervomaiskaya and a new corridor was
inaugurated Saturday that leads south to Alkhan-Yurt. Alkhan-Yurt
lies on a major highway that crossed the Caucasus, and a checkpoint
there to process refugees was opened Saturday with great fanfare by
Sergei Shoigu, Russia's minister for emergency situations and a
leading politician in next weekend's parliamentary elections in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage civilians to leave, the Russian military has not
bombed Grozny for five or six days and it has promised not to bomb
the corridors. Only a trickle of refugees has crossed through the
northern checkpoint, and no refugees appeared Saturday in
Alkhan-Yurt, probably because there was no prior notification in
Grozny that it was being established.
</P>
<P>
   Shamanov declined to say precisely how long the Russian military
would wait before resuming its bombardment of Grozny, but he said
there would be no bombing attacks there ``in the near future.''

 UNDERDOG McCAIN DEVELOPS ANTI-CAMPAIGN STYLE  
(lb) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John McCain is not just running against Washington.
He seems to be running with great glee against all the conventions
of modern campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of repeating one carefully scripted ``message of the
day,'' the Arizona senator may well spout a hundred messages,
depending on what voters ask him at his free-wheeling town
meetings. He long ago tossed away a stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has McCain taken a poll since last January _ mostly because
his cash-poor campaign cannot afford it. But he has turned this
into a virtue, telling audiences: ``I will never be driven by a
poll in conduct of American security policy, I promise you that.''
</P>
<P>
   And while these days, other presidential candidates keep a wary
distance from journalists, rationing interviews like treats for
starving dogs, McCain practically stalks reporters.
</P>
<P>
   As candidates once did, he constantly invites more questions _
even after every conceivable subject has been exhausted, from
national security policy to big tobacco to poetry to sports to
books to World War I to his favorite food.
</P>
<P>
   In short, if Bill Clinton was the master politician who
transformed strategists like James Carville into cult figures and
brought campaign stagecraft to a new high gloss, then McCain is
running as the blunt anti-politician who won't lie, who won't spin.
</P>
<P>
   And in the wake of the Lewinsky scandal, audiences in New
Hampshire are eating it up. For the first time last week, a series
of polls showed McCain surging ahead of Gov. George W. Bush in the
nation's first primary state, despite Bush's formidable support
from the Republican establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he did a fabulous job,'' said Ed Nutter, a retired
businessman who has become a McCain connoisseur after watching the
senator at five town meetings, most recently in a high school in
Pembroke. ``He's direct.''
</P>
<P>
   In the lakeside town of Meredith, Rusty Chase, 24, was clutching
McCain's autobiography in hopes of getting an autograph. ``He's
honest,'' Chase said admiringly.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to suggest that McCain's methods are uncalculated.
His aides are aggressive about trying to manipulate news coverage
through the well-planned leak, occasionally timed for McCain's
appearance on weekend talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   And the campaign telegraphs that the man is the message when it
calls his campaign bus the ``straight-talk express'' and the plane
for his announcement tour ``Maverick One.'' Large posters of McCain
as a dashing young naval aviator also remind audiences of his
searing years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the senator acknowledges that he needs the journalists
he courts to propel him forward with enough free publicity to
overcome Bush's campaign war chest of $60 million or more. In the
New Hampshire and South Carolina television air wars, the Bush
campaign is already outspending McCain at times by as much as two
to one.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's underdog strategy is to damage Bush in the early
primary states, where personal appearances still count before the
multistate, coast-to-coast primaries set in on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go from New Hampshire to South Carolina, Arizona and
Michigan,'' said Greg Stevens, McCain's media consultant. ``If we
win three out of the four, let's say, who's the front-runner? Who's
proving to a national audience that they're the candidate that's
doing the best? That carries into those multiple-state days.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers counter that New Hampshire is a unique state
that likes to support mavericks and allows independents to vote in
party primaries. They argue that McCain will fade once the
primaries go national and organization and media become important.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only really two states in which John McCain is
competitive,'' Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, told reporters.
``One is New Hampshire. One is Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, McCain and his aides worry that he may be rising in the
polls too quickly in New Hampshire. ``It's a double-edged sword,''
John Weaver, McCain's political director, said of the surge in the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's success has helped his fund raising. This quarter
is his best yet and last week he surpassed the $16 million mark. In
January, he will be eligible for $5 million in matching federal
money.
</P>
<P>
   But the downside of success is that in New Hampshire, as McCain
notes, ``the definition of `win' is in the eyes of the media.'' If
journalists come to assume that he will win New Hampshire, McCain
may not get the kind of publicity bounce he is counting on to
propel him into South Carolina, which votes 18 days later. And a
strong second-place showing in New Hampshire _ which once might
have been impressive _ instead could crush his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, having been in this position, anything short of
a win is not good news for him,'' said Tom Rath, a New Hampshire
adviser to Bush. ``They must win here.''
</P>
<P>
   So McCain must maintain his lead in New Hampshire while building
support in South Carolina where he lags far behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
   To step up his national exposure, the senator has begun a series
of addresses on national policy. He rolled out a military plan last
week, and plans speeches in the next two weeks on health care,
Social Security and the environment in South Carolina and New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   He and Bill Bradley, the insurgent Democratic candidate, also
plan an unusual joint appearance on Thursday to underscore their
support for taking big money out of politics.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   McCain plans to spend more time in South Carolina, and his
campaign is starting to flood the state with surrogates. McCain's
wife, Cindy, held a debate-watching party there last week.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the state's congressmen who were part of the ``Contract
With America'' class of 1994 _ Mark Sanford and Lindsey Graham _
have promised to barnstorm the state for him. The new money has
also allowed McCain to go on the air with his introductory
commercial, with its footage of the young man as a prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   And for now, McCain continues to bounce from town meeting to
town meeting, noticeably drawing energy from the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   At times he is irreverent. When only one person at a Rotary Club
lunch showed any response to one of McCain's usual applause lines _
that a good teacher should not earn less than a bad senator _ the
senator suddenly bellowed: ``Get it? All right, fellow Rotarians,
wake up!''
</P>
<P>
   He woos young people by telling of his trip to the MTV Awards
with his 15-year-old daughter Meghan and his reaction to rappers
and rock stars. ``That was the greatest assault on my senses since
I was in prison,'' he says, usually drawing whoops of laughter.
``But I know who Puff Daddy is. I met Busta Rhymes. He was wearing
a dress. I thought I might borrow it from him. My personal favorite
is Nine Inch Nails.''
</P>
<P>
   At other moments he tries to teach the students of patriotism by
speaking of Mike Christian, a Navy navigator who had been shot down
in Vietnam six months before McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Christian, he said, had used a bamboo needle and scraps of
colored cloth to sew an American flag inside his shirt. The
prisoners would hang it in their cell each day and say the pledge
of allegiance to the shirt _ until their guards found it. The
guards beat Christian until his ribs broke and his eyes were
swollen shut. And then, tossed back in his cell, he tried to sew
another flag.
</P>
<P>
   By the time McCain finished this story recently at Pembroke
Academy, the entire gymnasium had fallen to a hush.
</P>
<P>
   But it is when he is railing against big corporations, big
money, and special interests that the senator becomes most
animated.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over he calls Theodore Roosevelt his hero and vows that
as president he would break the stranglehold of money on politics.
</P>
<P>
   `And if I fail to win the nomination,'' he told a crowd in
Meredith last week, ``at least people knew what I stood for.''

COMMENTARY: MARTINI MIGRAINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I was so happy to see Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   After all these years, she hadn't changed a bit: friendly blue
eyes and golden curly hair. Clever and spunky. Still taking it on
her slender shoulders to solve mysteries that baffled everyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   I was standing in Restoration Hardware, in a Proustian reverie
about Nancy Drew, sweet memories of reading the stories to my
mother as we drove, sometimes sitting after we'd parked to finish a
chapter.
</P>
<P>
   It was gratifying to find new copies reproduced to look
perfectly old. No more hunting through flea markets for worn sets
to buy little girls for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   But then I got the creeps.
</P>
<P>
   They had my number. They knew what I wanted, even before I did.
</P>
<P>
   I have no original tastes. My niche is a cliche.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, prowling in vintage shops, I unearthed old
treasures: a silver penguin cocktail shaker from the '30s, a brown
leather club chair, a mica lamp, tin toys.
</P>
<P>
   Now when I leave home to shop for Christmas, I'm still home. My
choices are eerily cloned at Restoration Hardware. There are
reproductions of the penguin cocktail shaker, the brown leather
chair, the mica lamp, the tin toys. The same music that plays at
home is playing here: Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington.
</P>
<P>
   I also find myself transported back to the house I grew up in,
with reproductions of the leather firewood holder my father used,
the floor wax my mom used, the bark-covered bowl with nutcracker we
had, the glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling of my bedroom, the
Slinky, the marbles, the Interstate highway bingo games, the
Christmas tree bubble lights.
</P>
<P>
   Why don't Americans ever get nostalgic for something new? Even
Brooks Brothers now has ties with martini shakers, cocktail recipe
books and a CD compilation improbably called ``Brooks Brothers
Cocktail Jazz.'' We are awash in sock monkeys, yo-yos, eight balls,
dashboard hula dolls, highball glasses, Etch-a-Sketch key chains,
Lionel trains, Silly Putty, Lucy, Erte, Barbie, Elvis, Marilyn,
nuns, dice, Martians and martini everything.
</P>
<P>
   At the millennium, yuppies are using new technology to create an
eternal present out of their past.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, I'm sure, we'll have TV ads and stores that speak to us
personally and morph their merchandise to match our unspoken
desires.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Internet is expanding by reductive marketing _
trying to pinpoint and mold our preferences.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of privacy does not make me as paranoid as the loss of
individuality.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Avila reported on NBC News that big online stores use a
technology called ``collaborative filtering.'' They pair you with
another buyer with identical tastes and then propose the other
guy's picks to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``You buy 10 wines from Wine.com in Napa,'' Avila explained.
``The computer finds another buyer who bought those same 10 wines
and then bought another one. The computer then suggests to you, you
buy the same wine.''
</P>
<P>
   After I bought some stuff on Amazon.com, they began greeting me
personally and telling me what they thought I would like next. They
presume if I order Gabriel Byrne's memoir, I'll also want Yeats and
Joyce. If I order a CD by the Buena Vista Social Club, they predict
I'll like Santana and Bob Dylan and Randy Newman. And if I order a
book by Barbara Tuchman about the Middle Ages, they bet I'll need a
history of dreadnoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Capelli, a spokesman for Amazon.com., explains how they
define and refine: ``We work through the power of aggregating a
vast database'' of 13 million customers. ``People have similar
tastes, similar interests, similar things they want to explore, so
Amazon.com does that work for you.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a little sinister. Your tastes are cloned and
cross-referenced so quickly you end up with the sense that
idiosyncrasy is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   It makes you want to lie to them or confuse them, simultaneously
ordering a bottle of Veuve Clicquot and a bottle of Thunderbird;
Jacqueline Susann's ``Valley of the Dolls'' and a biography of
Schopenhauer; a John Tesh CD and a Lil' Kim CD.
</P>
<P>
   But the scary thing is that they'd probably find a doppelganger
for all these weird combinations.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers of the world, disaggregate!

COMMENTARY: UNFROZEN IN DAMASCUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, OK, I know what the quid is, but what's the quo?
</P>
<P>
   I know that when the Syrians come here this week to talk peace
with Israel they will demand the total return of the
Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. But what will Israel be asking for
in return? Prime Minister Ehud Barak hasn't spelled that out.
</P>
<P>
   Some serious people believe that Israel should focus purely on
the strategic deal _ trade the Golan for a wide, U.S.-monitored
buffer zone with Syria _ and not worry about trade, tourism or
normalization; Syria doesn't have much to trade, and real
reconciliation would seem unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the key issue here is security, and Barak's logic is
as follows: Syria has a large standing army and can keep many, many
troops and tanks constantly deployed near its border with Israel,
so that a surprise attack is possible at any time. That's Israel's
constant fear. Israel has a small standing army, so it uses the
Golan as a land buffer that would slow down any Syrian surprise
attack long enough for Israel to mobilize its reserves. The key is
whether Israel can trade the Golan for an even better security
arrangement _ one that would push Syrian troops and tanks so much
farther away from the frontier that, along with U.S.-run early
warning stations and other restrictions, it would make a Syrian
surprise attack impossible before Israeli reserves could be fully
deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israeli generals feel such a deal is both possible and
preferable to the status quo, particularly if you add in the
regional implications: bringing Syria into the circle of peace
would close down the Lebanon front and totally isolate Iraq and
Iran. That would constitute a major strategic realignment of the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   But while such a strategic deal is necessary, it is not
sufficient. Syria has always seen itself, rightly, as the Arab
heartbeat of the conflict with Israel. Without a heart transplant
in Syria, without Damascus opening itself to Israeli trade, tourism
and diplomats, the war will not be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Egypt was always in charge of the hardware of this conflict _
the tanks and planes,'' notes Stephen Cohen of the Center for
Middle East Peace. ``With Egypt inside the conflict, a lethal war
against Israel was always possible. Without Egypt, such a war was
impossible. Syria was always in charge of the software of this
conflict _ the existential struggle against Zionism, as well as the
maintenance of a rejection front of Palestinian, Iranian and
Lebanese resistance groups. With Syria inside the conflict, the
existential war with Israel was always there. With Syria out, that
war would basically be over.``
</P>
<P>
   Internal reform and an opening of Syria to the world is critical
for another reason: Egypt is a homogeneous state with a long and
stable history. Syria is a multi-ethnic state, with constant
internal tensions. For Egypt, the war with Israel was a policy that
could be changed when Egypt's interests changed. But for President
Hafez al-Assad, the war with Israel hasn't been just a policy, it's
been the glue holding Syria together and the foundation, and
justification, of his own regime. That's why it's essential that as
Syria makes peace, and a new generation takes power there, the new
Syrian generation be seen to build its identity, and legitimacy,
not on rejection of Israel, but rather on modernizing Syria and
opening it to the world. Otherwise, no peace accord can be stable.
</P>
<P>
   That will take a huge amount of money, which is the other reason
Syria will have to change internally. Egypt made peace with Israel
in the Cold War, when superpowers were ready to buy countries just
to get them to join their bloc. The superpowers didn't care what
your country looked like inside; they just cared whose side you
were on outside. But Syria is making peace in the age of
globalization, when no superpower pays you to join its bloc and
when the big money is with the global supermarkets, like Wall
Street. Neither the U.S. Congress nor Wall Street will invest in
peace with Syria without Syria reforming its sclerotic economy.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote last week that we needed to force Assad to choose:
Either remain a failed state or use peace with Israel to build a
bridge for Syria into the world. I had no idea he was so close to
that decision. It's too early to tell if it's real. But if it is,
it could be extremely important for transforming both the hardware
of the Arab-Israeli conflict and its software.

HESITANT RIVAL OF MILOSEVIC JOINS FRAY UNDER DURESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The fur was flying in Belgrade last week
in a spat of accusation and intimidation between the authorities
and the opposition. What has made this bout particularly heated,
and potentially significant, is that it involves the largest
opposition party and state security officials who seem increasingly
tough in cracking down on independent action.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian Renewal Party led by Vuk Draskovic had until
recently tended to stay on the sidelines, allowing its opposition
rival, the Alliance for Change, to lead street protests against
President Slobodan Milosevic that fizzled fairly quickly and now
attract skimpy support.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Draskovic's party moved into open opposition,
apparently stung by state security officials who responded to the
party's accusation that they orchestrated a campaign of state
terrorism with harsh court rulings and police summons to party
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the police are going to attack us, then we are going to
defend ourselves, no doubt, there is no doubt,'' said Ognjen
Pribicevic, a chief adviser to Draskovic.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month the party accused two leaders of Milosevic's
state security apparatus of organizing an assassination attempt on
Draskovic on Oct. 3. Draskovic escaped with slight injuries, but
his brother-in-law and three bodyguards were killed when a truck
swerved into their motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the party in a statement accused the government of
``not wanting changes to be effected by peaceful and democratic
means, resorting instead to pure state terrorism.'' The party
spokesman, Ivan Kovacevic, blamed the two parties allied with
Milosevic's ruling socialists _ the powerful Radical Party and the
Yugoslav Left _ for orchestrating a campaign of ``arrests, state
terrorism and persecution.''
</P>
<P>
   The Radical Party immediately hit back, suing two independent
daily newspapers, Danas and Blic, and the Belgrade television
station Studio B, which is run by Draskovic's party, for reporting
the ``untrue'' statement. Under Yugoslavia's information law, the
three were ordered to pay hefty fines _ over $200,000 at official
exchange rates _ within 24 hours. The party stepped in to pay.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the police arrived at the party's offices to take
in three senior members for questioning about the allegations.
Draskovic, who has been jailed before, ordered the men to refuse
and challenged the authorities to arrest him instead.
</P>
<P>
   The government has also turned up the rhetoric. The Yugoslav
information secretary, Goran Matic, said that Draskovic was
following the orders of Western leaders he met at a recent European
summit in Istanbul, Turkey. ``There is no state terrorism in this
country,'' Matic said. ``The thesis on state terrorism in
Yugoslavia is something Vuk Draskovic received in Istanbul for
homework.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Serbian interior minister, Vlajko Stojiljkovic,
spoke to police officers and stressed that Yugoslavia is under
``pressure from certain Western governments, led by the United
States, who are trying to dominate, occupy and break up its
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   He branded the most dedicated members of the opposition ``drug
addicts, alcoholics, criminals and known hooligans, failed
scientists and artists, who have made a profession out of betraying
their country.''
</P>
<P>
   The sparring comes after an increase in harassment and arrests,
according to political analysts and human rights lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   An Albanian lawyer from the Belgrade-based Humanitarian Law
Center, who is defending some of the hundreds of Kosovo Albanians
currently in Serbian jails, was arrested last week and has not been
heard from since. A human rights activist in Leskovac has received
a death threat from someone purporting to be from the state
security force.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic's party, whose national leadership is meeting Saturday
to plan the next move, is by far the largest and most organized
opposition party, and its leaders say the government is campaigning
against the party because it is moving to challenge Milosevic
directly.
</P>
<P>
   The truck accident, which Draskovic immediately called an
assassination attempt, clearly shook him and his wife, Danica.
Pribicevic, Draskovic's adviser, said it had also toughened the
party leader's resolve ``to overthrow Milosevic and the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Political developments are also dictating action. The government
has failed to answer the opposition call for early elections and
the party had always threatened to take to the streets as a last
resort.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Alliance for Change, led by Draskovic's bitter
rival, Zoran Djindjic, has failed to win change, ``it is our
turn,'' Pribicevic said. ``For five months they were on the
offensive. Now we are saying the attention is on us. Give us a
chance to show ourselves.''

FIREFIGHTERS REFLECT ON A JOB OF GREAT RISKS AND REWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mass.)  (mk) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON

<P>
   ROCKFORD, Ill. _ When firefighters talk about the toughest
moments of their lives, it is not always the leaping flames or the
smoke-filled stairways that haunt them.
</P>
<P>
   For Tom Baylor, it was the face of a dying baby girl. Inside a
fire truck racing to a hospital, Baylor had tried to breathe life
into her lungs. When nothing more could be done, he went into a
bathroom at the hospital, buried his face in his hands and broke
down in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firefighters are supposed to be tough, just dummy up,''
Baylor, 42, said. ``But you don't forget. You have dreams about it.
Once after a baby died, another firefighter looked over at me and
said, `Man, this really hurts.' And we just sat there with tears in
our eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The emotional tribute on Thursday in Worcester, Mass., for the
six firefighters who died in a warehouse blaze showed the depth of
respect and reverence that Americans maintain for the people who
answer their calls for help. It was a response that even tragedy
seldom evokes.
</P>
<P>
   In an age that seems rich in everything but sacrifice, the
firefighter stands, in the ways that count most, as perhaps
America's most heroic figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little kids look at you and trust you,'' said Capt. Mark
Asprooth, 42, of Fire Station No. 5 in Rockford, an industrial city
of 160,000 about 70 miles west of Chicago. ``In a way, that's part
of the reason some of us go into this line of work.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that police officers sometimes grumble, with a
mixture of humor and envy, about how warmly people treat
firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police officers have to do things that make them unpopular,''
said Chris Kowalski, 27, a firefighter. ``With us, people call and
say, `Come and help me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Few civilian jobs, for that matter, get the respect accorded to
firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Stassi, 45, a former plumber who became a firefighter, noted
that injuries are far more common on construction sites than on
fire and rescue scenes.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say firefighters do not encounter danger. Not
long ago, Baylor, for example, found himself in a burning house
that became so hot the picture window was blown out.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us in this station,'' Baylor said, ``have been on calls
where somebody's been carried out of a burning building on a
firefighter's back.''
</P>
<P>
   Adrenaline surges with every alarm, he said. It is impossible to
know if the call is routine or mortally dangerous. After some
calls, the Rockford Fire Department has brought in counselors and
chaplains to talk with firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Asprooth said he believed that firefighters tend to be
compassionate and spirited, people who revere life so much because
they know it cannot be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see death a lot, you greatly appreciate life,'' he
said. ``We know what it is to see sorrow and pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Working 24-hour shifts, the firefighters in Rockford spend a day
and night at the fire station and then get the next 48 hours off.
The night work can mean missing the ballgames or piano recitals of
their children. And holidays usually mean work.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this line of business, you don't stop work for Christmas,''
Stassi said.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighter Lindsay Pooley, 39, told of an accident victim he
had helped, an elderly woman who hugged him and told him, ``I
needed somebody to help get me through this.''
</P>
<P>
   And there was the man who stood outside his house, most of it
burned, and still thanked the firefighter, Kowalski, for saving
what could be saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a house, it's somebody's life,'' Kowalski said.
``And if you can just save a family photo album, you've saved a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Kowalski said that firefighters do not like to be singled out
for credit. When people go into burning buildings together, he
said, they must trust one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not me or you or him, but a team,'' Kowalski said. ``If
anything ever happened to me, my crewmates would be there to help
me and get me out of there.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if I didn't make it out, I know they'd be there to take
care of my family. This is quite a brotherhood.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Worcestor, firefighters on Saturday discovered the remains of
the fourth and fifth firefighters in the rubble of last week's
fire, The Associated Press reported. They were continuing to search
around the clock for the remaining victim.

BARRACKS LIFE OF GAY HARASSMENT IS DETAILED AT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Note language throughout may be offensive to some readers.) 
(ATTN: Ky., Mo., Neb., Tenn.) (rk) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. _ All about the base there was the surface
bustle of the modern Army: Troopers jogged by in crisp formation to
a proud cadence. A woman sergeant in tailored fatigues darted into
the PX with an infant on her hip, shopping for the evening meal.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this reassuring scrim, a steady stream of young
paratroopers quietly arrived at the door of the fort's humble white
courthouse, summoned to tell of more aberrant days and nights on
the post.
</P>
<P>
   Though trained to be tough, the young men were clearly nervous
in testifying at a court-martial that was gauging the Clinton
administration's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy toward
homosexuals as assuredly as it fixed the guilt of an 18-year-old
private who crept up with a baseball bat and bludgeoned a gay
soldier to death last July here in the barracks of Delta company.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the trial last week, the court's pronouncement of
guilt upon Pvt. Calvin Glover for the premeditated murder of Pfc.
Barry Winchell seemed almost anticlimactic to the larger set of
facts gradually established before the court about the
ineffectiveness of the administration's controversial policy toward
gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
   The young witnesses disclosed a casual culture in which gibes
and taunts were directed for months at Winchell by Glover and
others. Such terms as a ``faggot,'' ``queer,'' and ``homo'' echoed
amid beer-filled nights of barracks carousing that, the record
showed, were devoid of superiors' reprimand or notice. Testimony
demonstrated that regulations were regularly violated and
harassment complaints positively discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing was done, sir,'' said Sgt. Michael Kleifgen, who told
of one fruitless attempt to complain to the post inspector general
about what the sergeant considered a clear violation of regulations
by a master sergeant, who referred to Winchell as ``that faggot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way all of us were, sir,'' Spc. Lewis Ruiz, a
friend of the slain soldier, testified about the barracks culture
in which braggarts and bullies stepped to the fore to pick on
soldiers' perceived weaknesses, to coin stinging epithets, and to
goad conflict that superiors made no sign of stopping in the case
of 21-year-old Winchell.
</P>
<P>
   As rumors and taunting spread about Winchell's dating of a
nightclub drag queen, friends testified that the private kept his
silence about his harassers because he feared the consequences of
the ``don't tell'' part of the policy that provides for expulsion
if a soldier's homosexuality becomes known. The trial showed that
Winchell, of Kansas City, Mo., had already had his rights violated
under the ``don't ask'' stricture as a sergeant had questioned him
about his sexuality and looked into his private life, despite
official prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was having fun,'' the sergeant responded, when asked
why he did not order his platoon members to cease their harassment
of Winchell.
</P>
<P>
   In the critical turn of events last July 3, the third dictum of
the administration's gay policy _ ``don't pursue'' _ came to haunt
Winchell. He knocked down his homophobic tormentor, Glover, of
Sulphur, Okla., and paid with his life 26 hours later as he slept.
</P>
<P>
   The murder case, which is drawing national attention to the base
as a lethal example of gays' dilemma with the military, will
conclude this week with the court-martial of the man accused of
being Glover's accomplice, 25-year-old Spc. Justin Fisher, of
Lincoln, Neb. Witnesses testified that Fisher provided Glover with
the bat and intense prodding for ``letting that faggot'' best him
in a fight.
</P>
<P>
   What the Army treated last summer as a slaying stemming from
youthful drunken violence finally evolved into something more
decisive as the court-martial slowly, obliquely accepted the
possibility of a homophobic hate crime in the ranks. In the charge
to the court, the presiding judge, Col. Gary Holland, allowed
Glover's record of repeated anti-gay epithets and threats, as
confirmed by barracks witnesses, to be weighed as a factor in
determining motive and guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's significant,'' said C. Dixon Osburn, co-executive
director of the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, a gay rights
group that monitors military justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He specifically cited that important point,'' said Osburn,
finding a glimmer of progress by the military as it wrestles with a
gay policy that has produced mainly controversy over the past six
years.
</P>
<P>
   In that time, the number of discharges of gay service members
increased to 1,149 in 1998 from 682 in 1993. There has been a
corresponding rise in harassment complaints to gay rights groups,
Osburn said, as gays either leave the service or suffer abuse
without complaint in fear of confirming their homosexuality and
being subject to expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of Glover underlined the fact that little came of
promises of heightened sensitivity toward gays made by the Clinton
administration in 1993, when the ``don't ask'' policy was
introduced. The trial underlined the fact that Army authorities did
not begin to hold sessions down the ranks on the gay policy until
after Winchell had been murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a former soldier who is gay told of the joke that one
of his superiors here made of a token sensitivity session. Javier
Torres, an Army private for two years before he quit, told the CBS
News program ``60 Minutes'' that his superior declared with evident
disgust: ``This is a meeting about fags. Don't bother them; they
won't bother you.''
</P>
<P>
   A critical moment in his decision to quit the Army, Torres said
in a segment of the program to be broadcast on Sunday, came when
his drill sergeant unapologetically bellowed a homophobic cadence
in leading his platoon on a five-mile run: ``Faggot, faggot down
the street/ Shoot him, shoot 'til he retreats.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the spit-and-polish of this post's celebrated unit, the
101st Airborne Division, the trial of Glover suggested a leadership
void in the off hours of the unmarried soldiers who were part of
Winchell's world. ``We watch TV, drink, just talk _ that's about
it,'' Pvt. Benjamin Boyer told the court in describing the
circumstances in which the taunting of Winchell flourished.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Glover defense team underscored the young soldier's routine
heavy drinking at night as a factor in the cruel behavior of some.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can find the larger life of this base encouraging for
its sense of normalcy, even as the trial of Glover laid bare a
jagged alternative. Glover's parents testified, keening at their
son's weakness in the face of peer pressure. ``Cal wants to belong
to something so bad,'' said his father, Rue Glover, sad-eyed before
the court, which sentenced his son to life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict, Winchell's anguished parents expressed pride
in their son's putting himself at risk as a patriotic serviceman.
But in a statement, the mother and stepfather, Pat and Wally
Kutteles, added, ``We never dreamed that he would be killed by
labeling, prejudice and hatred at home.''
</P>
<P>
   And they asked: ``Why did leaders turn a blind eye to the
excessive drinking occurring on base? Where was the supervision in
the barracks? Why were people allowed to taunt our son, hit our son
and harass our son?''
</P>
<P>
   Of the ``don't ask'' policy, they warned, ``It won't protect
anyone else's child.''
</P>
<P>
   The most mournful-looking figure in the trial audience was Cal
Addams, a performer known as Calpurnia, whom Winchell befriended in
Nashville, Tenn., and began dating last March. A former Navy medic,
Addams commented as a veteran of a gay's travails in the service.
``Barry had been looking his entire life, he told me, for a way to
feel comfortable with himself,'' Addams said after the murder. ``He
had only just begun to find that.''

CHECHENS SEE DANGER FOR THEIR HISTORY MADE OF STONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Hundreds of stone towers, some nearly 1,000 years old,
dot the jagged cliffs of the Caucasian mountain range in Chechnya.
One of the region's prized symbols, they have survived through
earthquakes, wars and the deportation of the Chechen people in
1944, but Chechens fear that the towers are now threatened by
Russian bombing in the region's second war in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how any of the towers can survive such bombing,''
said Lecha Ilyasov, 38, a philologist and photographer who lived in
Russia most of his life before returning to Chechnya two years ago
to document its culture.
</P>
<P>
   Ilyasov recently returned to Moscow _ leaving Grozny, Chechnya's
capital, through military checkpoints and police patrols _ to
attend a conference on the threat that the latest bombing poses to
Chechnya's culture.
</P>
<P>
   He came with two other members of the LAM Center for Research
and Popularization of Chechen Culture, a nongovernmental group. It
is supported by human rights advocates and the Andrei Sakharov
Museum and Public Center in Moscow, named for the Soviet dissident.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians are wary of Chechens; militants from the region
are widely suspected in the September apartment bombings that
killed nearly 300 people in Moscow and elsewhere. Like other
Chechens, Ilyasov said, he has been stopped and interrogated by
Moscow police.
</P>
<P>
   Even simply bringing photographs of the towers to Moscow for the
conference was not easy, he said. To escape possibly having the
pictures confiscated, he said he arranged for them to be smuggled
out of Chechnya by women, who are less likely to be stopped by
Russian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   To Chechens, the towers symbolize the close-knit clan traditions
and the aversion to outside control that are considered hallmarks
of their history. And Chechens fear that Russian forces may strike
at the towers now both because of their symbolic importance and
their possible use as a strategic redoubt for retreating Islamic
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The towers are very important to Chechen culture,'' said
Johanna Nichols, a professor at the University of California at
Berkeley who is an expert on Chechen language and culture. ``Every
clan in Chechnya traces its ancestry back to a mountain village
with a set of towers that belongs to that clan.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time there were thousands of towers, stretching from the
mountains to the plains and as far as the edge of Grozny. A wealth
of folklore and legend surrounds the structures; the first known
documented mention of them is in Arab manuscripts dating from the
10th century.
</P>
<P>
   They were originally built as multipurpose structures, housing
livestock and families and serving as lookout posts, and were
constructed to withstand even earthquakes, to which Chechnya is
prone.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that some of the Chechen towers were destroyed by
invading Mongols as far back as the 14th century. Five hundred
years later, during Russia's colonial wars in the Caucasus, czarist
soldiers destroyed still more.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet secret police also destroyed some towers. When the
police executed Stalin's order for wholesale deportation of the
Chechens to Central Asia in 1944 for allegedly collaborating with
the Germans, they feared that Chechens would take to the hills and
use the towers as strongholds from which to conduct guerrilla
warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Some Chechens did just that. The last die-hard, Chechen lore
says, climbed out of his lair in the late 1970s, a sick old man.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1994-96 war in Chechnya, Russian artillery and
airstrikes destroyed Russian cultural treasures: an old Orthodox
church as well as the main library in Grozny, named after Anton
Chekhov, and its nearly 3 million volumes, including rare Russian
books.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechens thus fear that the Russians will have no
inclination to hold back from destroying the towers during the
bombing now.
</P>
<P>
   The Argun gorge, where some rebels have already retreated, is
home to some of the oldest and most prized towers and a necropolis
of 50 crypts. And the region has reportedly come under ferocious
bombardment by Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Ilyasov said the rebels, too, have little interest in preserving
the towers, and are far more concerned with setting up a
fundamentalist Islamic state. The rebels object to pagan markings
on the towers, which were built hundreds of years before Chechens
were converted to Islam. Ilyasov said that after he made a film
about the necropolis, the Islamic militants threatened him and
denounced him for promoting pagan beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're against anything Chechen,'' he said. ``They say
everything must be purely Islamic and Arabic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ilyasov would like to see the towers added to the United Nations
list of the world's protected monuments, which he hopes would
increase international attention if they are bombed and might help
save them from attack. Preserving the towers, he said, would ``show
our young people what a great and civilized culture our forefathers
had.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A WOMAN SHOULD BE CALLING THE SHOTS FOR THE WOMEN'S
TEAM
</HEADLINE>
  (Replaces SOC-U.S.-OLYMPICS)  
(rk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having won the World Cup of soccer with a women's team, the
United States should now attempt to win an Olympic gold medal with
a woman as coach. The four candidates to replace Tony DiCicco, who
resigned last month to spend more time with his family, are his
assistant coaches, Lauren Gregg and Jay Hoffman, along with Clive
Charles of the University of Portland and Bobby Howe, who is
director of coaching for the U.S. Soccer Federation.
</P>
<P>
   If loyalty and merit were the only considerations, Gregg would
already have the job. At 39, she is the one coaching thread that
embroiders the long success of the American team. Her career
reflects the evolution of the women's game: a player on the first
NCAA championship team at North Carolina in 1982, an assistant
coach for the U.S. teams that won the 1991 and 1999 Women's World
Cups and the 1996 Olympic gold medal. She has given her life to
soccer and it is time for soccer to give something back by naming
her coach as the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia,
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support Lauren,'' DiCicco said. ``I think she gives us the
best chance of winning in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Howe has never coached women at the college or national level.
Hoffman has, but not as long as Gregg. Charles coached two of the
American stars, Tiffeny Milbrett and Shannon MacMillan, at
Portland, along with the top men's goalkeeper, Kasey Keller. But
his international record is unimpressive. While Gregg has twice
coached the Americans to victories in the Nordic Cup _ the
unofficial world championship for under-21 players _ Charles
finished no higher than third in three attempts. And he was part of
the biggest debacle in American soccer history, serving as
assistant coach for the men's 1998 World Cup squad that finished
last among 32 teams, sinking in the quicksand of finger-pointing
and ineptitude.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring Charles to run the women's team a year after such an
embarrassing collapse would be the soccer equivalent of hiring Ben
Johnson to run the Olympic drug-testing program.
</P>
<P>
   A coach is expected to be hired by Jan. 2, when the American
women leave for a pre-Olympic tour of Australia. The U.S. women's
team has never had a woman as head coach since it began play in
1985. Three coaches, three men. It is widely believed that Charles
has the job locked up and that the interviewing process is a
formality. That would be a mistake. Soccer is a game of passion,
but this is a decision that needs to be based on reason, not
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   The soccer federation, which is the national governing body, has
a mixed record in managing the women's team. On one hand, it treats
female players more professionally than any other federation in the
world. It held the 1999 World Cup in huge arenas, spent $3 million
on a training camp, provided a nanny and a sports psychologist and
even chartered a plane for the team for a cross-country flight
between the quarterfinals and the semifinals. But relations with
the women have often been tense and advances, even fruit and bagels
after practice, have come grudgingly.
</P>
<P>
   The players went on strike in late 1995, before the Atlanta
Olympics, when the federation proposed offering bonus money only
for a gold medal. Paltry bonuses were paid to the players for
winning the 1999 World Cup, the victory was coolly embraced and the
federation clumsily waited two months before offering to renew
DiCicco's contract.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed to treat the women in a paternalistic manner and
threatened to sue when they opted to play an indoor victory tour of
their own instead of participating in an outdoor world tour the
federation had planned. A cereal war erupted over whether players
could appear on boxes of the brand shaped like flakes or the one
shaped like soccer balls.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the federation has a right to protect its marketing
interests, but it should not take the hardball negotiating of the
women personally. This is the necessary transition of a sport that
was once amateur and is now professional. The women are bargaining
from strength. They are more successful and more popular than the
men, deservedly so. After earning next to nothing for so long, they
have the right to a bigger slice of the financial pie.
</P>
<P>
   The federation has no reason to resent their achievement or to
punish their assertiveness by hiring a coach from the outside and
cleaning house. The women's team gave American soccer legitimacy
and visibility. It should be embraced as a wind that can lift
everyone's sails.
</P>
<P>
   This is an inviting opportunity for the federation to disprove
the suspicion that it remains an old-boy network, and that a strong
British influence will result in the hiring of Charles because he,
too, is a Brit. Only two of the 16 teams in the Women's World Cup _
Germany and Sweden _ had women as coaches. The United States should
set the same example in providing diversity that it has set in
providing the world's best female players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not either/or; if the women get more, it doesn't mean the
men have to get less,'' said Lynn Berling-Manuel, publisher of
Soccer America, the country's leading weekly soccer publication,
who supports Gregg's candidacy. ``This is an opportunity for
women's soccer to push all of soccer along. It will attract
publicity. It will bring tremendous credibility for the women's
game to have a female in a leadership position. It will provide a
valuable role model.''
</P>
<P>
   A whisper campaign questions whether Gregg is tactically
proficient enough to be a head coach. The players are supposedly
wary of her consuming energy. She is too aggressive. She toots her
own horn. Berling-Manuel is right when she says that these are the
same vague, discriminatory murmurs that are often used in denying
jobs to women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gregg started the soccer program from scratch at the University
of Virginia in 1986 and took it to the Final Four in five years.
And since when do players hire the coach? They got along with her
well enough to win two world championships and an Olympic gold
medal. Gregg has been instrumental in building the world's top
system and she offers the best hope for continued success. With the
next Women's World Cup moved up from 2003 to 2002, it is even more
urgent that continuity be maintained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned that whoever comes in is going to start
rebuilding now and throw away the Olympics,'' DiCicco said. ``You
can't throw it away with all the hype and all the attention NBC is
going to pay. Whoever takes over should try to improve the team.
That might mean some changes, but not wholesale changes. Let's see
if we can win another gold medal. Lauren offers the best chance to
keep the championship team together and winning.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg was indispensable to the American success last July as the
team's tactical analyst, chief scout and video expert. She spotted
a weakness in Nigeria's defense of free kicks, and American goals
rang up like a gas pump in a 7-1 victory. Expecting to play China
in the final, she logged every corner kick and free kick the
Chinese players had taken during the tournament. She knew which
foot they preferred, which teammate they most often passed to,
whether their kicks swung inward or outward. She helped design the
roach-motel defense that funneled China's attack inside and did not
let it back out.
</P>
<P>
   She recorded nearly every penalty kick the Americans rehearsed
in the six months leading to the World Cup, noting whether the kick
was accurate, whether it missed, whether it was high or low, placed
to the left or the right, whether it was struck with confidence.
She drew up the list of shooters for the penalty kick finale. Five
kicks, five goals. She recognized soccer as a player's game, but
she also believed that little should be left to chance.
</P>
<P>
   The soccer federation should feel the same. The best way to
achieve Olympic success is an orderly transition from DiCicco to
Gregg. Dr. Robert Contigulia, president of the federation, did the
right thing in 1998 by giving Bruce Arena, an American, the chance
to coach the American men. He should do the right thing again by
giving a woman the chance to coach the American women.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the politically correct thing to do, just the correct
thing. &QL;

CONGO LEADER PROMISES COOPERATION WITH MEDIATOR IN CIVIL WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Congo President Laurent Kabila said Saturday in
talks with Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. representative at the United
Nations, that he would be willing to work with an African mediator
to find a political settlement to the civil war in his country,
which still rages despite a July peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, speaking from Kinshasa before returning to New York
after a two-week tour of 10 African nations, said it was necessary
to view any commitment with caution in a civil war that has
restarted several times in recent years and has drawn in half a
dozen nations on one side or the other. But he said all sides and
their supporters now appeared ready to discuss a political solution
under the auspices of the Organization of African Unity, which has
so far failed to appoint an envoy called for in the July agreement.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and African diplomats said a leading candidate for the job
has finally emerged. He is Sir Ketumile Masire, a former president
of Botswana. Africans had hoped to appoint former South African
President Nelson Mandela, but relations between Mandela and Kabila
are not good. Mandela has instead taken on the task of trying to
settle a civil conflict in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who spoke for two hours Saturday with Kabila, met
Friday in Kampala, the Ugandan capital, with Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni and leaders of the three main rebel factions
fighting in eastern Congo. Earlier on the trip, Holbrooke discussed
the Congo war with officials in Angola, Zimbabwe, Zambia and other
countries that have supplied the sides with troops, money or
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the parties we talked to blamed the other parties,''
Holbrooke said. ``I told them we're not running a court of inquiry.
We just want to get moving, get the United Nations in the field
with military observers and peacekeepers.''
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. liaison mission is now stuck in Kinshasa, unable to
operate. This situation fits a pattern in relations with Kabila,
who agrees to an international operation and then in effect
prevents it from doing its job. A U.N. human rights investigation
into allegations that troops loyal to Kabila killed thousands of
refugees from Rwanda in an earlier round of the civil war in
1996-97 stalled for months and finally gave up more than a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who will take over as Security Council president in
January, said he planned to hold open meetings on wars in Angola,
Congo and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States, this administration, is committed to help
in the region,'' he said. ``But we are not going to go in blindly
with a United Nations peacekeeping operation just to make it look
as if we're doing something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has asked for nor is anyone expecting American
troops,'' he said. ``Still, we pay 25 percent of the costs, and
Congress has to approve missions we pay for. We want to get this
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said that he and Susan Rice, assistant secretary of
state for Africa, who is traveling with him, will recommend to
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that Howard Wolpe, President
Clinton's special envoy for Africa, return to the region this week
to follow up on developments in Congo and elsewhere. Wolpe was
formerly chairman of the House foreign relations subcommittee on
Africa.

<P>
   YELLOW SPRINGS, Ohio _ Antioch College abolished football 70
years ago, but on Friday students celebrated homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   The game was rugby. The players were women. The ``home'' field
belongs to the high school down the road. The homecoming ``king,''
18-year-old Kate Donnelly, wore a strapless pink number she picked
up at a church tag sale for $2, and was crowned with a wreath
borrowed from the Christmas display at a nearby gas station.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of hard to facilitate traditions,'' said Kevin
Franck, 21, a sociology major from Annapolis, Md., who had
appointed himself last year's homecoming king and donned a feather
boa. ``We're trying to pretend we've had it all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Things have always been a little off-center at Antioch, and so
it is with the iconoclastic campus's flirtation this fall with
intercollegiate athletics.
</P>
<P>
   What started as a lark with an experimental physical education
class has become a dominant activity at the liberal arts college of
650 students _ on Friday, more than 100 people braved bitter winds,
cheering and screaming as their team lost 19-0 to the University of
Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   The college has spent at least $4,000 buying jerseys and socks
and cleats and balls for a sport that is exploding in popularity
across campuses but typically draws little attention or support
from administrators.
</P>
<P>
   A place notorious for taking itself too seriously is having
serious fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community was searching for celebratory ritual,'' said Bob
Devine, the college president, in an effort to explain the
phenomenon. ``Antioch doesn't think in school-spirit terms.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a place where Melinda Kanner, associate professor of
anthropology and now rugby coach, had to ask the archivist to
research the school colors (blue and gold). Nobody knows the alma
mater. There remains much confusion over the mascot: Letterman's
jackets in the bookstore say ``Antioch Radicals'' on the back;
history points to the Bluejackets, probably named for Union
soldiers in the Civil War; Ms. Kanner backs ``Barbarians'' and some
have suggested an even more esoteric name, the ``Antioch Other.''
</P>
<P>
   But what at first seems thick with irony might just make perfect
sense.
</P>
<P>
   Antioch, which was founded in 1852 and has long been a beacon of
racial and gender equality, ahead of its time politically, proudly
offers an ``alternative'' education in which what is normally on
the margins is placed at the center.
</P>
<P>
   Many see rugby, a brutal sport played without padding and
dependent on teamwork, as a metaphor for the college's system of
governance, in which the students sit on every important committee
and the entire community is invited to weekly open meetings that
often become verbal battlegrounds.
</P>
<P>
   It seems fitting for a place that uses narrative evaluations
instead of grades that a touchdown in rugby is called a try.
Rugby's reputation as a haven for gay women makes sense on a campus
where students say lesbians are the dominant culture.
</P>
<P>
   Women's rugby ``absolutely challenges, at its core, all the
cultural notions and assumptions that we have about gender, body,
power, sex,'' said Mary Jo Kane, the director of the University of
Minnesota's Tucker Research Center on Girls and Women in Sport.
``That's what's fun about it, but why it's also most marginalized
and trivialized, because it causes the most threat.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rugby historians have uncovered evidence of secret schoolgirl
matches in England as far back as 1913, but American women have
only been playing the sport for about 20 years. The number of
college teams has more than doubled to 272 this year from 129 in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kanner, a lifelong athlete, sees team sports as essential to
a liberal education. ``It's about organization; it's about
self-discipline; it's about testing their own limits,'' she
explained.
</P>
<P>
   The intellectual approach is apparent in the team huddle before
kickoff, as the women shout: ``Superior-Mental-Organization!''
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the team's 18 players had ever touched a rugby ball
before. Some, like Nadine Alonzo, had played soccer or other
sports, but like this one better. ``I used to get red-carded all
the time for hurting people,'' said Ms. Alonzo, a 19-year-old
sophomore from Manhasset, N.Y. ``Now I'm supposed to hurt people.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Leilah Weinraub, a first-year student from Los
Angeles, are part of a team for the first time. ``Usually I try to
fend for myself, think for myself, rely on my own facilities _ it's
still hard for me to think in terms of other people,'' said Ms.
Weinraub, 19. ``It's totally weird to be a jock all of a sudden.
After the game, people high-five you, they give you beers, they
want to give you advice. It's like, what? I'm talking about
sports?''
</P>
<P>
   It has been an education for the fans as well. Clueless about
the rules, they cheer sometimes when the other team scores. Their
chants are of the ``hey, hey, ho, ho'' variety, adapted from years
of political protests. In a riff on Antioch's infamous policy in
which people are required to obtain verbal consent before any
sexual contact, one student carries a hand-lettered sign, ``Ask
Before You Ruck'' (``ruck'' is a rugby tackling formation).
</P>
<P>
   In an institution that has spent much of its history on the
brink of bankruptcy (it even filed once) and is often riven by
politics, this is the first time in recent memory that people have
come together not to ponder problems but to do something positive.
Dissident alumni are withholding donations to protest the college's
relationship with other Antioch campuses, established in the 1970s,
and some are concerned that the co-op program, in which students
alternate semesters of study and work, is losing its cache.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth noting that football, and all varsity sports, died
not because of lack of interest but because students thought it an
undemocratic, warlike symbol of the imperialist establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of people that come here weren't the jocks or the
preppy people in high school,'' said Shannon McCarville, 20, the
team kicker. ``They were the people that got teased by them.''
</P>
<P>
   Students and faculty agree that if it were football, it would
never fly. But there is already some buzz about co-ed basketball,
with pickup players wondering whether they, too, might get some
snazzy uniforms.

   Two's a Challenge, But Seven's a Crowd
</P>
<P>
   For months, the morning line on next year's Senate race in
Pennsylvania has been that Republican incumbent Rick Santorum
should be one of the easiest targets for Democrats in their battle
to recapture the Senate. He is a conservative in a state that
typically elects moderates, his 1994 margin of victory was a flimsy
2 points and he has since struggled to raise his poll numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Democrats think Santorum is so vulnerable that no fewer
than seven _ so far _ are competing for the right to take him on.
</P>
<P>
   And that's turning out to be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, when the Democratic State Committee gathered in
Harrisburg, six of the contenders showed up to work the corridors
and caucuses in search of support. That struck many committee
members as perhaps too much of a good thing and they have since
begun to push the thought that perhaps it would be better,
politically, if some candidates dropped out, lest the party end up
badly battering itself in a divisive, money-devouring primary next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Not one of the seven contenders is widely known throughout the
state, and some face serious campaign money problems. The one with
the best chance to be nominated and go on to beat Santorum, many
Democratic leaders think, is Rep. Ron Klink, who hails from the
Pittsburgh area.
</P>
<P>
   The most visible of the other candidates, all from the
Philadelphia area, are former state Labor Commissioner Tom Foley,
former U.S. Reps. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and Peter Kostmayer,
and state Sen. Allyson Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   As Klink's supporters see it, in a nomination fight he would
have his base area in western Pennsylvania mostly to himself
whereas his main competitors would be scrapping for _ and
splintering _ the vote in their base area in eastern Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   As the fall contest nominee, the Klink supporters go on, Klink,
who tends to vote liberal on economic issues and conservative on
social issues, would be ideally positioned not only to go for the
state's big centrist vote but also to steal some of Senator
Santorum's conservative base.
</P>
<P>
   An analyst, Charles E. Cook Jr., wrote recently in the Cook
Political Report that if that reasoning was correct, then ``the
question is, who is running second and third in the primary field
and how long will it take before the field becomes more
manageable?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Santorum is vulnerable,'' Cook said. ``But Democrats have a
long way to go before they can take advantage of that
vulnerability.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes Uses Highway As a Political Wedge
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes has long argued that he is a more implacable foe of
abortion than Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and therefore more
deserving of the Republican presidential nomination. And now as
part of his campaign pitch, he insists he has proof.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he said, the governor signed a bill that named a
stretch of Texas highway for a Houston doctor, John B. Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, Forbes said, performed abortions and was frequently a
target of anti-abortion protesters.
</P>
<P>
   No other governor anywhere has ever allowed a public highway or
public building to be named for someone who performed abortions,
Forbes says. The governor's signature on the Texas bill, he
contends, ``raises questions about his commitment to the pro-life
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush insists he is as opposed to abortion as any candidate. His
office says the highway bill was meant to honor Coleman because he
was a leading force in Texas for better schools and colleges for
blacks and because his son, Garnet, is a Texas state
representative.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is not convinced. He says the governor should ``rename
the highway immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   A Battle to Control The Reform Party
</P>
<P>
   Donald Trump and Pat Buchanan are getting all the headlines when
it comes to coverage of the Reform Party. But while they squabble
over who should be the party's presidential nominee, another
squabble has broken out within the party that ultimately could
prove to be more serious.
</P>
<P>
   Top leaders can't agree on where to hold the party's nominating
convention next August.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, the party's departing chairman, Russ Verney
of Dallas, and the party's chairman-elect, Jack Gargan of Cedar
Key, Fla., can't agree. They are in the middle of a civil war that
threatens to rip the party in half and disrupt its nominating
process.
</P>
<P>
   Even more to the point, Ross Perot and Jesse Ventura can't agree
where to hold the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Verney is the closest political confidant of Perot, the party's
founder. Gargan is a confidant of Ventura, the governor of
Minnesota, the Reform party's highest elected officeholder and the
power behind the coup last summer that saw Gargan win the party
chairman's job.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Verney and Gargan are proxies in a power
struggle between the Texan who has twice run for president on the
Reform ticket and has not ruled out a third run next year, and an
upstart former professional wrestler who says that one day he might
run for president on the Reform ticket, but not in Election 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This is not about Buchanan, who has some Perot allies, or Trump,
who is close to Ventura. This is about control of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Verney did not seek re-election as Reform chairman at last
summer's national party convention, saying it was time to let
someone else serve. But he was the most outspoken backer of the
candidate whom Gargan beat with a contention that Verney and Perot
had run things for too long.
</P>
<P>
   Verney is scheduled to leave office Jan. 1. However, he is
keeping busy as a lame-duck chairman _ too busy for Gargan.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, in September he persuaded the party's 11-member
national executive committee to choose California for next year's
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Gargan and other Ventura allies argued that the site should be
more central, perhaps in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   No way, Verney said. And he had the votes to back that up.
</P>
<P>
   But last week the Ventura forces struck back.
</P>
<P>
   Gargan and other close allies of the governor persuaded the
party's 143-member national committee to overturn the vote of the
smaller executive committee and move the convention site to
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   '`Totally and completely a fraud,'' Verney protested, saying no
one had bothered to notify him that a vote was being held.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will of the members,'' countered Gargan.
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned.

   The Fordice Saga Comes to a Close
</P>
<P>
   And now for our final chapter of the Fordice Saga ...
</P>
<P>
   When last we visited the unhappy Mississippi couple, the
governor, Kirk, was having trouble persuading Pat, his wife of 45
years, to decamp the Executive Mansion in Jackson and grant him a
divorce so he could marry Ann Creson, a high school sweetheart.
Mrs. Fordice was particularly miffed, as were many Mississippi
voters, because the governor, an outspoken advocate of ``strong
family values,'' was publicly squiring Ms. Creson around.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes word that Pat Fordice has relented and irreconcilable
differences have been reconciled _ more or less. Mrs. Fordice has
negotiated herself ``a very favorable agreement,'' her lawyer said,
and is headed for a new life in a new home.
</P>
<P>
   As for Kirk Fordice, he leaves office in January and wedding
bells are expected to chime about Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the papers in the case have been sealed by the court.
</P>
<P>
   End of saga.

   KAVKAZ CHECKPOINT, Russia _ A top commander of Russian forces in
Chechnya said Saturday that the Russian military was determined to
destroy the Islamic militants in Grozny by the end of the winter,
signaling that while the Russians have backed off from threats to
bombard the Chechen capital this weekend, they still seek an early
and decisive victory over the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't allow them to survive the winter,'' Maj. Gen.
Vladimir A. Shamanov, who commands the Western Group of Russian
Forces, said of the rebel force in Grozny, a city that was heavily
hit in the 1994-96 war in Chechnya and whose marketplace has been
reduced to rubble by the current bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   The comments came as politicians in the administration of
President Boris Yeltsin have begun to advertise their willingness
to negotiate with the leaders of the breakaway Chechen republic.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow, however, has not relaxed its tough demands, including
the stipulation that the Chechen authorities hand over Shamil
Basayev, the Chechen warlord who led an offensive against Dagestan
in August in an abortive avowed effort to create a new Islamic
state.
</P>
<P>
   The mention of negotiations appears intended, at least in part,
to mollify Western governments worried about civilians caught up in
the fighting. And while Russian politicians talk about negotiating,
Russian forces continue to gain ground.
</P>
<P>
   The main focus is on Grozny, which is surrounded by Russian
troops. Early last week, the Russian military spurred an
international outcry by dropping thousands of leaflets in the
besieged Chechen capital urging the unknown number of civilians
there to leave by Saturday or risk terrifying bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military quickly backed away from the ultimatum. But
it has not changed its overall strategy: seizing Grozny and chasing
the remnants of the Chechen rebel force and its core of Islamic
militants into the mountains near Georgia, Chechnya's southern
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Shamanov is one of the leading architects of Russia's military
campaign in Chechnya and a hawk on the Chechen question. He met
with a small group of reporters at a checkpoint at the border
between the Chechen republic and Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He is a popular figure in the army and said last month that he
would rip the epaulets off his uniform in protest if the military
is stopped from completing its campaign in Chechnya. He has
described the 1994-1996 war as a betrayal. He was recently
hospitalized with exhaustion, but appeared vigorous Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the current war, Shamanov's force entered Chechnya from
Ingushetia, driving to the Argun river to link up with the Eastern
Group. That link effectively blocked Grozny and separated Chechnya
into two theaters: Grozny, and the settlements to the south that
stretch to the mountainous border with Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, cars and buses of Chechen refugees shuttled back
and forth across the border. About 79,000 Chechen refugees have
fled to Ingushetia through this checkpoint, but about 56,000 have
since returned, according to Col. Anatoly N. Khrulyov, the
commander of the Kavkaz checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers would suggest that conditions are rough in the
refugee camps in Ingushetia, and that many people feel the
situation in Chechnya may be stable enough _ under Russian control
_ to return. The colonel added, however, that some refugees do
appear afraid to go back to Chechnya until it is clear who is in
charge in the breakaway region, where the 1994-96 war ended with an
agreement only to leave its status _ officially that of a Russian
republic _ in limbo until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   There still appears to be much fighting ahead, however,
particularly over Grozny. Shamanov said that the city remains a
strategic objective, not because it is the Chechen capital but
because several thousand rebels are believed to have taken refuge
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grozny is not gold,'' he said. ``Our task is to destroy the
organized resistance of the bandits and terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the thousands of civilians in Grozny, however, has
complicated that task. Nobody knows for sure how many people reside
in Grozny. Shamanov estimated that there were up to 7,000 civilians
in the city, but Nikolai Koshman, Russia's deputy prime minister
for Chechnya, has said there may be as many as 50,000. Grozny was
home to almost 400,000 people in the 1980s. A large but unknown
number of its residents have left since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the Russian military hoped to scare residents in
Grozny to leave by issuing its ultimatum. Now, it has dropped its
explicit threats and has sought instead to expedite the evacuation
of the city.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A corridor for refugees has been established leading north from
the city through the town of Pervomaiskaya and a new corridor was
inaugurated Saturday that leads south to Alkhan-Yurt. Alkhan-Yurt
lies on a major highway that crossed the Caucasus, and a checkpoint
there to process refugees was opened Saturday with great fanfare by
Sergei Shoigu, Russia's minister for emergency situations and a
leading politician in next weekend's parliamentary elections in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage civilians to leave, the Russian military has not
bombed Grozny for five or six days and it has promised not to bomb
the corridors. Only a trickle of refugees has crossed through the
northern checkpoint, and no refugees appeared Saturday in
Alkhan-Yurt, probably because there was no prior notification in
Grozny that it was being established.
</P>
<P>
   Shoigu also said he wants to negotiate with Aslan Maskhadov, the
president of the Chechen republic, to help the exodus of civilians
from Grozny. He said he sought to call Maskhadov during his visit
to Alkhan-Yurt to open the talks. Maskhadov, however, could not be
reached.
</P>
<P>
   Shoigu's statement followed the announcement on Friday by Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin that he had held previously unpublicized
negotiations with unnamed officials from Maskhadov's government.
Putin reiterated _ as Russian leaders have since the start of this
conflict _ that Chechen leaders would have to renounce terrorism,
secure the release of hundreds of foreigners and Russians held
hostage, and hand over those the Russian authorities blame for the
bombing of apartment buildings that killed nearly 300 people this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Shamanov said he saw little point in negotiating with Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the point of talking to him?'' Shamanov said
contemptuously. ``He is a man who does not rule anybody or
anything, and there is nothing to talk to him about.''
</P>
<P>
   Shamanov declined to say precisely how long the Russian military
would wait before resuming its bombardment of Grozny, but he said
there would be no bombing attacks there ``in the near future.''

SPORTS COLUMN: TRUMP WAS A FRONT-ROW WITNESS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Donald Trump was sitting in the front row when Stephan Johnson
slumped into a coma. The fight was held in the Trump Taj Mahal, the
hotel casino that bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love boxing, but it's a dangerous sport,'' Trump said,
shortly after Tuesday's memorial service for Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Trump always has the best seat in the house, particularly when
he owns the building. His head never moves with the ball at tennis
matches because he is preoccupied scanning the audience, but he
says boxing compels him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the essence of competition,'' Trump said. `It's one on
one. In boxing, you can't blame the team because the guard didn't
pull in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an alpha-male attraction to boxing that makes it hard
to control, which is why boxers with marginal CAT scan results like
Stephan Johnson are suspended in the diligent province of Ontario
but licensed in the complaisant state of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Even some public officials of discernible conscience like John
McCain and Mario Cuomo show a fascination with boxing, which is why
it is always on the verge of being ``reformed'' rather than
abolished as a bloody relic from a savage past.
</P>
<P>
   The grisly business is also good for hotels and casinos in
outposts like Atlantic City and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing and gaming have always gone hand in hand,'' Trump said
the other day, declining to put a dollar sign on how much a big
fight card is worth.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, a human being has died, almost literally in front
of Donald Trump's eyes. Stephan Johnson died last Sunday after 15
days in the hospital, but his life was more or less over when he
crumpled in the ring a few feet from the owner of the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   From a 10-minute telephone interview it is difficult to judge
just how shaken Trump really is, but the tenor of his conversation
was sober, without any of the grandiose asides for which he is
famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terrible,'' Trump said. ``He was comporting himself
very well, and he may even have been winning, but then he went down
and he didn't even move. A lot of people didn't see the punch. He
just went right out.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump continued: ``I've seen a lot of fights. The Golota-Grant
fight that night was murderous, but it wasn't as good as this one.
I've seen fights where the fighter goes down and they help him to
the dressing room and then he collapses, but I've never seen a
fighter carried out of the ring like that.''
</P>
<P>
   There is always a first time. Now that he has seen another human
being suffer irreparable brain damage in front of his eyes, does
Trump have any second thoughts about being in the boxing business?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand that we do not sanction the fights,''
Trump said. ``That is done by the New Jersey State Athletic Control
Commission. All we are is the venue _ and fighting is popular.
Every fight sells out. We have other things like gymnastics; they
don't sell out. All I know is, boxing sells out.''
</P>
<P>
   If he wanted, Trump could get out of the boxing business, could
end his alliances with the shady officials in New Jersey, some of
whom are already under serious investigation for corruption, as
well as promoters like Don King, who need no introduction.
</P>
<P>
   As a moral gesture, has Trump considered his own personal
abolition of boxing?
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I went to the Wharton School for Finance,'' Trump said.
``If boxers went to the Wharton School, they would be at a
disadvantage in boxing. Let's face it: Tough kids are the best
fighters. The nicest environment they know is the ring. What would
they be without boxing?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it was suggested, many of them would be healthier in their
old age, and some would live to old age. But Trump said boxing was
a way of overcoming poverty and worse violence, adding:
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the old story about the boxer after a fight who said:
`That wasn't so tough. What was really tough was my father hitting
me on the head with a hammer.'''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Trump is supplying the figurative hammers for two
men to use on each other. He is joined in this cruel deal by the
suave executives at HBO and the slick proprietors of venues like
Madison Square Garden and now Radio City Music Hall, who sell
tickets for humans knocking each other senseless. And they are
enabled by governors like Christie Whitman of New Jersey and George
Pataki of New York who are not yet sufficiently horrified at the
carnage.
</P>
<P>
   Not even death is a goad to change. Trump said ``we are working
on something'' as a benefit for the Johnson family, and his
organization did house the Johnson family while the fighter
lingered in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Now life goes on. The buses rumble down the parkway bearing old
people from rest homes with dollars in their pockets for the slot
machines. And the big rollers arrive in limousines for a boxing
match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate what happened,'' Trump said. ``It's something you have
to get through. I think boxing is an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases, the boxing ring is better than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Would he go back soon to a boxing match?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something I relish,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing goes on. Men continue to hit each other in the head in
buildings with the name Trump on them.  &QL;

RICK DANKO, 56, A GROUNDBREAKER WITH THE BAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rick Danko, a singer and bass player in The Band, revered as one
of the most important rock acts of the 1960s and '70s for its work
with Bob Dylan and its first albums as a group, died Dec. 10 at his
home in Marbletown, N.Y. He was 56.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was unknown, said Dr. Walter Dobushak, the Ulster
County medical examiner. He said an autopsy was planned.
</P>
<P>
   Danko, who was born in Ontario, left high school at 14 to pursue
a career in rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   His break came when he was hired three years later by Ronnie
Hawkins, a rockabilly pioneer with a ferocious stage show, to
replace the bassist in his backing band, the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   Danko met Levon Helm, the senior member of the Hawks and, like
Hawkins, a native of Arkansas, along with three Canadian musicians,
Garth Hudson, Robbie Robertson and Richard Manuel.
</P>
<P>
   They left Hawkins in 1963 to tour on their own, mining the roots
of American music under group names like Levon and the Hawks, the
Crackers and the Canadian Squires.
</P>
<P>
   After performing on recording sessions for the blues guitarist
and singer John Hammond Jr., the group was introduced to Bob Dylan
by Hammond, whose father had signed Dylan to his first recording
contract.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965 and 1966, the Band toured with Dylan as he was making
his transition from acoustic folk to electric music, enduring boos
and catcalls from folk purists who disapproved of Dylan's emerging
style.
</P>
<P>
   After Dylan was injured in a motorcycle accident, they spent
seven months making music with him in the house known as ``Big
Pink,'' which Danko and two other Band members had rented near
Woodstock, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 100-plus songs they recorded there became part of
one of rock music's most legendary bootlegs, known as ``Great White
Wonder'' for its plain packaging. The material, in modified form,
was officially released years later on Columbia as ``The Basement
Tapes.''
</P>
<P>
   After these recordings, the Band emerged with its first two
albums, ``Music From Big Pink'' and ``The Band,'' which rank among
rock's seminal recordings. The Band reached into the heart of
American music and came out with ready-made classics like ``The
Weight'' and ``Up on Cripple Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   The group reunited with Dylan in the mid-1970s, documenting its
tours with the live album ``Before the Flood'' before breaking up
in 1976 with a blowout Thanksgiving concert at the Winterland
Ballroom in San Francisco. In addition to performances by Dylan,
Eric Clapton, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell and Van Morrison, the
concert featured a reunion with Hawkins. The concert was documented
in a film by Martin Scorsese, ``The Last Waltz,'' and a
three-record set.
</P>
<P>
   While a member of the Band, Danko appeared on albums by Todd
Rundgren (``Runt''), Neil Young (``On the Beach'') and Clapton
(``No Reason to Cry''). After leaving, he recorded a series of solo
albums, the first of which was ``Rick Danko.''
</P>
<P>
   The Band, which was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame
five years ago, has had several reunions. During a tour in 1986,
Manuel hanged himself during a stop in Florida. In 1997, Danko was
arrested for receiving a package of heroin mailed to him in Japan.
He was convicted and received a two-and-a-half-year suspended
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Danko appeared on albums by the Indigo Girls and Mark
Fromm. He also released his first solo album in 10 years, ``Live on
Breeze Hill,'' profits from which were donated to Greenpeace. He
had been on tour this month, and was at home resting and conducting
interviews to promote the new album.

A CHANGE IS AT HAND AMONG RECEIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the 1985 National Football League season, and in Chicago,
they were doing a shuffle to the Super Bowl. Bo Jackson was a
first-round pick and Earl Campbell was about to retire. The Jets'
Kenny O'Brien was the highest-rated passer in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Kosar was arriving in Cleveland, as Mark Bavaro was
coming to the Giants. There was no NFL team in Arizona, but two in
Los Angeles: the Raiders and the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   In pro football years, it was a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   Consider then that the 1985 season was also the last time a wide
receiver named Rice, Irvin or Moore did not finish ranked among the
NFL's top 10 in either catches or receiving yards.
</P>
<P>
   And now, 14 years later, it appears that streak will end.
Michael Irvin and Herman Moore have missed much of the season with
injuries, and Jerry Rice, while still proficient, is well outside
the top 10. But just as Rice supplanted an established veteran like
Art Monk and Irvin supplanted Al Toon, Drew Hill or Gary Clark, in
1999 there are new names in the top 10 roll call of the NFL's best
receivers. They are Marvin Harrison, Germane Crowell, Jimmy Smith,
Muhsin Muhammad and Isaac Bruce.
</P>
<P>
   It is a changing of the guard, an ascent of a new breed of
receivers: big and small, physical and quick. Or best of all: big,
physical and quick.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the catalog of the league's elite receivers is more
than a kiddie corps. There are some familiar names with a seasoned
resumes, like Cris Carter or Tim Brown, who are each in the top
five in catches and yards this season. Moore, who is only 30, is
returning to the Lions.
</P>
<P>
   But the shift is dramatic leaguewide.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: even the Giants, who have not had a Pro Bowl
receiver in 31 years, have got into the act. Amani Toomer, 25, and
Ike Hilliard, 23, are each on a pace to have 1,000 receiving yards.
The Giants, in their 75th season, have never before had two
1,000-yard receivers.
</P>
<P>
   The standout of the youth movement at wide receiver is the
Indianapolis Colts' Marvin Harrison, who leads the NFL with 12
touchdown receptions and 1,239 receiving yards. His 82 receptions
are second only to the Jacksonville Jaguars' Jimmy Smith, the
two-time Pro Bowler who has 85 catches.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, 27, is only 6 feet and 181 pounds, but like Rice, he
is relentless about preparing for each new opponent. His teammates
call him Meticulous Marvin.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison's routes are precise, and he creates separation from
defenders with his acceleration after the pass is thrown, a skill
that defensive backs call ``sneaky quick.'' It matters more than a
receiver's 40-yard dash time.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, in what many saw as a coming-of-age victory for the
young Colts, the Miami Dolphins' skilled defense focused on holding
down Harrison and succeeded for most of the first three quarters.
As the Colts attempted one final last-minute drive, nothing had
changed in the Miami defensive huddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 30 seconds to go and the mood was `Stop 88,'''
Dolphins cornerback Sam Madison said, referring to Harrison's
jersey number.
</P>
<P>
   Madison's post-game analysis was different. ``We didn't stop
him,'' he said. ``It was almost like he had been setting us up. At
crunch time, he just ran away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison caught two passes for 34 yards in that final drive,
putting the Colts in position for the game-winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of comparisons made about me to other
receivers from other years,'' Harrison said last week. ``It's nice,
but that kind of status is more of a goal than a reality. Those
guys have done it for many years. I am just beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   But what a beginning. In the midst of his fourth season,
Harrison already has 278 career receptions, which is more than Rice
had in his first four seasons. Harrison still has four games left
this year and played on a team that combined for only six victories
in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He is hardly the only new name helping to create the feel of a
generational shift at the wide receiver position.
</P>
<P>
   As Toomer said: ``I watch television on Sunday nights and
they'll put the day's 100-yard receivers on the crawl at the bottom
of the screen. You see all these different names you're not used to
seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Names like that of Crowell of Detroit, a 23-year-old,
second-year player, who in his last five games alone has 33 catches
for 630 yards with 4 touchdowns. Crowell, who has 1,035 receiving
yards this season, may have the whole package scouts look for. He
is fast and big at 6-3 and 220 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Crowell, who reads from the Book of Psalms in the final minutes
before a game, was drafted in the second round last year, five
spots before the Giants' slumping wide receiver Joe Jurevicius.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' Bruce, 27, has 11 touchdown catches and is hardly
unknown, since he was the league's second-ranked receiver in 1995
and a Pro Bowl choice in 1996. No one in the history of the NFL has
caught more passes in his first three seasons than Bruce, who had
224. But at 27, he is still pulling away, and maybe a better
all-round receiver.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the Jets' Keyshawn Johnson, who is 27; Smith, the
elder statesman of the younger crew at age 30 who is also first in
receptions and second in receiving yards this year; and Minnesota's
22-year-old Randy Moss, who, like Crowell, has speed and size at
6-4, 200 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Two other big receivers who rank among the league's elite are
Carolina's Muhammad, 26, who is 6-2 and 217 pounds, and Chicago's
Marcus Robinson, 24, who is 6-3, 215 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be no consensus among NFL general managers about
what has brought about the emergence of a new class of receivers,
except the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change of guard is happening because it's time,'' Giants
general manager Ernie Accorsi said. ``We've got younger guys
catching up on older guys. I do see a trend in the game: you've
either got big receivers or little guys who can run fast. Your
first choice is to have both in one guy, but if you can't find
that, you try to get a speed guy and a big guy because the league
is going to littler cornerbacks and if you have a big guy, you have
a tremendous advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   As the game becomes more pass-happy, with most new rules
favoring an offense that throws the football, there are also more
good, big athletes becoming wide receivers early in their football
careers. Even at the high school level, the glamour isn't reserved
just for quarterbacks and running backs. College programs have
helped the cause, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``More colleges run pro-style offenses,'' said the Colts'
president, Bill Polian, who drafted Harrison and Buffalo's Andre
Reed, a top receiver since the late 1980s. ``So receivers come out
a little more ready or schooled in what will work for them in the
NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   It all adds up to a new pass-catching order, one, temporarily at
least, without Rice, Irvin or Moore. But new guys have a long way
to go to draw equal historically.
</P>
<P>
   For example, once Rice did crack the league's top 10 for the
first time in 1986, finishing second in catches and leading the
league in receiving yards, he remained among the top five in at
least one of those two categories _ and almost always both _ during
each of the next 10 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   That is what you call having some catching up to do.  &QL;

   Forty students from 28 colleges and universities have won this
year's Marshall Scholarships, which pay for American students to
continue their studies for two or three years at British
universities.
</P>
<P>
   Worth about $50,000 over two years, the scholarships will cover

SPORTS COLUMN: GESTURING BY ATHLETES: THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE
UGLY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

   The psychiatrist says the throat-slashing gestures in pro
football may be a positive force, offering vicarious satisfaction
to fans and sublimating the players' desire to really hurt someone.
The psychologist says the gestures are symptomatic of something
much darker and more complicated than end zone posturing: Players
are acting out the projections of an angry America.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hard gesture to interpret beyond the obvious
in-your-face, I'm-the-man message. Why is it necessary for some of
the country's richest, best-looking and most admired young men to
signify themselves with what seems to be a cheesy, adolescent,
retrograde symbol? Isn't scoring a touchdown enough? When did
winning become empty? Whatever happened to cool? Analyze that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me give you the superego argument,'' said Dr. Thomas J.
Ferraro, a Long Island psychologist who works with athletes,
particularly golfers. ``The country is freer, but there's more
aggression and fans are bored with overcontrolled, no-risk work.
They look to sports for explosive excitement. They throw snowballs
and batteries because they don't have a sense of justice,
self-love, guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players, narcissistic and lacking in identity, reflect the
fans' anger. There's no authority for them anymore. They ignore
Fassell and Parcells and Valentine. Joe Torre is an aberration. How
can a coach have authority in a time when `Married ... With
Children' has replaced `Father Knows Best'?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Howard Katz, a Boston psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, thinks
that ``while sports serves as an outlet for aggressive energy, the
important question is: When does it go over the line? The throat
slashing is not OK if it undermines the other values of the game
such as sportsmanship and respect for opponents. I think the throat
slashing can be seen as a descendant of the antics of Jimmy Connors
and John McEnroe in tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, what Latrell Sprewell did to his coach was an assault. I
find it strange that some people excuse it or look the other way as
if it were somehow part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro and Katz are first-stringers in a new generation of
shrinks drawn to sports as an adjunct to a general practice. There
is excitement, money and publicity in dealing with a relatively
healthy population outside of managed care.
</P>
<P>
   The psychologists, in particular, concentrate on performance
enhancement, particularly on teaching athletes to focus on
realistic goals and to disconnect the emotional bonds that hamper
them. It's surprising how many athletes get injured or find other
ways to lose so they can punish the parents who pushed them.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between sports and mental health professionals
has traditionally been shaky; there seems to be a tendency for the
psychiatrists, in particular, to either dismiss athletics as
beneath their professional dignity or to be such passionate fans
that they blur their professional boundaries. Traveling with
athletes, befriending them, thrilled by access and confidence, they
think of themselves as part of the team.
</P>
<P>
   This can be as harmless as aping jocks. It has been as dangerous
as psychiatrists' becoming drug connections. Perhaps worst of all,
and most common, as evaluators of prospects or counselors to
troubled players, some shrinks lose sight of any responsibility to
the needs of the individual.
</P>
<P>
   Like many sports doctors in general, they see their job as
getting the athlete back in the arena _ to win, not necessarily to
become healthier. Their allegiance is to the customer _ team
management _ rather than to the patient.
</P>
<P>
   There is no great body of psychoathletic literature (we are
still waiting for Coach Jung), perhaps because athletes are so
devoted to quicker fixer-uppers _ drugs, religion, surgery _ and
rarely have the patience or playing time for psychoanalysis. Also,
few serious scholars outside the kinesiologists of physical
education and a few anthropologists have spent enough time on the
field and in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   My own favorite text was a Freudian analysis of baseball in
which the batter, who was the child, swung his bat in an attempt to
interrupt the relationship between dad, the pitcher, and mom, the
catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, there are Oedipal aspects to sports,'' Ferraro said.
``Men play sports to re-enact the Oedipal conflict and work through
their anxieties. Think about that throat-slashing gesture. Cutting
off the head of the opponent. Think about the symbolism. Are you
saying, I chopped off his but didn't lose mine?''
</P>
<P>
   These would be interesting thoughts to bat around with Sprewell,
with Keyshawn Johnson (among the most celebrated of the throat
slashers), with Dennis Rodman and with Connors and McEnroe.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, some of this may be aired Friday, in New York, when
Katz will moderate a panel sponsored by the American Psychoanalytic
Association titled ``Sport, Society and Development: Helping Kids
Field Their Dreams.'' It is free and open to the public, at 10:30
a.m. in the Astor Salon of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are seeing individual aggrandizement becoming more
important than subjugating oneself for the team,'' Katz said. ``I
think we have to realize that some of this comes from sports
itself. Teams utilize competition among members as a motivational
force; players are competing among themselves for space and time
before they compete against other teams. Aggressiveness is a major
tool. There seems to be a progressive movement in pro sports of
going over the boundaries, and then the field is no longer a safe
place for aggressive energy. Sprewell went beyond the boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate danger is when this becomes reflected in youth
sports. One high school baseball team I work with was recently
involved in an ethnic name-calling incident with another inner-city
school. It escalated into fistfights and then bats were raised. The
coaches and the umpire were just barely able to contain it. They
were badly shaken. But I'm even more worried when I see parents and
adult coaches abusing the 13-year-old umpire of a game among
8-year-olds.''

CALLING THE PLAYS IS SOMETIMES THE COACH'S CALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Shanahan of the Denver Broncos is considered by many
National Football League coaches to be the best play-caller in the
game. The head coach spends dozens of hours during the week
planning.
</P>
<P>
   When he eats, he thinks about plays. When he dreams, he sees X's
and O's. During the Broncos' two Super Bowl runs, watching Shanahan
call plays was like seeing a skilled pilot perform the perfect
aerial maneuver. It was a thing of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   And Shanahan would never, ever permanently hand off the
play-calling duties to someone else on his staff, as coach Jim
Fassel of the New York Giants has done. In Shanahan's world, to do
so is blasphemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the utmost confidence in my offensive coordinator, Gary
Kubiak,'' Shanahan said this past week, ``but the reason I have not
given up the play calling on a long-term basis is because I think
what happens is you remove yourself from the game.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``You become detached. I think it hurts you as a coach
in the long run. And what if you give those duties to your
offensive coordinator, and for a year or two he calls the plays,
then leaves for a head coaching job? Then instead of you learning
all of the nuances of the offense those few years, your offensive
coordinator learned them and took those lessons to another team.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the league, opinions differ on whether a head coach
should call the plays. When Fassel set aside his ego and handed the
play-calling duties to his quarterbacks coach, Sean Payton, last
Sunday, it was hailed as a smart move by the New York news media.
</P>
<P>
   But when you look elsewhere, a different picture emerges. In
some instances, as with Shanahan, the head coach calling the plays
works well. Coach Mike Holmgren of Seattle called the plays for the
Green Bay Packers during two Super Bowl runs.
</P>
<P>
   There have been mixed results in other situations. Bill Parcells
took over the New York Jets' play-calling duties this season and at
times has made strange decisions. Tom Coughlin, who began calling
the plays this season as well, has his Jacksonville Jaguars playing
at a high level.
</P>
<P>
   But without the buffer of an offensive coordinator between
Coughlin and his quarterback, Mark Brunell, the two have had their
rough moments, disagreeing at times on how the offense should be
run.
</P>
<P>
   The question of who should call the plays may center more on
control than anything else. The coaches who favor calling their own
plays think that since the head coach is the leader of the team, he
should command the troops on game day like a field general.
</P>
<P>
   Other head coaches feel an offensive coordinator can do a better
job because the head coach has too many different duties during the
week, like overseeing the defense or special teams or worrying
about team morale. An offensive coordinator does not fret about
such things, just the plays.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' game against the Jets last week was a good example
of how a coach's freeing himself from play-calling duties can help
the team.
</P>
<P>
   Payton works closely with the Giants' quarterbacks, and he knows
that because of the offensive line's struggles this season, the
quarterbacks are not crazy about long drop-backs to set up their
passes. The deeper the quarterback drops in the pocket, the longer
the offensive line must hold its blocks.
</P>
<P>
   So Giants quarterback Kerry Collins had a number of quick three-
and five-step drops against the Jets, as opposed to the deeper
seven-step drops Fassel had mostly been calling. The quick
drop-backs led to quick throws, and thus put the offense in more of
an attack mode.
</P>
<P>
   Another aggressive move by Payton came at the expense of Bill
Belichick, the Jets' smart defensive coordinator. Belichick, like
most of his brethren, studies game films relentlessly and composes
a game plan for his defense. He puts his thoughts on a large card,
as many coordinators do.
</P>
<P>
   The Jet players are then told what to expect in certain
situations. In most games this year, Fassel introduced few new
wrinkles to the offense, so Belichick thought he had a good idea of
what the Giants were going to do.
</P>
<P>
   But Payton wanted to change the Giants' tendencies and make
Belichick's studying _ and his card _ less useful. One example: a
third-and-4-play on which the Giants operated with their ``even
22'' personnel, which calls for two tight ends and two backs. Often
in this situation the team works out of the shotgun and passes.
Payton changed that by running out of the shotgun instead, catching
the Jets off guard.
</P>
<P>
   When Fassel was an offensive coordinator with Arizona, he ran a
wide-open offense. He was then, and is now, a smart offensive
coach. But he was also trying to get a head coaching position.
Fassel wanted to impress teams, and he did.
</P>
<P>
   But in New York, Fassel has grown more conservative and relied
heavily on his defense. As a head coach he seemed less willing to
take the chances he did as a coordinator with the Cardinals. Payton
helped put a little more spice in the Giants' offensive game.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, no matter who is calling the plays, the bottom
line is if it is successful, that is all that matters.
</P>
<P>
   COLTS LOOKING AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Bill Polian of the Indianapolis Colts is already
looking at his team's future salary-cap situation. And he needs to,
because Polian will soon face the sort of problems that almost
destroyed the Dallas Cowboys, a team to which the Colts are often
compared.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts' threesome of quarterback Peyton Manning, running back
Edgerrin James and wide receiver Marvin Harrison currently consumes
12 percent of the team's salary cap, or about $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The three players could, in several years, eat up 25 to 30
percent of the cap, the way the Cowboys' threesome of Troy Aikman,
Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin do now.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Colts could be severely restricted in the future
when it comes to bringing in free agents, as the Cowboys have been.
But Polian's draft skills should help offset any talent drought.
The Cowboys have drafted poorly in the last five years, while
Polian is one of the best talent evaluators in football.
</P>
<P>
   DITKA'S DAYS NUMBERED?
</P>
<P>
   Two 6-10 seasons and a current 2-10 record will most likely make
the New Orleans Saints' owner, Tom Benson, seriously consider
firing coach Mike Ditka after the season.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Benson might ask Ditka to make changes in his
staff, something Ditka would probably decline, thus forcing
Benson's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, only a strong run in the playoffs can save the job of
coach Pete Carroll of the New England Patriots. The Broncos'
offensive coordinator, Gary Kubiak, is a candidate to replace him.

NEXT TIME AROUND, RANGERS TRYING YOUTH
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Texas Rangers have adopted a strange
course to take them past the New York Yankees, the team that has
stunted their October growth each time they have reached the
playoffs in three of the past four years. First, they traded Juan
Gonzalez, their No. 1 run producer, and now they have shed through
free agency two of their three other veteran outfielders, their
second baseman, two starting pitchers and a potential starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of planned it that way,'' General Manager Doug Melvin
said, discussing some of the Rangers who were not offered
arbitration and thus will not return. ``We signed them to contracts
to let our farm system catch up. Our system hadn't been doing well.
We wanted to keep the players down there. Now the farm system has
gotten to the point where we feel we have to give our younger
players a chance. But our payroll is still high enough that it
makes us a contender.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers surprisingly had the major leagues' second-highest
payroll this year, behind only the Yankees. But the expensive
collection of players was no match for the Yankees' more expensive
collection. For the second successive season, Gonzalez scored the
team's lone run in a three-games-and-out first-round playoff
encounter with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin traded Gonzalez because the club would not give him the
kind of money he wanted _ it wasn't Monopoly money _ to sign a
contract extension. The other outfielders, Tom Goodwin and Roberto
Kelly, were allowed to leave as free agents because they had
outlived their usefulness. So had second baseman Mark McLemore and
pitchers John Burkett and Mike Morgan. Jeff Fassero had been an
Aug. 31 pickup, someone the Rangers hoped would help in the
postseason and who started three games.
</P>
<P>
   For 2000, the homegrown Ruben Mateo and Gabe Kapler, acquired in
the Detroit package for Gonzalez, will join Rusty Greer in the
outfield. Luis Alicea will get a chance to win a large share of the
second base job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be younger and more athletic with Kapler and Mateo,''
Melvin said. ``They're better all-around players, strong players.
Kapler's at the next stage of development. Mateo will be in his
first full year in the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Mateo, who will be 22 years old next season, is the Rangers'
prized prospect. His introduction to the majors last season was
marred by injuries, including a broken bone in his left hand that
ended his season on Aug. 4. Kapler, 24, was the Tigers' 57th-round
selection in the 1995 draft but became a power-hitting prospect,
though he had a disappointing rookie season, struggling to hit
.245.
</P>
<P>
   Last season Gonzalez and Goodwin combined for 42 home runs and
161 runs batted in, Gonzalez obviously producing the bulk of those
numbers. ``If Mateo and Kapler hit 40 homers and drive in 130 runs
between them,'' Melvin said, ``that will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin cited other numbers: ``There's a big gap between the
$450,000 for the two of them and the $11 million that Juan and
Goodwin will make next year.''
</P>
<P>
   So was this a downsizing of salary, as other teams have done in
recent years when payrolls spiraled out of control? Did Tom Hicks,
the Rangers' relatively new owner, order Melvin to slash the
payroll?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the general manager said. ``He just said we have to have
an awareness of the payroll. We would spend the money if we thought
it was wise spending. With younger players coming along, it didn't
make sense to pay Tommy Goodwin the money he deserved to make.''
</P>
<P>
   The payroll will drop, Melvin acknowledged, but he added:
``We'll have the flexibility. We lost money with what was the best
team in franchise history. We didn't draw three million. We drew
2.7. We felt we needed to make some moves.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was one edict Hicks delivered, it was that the Rangers
would not pay the fee assessed against the teams with the five
highest payrolls based on the average annual value of players'
contracts, not just the 1999 salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin watched the numbers carefully and succeeded in avoiding
the tax man. The Yankees, Los Angeles, Baltimore, the Mets and
Atlanta will pay fees totaling just over $12 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the only way the Rangers fared better than the
Yankees. And while the Rangers get younger and more uncertain, the
Yankees remain, well, the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the tough part,'' Melvin said. ``You hope the Yankees
won't be as good every year. No doubt they have an advantage. They
give $2.5 million to a set-up reliever. We weren't willing to give
that to our second baseman.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, though, aren't conceding anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can still win,'' Melvin said. ``I think we could
win 95 games again, but it will be tough putting younger players
into the mix. It's a possibility. I don't see why not. Obviously,
pitching is still the key. We feel our bullpen, which was real good
last year, can be as good or a little bit better.''
</P>
<P>
   Most immediately, the Rangers want to re-sign two free agents,
Aaron Sele, their No. 1 starter last season, and Todd Zeile, their
third baseman. They should know about Zeile by the end of the
weekend.

NOTABLE LACK OF INTEREST 
THE AGENT GAME
</HEADLINE>
   (With BBO-NOTEBOOK-RANGERS)

<P>
   Many teams did not seem to have much interest in the winter
meetings, which once were the high point of the off-season. The
meetings began Friday and run through Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys are coming in Friday night and leaving Monday,''
one general manager said. But John Schuerholz of Atlanta planned to
arrive Sunday, and Ron Schueler of the Chicago White Sox didn't
plan to come at all. Neither did Brian Cashman of the Yankees, but
that wasn't his decision.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second year of the revived major league meetings.
They had ended after the 1992 gathering because officials and
owners looked at those meetings and saw that they were not good.
Player agents dominated them, getting 35 clients signed in a
three-day frenzy to contracts totaling $225 million. If the money
doesn't sound like much, remember this was seven years ago. It was
unprecedented in the 17-year history of free agency.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of the revived meetings last year, the Los
Angeles Dodgers signed Kevin Brown to a $105 million contract over
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``General managers fear the meetings will be a stage for
agents,'' one said. ``They're sitting face to face with them. They
go from one room to the next. They go back and forth within the
same day.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the general managers don't trust themselves to
be able to say no to the agents.
</P>
<P>
   The Agent Game
</P>
<P>
   Agents have discovered a way to make much more money than they
get from the fees their clients pay after signing
multimillion-dollar contracts. They sell their businesses to larger
companies for many, many more millions of dollars. In the past
year, three companies that represent baseball players have been
sold.
</P>
<P>
   Arn Tellem, a Los Angeles lawyer who clients include Albert
Belle, and Alan and Randy Hendricks of Houston, whose clients
include Roger Clemens, have sold their businesses to SFX
Entertainment, the company that also bought the agency run by David
Falk, agent for Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent agency to follow that path is Steinberg, Moorad
&AMP; Dunn of Newport Beach, Calif. Leigh Steinberg is noted as the
agent of the NFL quarterbacks. Jeff Moorad is the baseball agent,
representing such players as Shawn Green and Raul Mondesi. The sale
of the firm to the Assante Corp. of Winnipeg for $120 million
prompted a general manager to make a suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why aren't their players entitled to some of that money?'' the
general manager said. ``Players should call the agents and say,
`Shouldn't I get a percentage of what you just made on us?' Without
the players, the business isn't worth what a company paid for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if the Hendricks brothers didn't have clients of
Clemens' caliber and Moorad did not have a player who could command
a $14 million annual contract, their businesses would not be worth
all of those millions.
</P>
<P>
   Assante's president, Martin Weinberg, basically confirmed that
view when he explained that it was easy to place a value on the
Steinberg-Moorad firm. ``It has a lot of multiyear contracts with
cash flow that can be counted on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the general manager's idea of giving a share of the sale
price to the agents' clients was mentioned to Moorad, he didn't
rush to endorse the plan. But he said, ``That's an interesting
perspective.''

JETS' MARVIN JONES REGAINS ALL-AMERICAN TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (bl)  
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teammates are falling around him, and the sight is painfully
reminiscent. But linebacker Marvin Jones has been left standing
this season amid the tumbling New York Jets. And he has started to
evoke memories of the time he was the most acclaimed defensive
player in college football.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, Jones was second-guessing himself about his
halting play. Was he afraid to reinjure his surgically repaired
left knee?
</P>
<P>
   Jones decided to look at old films from college, when he was
everybody's all-American.
</P>
<P>
   Since his moment of self-doubt, Jones has been so good on the
field that as the Jets struggle with the loss this week of still
another player _ linebacker Bryan Cox is out after having abdominal
muscle surgery _ they do not have to abandon their usual defensive
stratagems.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a Jet defense orchestrated by Bill Belichick, which faces
Dan Marino and the Miami Dolphins at Giants Stadium on Sunday, will
at times use Jones on the inside of the 3-4 scheme, which is
dominated by linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is also the man in the middle of the 4-3 alignment,
although in both formations he is excused on passing downs to make
way for players of greater range. His being in the middle _ the
place Jones would like to be all the time _ is reminiscent of him
at his best, during his years at Florida State in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' resurgence this season is happening after he missed all
of last season with still another serious injury; he tore both the
anterior cruciate and the medial collateral ligaments in his left
knee when a teammate landed on him during a summer practice.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the films of last Sunday's loss to the New York
Giants, the Jets' coaching staff credited Jones with taking part in
17 tackles. That is a remarkable figure, considering that the
Giants had 75 offensive plays.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is only the third time Jones has played into December
since joining the Jets in 1993. In his seven pro seasons, he has
played only one year completely free of injury. That was 1997, Bill
Parcells' first season with the Jets. That is no coincidence, since
Parcells is a stickler for off-season conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Jones grew up in Miami, a Parade all-American linebacker at
Northwestern High School. Miami was a city famous for linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   Jones considered Miami, but his brother had attended Florida
State. And anyway, Jones said: ``I was looking for stability. Bobby
Bowden had been at State for 20 years. Dennis Erickson was in his
first year at Miami, and Steve Spurrier was in his first year at
the University of Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   After Jones capped a three-year all-American career by capturing
the Lombardi Award as the top defensive player in college, along
with the Butkus trophy as college football's top linebacker, he
opted for the 1993 draft as a junior and thought about which team
might choose him. He knew the Patriots were going to draft first
under their new head coach, Bill Parcells, and he was kind of
hoping Parcells would take him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had a thing for the Giants, LT and the Big Blue
wrecking crew,'' Jones said of the days when Parcells led the
Giants and Lawrence Taylor. ``But I figured that he would go for a
quarterback. Drew Bledsoe was putting up big numbers in college,
and it was Parcells' first year, so he wanted to start with a
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, who had the third pick in the draft, traded it to
Phoenix for running back Johnny Johnson and the No. 4 choice. The
Jets chose Jones, as the first defensive player in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Before the year was out, his season ended with a hip fracture.
The next season he sustained an ankle sprain that forced him to
miss every practice, although he played in almost every game. Then
in 1996 he sprained his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through it all: `Why me,'' Jones said. ``After last
season I decided I wanted to take care of a lot of things,
concentrate on myself physically and mentally, things I had never
done before.''
</P>
<P>
   He worked out in the Jets' off-season conditioning program,
something he eschewed until Parcells took over. He cut back on
socializing late into the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just figured it out,'' he said. ``I had the time to think
about what would make me happy, what would make me at peace with
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even when this season began he was far from his best. Jones
was still not attacking the way he knew he should. Parcells noticed
that Jones still had his tentative moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were playing Buffalo in the second game,'' Jones
said, ``and I just realized it wasn't me. Whether I was worried
about the knee, I don't know. But I decided after that I was
running to the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   He also watched the college films of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changed for me against Denver,'' Jones said of the game
Oct. 3 at Mile High Stadium, the Jets' first victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had five solo tackles and batted away a pass during that
game.
</P>
<P>
   He is now second on the team in tackles to strong safety Victor
Green, the perennial leader. Jones has 73 tackles and has recorded
his first career interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these things I did in the off-season, the physical and
the mental, helped me,'' he said. ``I don't look at it as I've been
dealt a bad hand now. I look at it as just having had some
interruptions.''

INDIANA AND SANTA CLARA, BOTH WEARY, TO PLAY FOR SOCCER TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ No one could blame Indiana and Santa Clara for
practicing ever so lightly Saturday for Sunday's match to determine
the collegiate champion in men's soccer.
</P>
<P>
   After both teams were engaged in quadruple overtime games in the
semifinals a night earlier, they needed all the rest they could
get.
</P>
<P>
   The college semifinals this year were what several regular
followers of the tournament called the greatest day in college
soccer, men's or women's.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana eliminated UCLA, 3-2, in 141 minutes 24 seconds in the
second game Friday night, after it took Santa Clara 138:50 to
eliminate a highly technical Connecticut team by 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana and Santa Clara are fairly familiar with each other.
Santa Clara has defeated Indiana three times, but the Hoosiers
routed the Broncos, 4-0, in last year's semifinals before winning
their fourth championship with a triumph over Stanford. This will
be their first meeting in the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, finals are not classic games,'' Jerry Yeagley,
in his 27th year as coach of the Hoosiers, said about Sunday's
game. ``We won't be able to tell the effects of the semifinals
until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The semifinals were a special night for college soccer. It
marked one of the most entertaining days in the history of the
final four and I have been to just about all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeagley went to the semifinals as a player with West Chester
State and won a national title in his senior year in the 1961
edition of the tournament, which was started in 1959. He has taken
Indiana to 13 semifinal games as coach. And he has the most
victories (477) among all active soccer coaches in Division I.
Steve Negoesco of San Francisco has the most victories (526) of all
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana has a record of 20-3-0 this season and will be seeking
its fifth national title Sunday at Ericsson Stadium in a game that
will be broadcast live by ESPN at 1 p.m. Santa Clara is 16-3-3 and
will be vying for its second championship.
</P>
<P>
   While Indiana's titles have been captured outright, Santa Clara
shared the title with Virginia in 1989 in subfreezing temperatures
at Rutgers Stadium in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara may have the advantage over Indiana in having played
all of its tournament games on the road. Under the direction of
coach Mitch Murray, the Broncos have also won three overtime games
in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana and Santa Clara are very well organized defensively and
have similar statistics in that area. Indiana has 14 shutouts and
has allowed 14 goals, while Santa Clara has 11 shutouts and has
allowed 17 goals. One man Santa Clara's defense impressed the most
was Ray Reid, the coach of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're as good a defensive team as we've seen in the country,
and obviously we had trouble breaking them down,'' Reid said of
Santa Clara, which ended Connecticut's 12-game winning streak.
``Hopefully, this will be a building block for next year for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana allowed its first goal in four games in the tournament
in the victory over UCLA. The Hoosiers had a two-goal lead with
goals from Pat Noonan and Yuri Lavrinenko, but UCLA rallied in
regulation on goals by Steve Shak in the 77th minute and Scot
Thompson in the 83rd before Ryan Mack, Indiana's indefatigable
midfielder, scored his winner in the fourth sudden-death overtime.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the Hoosiers got the opportunity to defend their
title.

NYC TO SEEK PENALTIES AGAINST TRANSIT UNION IF IT STRIKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ratcheting up the pressure on union negotiators for
New York City's 33,000 subway and bus workers, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani said Saturday that city lawyers would seek an injunction
Monday that would lay out the financial penalties the union would
face if it goes on strike.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said some contingency plans designed to reduce
disruption across the city, including wider deployment of privately
operated vans, may be set in motion before the union's contract
expires at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference, the mayor also said that the police were
vigorously investigating an incident of vandalism in the subway
system on Friday afternoon on the suspicion that it might have been
committed by union workers.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by Police Commissioner Howard Safir, who said 2,400
additional officers would be called in to work each day if a strike
occurs, the mayor said the subway vandalism occurred at 4:20 p.m.
Friday at the 34th Street station of the Eighth Avenue line, where
a switch was activated to move a local train to the express track.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of switching the train, the tampering tripped a security
system and turned off power, he said. But the vandalism, which
Giuliani said could have been accomplished only by someone with a
key to the switch, could have resulted in a collision and serious
injuries if the safety device had not been tripped, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will make a very big deal out of this,'' Giuliani said.
``If we catch the person who did it, we would expect that person to
go to prison for a very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   In a clear warning to union leaders that they should discourage
acts of violence or sabotage, he added that he ``will hold the
union accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Union officials were in negotiations and could not be reached
for comment on the mayor's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Marc Shaw, the executive director of the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said Saturday that the
incident had caused train service to be delayed for 30 minutes. But
he said it had not posed a threat to safety because, when the track
switch was activated, it immediately caused signal lights to turn
red and also set off an electronic braking system that would have
prevented trains from going through the red lights.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who met Saturday morning with more than 10 of his
commissioners and senior advisers to refine plans designed to cope
with a strike, said city lawyers would seek an injunction Monday
that lays out financial penalties that the union would face if a
strike occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Such penalties are dictated by the state's Taylor Law, which
prohibits strikes by public employees. Under the law, each worker
would be fined two days' pay for each day of the strike, and the
city could seek penalties from the union to cover losses.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the potential loss, which the mayor said Friday
could reach $25 million a day, appeared to be growing Saturday,
since Safir said he expected the expense of adding police officers
for traffic control and security of the subway system to be $3.9
million a day, nearly four times a previous estimate by Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   In threatening to seek full compensation from the union, the
mayor said city lawyers would seek penalties to cover expenses that
are incurred even before a strike begins. Unlike the resolution of
prior court battles involving the Taylor Law, he said, the city
would not lessen its demands for full compensation as part of a
settlement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``In the past, people have been willing to compromise in the
months after a strike is over and begins to be forgotten,'' said
city Corporation Counsel Michael Hess, who joined Giuliani at the
press conference. To that, the mayor said, ``I won't forget.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of its contingency, the city planned to set up a Web
site, www.nyclink.org, to provide detailed information on such
things as the areas where cars with fewer than three people will be
banned, increased schedules for commuter trains, and the location
of more than 50 parking lots that are to be set aside to discourage
people from driving into Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said some plans may be set in motion as early as
Monday, including a plan to encourage the operators of private van
services to broaden and increase their routes, filling some of the
void left if subway and bus service is interrupted. He said
companies that supply food, retail products and other goods in
Manhattan would also be encouraged, beginning Monday, to adjust
delivery schedules to avoid the morning and late-afternoon rush
hours.

 &HT;    Influential Black Politicians Vow to Help Gore
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some of the nation's most influential African American
politicians vowed Saturday to wage a political crusade ``of
biblical proportions'' to elect Al Gore president and to restore
Democratic control of Congress next year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in response, promised to use the presidency to counter any
challenge to affirmative action, one of the most significant
legislative gains of the modern civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who says that affirmative action is no longer needed
because we've reached the promised land has confused wilderness
with Canaan,'' the vice president declared.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's declaration followed a summit with hundreds of black
leaders from around the country at the offices of Atlanta Life
Insurance Co., the nation's largest African American-owned and
-controlled company.
</P>
<P>
   The company's offices are located on Atlanta's historic Auburn
Avenue, the main thoroughfare of the community from which the late
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. led his historic civil rights crusades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no accident that Vice President Gore has come today here
in Atlanta, to the most historic street in African American history
to launch this African American movement and crusade to elect this
man president of the United States,'' Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell
told the hundreds of supporters who jammed an auditorium in the
Atlanta Life offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a crusade of biblical proportions because we will
change the way this country thinks about politics in the election
in November,'' Campbell added.
</P>
<P>
   Former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson said black voter turnout,
if high enough, could produce ``a clean sweep'' for the Democratic
Party next year - winning the White House, the Senate and the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said African Americans, long denied the right to vote in
the South, ``have an obligation to our children to use the power
for which we have struggled.'' He said African Americans ``don't
need to beg anybody for anything'' when they can use the ballot to
``smack somebody in the head.''
</P>
<P>
   The summit coincided with the Gore campaign's announcement that
more than 2,000 African American leaders have endorsed the vice
president over rival Bill Bradley in the contest for the Democratic
presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   The list of endorsements released at the summit included nearly
every black member of Congress, some of whom were on hand to help
energize African American interest in the upcoming election.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Lewis of Atlanta, one of the most famous civil rights
pioneers, invoked the names of voting rights martyrs in order to
spur greater African American participation in next year's
election. And he called Gore ``our brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis brought his listeners to their feet when he noted that
black voter turnout could also result in the Democratic Party
reclaiming the majority in Congress that it lost in 1994, the
result of which could be to ``bring Bob Barr back to Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr, who represents an Atlanta area congressional district, was
one of President Clinton's most active critics and the first member
of Congress to call for Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas not only promoted Gore's
candidacy but took a verbal swipe at Gov. George W. Bush, her
fellow Texan, and his campaign rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a state that understands that 'compassionate
conservatism' speaks but it does not act,'' she said, noting the
declining enrollment of minorities at Texas universities as a
result of legal challenges to affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. Roy Barnes and U.S. Sen. Max Cleland, two of Georgia's
most prominent white politicians, also were on hand to rally black
voters for Gore. Both won their last elections with the help of
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got elected because each of you rose up at a particular time
... and said, 'We are not going backward anymore','' Barnes
reminded them.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a longtime champion of improved race relations, was
largely ignored at the campaign event. Only Gore mentioned him by
name in expressing ``gratitude'' over the news of Bradley's
improved health.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good man, a great competitor - I look forward to
continuing our discussion,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the focus of the event was more on the general
election, in which the turnout of minority voters is likely to be
crucial to Democratic Party successes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore acknowledged as much in noting that the Republican Party is
``blowing the roof off'' election finances, a reference to the
record-setting fund raising of Bush, the frontrunner for the GOP
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that here, in the South, we have the capacity
to blow the roof off voter registration and turnout,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   African American voters constitute about 40 percent of the
Democratic primary vote in the 11 states of the Old Confederacy.

DESPERATE YOUNG AMERICA CAN CONTROL ITS DESTINY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the preliminary trials for the America's Cup began nearly
two months ago off Auckland, New Zealand, the New York Yacht Club's
Young America team was on the short list of favorites to win the
Louis Vuitton challenger series and face the defending Kiwis in
February's cup finals. But for the New Yorkers, that simple plan
has gone terribly awry.
</P>
<P>
   Six teams will advance to next month's semifinal round of
challenger racing, and Young America is now in a desperate battle
to secure the sixth and final spot. Four syndicates have qualified
for the semifinals: Italy's Prada Challenge, Paul Cayard's America
One, Dawn Riley's America True and Japan's Nippon Challenge.
Barring a total collapse in the closing days of the trials, Dennis
Conner's Stars and Stripes will retain the fifth spot.
</P>
<P>
   With a handful of squads already eliminated, that leaves Young
America and Le Defi Francais _ two teams seemingly headed in
opposite directions _ to jostle for the remaining berth. On
Saturday, the French continued their stunning third-round roll by
beating America One to register their fifth straight victory. Young
America also recorded a much-needed victory _ its 2 minute,
13-second margin over Bravo Espana dashed Spain's hopes of
advancing _ but it was only its third triumph in the last seven
races.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a slump,'' Young America's president, John Marshall,
said in a phone interview from Auckland Saturday. ``For us, the
question is whether we can overcome a string of bad luck and bad
sailing and still go out and sail great races. I have a very strong
conviction that the answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   With three races remaining, including a vital match Sunday with
America True, Young America still controls its own destiny. If
Young America wins them all, it will advance. But the French also
have three races to go, and they hold a slight edge over the New
Yorkers on points. Should both teams sweep their next two races, it
will set up a winner-take-all contest between Young America and Le
Defi on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This regatta is in the human phase right now,'' Marshall said.
``It's not technologically dominated, it's now a sailors' regatta.
For our team, the coming days will be a test of inner strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Young America's early-round momentum came to a crashing halt on
Nov. 9, when the first of its two new boats, USA 53, cracked and
nearly sank.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorkers hurriedly substituted their second boat, USA 58,
but Marshall said it might not have been ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's conceivable that 58 may be underperforming,'' he said.
``The conditions have been very shifty, so it's difficult to be
dead sure on boat speed. But it may be that we're not going as fast
as we were on 53.''
</P>
<P>
   But Young America has also been plagued by tactical mistakes,
particularly in recent losses to Italy and Japan. For that reason,
Marshall also conceded that he had considered making changes in the
afterguard led by the skipper, Ed Baird.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we decided that anything we could do on short notice, that
hasn't been planned and drilled, would have a negative effect,''
Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think history bears it out. Desperation changes are almost
always negative ones.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one interested observer, America One's Cayard, believes
that Young America's near sinking had a devastating effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a pretty major incident, and it seems like it
destabilized them,'' he said in a phone interview. ``It looks like
they haven't been able to get the program back on track where
they're solid, confident and calm. They're just not sailing their
best.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cayard, whose team scored an important victory over Young
America last Thursday, also says the light, shifty breezes of the
last week have played havoc with the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything's wrong with Young America's boat,'' he
said. ``I think they're pretty fast. But in the conditions we've
had recently, everybody's dangerous. If you sail smart, anyone can
win. It's not such a speed contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the big picture, Cayard believes that in the third
round, Italy's Prada Challenge, a team that once appeared
invincible, finally exhibited at least a veneer of vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may still come out on top of the round, but they've lost
a few races now,'' he said. ``As far as improvement goes, their
curve is much flatter than the rest of us. I didn't expect that to
happen until the semifinals.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayard, for one, knows that a semifinal encounter with Prada is
assured.
</P>
<P>
   Young America must run the table to seal a similar fate.

GIANTS STAY COOL AGAINST STIFF ODDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the the New York Giants are going to have any chance to
qualify for the playoffs, they will almost certainly have to win at
least one of their next two games: a matchup at Buffalo on Sunday
afternoon or one at St. Louis next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Some choice.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams have scored more points than any team in the National
Football League, and the Bills have not lost at home to any team
from the Giants' division, the National Conference East, since
1987.
</P>
<P>
   As the Giants head to Ralph Wilson Stadium on Sunday, they have
no experience playing against Bills quarterback Doug Flutie. Also,
the Giants' top four cornerbacks are injured, as are the starting
center and two of the team's three tight ends.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills, meanwhile, are coming off a bye week, and such pauses
in the schedule have been good to other Buffalo teams, which have
won nine of their 10 games after a bye week. And the Bills have won
11 of their last 13 home games.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Giants, it is not supposed to snow Sunday. Of course, the
Giants were rooting for snow, thinking it might make it harder for
Flutie and the Bills to prey on the Giants' banged-up secondary. It
is very likely that the Giants will be forced to start Jeremy
Lincoln and Emmanuel McDaniel at cornerback because Jason Sehorn
has a broken leg and Phillippi Sparks has a groin muscle pull and a
case of the flu.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, the Giants had a curious confidence about them
this past week, the sly grin of someone playing possum, as if they
_ if no one else _ truly believed they had a chance Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As the injuries mounted this week, even coach Jim Fassel was
making jokes. When tight end Dan Campbell was the last to go down
Friday with a severe hamstring pull, Fassel said, ``It's tough, but
we'll take 46 guys up there _ I think we'll find 46 _ and get ready
to play.''
</P>
<P>
   This road game is an obscure trip for the Giants, who have
played the Bills at their home in Orchard Park, N.Y., only four
times since 1970. Only two Giants who will be active Sunday played
in the last meeting, a 1993 game won by the Bills, 17-14, after a
late touchdown pass by Jim Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that game and the stadium,'' defensive tackle Keith
Hamilton said. ``The people are right on top of you, screaming at
you like Giants fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Jessie Armstead, who also played in the 1993 game,
said: ``It was loud. They love their football up there. Just really
loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel expects as much Sunday. He had the team practice inside
Giants Stadium on Friday so he could use the public address system
to blare crowd noise at his offense whenever it lined up to run a
play.
</P>
<P>
   A loud crowd will test the exchange between quarterback Kerry
Collins and center Derek Engler, who will be making his first start
in front of Collins because Brian Williams sustained a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd will also test the sideline communication system used
between Collins and the quarterbacks coach Sean Payton, who is now
in charge of calling the plays. Hand signals may be necessary,
something that can lead to confusion even among coaches and
quarterbacks who have worked together for years.
</P>
<P>
   It does not add up to the easiest assignment for these Giants,
but again, they seemed strangely at ease as they went about their
preparations for Sunday's game, one of two that will decide if the
Giants have anything to look forward to besides Christmas.  &QL;

HOW AN HONOR STUDENT BECAME A WHITE WARRIOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Wash., Ark., Ohio, Utah, Okla., Idaho, Mont.)  (SUBS to add ``prepared in conjunction'' note)  
 This article was reported in conjunction with a documentary on the
subject produced by New York Times Television for the Showtime
network, scheduled to appear Sunday night at 9:30. 
 (lh) 
 By JO THOMAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a 10th-grader, Chevie Kehoe was an honor student who dreamed
of joining the Air Force and becoming a pilot. His parents, white
supremacists who despised the federal government, took him out of
school and urged him to become a white warrior instead. He
objected, but not for long.
</P>
<P>
   By the age of 24, Kehoe was one of the most notorious white
supremacists in the United States, having engaged in a kidnapping,
three robberies, three murders and two police shootouts, all in a
quest to establish an Aryan republic for white people.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his violent journey from talented and well-liked
teen-ager to merciless terrorist, Kehoe, now 26 and serving life in
prison, blames his family for his troubles. In a lengthy interview
in jail shortly after his sentencing, the only interview he has
given since his arrest in 1997, he said, ``In my entire life, my
dad always hated this or hated that and never gave me something to
love or something to work toward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was extremely confusing, because you get left with this bag
of anger, and you have no place to focus, you have nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   As self-serving as Kehoe's comments are _ he also maintains his
innocence and accuses his mother of framing him _ they help
illuminate the power of family pressure to twist and distort a
young life, especially in the isolated environment of the country's
anti-government movements, and to turn promise into poison.
</P>
<P>
   Chevie Kehoe was born in 1973 and named after his father's
favorite car, the Chevrolet. The father, Kirby Kehoe, was a skilled
auto mechanic who had served with the Navy in Vietnam and had
returned with a skin rash that ultimately was diagnosed as a rare
form of cancer. He blamed exposure to Agent Orange.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Chevie was born, Kehoe moved his family from
Florida to the mountains of western North Carolina to get away from
the crowds, settling in Sam's Gap, N.C. It was the beginning of
years of isolation and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Their home was destroyed by fire, and unable to rebuild, the
Kehoes lived in a garage with no plumbing, no insulation and no
heat. A neighbor, Dixie Lee Tipton, remembers buying Chevie and his
brothers beds; they had been sleeping on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tipton recalls Chevie as ``the most beautiful little child
I had ever seen, and very, very polite.'' In elementary school in
nearby Mars Hill, he was an ``A'' student in a class for the gifted
and talented.
</P>
<P>
   In jail many years later, he recalled having many friends, but
no close ones. And when Mrs. Tipton offered to take the boys to
church, Mrs. Kehoe refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad didn't like other people,'' Chevie Kehoe said. ``He was
concerned about bad habits rubbing off on us.''
</P>
<P>
   The pattern continued in 1985 when Kirby Kehoe moved his family
to Washington state, where he eventually bought a cabin on 20 acres
near Deep Lake, a mountain community near the Idaho border.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kirby Kehoe worked a series of jobs as a mechanic. His father,
Doyle Kehoe, said in an interview that he ``cver hold a
job,'' adding: ``Everyone he worked for cheated him. He always
didn't get along.''
</P>
<P>
   Chevie Kehoe put it this way: ``Dad didn't do well. He was too
independent. He didn't like to have a boss.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Chevie entered Colville Junior High School, 25 miles from Deep
Lake, as a ninth-grader in 1987. Kent Roberts, a science teacher,
remembered him as an honor student, well-liked, happy to help out
after school or on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to run track, but his parents refused to allow it. His
friends, he said, were not welcome at home; his parents grew
marijuana, and they did not want people coming around who might
talk about it. He did manage to go to a school dance after Mrs.
Roberts tailored one of her husband's suits to fit him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the parents pulled Chevie and his younger brother
Cheyne out of public school, and from then on home-schooled their
sons _ eventually they had eight. ``My father saw school as a
threat,'' Chevie Kehoe said, adding that, in his case, home
schooling did not work well. ``My mom is not a teacher. She didn't
have patience. She didn't have her education. I ended up being
self-taught. At 15, I told myself, `I'm not going anywhere.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Kehoes were anti-government white separatists, followers of
the Christian Identity religion, which teaches that whites are the
chosen people and that Jews are the descendants of Satan.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was extremely racist, extremely anti-Semitic in the
sense he would like to exterminate anything that's not white,''
Chevie Kehoe said. ``If they're not white, then they don't have the
right to exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on the Kehoe boys to come around to their parents'
way of thinking was intense. Chevie won small battles, getting a
driver's license and a Social Security number despite their
disapproval. And at 17, he said, ``I was eight hours away from
signing up with the Navy. I had a person who was going to drive me
to the recruiting office in Spokane.''
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, he said, his hero had been the actor Tom Cruise in
``Top Gun'': ``Not because it was violent. Not because he had
power. It had to do with freedom. I wanted to fly.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did not go to Spokane. ``My dad talked me out of it,'' he
said. Instead, he married a neighbor, Karena Gumm, and a year later
they had a daughter.
</P>
<P>
   They had met in junior high school, he remembered. ``Both of us
were virgins. That was a long time and a lot of innocence ago.''
</P>
<P>
   By then Chevie had entered his parents' separatist world. He
occasionally attended potluck suppers at the Ark, a Christian
Identity church not far from Deep Lake. Once, he listened to a
lecture there by the widow of Gordon Kahl, an anti-tax activist who
had become a martyr to the white right.
</P>
<P>
   He and his parents also began to study the ideas of Robert
Mathews, who had formed an underground terrorist group, the Order,
in the Pacific Northwest years before. Mathews died in 1984 in a
fiery shootout with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with his concept of separatism,'' Chevie Kehoe said of
Mathews. ``I agree with his concept that the government is not
truly for the people. I respected his dedication. I respected him
as a man, as an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   He also met Mathews' widow at the Aryan Nations compound near
Hayden Lake, Idaho. And his thinking hardened in 1992, he said,
when agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms raided the home of a family friend, Del Knudson.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to see the government come up there with all these
police cars and helicopters and all that,'' he said, ``and tear his
house apart, tear books off shelves, confiscate computer disks,
confiscate every firearm he had, go through his garage, handcuff
his wife, terrorize his children _ to see that the government has
that type of power, you know something's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As time passed, Chevie Kehoe came to imagine that he might
someday achieve Robert Mathews' goal: a whites-only nation. He
wanted to call it the Aryan People's Republic.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when Chevie was 21, Kirby and Gloria Kehoe moved their
family to Kingston, Ark., in the Ozarks, they became friends
with a gun dealer, William Mueller, and his wife, Nancy. They
traveled the same gun show circuit, shared anti-government views,
and identified with the Christian Identity religion.
</P>
<P>
   But friendship did not stand in the way of profit. In January
1995, Kirby and Chevie Kehoe burglarized the Muellers' home in
Tilly, Ark., and took thousands of dollars' worth of guns and gold
and silver coins.
</P>
<P>
   Chevie Kehoe then returned to Washington, on the way stopping at
Elohim City, a Christian Identity community in Oklahoma, where he
asked an escaped convict, Faron Lovelace, to accompany him for
protection.
</P>
<P>
   On June 12, 1995, Kirby and Chevie Kehoe mounted another
fund-raising operation in Colville, Wash., sending Lovelace into
the home of two well-to-do grocery store owners, Malcolm and
Jillian Friedman. Lovelace later said he targeted the Friedmans
because he thought they were Jewish and would be easy to kill if
something went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Lovelace held Friedman hostage and ordered Mrs. Friedman to go
out and collect cash. Then he forced the Friedmans to go to
Spokane, where he set them free.
</P>
<P>
   The money from the Arkansas and Washington crimes went to buy
land near Priest River, Idaho, where Chevie Kehoe planned to set up
a training camp for revolutionaries, prosecutors in his trial said.
</P>
<P>
   By winter, the money was gone, and knowing that William Mueller
had come into a $50,000 inheritance, Chevie Kehoe decided to rob
him again. This time, his accomplice was Danny Lee, a skinhead from
Oklahoma with lightning bolts tattooed on his neck. Lee was known
as ``Cyclops'' because he had lost an eye in a bar fight.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 11, 1996, Kehoe and Lee, disguised as federal agents,
broke into the Muellers' home and waited for the family to return.
It was almost summer by the time the remains of the family _ the
father, mother and 8-year-old daughter, Sarah _ were found in the
Illinois Bayou near Russellville. A woman who was fishing hooked a
shoe and a bone.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kehoe later told investigators that her son told her about
his role in the Mueller murders shortly after the crime, but that
she kept quiet. That July 1996, the Kehoe family had moved to
another remote home, in Yaak, Mont. Cheyne and his wife and son
lived nearby until that winter, when Chevie came to get them. The
two brothers and their families drove south together to look for
work in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Cheyne knew nothing about the murders until they were traveling
together and Chevie began selling guns because they could not find
work. At that point his brother told him, Cheyne later told
investigators, because some of the guns had been stolen from the
Muellers.
</P>
<P>
   By then, investigators were tracing other Mueller guns to the
Kehoes. Shortly after the family disappeared, the pistol from an
empty gun box found in the house was recovered at a Seattle pawn
shop and traced to Kirby Kehoe. Months later, another Mueller gun,
an AR-15 rifle, was recovered from Sean Haines, a former Aryan
Nations youth leader. It had been sold by Chevie Kehoe.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers' luck ran out as they traveled through Ohio, where
a state trooper stopped them for driving with expired plates.
Chevie broke away from being searched because he was carrying a
gun, and Cheyne opened fire. The ensuing gun battle, caught on
videotape by a camera on the trooper's dashboard, was broadcast
nationwide. But both brothers escaped.
</P>
<P>
   With help from their parents, the brothers and their families
escaped to Utah, where the men found work under assumed names. But
according to Cheyne Kehoe and his wife, Tanna, Chevie's behavior
became more violent and erratic. When Chevie said he was thinking
of killing his parents so he could raise his younger brothers
himself, Cheyne decided he had to be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Cheyne surrendered on June 16, 1997. The next day, using his
information, the FBI arrested Chevie Kehoe.
</P>
<P>
   Chevie Kehoe was charged with federal racketeering counts that
included the three murders. At his trial in Little Rock this year,
the principal witnesses for the prosecution were his brother Cheyne
and his mother, Gloria.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Gloria Kehoe had called the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms and said her husband had struck her and pointed an
AR-15 rifle at her. ``My husband was going to kill me,'' she said.
``I knew too much. I wanted my nightmare to be over.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria and Cheyne Kehoe told the jury that Chevie Kehoe
confessed to them that he and Danny Lee had surprised the Muellers,
handcuffed the parents, stunned them with an electric stun gun and
taped plastic bags over their heads to suffocate. Then they had
forced 8-year-old Sarah to tell them where her parents' valuables
were hidden. Then, when Danny Lee said he could not kill a child,
Chevie Kehoe killed her.
</P>
<P>
   Chevie Kehoe was sentenced to three life terms. Lee was
sentenced to death. Cheyne had been sentenced to 24 years for the
Ohio shootout, and Kirby Kehoe had been sentenced to 44 months in

he belonged to his son's white supremacist organization.

   Chevie Kehoe said afterward that his mother's testimony
shattered him. ``What more powerful witness can you put on the
stand than a person's mother?'' he asked. He said he told himself:
``It's not Mom up there. It's somebody I don't know. Mom wouldn't
do this to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He contended that his mother, with six sons still at home,
agreed to testify because she was afraid the government would
prosecute her for tax evasion in the sale of the family's property
in Arkansas, where she had used a false Social Security number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her husband was in prison,'' Chevie Kehoe said. ``My brother
was in prison. I'm in prison. If she's in prison, where do her six
children go? I was the sacrifice to save my other brothers.''

<P>

<P>
   In August, when Kirby Kehoe was sentenced, Judge G. Thomas
Eisele of U.S. District Court said he was sorry that sentencing
guidelines would not let him impose a longer sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're dealing with here is the man who is the father of
Chevie Kehoe, the man who raised Chevie Kehoe,'' he said. Although
Kirby Kehoe was not responsible for all his son's deeds, Eisele
said, ``he was a major factor in his son's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Chevie Kehoe put it this way: ``I'm the one left at the end of
the chain of these people's beliefs.''

REAL ESTATE: OUTSIDE BALTIMORE, A REACH BACK TO THE 19TH CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CHARLES BELFOURE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELLICOTT CITY, Md. _ A small residential subdivision nearing
completion in this Howard County community is the first in the
Baltimore metropolitan area to use a new land planning method that
is actually a throwback to late 19th- and early 20th-century
suburban neighborhood designs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Terra Maria, a 55-acre, 102-house development 14 miles west of
downtown Baltimore, is a neo-traditional neighborhood based on
century-old planning principles.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the late 1980s, urban planners and architects
sought to create residential communities different from the usual
cul-de-sac subdivisions used since World War II. These developments
are characterized by porch-fronted houses on small lots lining
narrow streets and within walking distance of parks, stores and
schools. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Terra Maria site was once part of a 253-acre landholding
owned by Charles Carroll of Carrollton, a signer of the Declaration
of Independence. Before his death in 1832, Carroll, a Roman
Catholic, was persuaded to give the land to the archdiocese of
Baltimore for the construction of a high school for young men
considering entering the priesthood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Named St. Charles College in honor of its benefactor, the school
grew into a large campus, but in 1911 it burned down, leaving only
the shell of a recreation hall. Over the years, the land passed
through several owners and, among other things, was used for an
evangelical camp. In 1978, the remaining acreage was purchased by
Robert and Donna Lancelotta, who named it Terra Maria, the Latin
translation of Maryland. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Their son, Robert Lancelotta Jr., came up with the idea of
creating a neo-traditional development.
</P>
<P>
   In the early `90s, he had read about the pioneering traditional
neighborhood design work of Andres Duany and Elizabeth
Plater-Zyberk, Miami-based architects who created such nationally
known projects as Seaside, in the Florida panhandle near Panama
City, and Kentlands in Gaithersburg, Md., just outside Washington.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another inspiration came from a group of estate buildings in
front of Carroll's manor house, all of which survive directly
across the road. ``I wanted to create the same village-like feel
for the development,'' said the younger Lancelotta. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Duany visited the site and did some conceptual work, but
eventually the project was turned over to Uri Avin, a principal of
LDR International, a land planning firm based in Columbia, Md. The
goal of Avin, who created a new site plan in 1993, was to create an
intimate streetscape with sidewalks, a community center and open
spaces and to include a mix of uses such as a day-care center,
professional offices, and retail space.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In neo-traditional work, one of the main trade-offs is using
small lots in place of the usual one- or half-acre parcels to
preserve more of the natural features of the site and have public
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a background of tall, mature trees and each sub-area
of homes has its own greenspace as well as a main one for the
community,'' explained Avin. One of the open areas incorporates the
ruins of the recreation hall, which was preserved by the Lancelotta
family.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another important tenet of neo-traditional work that was
included in Terra Maria was the de-emphasis of the automobile. Some
garages are either off alleys behind the houses or accessed by
driveways and pushed to the rear of the lot in order to avoid a
subdivision look. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Street widths in Terra Maria were reduced from a standard 26
feet to 18 feet to reduce traffic speed and also cut paving costs.
Because of smaller lot sizes, the cost of laying utility lines was
significantly less.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Terra Maria turned out to be more of a hybrid than a true
neo-traditional project because of its lack of mixed uses. A parcel
fronting on Frederick Road was originally scheduled to be a small
retail center with apartments above. But that proved economically
unfeasible, so the lot was rezoned for a day-care center with
professional offices on the second floor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Lancelottas teamed with Synergy Development Venture II, a
land development company based in Baltimore that became the
managing member of Terra Maria LLC. The development company sold
the lots to individual builders who in turn sold the land and
houses beginning in January 1997. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because Terra Maria is the first development to be based on a
neo-traditional model in suburban Baltimore, many builders and
developers are looking at its sales results to gauge the market's
acceptance of the concept. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although all 102 lots are sold, according to David DeMauro of
Synergy, ``it was a hard sell.'' The main problem, he explained,
was that a buyer could purchase a house on a 6,000 to 12,000 square
foot lot in Terra Maria or go within a five-mile radius and get a
home for the same price on about a half-acre lot, the equivalent of
21,780 square feet. Given the choice, many would opt for more land
over a sense of community. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prices for a 3,000- to 3,500-square-foot home in Terra Maria,
including the lot, originally ranged from $300,000 to $450,000. But
the four builders in the first phase sold a total of just 16 houses
in the first year and prices were later reduced. For the second and
last phase, however, Ryland Homes, Baltimore's second biggest
residential builder, decided to reduce the price range to $250,000
to $300,000 for homes on its 40 lots and sales were considerably
brisker, said Earl Robinson, sales and marketing manager. ``We
loved the concept and would definitely do something like this
again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Besides the issue of price, the concept of the higher density of
a neo-traditional community was initially a stumbling block. Many
potential buyers thought it would be overcrowded. ``But once the
development was 50 percent built,'' said DeMauro of Synergy,
``people could see what we were doing and were sold on the idea.
Sales have been very good since then.'' He said, however, that
sales in a normal subdivision would have been faster.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ben Sander, who became one of the first homeowners in 1997, was
immediately attracted to Terra Maria because it reminded him of the
charm and character of a historic community in which he had lived
in Northville, Mich. ``A normal subdivision is very sterile
compared to this,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One problem, said DeMauro, was that some builders did not have
the right product for this different type of development and also
were not used to the strict architectural guidelines they had to
follow, such as using certain types of brick and wood instead of
vinyl. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gary Clarke of the GYC Group in Westminster, Md., who built five
homes in Terra Maria, had to create a design different from what he
normally used. ``The houses had to be narrower and deeper to fit on
the lots,'' said Clarke.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Rutter, director of planning and zoning for Howard
County, said that his flexible policy on such things as setbacks,
lot coverage and density promoted projects like Terra Maria.
</P>
<P>
   A much larger neo-traditional community of 500 acres called
Maple Lawn Farms, which was designed by Avin and will be developed
by Greenebaum &AMP; Rose, based in Baltimore, is currently under review
in Howard County, and Rutter is confident it will go forward. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The younger Lancelotta believes that neo-traditional
developments will become more common in the future, but it will
happen slowly. ``People say, `I have to have my land,' but land is
becoming precious and we have to forgo large lots,'' he explained.
``Aesthetically and socially, neo-traditional is a better plan.'' &QL;

A FAMILIAR ROUTINE FOR LIPINSKI THE PRO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At age 15, soon after she won the Olympic gold
medal in figure skating, Tara Lipinski turned professional. Now at
17, she had a clear path to the Metabolife world professional
championship, but she sent mixed signals over how important this
title was.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day invitational competition at the MCI Center began
Friday night with technical programs, and Lipinski took a solid
lead over Denise Biellmann of Switzerland, 98.6 points to 97.7. The
scores for the technical programs, added to Saturday night's scores
for the artistic programs, determined the winner.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, Lipinski approached this competition most
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new event for me,'' she said, ``a new atmosphere. At
other pro events, it's more of a show. Here, it's a little more
intense. For me, that's the best way I skate _ under pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, her technical program was hardly testing for
a skater who, as an amateur, reeled off jump after jump in every
program. She did land three triple jumps: a toe loop, a lutz (with
a shaky landing) and a loop, but there was no combination jump
involving a triple, making her program easier.
</P>
<P>
   Two competitors did successful combinations _ Biellmann a triple
salchow-double toe loop, and Surya Bonaly of France a triple
toe-triple toe. Lipinski said she did no combination because her
choreography did not leave room for a change.
</P>
<P>
   Her technical and artistic programs were the ones she performed
in Stars on Ice, the touring show that pays her a seven-figure
salary for four months. So while titles are nice, tour income is
nicer. And while the $50,000 first prize here will pay many bills,
the tour money will pay more.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much or how little Lipinski did with her technical
program, it was difficult to argue with success. Of her 14 scores,
eight were for 9.9 and the other six for 9.8. She did not need a
tougher program.
</P>
<P>
   Biellmann, like Lipinski, landed three triples in the technical
program. Unlike Lipinski, she found a way to ad lib. When she did a
single axel instead of an intended double, she quickly interrupted
her choreography, threw in a double axel and resumed without
missing a beat.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe maturity helped. Biellmann, who turned 37 today, is the
oldest skater here. She won the world amateur championship in 1981,
15 months before Lipinski was born.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the men's competition became a battle between the
Russians who took the last two Olympic titles. Aleksei Urmanov won
the technical program with 98.4 points to 98.0 for Ilia Kulik.
</P>
<P>
   Urmanov, 26, completed four clean triples, including a
combination of a triple salchow and a double toe loop. Kulik, 22,
had three good triples plus one that was not so good, needing an
extra step to land a toe loop. It was the first competition in more
than a year for Kulik.
</P>
<P>
   Urmanov was not celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it looks perfect,'' he said, ``there's something that
may be off. The program was pretty good, but it was hard because
everybody knows this is world professional competition. I don't
know who is more nervous, me or my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   There was disappointment for 36-year-old Brian Boitano, who had
won six world pro championships. He placed third in the technical
program with 97.4 points, but seconds after he started he lost his
chance to be more competitive when he could not complete a triple
loop and did a double instead.
</P>
<P>
   Everything else went well for him, but because a back condition
prevented him from doing a triple or a double axel or both, as all
his rivals did, he could not afford any slip. As his longtime
coach, Linda Leaver, said: ``What he does between jumps is more
difficult than what they're doing. They do crossovers and he does
intricate footwork. If they miss a triple axel, his program has
more technical difficulty than theirs. But he can't make any
mistakes on jumps.''

EDITORIAL: NEW DIRECTIONS IN THE MARCH OF SCIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Dec. 12:
</P>
<P>
   Here at the threshold of a new millennium, the pace of
scientific and technological advance seems overwhelming. Computers
are obsolescent the moment we buy them. New discoveries at the
farthest reaches of the universe leave us awestruck. Scientists are
racing to delineate the entire human genome.
</P>
<P>
   Our predecessors felt just as breathless at the end of the last
century, with the Industrial Revolution in full throttle. But that
was just a warm-up. The hallmark of this century _ from splitting
the atom to cracking the genetic code _ has been a faster advance
over a wider range of activities than ever before in history. The
chief questions now are whether science can continue its forward
march or is losing momentum, and whether its products will be
harnessed for good or evil.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 500 years, science has emerged as a dominant
intellectual force, displacing religion and philosophy as the chief
explanation of the natural world. It radically altered humanity's
view of its place in the universe and brought a cascade of
technological marvels, not to mention potential doom.
</P>
<P>
   Its iconic achievements are mileposts of the millennium. They
include Copernicus' discovery that the Sun, not the Earth, was the
center of the cosmos; Galileo's invention of the modern scientific
method, in which hypotheses are stated and tested by experiment to
determine their validity; Newton's discovery that the same force
that caused an apple to fall also held the planets in their orbits;
and Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20th century, science brought an enormous expansion of
scale and theories so esoteric they seem downright freakish.
Astronomers were amazed to discover literally billions and billions
of galaxies racing apart at high speed in a universe so large it
took a Carl Sagan to intone its dimensions. Never had the Earth,
once the center of the universe, seemed such an inconspicuous
speck. Physics experienced one major revolution when Einstein
described a four-dimensional universe in which gravity was
explained as a warping of space-time geometry, then another when
quantum mechanics described a strange subatomic world in which
measurements are uncertain and electrons take ``quantum leaps''
from one orbit to another without traversing the space between. At
a more human level, the great breakthrough was the discovery by
James Watson and Francis Crick of the structure of DNA, opening the
way for the genetic engineering revolution that dominates today's
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Technology _ the production of useful artifacts _ has progressed
with equally spectacular rapidity over the past century, propelled
in part by the technical demands of the two world wars. For the
first time in history, science in the advanced countries became an
organized, well-financed function of the state and of giant
corporations, medical centers and universities.
</P>
<P>
   Flying machines, which got off the ground with a 120-foot flight
by the Wright brothers in 1903, had by the end of the century
carried humans to the moon. Medicine was revolutionized by the
discovery of antibiotics. Electronic communications leaped from the
wireless telegraph to radio to television to the Internet.
Agricultural productivity soared with the help of mechanization and
chemistry. And on the military front, the power of weaponry became
truly stupendous, culminating in nuclear warheads mated to
intercontinental missiles with enough destructive power, en masse,
to obliterate a nation.
</P>
<P>
   As with any human story, we are in suspense as to the next turn.
In a famously wrong pronouncement back in 1899, the head of the
U.S. Patent Office suggested that everything important had already
been discovered. Now we are hearing some of the same talk, with
such books as ``The End of Science'' suggesting that the discipline
is reaching the point of diminishing returns. The warring metaphors
are whether science is like a vast continent whose major outlines
and features have already been mapped, with only the details
remaining to be filled in, or whether it is more like a river,
rushing ever onward. Whichever it is, there will be plenty to do
over the next century as scientists look for genetically designed
medical treatments and a deeper understanding of how the brain and
mind work.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if the past century has been the age of physics, the
next will probably be the age of biology. One can only hope that
the emphasis will be different. The most transforming technology
emerging from the atomic era was the thermonuclear bomb, with
peaceful applications of nuclear energy a distant second. The
challenge for biology will be to reverse the priorities _ to
concentrate on human welfare and quell the urge to produce demonic
germ weapons.

</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Texas has threatened the government's ability
to use modern methods to ensure the safety of the nation's food
supply. The threat is contained in a preliminary injunction issued
on Friday that prevents the Agriculture Department from regulating
salmonella _ bacteria that can be detected only by the department's
new scientific methods, as opposed to the old ``poke and sniff''
tests.
</P>
<P>
   The department had shut down the Supreme Beef Processors' plant
in Dallas, which until recently supplied a large percentage of the
ground beef used in the country's school lunch program. The plant
had failed not just one but three tests for salmonella
contamination over a period of 12 months. But that did not stop the
company from bringing a lawsuit asserting that the government lacks
the authority to enforce its new regulations, which call for
sophisticated microbial testing to determine whether a plant meets
certain health standards.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Judge A. Joe Fish extended an earlier injunction
allowing the plant to remain open. His decision showed more concern
for the immediate economic harm to the company than for the
potentially greater harm to the public posed by contaminated meat.
The department should be able to win a reversal. The language of
the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act clearly gives it broad
authority to require sanitary conditions and safe products.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Out there on the presidential campaign trail, it was one of
those weeks when everything was churning, both in regard to big
ideas and the poll numbers. The biggest idea and the smartest
tactical move came in the proposed joint pledge by Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., and Bill Bradley, the former Democratic senator,
to forgo unregulated soft-money expenditures, should they face one
another in the general election. Their plan would bring a voluntary
end to a bipartisan abuse that Congress has refused to outlaw _ the
use of corporate and union donations by the Republican and
Democratic National Committees in circumvention of the limits on
candidate spending.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, the deal shores up his image as an insurgent
reformer who is not afraid to think outside the Republican boxes.
Moreover, it came as McCain was having his best week of the
campaign while the GOP establishment's presumptive nominee, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, was having his worst. Various New
Hampshire polls put McCain up by 3 to 15 points, while the Texan
was hit with a blizzard of questions about his intelligence from
the press and Republican political professionals. The
disenchantment process, during which front-runners get asked rude
questions, is as much a part of the run-up to Iowa and New
Hampshire as the discovery process that produced winners like Jimmy
Carter and flashes in the pan like Gary Hart, Pat Buchanan and Paul
Tsongas.
</P>
<P>
   These processes alone do not determine eventual outcomes, but
they do expose weak spots in candidacies. For Bush, the immediate
problem was the embarrassment of having to assure interviewers that
``I've been underestimated'' as a thinker. The more lingering
problem may be the performance gap that opened up between him and
the other Republican candidates in two recent debates. A comparison
with Ronald Reagan is useful here. When Reagan was asked certain
questions, one could almost see the cassette drop into place. But
the answers unspooled smoothly and with rich, if rehearsed, detail,
whereas Bush's programming shows in his stiff delivery and in the
sound-bite brevity of his responses.
</P>
<P>
   The other partner in the campaign-reform deal, Bill Bradley,
faces a different tactical situation on the Democratic side. He has
erased Vice President Al Gore's advantage as the guaranteed
nominee, but the effective Gore counterattack on the cost of
Bradley's health care proposal is based on a proven approach for
derailing Democratic insurgents. In 1984, Walter Mondale stopped
Gary Hart's red-hot challenge when Mondale cast himself as the
guardian of the party's social-welfare tradition. Bill Clinton used
a similar tactic aimed at Social Security pensioners to defeat Paul
Tsongas in the critical Florida primary in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to dismiss both the substantive and tactical
moves of the early campaign as politics as usual. But there is a
serious civics lesson in these events. On the GOP side, the debates
are filling their function as a place where candidates reveal, and
sometimes repair, themselves. The two Democrats' parrying over
health care may be cynical, but it also helps define policies for
the future. As for campaign finance, McCain and Bradley have set a
standard on the rejection of soft money that deserves to be
emulated by every candidate in both parties. Their decision to
dramatize campaign reform as a centerpiece issue could create the
best chance in years to chop down the dominant role of
special-interest money in presidential elections.

   ROCKFORD, Ill. _ When firefighters talk about the toughest
moments of their lives, it is not always the leaping flames or the
smoke-filled stairways that haunt them.
</P>
<P>
   For Tom Baylor, it was the face of a dying baby girl. Inside a
fire truck racing to a hospital, Baylor had tried to breathe life
into her lungs. When nothing more could be done, he went into a
bathroom at the hospital, buried his face in his hands and broke
down in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firefighters are supposed to be tough, just dummy up,''
Baylor, 42, said. ``But you don't forget. You have dreams about it.
Once after a baby died, another firefighter looked over at me and
said, `Man, this really hurts.' And we just sat there with tears in
our eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The emotional tribute on Thursday in Worcester, Mass., for the
six firefighters who died in a warehouse blaze showed the depth of
respect and reverence that Americans maintain for the people who
answer their calls for help. It was a response that even tragedy
seldom evokes.
</P>
<P>
   In an age that seems rich in everything but sacrifice, the
firefighter stands, in the ways that count most, as perhaps
America's most heroic figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little kids look at you and trust you,'' said Capt. Mark
Asprooth, 42, of Fire Station No. 5 in Rockford, an industrial city
of 160,000 about 70 miles west of Chicago. ``In a way, that's part
of the reason some of us go into this line of work.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that police officers sometimes grumble, with a
mixture of humor and envy, about how warmly people treat
firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police officers have to do things that make them unpopular,''
said Chris Kowalski, 27, a firefighter. ``With us, people call and
say, `Come and help me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Few civilian jobs, for that matter, get the respect accorded to
firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Stassi, 45, a former plumber who became a firefighter, noted
that injuries are far more common on construction sites than on
fire and rescue scenes.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say firefighters do not encounter danger. Not
long ago, Baylor, for example, found himself in a burning house
that became so hot the picture window was blown out.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us in this station,'' Baylor said, ``have been on calls
where somebody's been carried out of a burning building on a
firefighter's back.''
</P>
<P>
   Adrenaline surges with every alarm, he said. It is impossible to
know if the call is routine or mortally dangerous. After some
calls, the Rockford Fire Department has brought in counselors and
chaplains to talk with firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Asprooth said he believed that firefighters tend to be
compassionate and spirited, people who revere life so much because
they know it cannot be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see death a lot, you greatly appreciate life,'' he
said. ``We know what it is to see sorrow and pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Working 24-hour shifts, the firefighters in Rockford spend a day
and night at the fire station and then get the next 48 hours off.
The night work can mean missing the ballgames or piano recitals of
their children. And holidays usually mean work.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this line of business, you don't stop work for Christmas,''
Stassi said.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighter Lindsay Pooley, 39, told of an accident victim he
had helped, an elderly woman who hugged him and told him, ``I
needed somebody to help get me through this.''
</P>
<P>
   And there was the man who stood outside his house, most of it
burned, and still thanked the firefighter, Kowalski, for saving
what could be saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a house, it's somebody's life,'' Kowalski said.
``And if you can just save a family photo album, you've saved a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Kowalski said that firefighters do not like to be singled out
for credit. When people go into burning buildings together, he
said, they must trust one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not me or you or him, but a team,'' Kowalski said. ``If
anything ever happened to me, my crewmates would be there to help
me and get me out of there.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if I didn't make it out, I know they'd be there to take
care of my family. This is quite a brotherhood.''
</P>

   In Worcestor, firefighters on Saturday discovered the remains of
the fourth and fifth firefighters in the rubble of last week's

around the clock for the remaining victim.

REAL ESTATE: PREPARING A BUILDING FOR Y2K 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Managing agents must walk a fine line in determining
what steps to take to address concerns presented by Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Those who fail to take proper precautions could have some
serious explaining to do if their client buildings end up with any
bites from the millennium bug. Those who overprepare _ and, in the
process, overspend clients' money _ could also have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Following are some last-minute tips for property managers and
boards who want to be as prepared as possible for Y2K without being
too prepared for their own good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not stocking up on food, but we are buying extra garbage
bags,'' said Robert Grant, director of Diversified Property
Management, based in Brooklyn. ``Nobody's going to complain if you
have an extra month's worth of garbage bags, but I wouldn't want to
be the one to tell a client that because one of our suppliers'
delivery systems fouled up, we don't have any bags to put the
garbage in.''
</P>
<P>
   For the same reason, he said, his company is making sure that
any building that uses oil heat will have its fuel-storage tanks
topped off at the end of the year. ``That's a no-brainer,'' he
said. ``But it's a critical issue that shouldn't be overlooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant said he also intended to stock up on other basics like
light bulbs, cleaning supplies, flashlights and batteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things that are going to be outside a
board's or a management company's control,'' Grant said, referring
to problems that could result in the event of power failures or
problems with the city's water supply. ``But a prudent manager will
do his best to address all the things he can think of that are
within his control.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Kornfeld, executive vice president of Heron Ltd., a
Manhattan management company, said that notwithstanding assurances
from the various elevator contractors who service elevators in
client buildings, Heron isn't taking any chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the off chance there's something the elevator company
missed, we're bringing all our elevators down to the lobby at 11:45
p.m. and keeping them there for the next half-hour,'' Kornfeld
said. ``The last thing we want is to have a resident stuck inside
an elevator at midnight.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Peter G. Goodman, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that he had
advised client buildings to conduct an ``11th-hour checklist'' of
their Y2K readiness. For example, Goodman said, any equipment that
is either controlled by a computer or contains an embedded computer
chip should be checked to make sure that it will function after
midnight Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Such equipment could include building and parking access gates
and doors, fire alarms and smoke detectors, building lighting,
including emergency lighting, telecommunications equipment,
heating, ventilating and air-conditioning systems and, of course,
elevators.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you haven't addressed these things by now, it may be tough
to do so now,'' Goodman said. He added, however, that most
manufacturers of such equipment had information on their Web sites
regarding Y2K compliance or the lack thereof. Those that don't have
a Web site, he said, will certainly have telephone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are uncertain about a piece of critical equipment, you
can always call the manufacturer directly,'' Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, management should make sure that all fire
extinguishers have been recharged and that there are adequate
battery-powered lighting sources for hallways and common areas. It
is also imperative for management to make a backup copy of any
computer-stored data, such as rent records, accounts payable and
accounts receivable for each of their buildings, and to contact
each building's accountant to make sure that backup disks or hard
copies of tax and financial records have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Goodman said, buildings with backup generators should
make sure that they are operational and that there is sufficient
fuel on hand to run them.
</P>
<P>
   That latter point, however, could itself present a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fine to have a backup generator, but the real question
is: How much fuel do you have on hand to run it?'' said Karen
Anderson, author of the book ``Y2K for Women, How to Protect Your
Home and Family in the Coming Crisis'' (Thomas Nelson, Nashville,
1999).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson, who lives in Nashville, recently visited a
relative who lives in Midtown Manhattan. She said she had been
struck by how valuable storage space was in the city. Because of
this, she said, buildings that have backup generators should think
long and hard about where and how they will be able to store as
much fuel as is safely possible for the generator they hope to
never have to use. Ms. Anderson said she was also struck by how
vulnerable people who live in densely populated cities can be to
problems associated with failures in the water system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in a single-family house, and the water gets shut
off, you can improvise when it comes to dealing with waste-water,''
Ms. Anderson said. ``But what do you do when you're in a high-rise
building and you can't flush the toilet? Your only alternative,
really, is to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   While officials say that it is unlikely that New York City will
have a problem with its water system there is always the
possibility that glitches in sophisticated booster pumps in some
high-rise buildings could interrupt the building's water supply. In
anticipation of such an eventuality, there is a fairly simple step
that might be taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pack a bag so you can be ready to leave your apartment,'' Ms.
Anderson said. ``And once you have a bag packed it also makes sense
to have an alternative place to go.''

ON PRO BASKETBALL: TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT EWING STILL HAS LEFT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He could not find his rhythm on offense, and he was
often fooled by the simplest of fakes on defense. But he was back
at Madison Square Garden, glowering before the ball was tipped,
taking those purposeful strides toward midcourt at 37 years old.
Somewhere in Boston, another NBA icon, Charles Barkley, was saying
goodbye to the game. In New York, Patrick Ewing was saying hello
again.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on your perspective, his timing on Friday night was
either off _ or perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little rusty with my moves, but I thought I was trying
to do other things,'' Ewing said after the Knicks had held off
Philadelphia. He had played for the first time in six months after
tearing his Achilles' tendon in a playoff game. He missed all eight
shots he took in 30 minutes. But he grabbed 10 rebounds, made seven
of eight free throws and contributed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can walk on a treadmill, ride the bike, but nothing takes
the place of running up and down the court _ banging, bumping,
shooting, just playing ball,'' he said afterward. ``I'm just going
to take one day at a time. It's my first day, my first game. I'm
just trying to fit in and help the team win.''
</P>
<P>
   He is stubborn and proud, and rarely says what people want him
to say. But until he is gone, the Knicks need him almost as much as
the league still needs him. Only one NBA team has advanced past the
first round of the playoffs every time in the last eight years, and
there has been one constant on that team: Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the precincts in Cleveland and Dallas are
reporting, empty seats can be seen all over this season. There are
not enough entertainers in the game anymore. Four of the players
considered must-see TV _ Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Chris
Webber and Jason Williams _ are on two Western Conference teams.
After that lot, there are Vince Carter, Kevin Garnett, the Spurs,
the Blazers and a healthy Allen Iverson. There is but one
time-tested rivalry going, the Knicks versus the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Square Garden sold out for the 306th straight Knicks
game Friday night. That streak began long after Bernard King
stopped shooting. It did not begin because Pat Riley looked good in
Italian wool or because the brawn of Anthony Mason and Charles
Oakley was good theater. It began because a team anchored by Ewing
began winning and winning. Since 1985, he is the largest reason
people began caring about the Knicks again.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing was roundly criticized this past week for his inability to
communicate his status to his teammates and coaches, for his
failure to speak to the news media while he was injured. He was
fined twice for that infraction, the first player in the history of
the game fined for such a transgression while on the injury list.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, we can't separate Patrick the person from Patrick the
player. They are completely different. The person is often an aloof
loner, who goes about his own ways. His best friends on the team,
Herb Williams and John Starks, are gone. His warrior mentality does
not mesh with the carefree demeanor of his younger, more athletic
teammates. Will this dynamic ruin the Knicks' chemistry?
</P>
<P>
   They play basketball for a living. They have to get along on the
court, not in a group home.
</P>
<P>
   Is Ewing uncomfortable trying to find his place among the
nouveau Knicks? Is he genuinely worried if he can ever be the
player he was, one of the top 50 ever and perhaps the most
proficient jump-shooting center in the history of the game?
</P>
<P>
   Instead of denigrating him for what he is not, maybe Ewing
should be appreciated for what he is, what he still has left. The
people responsible for the NBA's renaissance the past two decades _
Magic, Larry, Michael, Charles, David Robinson, Karl Malone, John
Stockton, Scottie Pippen and, yes, Ewing _ are dropping out, one by
one, leaving the game to others.
</P>
<P>
   The most telling scene came on Thursday afternoon in a
Philadelphia doctor's office. At the same time Iverson was leaving,
having had a cast cut off his broken thumb, Barkley was going in,
to check the status of a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his
left knee, a tear that ended his career.
</P>
<P>
   The sage took the youngster aside, hugged him and said it was
his turn now to make what he and the others will of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got so many guys who are not going to fill Michael
Jordan's shoes and Charles Barkley and those guys,'' Iverson said
Friday night at the Garden. ``A lot of us collectively could stick
our foot in that shoe. It probably still won't fit. But if we get a
group effort, it would be all right for this league to go on and be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   There are still a few holdovers left. One of them jumped center
for the Knicks on Friday night. He is not going to be around much
longer. His breed is fading into the landscape, making way for
quickness and youth. Here's hoping he finds his rhythm and gets his
championship ring before he's gone. Here's hoping people can admire
Patrick Ewing, the player, and stop judging him by Patrick Ewing,
the person.

REAL ESTATE: CITING PAPERWORK, TWO BROKERAGE CONCERNS ADD FEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ELEANOR CHARLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It will cost a bit more to buy or sell a house or condominium in
Connecticut if your broker is Prudential Connecticut Realty or
William Raveis Real Estate, two of the largest firms in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively modest amounts _ $150 and $195, respectively _
were imposed by Prudential in September and by Raveis last month
independently of each other. The charges, established by the
companies after what they described as many months of research,
were added, the brokerage concerns said, to defray the cost of
processing numerous government-required documents for all sales
transactions. So far, no other brokerage has followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   The charges are called ``regulatory compliance'' or
``paperwork'' fees. They are billed to the buyer, the seller, or
both, depending on whether the company represents the buyer, the
seller or both. The fee goes to the firm, not to the sales agent;
it is non-negotiable and totally separate from the brokerage
commission on the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the required documentation that a real estate company
must collect, Peter Helie, owner of Prudential Connecticut Realty,
reeled off ``dual agency forms'' (relating to representation of
buyer and seller), ``lead-paint forms, well-water testing, property
disclosure forms, termite and destroying-insect testing, credit
reporting, radon testing, formaldehyde disclosure, a new law
requiring all contractors to register every job and supply 15
references or the past two years' worth of references to the state
_ and a few more that I can't remember.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some records need to be stored for a minimum of three years,
some forever,'' he said, ``because if there's a consumer complaint
years down the road, you have to back up your position.''
</P>
<P>
   Helie contends that the explosion of legal, administrative and
storage costs and training expenses for the sales staff and
managers for instruction on compliance must be reckoned with. ``We
do 12,000 sales transactions a year,'' he said. At $150 per
transaction the new fees add up to $720,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   His concerns focus not only on the increase in state and federal
regulations requiring documentation, but on compliance with the
laws as well, he said. ``Noncompliance can result in state fines
starting at $2,000 and federal fine minimums of $10,000, plus
suspension of our license,'' Helie said. ``If we don't hand out the
federal lead-paint pamphlet and there's a problem, we have a
$10,000 fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Additional pressure, he said, is exerted by the public's growing
fascination with online real estate. ``It's cutting into our
business,'' Helie said. ``We will do what we have to, recertifying
the staff to communicate and do business online and draw contracts
online.'' He expects to see new laws governing the legality of an
online signature until the original can be obtained.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Real Estate Commission, a state agency, met on
Dec. 3 to begin considering recommendations for legislation on the
charges. But legally, Raveis and Prudential appear to be on safe
ground. ``There are currently no statutes in place in Connecticut
which would prohibit the charging of such a fee,'' said Rosamond
Koether, corporate attorney for the Raveis company.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Ficeto, managing attorney for the Department of Consumer
Protection, said the legislature probably would not be able to
eliminate the fees, but could require them to be negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the issue of a company's legal right to charge the
fee, said Ms. Ficeto, whose agency is the administrative arm of the
state's Real Estate Commission, is the term itself _ regulatory
compliance fee. ``It suggests that this is a state or federally
mandated fee,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Breunich, managing partner of William Pitt Real Estate in
Stamford, Conn., reacted angrily to the issue. ``We don't charge
fees that don't have value associated with them,'' he said. ``We
feel it's insulting to the customer and to our agents who would
have to ask for them. Yesterday there was no fee. Today you are
charging $150 or more to handle documents for asbestos and
lead-paint removal. What happened overnight?''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he was ``passionate about it because I feel it's
not good for the industry to have its leaders act this way.'' He
added that the charges were ``so opposed to the trust we've
established with the consumer over 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   An outside consultant advised Century 21 to consider charging
the fees, but Bud Farris, owner of Century 21 A&AMP;B Realty in
Stamford, said: ``Why? I've been storing paperwork for years. I
might as well charge the students in my real estate class for
collecting and storing their exam papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Schappert, owner of Buyers' Trust Real Estate in
Brookfield, is reminded of the $1,000 retainers that some buyer
brokers (those who represent only the buyer) charged when such
agencies first came into being. ``If you bought a house it was
applied to the commission,'' he said. ``If you didn't, you lost the
$1,000. It was not popular and it lasted barely a year. I wouldn't
think of charging compliance fees either.''
</P>
<P>
   In letters to various newspapers, John Lamb, an independent
Norwalk broker, wrote: ``Charging $195 for copying three pages of
required disclosures and handing out a 10-cent pamphlet on lead
paint is price gouging at its worst!''
</P>
<P>
   With the issue mired in controversy, Ms. Ficeto said, ``I've
been telling real estate people and the public who have been
calling us about this that the fee does not have to be paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers have the option to go elsewhere, but agents who
complete a transaction without collecting the fee will have it
deducted from their commissions, according to a Compliance Fee
Instruction Package sent by Raveis to all of its agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``An expensive home may make it worthwhile for the agent to pay
the fee,'' said Ms. Ficeto. But, she added, she believes that most
agents, rather than annoy a client in a normal sale, would be
inclined to pay the fee themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Blumenthal, the state's attorney general, is reviewing
the legality of the fees under current statutes. ``The fact that
only a couple of companies have begun charging them belies any
claim that they are needed,'' he said. ``If fees can be attributed
to a specific cost or service there might be some justification for
them. But the explanations I've seen, that they somehow relate to
asbestos or underground oil storage tanks, is extraordinarily lame.
They are simply fees that the companies are tacking onto their
commissions.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Reactions to the fees from individual agents and managers in the
various Prudential offices around the state have been guarded.
Terry Mercede, manager of Prudential's Danbury office, said: ``I
haven't had a problem up to now. Nobody has objected or walked out.
I'm not trying to avoid the issue, but I'm reluctant to talk about
it. This is where we are now, we don't know what the future will
bring.'' Attempts to get the names of customers to discover their
reactions were rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   At a Prudential office in Stamford, Elayne Jassey, a longtime
sales associate, said: ``Customers ask questions, but nobody has
walked out or objected. We're all feeling our way _ it's so new.''
</P>
<P>
   No Raveis agents or managers responded to requests for
information, but the company's instructional package includes
details similar to those described by Helie, and it states that the
compliance fee ``is disclosed on the listing agreement and the
buyer-broker contract.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once an offer becomes a contract and the closing attorney(s)
are selected,'' it says, ``they will be sent a bill for payment of
the fee.'' In certain cases where government-subsidized loans for
buyers, bank-owned homes and foreclosures are involved, Raveis will
absorb the fee.
</P>
<P>
   The instructional package compares the fee to those charged by
lawyers for long distance calls, travel, copying and postage, and
to mortgage and title company courier fees and document preparation
fees.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate compliance fees are not without precedent. In parts
of Florida, California and Pennsylvania, among other areas of the
country, Helie said, similar fees are charged, ranging from $110 to
$295. ``Corporate executives I've talked to at brainstorming
sessions in Stamford are surprised we didn't do this sooner,'' he
said. ``They've been doing it for years.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that other real estate companies would go along
with Prudential and Raveis because of the value to the consumer in
retaining crucial documentation on properties for future use by
home buyers and sellers, brokers, and the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Another new type of charge is being imposed by one agency to its
rental clients. Weichert Realty, with offices in Greenwich,
Stamford and Norwalk, appears to be the only company now charging a
$25 non-negotiable, nonreturnable ``registration fee'' for showing
houses and apartments to rental clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are watching our competitors with interest,'' said Peggy
Doepper, Connecticut manager for Coldwell Banker Residential Real
Estate, ``taking a wait-and-see attitude in evaluating the whole
situation.''

   Charles Barkley has railed against young players the past few
years, as if he were Jack Lemmon or Walter Matthau and the rest of
the NB A was composed of uppity youngsters about to knock over his
mailbox with a bat. But there he was last Thursday, the day after
his career ended, walking into a Philadelphia physician's office at
the same time Allen Iverson was walking out.
</P>
<P>
   The broken-down vet with a career-ending knee injury. The young
buck having a cast removed from his thumb, almost all better again.
You could not stage this sort of symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing I got out of seeing Charles that way,'' Iverson
began, ``was that I always said once I started playing basketball
that I would play every game like it was my last, because I owed
that to myself and I owed it to God just for giving me the talent.
And to see Charles like that, it put my whole career in
perspective. Because it can be last your last game; any night can
be your last game.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, who had often taken Iverson to task for not treating
the game more like a privilege than a birthright, did not lecture
Iverson the day after his knee injury ended his career. He merely
told Iverson that it was indeed his league now, to not let the news
media bother him, to play hard and to cherish the game as much as
he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that went on with me and Charles, I feel even worse
now because of how he left the game _ and it being in the city that
I'm playing for and the city that loves him more than anybody,''
Iverson said Friday night at Madison Square Garden, where his 76ers
played the Knicks. ``It's tough to watch that, but it was important
for me to show him my love and my respect. I cared about him as a
person and I wish him well, and I meant that. And every word that
he said to me are words that I'll cherish for the rest of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows where Iverson goes from here, whether he is saying
what everyone wants him to say or genuinely feels different about
his career since his encounter with Barkley. And who knows if we'll
ever see Barkley on the floor again. Like Magic Johnson before him,
he needs an audience. He's 99 percent retired, but you never know.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, he was one of the best entertainers the game has
ever seen. And after all his transgressions and ill-timed remarks,
what Barkley's career was truly about had nothing to do with him
not winning a title.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between his rookie night with the 76ers at the
Spectrum and last Wednesday night with the Houston Rockets in
Philadelphia, Charles Barkley transformed himself from a young,
unthinking knucklehead into a folk hero who understood how lucky he
was to have had a chance to play in the NBA. Neither Iverson nor
anyone else will ever have his charisma, but they can find his
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether I play good or bad, I'm just fortunate and happy
enough to be out on the court regardless,'' Iverson said. ``Whether
I get this award or that award, it doesn't mean anything to me.
Just the fact that I'm in the NBA is enough for me. I'll play every
game like it's my last and cherish every game. Because just like it
happened to Charles 16 years later, it could happen to me.''

YO, ADRIAN  
 GLARE IS ON AN OWNER
</HEADLINE>
   (With BKN-NOTEBOOK-BARKLEY) 
(rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Boston Herald has used the headline ``Yo, Adrian'' while
trumpeting the quick start of Celtics rookie Adrian Griffin. Given
the Rockyesque nature of his story, including that he was actually
playing in Europe a year ago, the headline is as appropriate as it
is cornball.
</P>
<P>
   Never before has a 25-year-old won the NBA rookie of the year
award, but perhaps the one player who may give the Clippers' Lamar
Odom a decent run this season is Griffin, who makes his Madison
Square Garden debut Sunday against the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's too old,'' his teammate Paul Pierce joked.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, a 6-foot-5-inch swingman, has started all 17 Celtics
games. He is shooting 53 percent from the field and averaging 33.1
minutes, 10.1 points, 7.4 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 2.1 steals.
Modest numbers for a top rookie. Unreal numbers for a training-camp
invitee who was hardly expected to make the team.
</P>
<P>
   Undrafted out of Seton Hall, Griffin spent three seasons with
the Connecticut Pride of the Continental Basketball Association. At
one time or another since college, he had been passed over by
Miami, Golden State, Philadelphia, Milwaukee and Dallas. At 25, he
was beginning to think the NBA would never beckon again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at all those guys who made it from the CBA, guys like
Chris Childs and especially Mario Elie,'' Griffin said via cell
phone from Boston on Friday before scoring nine points in the
Celtics' 100-96 victory over Houston. ``Whenever things weren't
going well, I always tried to look at it like, `Those guys made
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the statistics, coach Rick Pitino noticed the intangibles
about Griffin: the way the ball moves when he is on the floor, the
way he uses his body on defensive assignments and the way the
Celtics have become better with him on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's very few people in this league in this day that really
know how to play the game,'' Larry Bird said recently. ``That kid's
got the talent to just go out there and play because he knows what
he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   If he has taken his game to another level, Griffin's salary and
comforts took flight, too. He went from Motel 6 and $1,300 a month
in the CBA to the Four Seasons and $385,000 a year in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite different,'' Griffin said. ``The pay is definitely
much better. Really, it's unbelievable how much money we make. You
could live off that and your family could live off that for
generations. It's just a blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of the league's genuine feel-good tales this season,
Griffin has gone from the status of anonymous rookie to near
celebrity in Boston. He knows his NBA existence could change
quickly, but he has not forgotten to enjoy the start of what may be
a long career in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, it was kind of weird,'' he said. ``I'd see
guys on television, like Kenny Anderson and Antoine Walker. To
actually be playing with them and against other NBA players, I
still haven't gotten over that I'm actually here. I've settled in a
little bit. But it's still a great feeling, especially where I came
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Glare Is on an Owner &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From corporate offices in Charlotte to the Olympic Tower in
Manhattan, people were watching television at work on Friday
afternoon. The programming did not come from nba.com but from Court
TV, where George Shinn, the principal owner of the Hornets, was
being tried on charges of sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   With each sexually explicit piece of testimony on the stand, one
wondered how much more embarrassment the Hornets franchise and the
league could take.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond making money, one of the precepts of the collective
bargaining agreement is the league's and the players' need to put
out a wholesome product. During the labor negotiations, players
were asked to agree to various measures in the name of promoting
the league and enhancing their image.
</P>
<P>
   Along those lines, a more comprehensive drug agreement was put
into place and a provision against a player's attacking his coach
was agreed to by both sides. That rule, an outgrowth of Latrell
Sprewell's choking P.J. Carlesimo two years ago, states that a
player will have his contract terminated if he attacks his coach.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what happens when an owner is accused of sexually assaulting
several women? When does Shinn's appearance on Court TV in
midafternoon become detrimental enough to the league's image that
the NBA decides to take action? Commissioner David Stern may
actually be subpoenaed to testify at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, Stern must do something. The language from the
NBA constitution that the league has repeatedly cited in regard to
the the recent sexual allegations surrounding the Knicks in 1997 in
Charleston, S.C., refers to behavior that is ``materially
detrimental or materially prejudicial to the team or league.''
</P>
<P>
   Shouldn't that passage apply to everyone affiliated with the
NBA?
</P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a 10th-grader, Chevie Kehoe was an honor student who dreamed
of joining the Air Force and becoming a pilot. His parents, white
supremacists who despised the federal government, took him out of
school and urged him to become a white warrior instead. He
objected, but not for long.
</P>
<P>
   By the age of 24, Kehoe was one of the most notorious white
supremacists in the United States, having engaged in a kidnapping,
three robberies, three murders and two police shootouts, all in a
quest to establish an Aryan republic for white people.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his violent journey from talented and well-liked
teen-ager to merciless terrorist, Kehoe, now 26 and serving life in
prison, blames his family for his troubles. In a lengthy interview
in jail shortly after his sentencing, the only interview he has
given since his arrest in 1997, he said, ``In my entire life, my
dad always hated this or hated that and never gave me something to
love or something to work toward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was extremely confusing, because you get left with this bag
of anger, and you have no place to focus, you have nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   As self-serving as Kehoe's comments are _ he also maintains his
innocence and accuses his mother of framing him _ they help
illuminate the power of family pressure to twist and distort a
young life, especially in the isolated environment of the country's
anti-government movements, and to turn promise into poison.
</P>
<P>
   Chevie Kehoe was born in 1973 and named after his father's
favorite car, the Chevrolet. The father, Kirby Kehoe, was a skilled
auto mechanic who had served with the Navy in Vietnam and had
returned with a skin rash that ultimately was diagnosed as a rare
form of cancer. He blamed exposure to Agent Orange.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Chevie was born, Kehoe moved his family from
Florida to the mountains of western North Carolina to get away from
the crowds, settling in Sam's Gap, N.C. It was the beginning of
years of isolation and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Their home was destroyed by fire, and unable to rebuild, the
Kehoes lived in a garage with no plumbing, no insulation and no
heat. A neighbor, Dixie Lee Tipton, remembers buying Chevie and his
brothers beds; they had been sleeping on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tipton recalls Chevie as ``the most beautiful little child
I had ever seen, and very, very polite.'' In elementary school in
nearby Mars Hill, he was an ``A'' student in a class for the gifted
and talented.
</P>
<P>
   In jail many years later, he recalled having many friends, but
no close ones. And when Mrs. Tipton offered to take the boys to
church, Mrs. Kehoe refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad didn't like other people,'' Chevie Kehoe said. ``He was
concerned about bad habits rubbing off on us.''
</P>
<P>
   The pattern continued in 1985 when Kirby Kehoe moved his family
to Washington state, where he eventually bought a cabin on 20 acres
near Deep Lake, a mountain community near the Idaho border.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kirby Kehoe worked a series of jobs as a mechanic. His father,
Doyle Kehoe, said in an interview that he ``could never hold a
job,'' adding: ``Everyone he worked for cheated him. He always
didn't get along.''
</P>
<P>
   Chevie Kehoe put it this way: ``Dad didn't do well. He was too
independent. He didn't like to have a boss.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Chevie entered Colville Junior High School, 25 miles from Deep
Lake, as a ninth-grader in 1987. Kent Roberts, a science teacher,
remembered him as an honor student, well-liked, happy to help out
after school or on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to run track, but his parents refused to allow it. His
friends, he said, were not welcome at home; his parents grew
marijuana, and they did not want people coming around who might
talk about it. He did manage to go to a school dance after Mrs.
Roberts tailored one of her husband's suits to fit him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the parents pulled Chevie and his younger brother
Cheyne out of public school, and from then on home-schooled their
sons _ eventually they had eight. ``My father saw school as a
threat,'' Chevie Kehoe said, adding that, in his case, home
schooling did not work well. ``My mom is not a teacher. She didn't
have patience. She didn't have her education. I ended up being
self-taught. At 15, I told myself, `I'm not going anywhere.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Kehoes were anti-government white separatists, followers of
the Christian Identity religion, which teaches that whites are the
chosen people and that Jews are the descendants of Satan.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was extremely racist, extremely anti-Semitic in the
sense he would like to exterminate anything that's not white,''
Chevie Kehoe said. ``If they're not white, then they don't have the
right to exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on the Kehoe boys to come around to their parents'
way of thinking was intense. Chevie won small battles, getting a
driver's license and a Social Security number despite their
disapproval. And at 17, he said, ``I was eight hours away from
signing up with the Navy. I had a person who was going to drive me
to the recruiting office in Spokane.''
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, he said, his hero had been the actor Tom Cruise in
``Top Gun'': ``Not because it was violent. Not because he had
power. It had to do with freedom. I wanted to fly.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did not go to Spokane. ``My dad talked me out of it,'' he
said. Instead, he married a neighbor, Karena Gumm, and a year later
they had a daughter.
</P>
<P>
   They had met in junior high school, he remembered. ``Both of us
were virgins. That was a long time and a lot of innocence ago.''
</P>
<P>
   By then Chevie had entered his parents' separatist world. He
occasionally attended potluck suppers at the Ark, a Christian
Identity church not far from Deep Lake. Once, he listened to a
lecture there by the widow of Gordon Kahl, an anti-tax activist who
had become a martyr to the white right.
</P>
<P>
   He and his parents also began to study the ideas of Robert
Mathews, who had formed an underground terrorist group, the Order,
in the Pacific Northwest years before. Mathews died in 1984 in a
fiery shootout with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with his concept of separatism,'' Chevie Kehoe said of
Mathews. ``I agree with his concept that the government is not
truly for the people. I respected his dedication. I respected him
as a man, as an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   He also met Mathews' widow at the Aryan Nations compound near
Hayden Lake, Idaho. And his thinking hardened in 1992, he said,
when agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms raided the home of a family friend, Del Knudson.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to see the government come up there with all these
police cars and helicopters and all that,'' he said, ``and tear his
house apart, tear books off shelves, confiscate computer disks,
confiscate every firearm he had, go through his garage, handcuff
his wife, terrorize his children _ to see that the government has
that type of power, you know something's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As time passed, Chevie Kehoe came to imagine that he might
someday achieve Robert Mathews' goal: a whites-only nation. He
wanted to call it the Aryan People's Republic.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when Chevie was 21, Kirby and Gloria Kehoe moved their
family to Kingston, Ark., in the Ozarks. There, they became friends
with a gun dealer, William Mueller, and his wife, Nancy. They
traveled the same gun show circuit, shared anti-government views,
and identified with the Christian Identity religion.
</P>
<P>
   But friendship did not stand in the way of profit. In January
1995, Kirby and Chevie Kehoe burglarized the Muellers' home in
Tilly, Ark., and took thousands of dollars' worth of guns and gold
and silver coins.
</P>
<P>
   Chevie Kehoe then returned to Washington, on the way stopping at
Elohim City, a Christian Identity community in Oklahoma, where he
asked an escaped convict, Faron Lovelace, to accompany him for
protection.
</P>
<P>
   On June 12, 1995, Kirby and Chevie Kehoe mounted another
fund-raising operation in Colville, Wash., sending Lovelace into
the home of two well-to-do grocery store owners, Malcolm and
Jillian Friedman. Lovelace later said he targeted the Friedmans
because he thought they were Jewish and would be easy to kill if
something went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Lovelace held Friedman hostage and ordered Mrs. Friedman to go
out and collect cash. Then he forced the Friedmans to go to
Spokane, where he set them free.
</P>
<P>
   The money from the Arkansas and Washington crimes went to buy
land near Priest River, Idaho, where Chevie Kehoe planned to set up
a training camp for revolutionaries, prosecutors in his trial said.
</P>
<P>
   By winter, the money was gone, and knowing that William Mueller
had come into a $50,000 inheritance, Chevie Kehoe decided to rob
him again. This time, his accomplice was Danny Lee, a skinhead from
Oklahoma with lightning bolts tattooed on his neck. Lee was known
as ``Cyclops'' because he had lost an eye in a bar fight.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 11, 1996, Kehoe and Lee, disguised as federal agents,
broke into the Muellers' home and waited for the family to return.
It was almost summer by the time the remains of the family _ the
father, mother and 8-year-old daughter, Sarah _ were found in the
Illinois Bayou near Russellville. A woman who was fishing hooked a
shoe and a bone.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kehoe later told investigators that her son told her about
his role in the Mueller murders shortly after the crime, but that
she kept quiet. That July 1996, the Kehoe family had moved to
another remote home, in Yaak, Mont. Cheyne and his wife and son
lived nearby until that winter, when Chevie came to get them. The
two brothers and their families drove south together to look for
work in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Cheyne knew nothing about the murders until they were traveling
together and Chevie began selling guns because they could not find
work. At that point his brother told him, Cheyne later told
investigators, because some of the guns had been stolen from the
Muellers.
</P>
<P>
   By then, investigators were tracing other Mueller guns to the
Kehoes. Shortly after the family disappeared, the pistol from an
empty gun box found in the house was recovered at a Seattle pawn
shop and traced to Kirby Kehoe. Months later, another Mueller gun,
an AR-15 rifle, was recovered from Sean Haines, a former Aryan
Nations youth leader. It had been sold by Chevie Kehoe.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers' luck ran out as they traveled through Ohio, where
a state trooper stopped them for driving with expired plates.
Chevie broke away from being searched because he was carrying a
gun, and Cheyne opened fire. The ensuing gun battle, caught on
videotape by a camera on the trooper's dashboard, was broadcast
nationwide. But both brothers escaped.
</P>
<P>
   With help from their parents, the brothers and their families
escaped to Utah, where the men found work under assumed names. But
according to Cheyne Kehoe and his wife, Tanna, Chevie's behavior
became more violent and erratic. When Chevie said he was thinking
of killing his parents so he could raise his younger brothers
himself, Cheyne decided he had to be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Cheyne surrendered on June 16, 1997. The next day, using his
information, the FBI arrested Chevie Kehoe.
</P>
<P>
   Chevie Kehoe was charged with federal racketeering counts that
included the three murders. At his trial in Little Rock this year,
the principal witnesses for the prosecution were his brother Cheyne
and his mother, Gloria.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Gloria Kehoe had called the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms and said her husband had struck her and pointed an
AR-15 rifle at her. ``My husband was going to kill me,'' she said.
``I knew too much. I wanted my nightmare to be over.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria and Cheyne Kehoe told the jury that Chevie Kehoe
confessed to them that he and Danny Lee had surprised the Muellers,
handcuffed the parents, stunned them with an electric stun gun and
taped plastic bags over their heads to suffocate. Then they had
forced 8-year-old Sarah to tell them where her parents' valuables
were hidden. Then, when Danny Lee said he could not kill a child,
Chevie Kehoe killed her.
</P>
<P>
   Chevie Kehoe was sentenced to three life terms. Lee was
sentenced to death. Cheyne had been sentenced to 24 years for the
Ohio shootout, and Kirby Kehoe had been sentenced to 44 months in
prison after pleading guilty to racketeering charges and admitting
he belonged to his son's white supremacist organization.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Chevie Kehoe said afterward that his mother's testimony
shattered him. ``What more powerful witness can you put on the
stand than a person's mother?'' he asked. He said he told himself:
``It's not Mom up there. It's somebody I don't know. Mom wouldn't
do this to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He contended that his mother, with six sons still at home,
agreed to testify because she was afraid the government would
prosecute her for tax evasion in the sale of the family's property
in Arkansas, where she had used a false Social Security number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her husband was in prison,'' Chevie Kehoe said. ``My brother
was in prison. I'm in prison. If she's in prison, where do her six
children go? I was the sacrifice to save my other brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In August, when Kirby Kehoe was sentenced, Judge G. Thomas
Eisele of U.S. District Court said he was sorry that sentencing
guidelines would not let him impose a longer sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're dealing with here is the man who is the father of
Chevie Kehoe, the man who raised Chevie Kehoe,'' he said. Although
Kirby Kehoe was not responsible for all his son's deeds, Eisele
said, ``he was a major factor in his son's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Chevie Kehoe put it this way: ``I'm the one left at the end of
the chain of these people's beliefs.''

WHITEY KUROWSKI, 81, BASEBALL HERO OF 1940S 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Pa.)  (lb) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whitey Kurowski, who surmounted a severe arm injury as a
youngster and became one of the major leagues' top third basemen of
the 1940s and a World Series hero for the St. Louis Cardinals, died
on Thursday at a physical rehabilitation center in Shillington, Pa.
He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Kurowski, who lived in Shillington, had been in failing health
since suffering a stroke after heart bypass surgery in July,
according to his wife, Joan.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon of Oct. 5, 1942, a remarkable stretch of World
Series success for the Yankees came to an end with one swing by a
rookie infielder. George ``Whitey'' Kurowski's two-run home run off
Red Ruffing into the left-field stands at Yankee Stadium in the
ninth inning of game five propelled the Cardinals to a 4-2 victory
and a Series title, the first time the Yankees had been beaten in
nine trips to the Series since they were defeated by the Cards in
1926.
</P>
<P>
   That Kurowski was even in a major-league uniform defied the
odds. When he was growing up in Reading, Pa., he fell off a fence
and landed in broken glass, severely cutting his right arm.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he began suffering severe pain and was found to
have developed osteomyelitis, a bone inflammation. Three inches of
bone above his wrist were surgically removed, leaving the arm
weakened and with an unnatural bend. He strengthened his arm
muscles as he embarked on a baseball career, but his right arm, his
throwing arm, had become shorter than his left.
</P>
<P>
   Kurowski had to surmount emotional trauma as well. His brother
Frank was killed in a mine accident in 1937, just before Kurowski
left for his first minor-league season, and his father died of a
heart attack just as he was breaking into the Cardinal lineup in
1942.
</P>
<P>
   He would go on to an outstanding career over nine major-league
seasons, all with the Cardinals. Kurowski played on four World
Series teams, was named a National League All-Star four times,
batted over .300 three times and finished with a career batting
average of .286. He twice led the league's third basemen in
fielding. His best season was 1947, when he hit .310 with 27 home
runs, 104 RBIs and 108 runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   The high point of his career was that World Series-winning home
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We nearly killed Whitey when he crossed the plate,'' the star
Cardinal shortstop Marty Marion recalled. ``I remember tackling
him, and we mobbed him until he begged for us to let him go.''
</P>
<P>
   In the clubhouse, Kurowski was hoisted on his teammates'
shoulders and then did something almost as audacious as sinking the
Yankees: He mussed the white hair of the dignified and stern
baseball commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis. ``I messed up his
hair pretty good, and that was a first,'' Kurowski remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Kurowski retired after the 1949 season and then managed in the
minors.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, George Jr.
and James; two daughters, Joanne Osterman and Georgeann
Waldbiesser; a brother, Edmund; two sisters, Bernice Kurowski and
Josephine Smith; nine grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   After his World Series-winning homer, the hometown fans in
Reading gave Kurowski a parade. But his off-season celebrity status
was otherwise limited to one radio guest spot, with the bandleader
Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians. As Kurowski recalled it, ``I
got $25 and a record album.''

SAMARANCH GETS IOC TO APPROVE REFORM PLAN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Members of the International Olympic
Committee compliantly fell into line Saturday with the insistence
of Juan Antonio Samaranch that they begin instituting legitimate,
if incremental, reform in an attempt to restore credibility to the
badly damaged Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
   The 93 voting delegates unanimously voted to end their unlimited
memberships and to restrict future presidents to a maximum of 12
years in office, as well as to select 15 active athletes to the
IOC. The session will continue Sunday with a vote on the
contentious issue of whether to allow delegates to visit cities
bidding on the Winter and Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   The 79-year-old Samaranch has called for an end to the visits,
but the IOC is said to be split on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's reforms will not immediately change the makeup of
the IOC in any substantive manner, nor will they represent an
overhaul in the way it operates. Rather, they represent another
step in a continuing attempt to convince the public, corporate
sponsors and lawmakers that the IOC has begun to transform itself
into a more open, accountable and less corrupt organization a year
after the Salt Lake City bidding scandal was disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the IOC has been transformed from being a small,
personal organization through its history into something as
transparent as we could make it and responsive to the tasks now
before it,'' said former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger,
who was the most visible outside member of an 82-person reform
commission that has been working since June.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant reforms enacted Saturday reduced the age
limit for new IOC members from 80 to 70 and subjected all delegates
to re-election every eight years. Previously, they did not have to
face re-election. Current members can still serve until age 80.
Supporters of the age and term limits said the changes will allow
for more frequent turnover in delegates. Of the 102 current
delegates, 66 are 60 or older.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must obligate the IOC to renew itself more quickly than in
the past,'' said Franco Carraro, a delegate from Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have said that renewable terms are not term limits at
all, and that the IOC will continue to perpetuate itself in an
essentially closed operation. In any case, the IOC will undergo an
extended transition period.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will increase to as many as 130 members until 2003
with an eventual limit of 115 _ 70 selected at large, 15 athletes,
15 presidents of international sports federations and 15 presidents
of national Olympic committees. Complete turnover of the current
IOC membership may not occur until 2047, when the youngest
delegate, 32-year-old Prince William of Orange turns 80.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates also voted unanimously Saturday to restrict future
IOC presidents to an eight-year term, plus a second term of four
years. This is intended to prevent leaders in the future from
gaining the same autocratic hold on office that Samaranch has held
since being elected in 1980. Before the vote on presidential term
limits, a surreal moment occurred when the governing styles of the
Rotary Club and the former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin were invoked.
</P>
<P>
   Philipp von Schoeller of Austria suggested that the IOC follow
the procedures of the Rotary Club in electing ingoing and outgoing
presidents. Maj. Gen. Francis Nyangweso, a former military leader
in Amin's government who noted that he had ``lived in a country
with an unstable presidency,'' cautioned the delegates to limit
future IOC presidents to four-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we will have chance for change,'' Nyangweso said.
``Otherwise, we will have coups around here.''
</P>
<P>
   The ease with which Saturday's measures were passed reflected,
in large part, the shrewdness of Samaranch, who received a vote of
confidence by 86-2 from the delegates last March. He has since
convinced the members that serious reform was necessary, and he
helped solidify the necessary votes by naming 41 IOC members to the
reform commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the members who don't like the medicine take it, because
he's a leader with a proven track record,'' said Kevan Gosper, a
member of the IOC executive board from Australia.
</P>
<P>
   While saying that change was necessary and unavoidable,
Samaranch also persisted Saturday in blaming ``pressure'' from bid
cities for much of the culture of corruption in the IOC. That
culture was fully exposed in the past year with the disclosure that
Salt Lake City officials who successfully bid on the 2002 Winter
Games had given millions of dollars in cash payments, scholarships,
free medical treatments and gifts to the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have been facing harsh criticism, very often unfair,''
Samaranch told the IOC delegates. ``You have gone through
undeserved sufferings and pains. I have suffered, too. We all
suffered. Believe me, there was no alternative but to work hard to
solve the crisis. We did it.''
</P>
<P>
   The athletes who are candidates for IOC membership include Bob
Ctvrtlik, a volleyball player from the United States; Hassiba
Boulmerka, a 1,500-meter runner from Algeria; Sergei Bubka, the
pole-vaulter from Ukraine; Johann Olav Koss, the Norwegian
speedskater, and Alexander Popov, the Russian swimmer. All are gold
medalists.

TAMING THE GREAT OUTDOORS
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Monday, Dec. 13)  
(lb) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As someone whose main objection to the ``outdoor experience'' is
that it is outdoors, I sympathize with those rugged individuals who
filled out the following comment cards at the Bridger-Teton
National Forest in Wyoming:
</P>
<P>
   _ Trails need to be wider so people can walk while holding
hands.
</P>
<P>
   While holding hands is fine in most circumstances, I'm not sure
it's such a hot idea while navigating a twisting, turning
wilderness trail. For one thing, the person whose hand you are
holding may slip and fall down a steep precipice, dragging you with
her unless you are alert enough to quickly let go. Also, holding
another person's hand can slow you down while running away from a
bloodthirsty bear, land-shark, squirrel or other dangerous woodland
beast.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I agree that nature trails should be made as wide as
possible so I don't scratch the sides of my car.
</P>
<P>
   _ Trails need to be reconstructed. Please avoid building trails
that go uphill.
</P>
<P>
   In mountainous regions, it is unavoidable that some trails go
uphill. Still, this is America, and there's no reason why
escalators can't be installed in these areas or burly rangers made
available to carry tired hikers to their destination.
</P>
<P>
   _ Too many bugs and leeches and spiders and spider webs. Please
spray the wilderness to rid the area of these pests.
</P>
<P>
   Amen to that. It would also be nice if park management built a
coal-fired power-plant nearby to enhance the color of the sunsets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Please pave the trails so they can be plowed of snow during
the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Right on. To me, nothing says ``wilderness'' like the sound of a
20-ton, 180-horsepower John Deere crawler-dozer firing up its
diesel engine on a frosty winter morning. Equipped with altitude
compensation, turbocharger and a 207-inch blade, this baby can not
only scrape the snow off any trail you care to name, it can also be
counted on to scare off any annoying wildlife that would otherwise
detract from your outdoor experience.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chairlifts need to be in some places so that we can get to
wonderful views without having to hike to them.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know. Chairlifts tend to give me vertigo. Plus, unless
the chairlift is enclosed and equipped with heating and
air-conditioning, you are still at the mercy of the dreaded
elements, including sun, wind and, worst of all, rain. It is
probably a better bet to just stay in the visitors center and load
up on postcards.
</P>
<P>
   _ Need more signs to keep area pristine.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking along the lines of the flashing-neon variety, the
kind you need sunglasses to look at or risk going blind. Messages
could include: Danger! Uphill trail ahead! or Warning! Spraying for
leeches! Do not breathe air!
</P>
<P>
   _ A McDonalds would be nice at the trailhead.
</P>
<P>
   Tell me about it. What wouldn't taste better before a hard day's
ride on the escalator than a nice, lukewarm Big Mac and a side of
greasy fries? It certainly couldn't be any worse than the vile
``trail mixes'' that serious hikers pretend so hard to enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Too many rocks in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   My sentiments exactly. The way I look at it, if rocks are so
cool, then why are the ones at Disney World artificial? My
suggestion is that while they're paving the trails, installing the
escalators and spraying for leeches, they remove all the
unnecessary rocks and replace them with softer, more lifelike,
fiberglass imitations. When the glow of the McDonalds sign reflects
off them at just the right angle, the view is unforgettable.

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Ever since the Seattle Mariners began trying
to trade Ken Griffey Jr. last month, the prevailing view in
baseball circles was that they would trade baseball's ranking No. 1
player to the Cincinnati Reds. Jim Bowden, the Reds' general
manager, shot the prevailing view out of the sky Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``After five weeks of attempting to negotiate a trade for Ken
Griffey Jr.,'' Bowden said, ``the Reds today have pulled out and no
longer will pursue a trade for Ken Griffey Jr. Neither side has
moved in five weeks. It's a waste of time to continue to have
discussions and meetings when we get absolutely nowhere. We haven't
moved a centimeter, let alone an inch.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden made his announcement at an unusual news conference at
the winter meetings at the Anaheim Marriott Hotel. General managers
usually do not call news conferences to announce what they are not
doing.
</P>
<P>
   But the Griffey matter has captivated the attention of everyone
in baseball because it is not every year that a player of his
caliber is traded. Now the question is whether the Mariners will be
able to meet the center fielder's request and find a team for him
closer to his home in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Gillick, the Mariners' general manager, said he would
continue to talk with other teams. ``We have a difference of
opinion in personnel,'' he said of the Reds. ``Jim has the right to
think as he wishes for the Reds, and we have a right to maintain a
position with the Seattle club.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillick declined to say which other teams he was talking with,
but acknowledged he would most likely talk to the New York Mets
during the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Some people keep trying to paint the Mets as serious contenders
for Griffey, but they have not made an offer for him and the
Mariners have not told them what they would want in return.
</P>
<P>
   Gillick's talks with the Reds, Bowden said, broke down over one
player. Bowden declined to identify him, but he was believed to be
Pokey Reese, the Reds' second baseman, whom his manager, Jack
McKeon, calls the best in the National League defensively at his
position. Reese, 26 years old, made seven errors in 146 games,
batted .285 and had 38 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a certain player that that was key for them and we
were not going to trade that player,'' Bowden said. ``We told them
that at one of the first meetings. We never wavered off that. We
just can't get past that particular player.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said he made an extended series of offers, one a
five-player package, several with four players involved, the last
two with three players, ``different variants of quality and
quantity,'' he said. ``We put in proven players, top prospects, we
put in impact type, top-of-the-line quality players both at the
major league level and the minor league level. They just weren't
the names they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden hasn't identified any of those players, but he is
believed to have included at one time or another starting pitchers
Denny Neagle and Brett Tomko, reliever Scott Williamson (National
League rookie of the year) and outfielders Mike Cameron, Dmitri
Young and Michael Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made significant offers to them,'' Bowden said, ``offers
that if I were on that side and I had a player who was going to be
a free agent at the end of 2000, I would make a deal in their
shoes. We made that type of offers and it didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden and Gillick had one last meeting Saturday. It lasted
about 35 minutes and ended as did all of their other meetings or
telephone conversations in the past five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``After five weeks of no progress,'' Bowden related, ``Pat
Gillick and I shook hands and agreed not to continue any more
discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Was there a possibility that they, nevertheless, would start
talks again at some point? ``No chance at all, zero,'' Bowden said.
``It's behind us. The next time we'll pursue him is if he becomes a
free agent at the end of 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said the Reds wanted to acquire Griffey, whom he
described as his personal favorite, for one season, then see the
kind of economic impact he made in Cincinnati before they
considered negotiating a long-term contract that would be the
richest in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to see if he would have the effect that Mark McGwire
had in St. Louis,'' the general manager said.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's father, Ken Sr., is the Reds' hitting coach and the
presumed manager-in-waiting. The Reds figured that if they could
trade for Griffey now they would have an edge in having him stay
because of his father. But now they'll have to see if they can get
him as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said he was somewhat optimistic in his chances of getting
Griffey only once, when Chuck Armstrong, the Mariners' president,
called him last Friday. ``I felt possibly from a negotiating
perspective maybe they were considering blinking at that point,''
he said, ``but it never happened.'' &QL;

CLINTON ADMITS `DON'T ASK' STANCE HAS BEEN FAILURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (Eds: This story is now on page 1 of The New York Times.) 
(lb) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ President Clinton said Saturday that he
agreed with his wife that the military's ``don't ask, don't tell''
policy in dealing with homosexuals had been a failure, and he
accused military leaders of not enforcing it properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's out of whack, and I don't think any serious person could
say it's not,'' the president said in a radio interview with CBS
News. He noted that he adopted the policy in 1993 after Congress
rejected his proposal to end separate treatment of gay men and
lesbians in the military.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Hillary Rodham Clinton told a group of gay
contributors that she would work to overturn the policy if she
became a senator from New York.
</P>
<P>
   In his interview Saturday, Clinton said, ``For me, what's
important is that the policy as implemented does not work as I
announced and as the leaders of our military at the time in 1993
pledged to implement it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was here for a convention of the Florida state
Democratic Party. He gave a speech defending affirmative action and
urged Floridians to reject efforts to curtail its use to overcome
the effects of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In his first campaign for president in 1992, Clinton promised to
lift the military's longstanding ban on service by homosexuals in
the military. The issue surfaced only occasionally during the
campaign, but it dominated Clinton's first weeks in office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Most senior military officials were vehemently against any
change in the policy of excluding gays from the military.
</P>
<P>
   They were supported by most Republicans in Congress and many
important Democrats, including Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, then
chairman of the Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the president retreated from his campaign promise, the
lawmakers said, they would write into law the regulation barring
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   As a compromise, the president settled for the ``don't ask,
don't tell'' policy. Under it, homosexual activity is prohibited.
But gay men and lesbians may serve in the armed forces if they do
not disclose their sexuality, and the military is not supposed to
initiate unfounded inquiries about homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the policy satisfied no one _ neither those
who wanted to retain the ban nor gay rights advocates who wanted it
lifted entirely.
</P>
<P>
   In his radio interview Saturday, Clinton said, ``The reason I
went for `don't ask, don't tell' is that it's all I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped the beating death of a gay soldier at Fort
Campbell, Ky., last July would ``give some sobering impetus to a
re-examination about how this policy is implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me remind you that the original intent was that people
would not be rooted out, that they would not be questioned,'' the
president said, and that homosexuality ``would not be sufficient to
keep them out of the military or subject them to harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the Florida Democrats, Clinton said,
``Affirmative action actually began under a Republican
administration, back when both parties were really committed to
civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said no one could ``make a serious case that we'd be
better off if we were growing more divided by walking away from one
of the tools that helped to bring us together as a nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward Connerly, a conservative black businessman and opponent of
affirmative action who successfully advocated a ballot initiative
on the issue in California, has been pressing a similar campaign in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But the state Supreme Court, which must review such ballot
initiatives before they can be put before the voters, appears
likely to take so long that the question will not be put on the
Florida ballot in the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asserted that ``Mr. Connerly is wrong in wanting to end
affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Toiv, a spokesman for Clinton, said the president believed
that Connerly's efforts in Florida were ``extremely divisive,'' and
that ``it's important for leaders to speak out against them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, before leaving his hotel in Disney World here,
Clinton met for about 45 minutes with Nelson Mandela, the elder
statesman of South Africa, who has been visiting the United States.
</P>
<P>
   They discussed prospects for peace in the Middle East, among
other issues, Toiv said. On Wednesday, Clinton announced that Syria
and Israel had agreed to hold peace talks in Washington this week
to try to resolve their long-running dispute over control of the
Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Toiv said, ``Mr. Mandela believes that Mr. Clinton can play a
unique role in the Middle East,'' and the former president of South
Africa urged Clinton to make every effort to achieve that
potential.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela also told Clinton about his plans for negotiations in
Burundi. Mandela was recently asked to lead new peace efforts in
Burundi, where at least 150,000 people have been killed in six
years of civil war and ethnic fighting.
</P>
<P>
   In his regular Saturday radio address, Clinton announced plans
Saturday to improve the safety of imported food and to reduce the
number of illnesses caused by eggs infected with salmonella
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, foreign-grown food products that are
rejected because of a serious public-health or safety violation
will be destroyed, so they cannot be brought into the United States
at another port. Often, federal officials said, importers whose
cargo is denied entry at one port try to introduce it at another
port.

   FARMLAND LOSS IS PAVING THE WAY FOR SOUTHERN GROWTH
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Southern Sun Belt states are paying for their
population and economic growth with drastic reductions in farmland
and open space, according to a new survey of agricultural lands.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Resources
Inventory ranked five Southeastern states in the top 10 for acreage
converted to urban and other uses and put seven in the top 15. The
survey, covering the years 1992-97, reflects what many Southerners
already know _ asphalt is rapidly replacing rolling fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate at which we're paving over good, productive working
land is accelerating at a horrifying speed,'' said Ralph Grossi,
president of the American Farmland Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Texas was again the top state, with 243,000 acres lost annually,
followed by Pennsylvania, which saw a huge jump in conversions.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia was third, with a significant increase in farmland
losses to 210,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Growth slowed slightly in Florida and North Carolina from the
previous survey, but they still ranked fourth and fifth
respectively with 189,000 acres converted in Florida per year and
156,000 in North Carolina. Tennessee ranked seventh with 122,000
acres plowed under each year followed by South Carolina in ninth
place with 107,000 acres, Virginia 12th with 93,000 and Alabama
13th with 89,000.
</P>
<P>
   Groups like the farmland trust are trying to maintain farm
acreage inventories through approaches such as preservation
easements _ paying landowners to hold onto their property. But the
financial pressure to sell to developers can be irresistible,
especially in cases where younger family members have no interest
in farming.
</P>
<P>
   The report is likely to boost the visibility of urban sprawl as
a political issue in the 2000 campaign season. ``We can help
preserve our communities, and our environment, by keeping farmers
on the land,'' said Vice President Al Gore, who has seized on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTIONABLE TRANSACTION
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of a House banking subcommittee, Alabama Rep.
Spencer Bachus is a natural to talk about service fees,
international monetary policy _ and the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
   Huh?
</P>
<P>
   Bachus, a Republican, recently presided over a hearing looking
at the pending transfer of the canal from the United States to
Panama. He is one of several conservatives sounding the alarm about
that move.
</P>
<P>
   Bachus said his banking subcommittee has jurisdiction over the
matter because of concerns that ``alleged corruption'' in the
Panamanian government threatens U.S. commercial interests.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives also see a threat from China because a Hong
Kong-based company operates ports at both ends of the canal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is legitimate concern that Panama cannot provide the
necessary security to protect the canal, which is vitally important
to our commerce and national security,'' Bachus said.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer will take place Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   WOMAN'S WORK
</P>
<P>
   Some Southern states are lagging in appointing women to top
government posts, with a few states in Dixie moving backward even
as women make gains elsewhere in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In a new review done for the Center for Women in Government,
based in Albany, N.Y., Mississippi ranked 49th in terms of the
number of women in state leadership posts when compared with the
state population overall. Louisiana ranked 47th, Alabama 39th and
South Carolina 38th, down substantially from the year before.
Though North Carolina ranked 11th, that state too had fewer women
in top roles than in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Florida was the leader among Southern states, ranking fourth,
with women holding 42 percent of the state's top policy jobs while
comprising almost 52 percent of the state's population. Vermont was
the national leader.
</P>
<P>
   TROLLING FOR TROUBLE
</P>
<P>
   Federal fishery managers are demonstrating that they are serious
about protecting dwindling red snapper and other species of fish in
the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration charged the
owners and operators of 25 commercial fishing vessels with multiple
counts of catching red snapper when the commercial season was
closed, assessing more than $1.2 million in penalties and seeking
fishing permit suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said over 35,000 pounds of snapper was sold after the
1996-97 season was closed. Snapper fishing in the Gulf has been
under tightening restrictions in an attempt to restore the depleted
stocks of one of the region's signature fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Illegal activities like these, if unchecked, make a mockery of
the sacrifices honest fishermen make to rebuild the red snapper
fishery,'' said Bill Hogarth, Southeast administrator for NOAA.

DEVILS NAP AND OILERS SKATE PAST THEM, 3-1 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Brimming with confidence after their
victories over Pittsburgh and Chicago, the Devils came into
Saturday's game against the worst road team in hockey and did
exactly what center Bobby Holik had feared.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played right into their hands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Edmonton Oilers scored three goals in less than eight
minutes in the first period and went on to win their first road
game in nearly a month and second of the season, defeating the
Devils, 3-1, before 14,224 at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came out ready to play and we didn't,'' said defenseman
Lyle Odelein, who was on the ice for all three Oilers goals and had
an assist on Krzysztof Oliwa's slow-rolling goal at 17 minutes 3
seconds of the second period. ``After the first period, we said a
few things, the guys did, and played hard. But when you only play
40 minutes, you're not going to win too many hockey games.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter, Holik said, for the Devils to play ``a good 40
minutes if the game was decided in the first 20.'' With the loss,
the Devils fell to 15-10-3 but still possessed one of the best home
records at 11-3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-skating Oilers, infrequent visitors to the New York
area, jumped all over a somnolent Devils defense, peppering
goaltender Martin Brodeur and breaking through at 6:45 when Boyd
Devereaux took a nice pass from Georges Laraque and put it in off
the rebound for his second goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Just over three minutes later, Ethan Moreau made the score 2-0
when he beat Sergei Nemchinov to Devereaux's pass and put it past
Brodeur on his glove side at 10:05, and Josef Beranek made it 3-0
when he came across the blue line with the puck and sent a hard
shot past Brodeur at 14:24.
</P>
<P>
   ``The third one came in at an angle, bouncing a little bit, but
I should have had it,'' said Brodeur, who stopped 20 shots and
whose record is now 15-7-3.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Devils' offense mustered only five shots on goal
in the first period, getting off the first shot of the period and
then not again until 9:45 had elapsed. It was a different game in
the second and third periods, with the Devils outshooting the
Oilers by 25-10, but Bill Ranford made several spectacular saves to
keep the Devils at bay and register his first victory in seven
outings this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels real good,'' said coach Kevin Lowe, whose Oilers
(9-14-7) have lost 9 of 11 games by two goals or fewer, seven of
those by one. ``We have played some good hockey on the road this
year; it just hasn't been rewarded. It is kind of ironic that it is
rewarded against one of the best teams in the league.''

 &HT;    Debt comes due for 49ers dynasty
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Bill Walsh retired as coach of the 49ers
after the 1988 season, he left behind one of the NFL's greatest
dynasties.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco had won three Super Bowls in eight years and still
featured superstars Joe Montana, Roger Craig, Ronnie Lott and Jerry
Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator George Seifert took over only four days
after San Francisco won Super Bowl XXIII in January '89, and
uttered the words that would become a mantra around the 49ers'
empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ship will not sink on my watch,'' he vowed.
</P>
<P>
   The dynasty didn't crumble under Seifert. San Francisco won two
more Super Bowls and reached the NFC Championship Game three other
times during his eight-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a standard,'' 49ers defensive tackle Junior Bryant
said. ``We didn't have to talk about it too much. It was the way we
approached each season. Some teams might say, `We want to get a
winning season.' For us, that was taken for granted. The ultimate
goal was always the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Seifert was pushed out in a power struggle with former president
Carmen Policy. Replaced by Steve Mariucci, who had coached at
California for just one season, Seifert is in his first year as
coach of the Carolina Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   When Mariucci was hired in 1997, Policy told him, ``You're in
for the ride of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mariucci knows what Policy meant. The dynasty is over.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers (3-9) have lost eight games in a row going into
today's contest against the Falcons (3-9) at 3Com Park. San
Francisco, which won at least 10 games in 16 consecutive seasons
before this year, hasn't lost nine in a row since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to explain the emotions that you go through,''
Mariucci said. ``I guess shock is the best word. We know where we
are. We know why we are in this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the 49ers lived on borrowed time, or credit,
mortgaging the future on a yearly basis in hopes of putting that
season's team in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Eddie DeBartolo, serving an NFL suspension because of his
involvement in a gambling fraud case, demanded the drive. And it
worked.
</P>
<P>
   This year will be the first season the 49ers will miss the
playoffs since '91, when they finished 10-6 and won their final six
games.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo was willing to pay whatever it cost _ generally huge
signing bonuses and restructured contracts _ to attract and keep
top talent.
</P>
<P>
   Last offseason, the bill collector came calling.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, 68, returned to the franchise in January and was named
the team's vice president and general manager. His first task was
trimming the 49ers' payroll _ the team was $28 million over the $57
million cap in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came on board I knew to a certain extent what was going
to be ahead of us,'' Mariucci said. ``Really, there's no need for
any finger pointing or trying to find a reason why this is all
coming down right now. There was a conscious decision made five or
six years ago by Mr. DeBartolo and Carmen Policy to try to continue
to win games and try to be a contender every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``And while they decided to do that, it required spending money,
bringing in free agents, pro-rating signing bonuses and
restructuring contracts, pushing the debt into the future. That was
the decision that was made.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh was forced to purge the team's roster. He traded defensive
end Roy Barker, tight end Irv Smith, quarterback Ty Detmer and
fullback Marc Edwards to Cleveland, where Policy and Clark had fled
to run the expansion franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Bowl guard Kevin Gogan was dealt to Miami, and longtime free
safety Merton Hanks was cut in a cost-cutting move. Mariucci said
30 players are missing from the team that lost to the Falcons in
last year's NFC divisional playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh managed to bring the 49ers under the cap this year. But
Mariucci said the team will have to cut an additional $24 million
to $26 million after this season as the projected cap is $62
million for 2000. By contrast, projections put the Falcons roughly
$15 million under next year's salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly not out of the woods,'' Mariucci said. ``I
think everybody in the 49ers empire really did enjoy the long
stretch of success. But it was expensive to do that and sooner or
later you must pay the bill. It's come due.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers don't figure to get much better any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Decisions must be made about the futures of quarterback Steve
Young and receiver Jerry Rice. Young hasn't played since Sept. 27
because of post-concussion syndrome. Rice isn't nearly as
productive at 37.
</P>
<P>
   Young's cap charge is $8.1 million next season. It will be $6.9
million if he retires or is waived. Rice's cap charge is $5.95
million next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had my druthers, I would like to see a final game being
played with Steve Young throwing a touchdown pass to Jerry Rice,''
Walsh said, ``everything stopping and both of them coming off the
field together. That would be the appropriate finale for two great
careers.''
</P>
<P>
   And the appropriate end of a dynasty, although the 49ers would
still be paying for them for years to come.

NEW ZEALANDERS WIN 197-MILE ADVENTURE RACE
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARILOCHE, Argentina _ As the 1999 Eco-Challenge adventure race
came to a close Friday, a full two days ahead of schedule, the
winners had already enjoyed several days of catching up on sleep
and stuffing themselves with Argentine beef.
</P>
<P>
   The race was decided at 9:20 a.m. Monday when Team Greenpeace of
New Zealand paddled across the finish line on Lake Nahuel Huapi,
about 20 miles from Bariloche. The team completed the 197-mile
course in a blistering five days, finishing on a placid Patagonian
summer day that belied the fierce storm two days into the race that
divided the leaders from the followers.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Eco-Challenge course, which teams of four
competitors traveled by kayak, horse and foot, was almost 100 miles
shorter than previous races, to give racers a greater margin of
safety in Patagonia's rugged terrain and unpredictable climate.
</P>
<P>
   The race director, Mark Burnett, allotted 12 days for the teams
to pass the race's 28 checkpoints, and had estimated it would take
the speediest teams eight. Many had strong kayaking and
mountaineering experience and, aside from the storm, the weather
was mostly on their side. This led to one of the closest finishes
ever in an expedition race.
</P>
<P>
   Two other teams paddled close in on Greenpeace's wake: Team
Sierra Nevada from Spain came across just 50 minutes later and Team
Condor an hour later. Condor, from Bariloche, was met by thousands
of local fans lining the beach and chanting ``Bariloche,
Bariloche'' while firemen let loose their shrill sirens in tribute.
</P>
<P>
   Four other teams finished that afternoon and evening: the
largely female American team Atlas Snowshoes/Rubicon; Finland's
Team Halti; the 1998 titleholder, Team Vail from the United States;
and Foster's Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 50 teams that started the morning of Dec. 1, 34 finished.
Seven others lost members with injuries and completed the race
unranked. There were only a few medical problems, including a
broken ankle, an ovarian cyst that needed emergency surgery and
several severely infected blisters.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenpeace team, which is named after the environmental
group but has no connection to it, did five days of deep-water
kayaking, bushwhacking through thick bamboo and multiple ascents
and descents of 10,000-foot-plus mountains and was ready to go
around again, said its captain, John Howard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't pushing ourselves _ we could have gone faster,''
said the 44-year-old Howard, one of the world's premier adventure
racers and a well-known character. Howard, who cleans windows at
mansions around Christchurch, New Zealand, lives in a bus
overlooking the city. He has won every major race, including three
Raid Gauloises titles and two previous Eco-Challenge titles.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the team were Andrea Murray, 35, a garden designer
from Christchurch; her husband, Keith Murray, 38, a doctor; and
Neil Jones, 38, a kiwi grower.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenpeace team will take home $50,000 for its victory. Many
teams are sponsored, allowing them to be outfitted with the latest
gear and clothing, but not Greenpeace. It's a situation Howard
prefers. He provided teammates with drugstore shower caps _ lighter
than any technical gear _ to keep their heads warm and dry during
the three kayaking segments. And it would be hard to forget the
sight of team members jumping into a churning river clutching black
plastic garbage bags full of their gear as they frantically swam
across to pick up their horses for the riding segment.
</P>
<P>
   The talk of the race was the storm that began on the afternoon
of the race's second day. Temperatures quickly dropped and winds
exceeding 90 mph were recorded at a checkpoint halfway up the
Agostini Wall, a sheer rock face that a majority of the teams had
yet to ascend when the storm arose.
</P>
<P>
   Those who had begun their climb returned to a base camp, where
temperatures fell into the 20s overnight. Snow began in earnest at
daybreak, and the upper mountain checkpoint was later closed as the
fixed ropes were buried by up to a foot of snow. Racers were later
sent on a longer, roundabout path to the next checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace and Rubicon were already far ahead, as were Sierra
Nevada, Halti and Condor. Rubicon spent eight hours mostly on the
move to stay warm, while Sierra Nevada found shelter in a
campground and slept. Greenpeace waited out the storm under a
tarpaulin, catching catnaps.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing when and at what point to sleep was important.
Greenpeace slept a total of 9 1/2 hours over five days. But by
sleeping mostly on course, not at checkpoints, it fooled
competitors into thinking it was barely resting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're pushing on, they think we're not sleeping,'' Howard
said.
</P>
<P>
   At checkpoint 23 on 12,000-foot Mount Tronador, a climbers'
refuge perched on a glacier 5,000 feet below the summit, racers
could stop for a hot bowl of pasta and sleep. Rubicon arrived giddy
from sleeplessness and decided to rest before attempting the next
glacier crossing. The members zipped themselves into reporters'
sleeping bags and shut down for two hours. While they slept, Team
Sierra Nevada whizzed in and out, as did Team Condor, and Rubicon
fell from second to fourth. But its captain, Rebecca Rusch, said it
had given up its lead much earlier in the race by forgoing sleep.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubicon's members were not disappointed, having expected
only to be somewhere in the top 10, she said. ``We were really,
really psyched,'' Rusch, 31, said of their finish. ``It was a
near-perfect race for us.''

SCHOOLS CHANCELLOR FIRES NINE IN CHEATING SCANDAL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew has fired nine educators
and taken steps to dismiss 11 others in the latest fallout from a
cheating scandal in New York City's public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Crew fired three teachers' aides and six teachers who did not
have tenure on Thursday evening after concluding that they helped
students cheat on standardized tests, said Pam McDonnell, a
spokeswoman for the Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor has also brought misconduct charges against 11
other teachers and principals, Ms. McDonnell said. Under state law,
tenured employees are entitled to hearings before state-appointed
administrative law judges as part of a review process that can last
several years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDonnell would not release the names Saturday of those
educators who had been fired or disciplined, because of privacy
concerns. But she stressed the chancellor's intention to deal
thoroughly with the matter: ``The chancellor has made it clear that
one cheater is one too many, and it is immoral and he will not
tolerate it.''
</P>
<P>
   A total of 47 principals, teachers and staff members from 32
elementary and middle schools were implicated in a cheating scandal
in a report released this week by Edward F. Stancik, the special
investigator for the city's public schools. The report said those
educators had encouraged and directly helped students to cheat on
highly competitive city and state standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   But the United Federation of Teachers, the teachers' union, has
questioned the accuracy of the report and has hired a private
company to verify the report's conclusions. ``The union will make
sure that all its members get a fair hearing, including those tried
by press conference,'' said Dick Riley, a spokesman for the union.
</P>
<P>
   The educators named in the report were immediately removed from
their school jobs and transferred to district offices while school
administrators conduct their own investigation, Ms. McDonnell said.
They will continue to receive their full salaries, which range from
$40,000 to $60,000 per year, Ms. McDonnell said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, seven teachers mentioned in the report had left the
school system before the report was released, and their names have
been placed on a list that will prevent them from being hired for
any public school in New York City, Ms. McDonnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDonnell said that the rest of the educators named in the
report were still being investigated by the chancellor's school
administrators, but that she did not know how long that would take.
``The ones that were the most egregious, we already knew about and
acted on,'' she said. ``The ones we're not acting on are still
under investigation because it's not as clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Stancik's report criticized the way school
administrators had handled the allegations of cheating, Ms.
McDonnell said they had helped Stancik's investigation by passing
along complaints and other information about individual educators.

SIR RUPERT HART-DAVIS, 92, PROLIFIC PUBLISHER AND EDITOR
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Sir Rupert Hart-Davis, a highly energetic Englishman of
letters whose rich careers in publishing, editing and writing
spanned nearly six decades, died on Wednesday in North Yorkshire,
England, his family said. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s and early '50s, Sir Rupert was the owner of
his own publishing company, which he named after himself. He was
known as much for the care he took in publishing books as for his
almost complete lack of business acumen. Under his stewardship, the
company published books like Gerald Durrell's ``My Family and Other
Animals,'' Ray Bradbury's ``Fahrenheit 451,'' which was dedicated
to Sir Rupert, and Heinrich Harrer's ``Seven Years in Tibet.'' The
books were always more of a literary than a financial success.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Rupert had a second and even more prolific career as an
editor and writer. Meticulously and thoroughly, he edited a number
of volumes of letters, diaries and poems by Max Beerbohm, Oscar
Wilde and Siegfried Sassoon, among others. He earned particular
praise from reviewers for his witty and illuminating footnotes. He
also published six volumes of his own correspondence with George
Lyttleton, his former housemaster at Eton, to considerable success.
</P>
<P>
   Born to genteel respectability in 1907, Rupert Charles
Hart-Davis was never sure that the man his mother was married to _
Richard Hart-Davis _ was in fact his father, who was rumored
instead to be a Yorkshire baronet. But Hart-Davis raised him and
paid for his education at Eton. Rupert began college at Balliol,
Oxford, but dropped out to pursue what was then his greatest love,
acting.
</P>
<P>
   He had a short acting career, spending a year as a student at
the Old Vic and a year as an actor at the Lyric Theater in
Hammersmith, London. He gained some experience, several good
reviews and a wife, the actress Peggy Ashcroft. They married young
and divorced young, but remained close friends until Dame Peggy's
death some 60 years later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1929 he began his publishing career, as a lowly office boy at
the publishing firm William Heinemann. He moved to Jonathan Cape
and, after serving in the Coldstream Guards in World War II,
decided to start his own publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   He found the job exhilarating but fraught with financial
uncertainty. Almost every year, it seemed, the company was facing
bankruptcy, and almost every year someone emerged to save it at the
last minute. Finally, the company became part of Heinemann and, as
the London publishing landscape changed, was sold and sold again to
other firms. Sir Rupert finally left it in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s he began a weekly correspondence with Lyttleton,
and he published it later in six volumes. The books were praised by
critics as funny, knowing accounts of the men's life and times,
although detractors ridiculed them as pretentious anachronisms.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Rupert was the author of a number of nonfiction books,
including ``Hugh Walpole: A Biography'' (1952). He was a voracious
collector of books as well, amassing more than 17,000 volumes in
his study.
</P>
<P>
   Knighted in 1967, Sir Rupert was married four times. His second
marriage, to the former Catherine Comfort Borden-Turner, ended in
divorce. His third wife, Winifred Ruth, died in 1967. He is
survived by his fourth wife, June, and by two sons and a daughter.

US ISSUES GLOBAL CAUTION FOR HOLIDAY TRAVEL ABROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an extraordinary worldwide advisory, the State
Department Saturday cautioned all Americans living or traveling
abroad to avoid large crowds over the holiday season, citing
``credible information that terrorists are planning attacks''
against them.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory did not include travel inside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no specific information at this time that the threat
is directed to American citizens here at home,'' said James B.
Foley, the department's deputy spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   While the State Department previously has issued travel warnings
about threats in specific geographic areas, it was highly unusual
to issue a global note of caution.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said there was discussion about eeing the worldwide
caution to the United States ``because there are lot of people
trying to take advantage of vulnerabilities during Christmas and
New Year's.''
</P>
<P>
   But the credible threats of attacks involved only overseas
sites, the official said. In its statement, the State Department
said it had information indicating attacks ``could be planned for
locations throughout the world where large gatherings and
celebrations will be taking place.''
</P>
<P>
   It urged Americans traveling or living abroad ``to review their
security practices, to remain alert to the changing situation and
to exercise caution.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley provided no details about the threat, but added: ``We
believe the information we have is credible and specific. The
specifics include terrorist activities. . . . American citizens are
among the targets of these attacks. The planned attacks are timed
to coincide with the beginning of the New Year and the month of
Ramadan, when religious and other celebrations are taking place.''
</P>
<P>
   While the State Department avoided any specifics on the threat,
officials have previously cited Osama bin Laden, a Saudi-born
terrorism suspect, as one of the most dangerous threats to
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, believed to be based in Afghanistan, is accused of
masterminding the 1998 bombings of two US embassies in East Africa
that killed more than 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   The administration official said that one of the biggest
concerns remains in Israel, where a large number of Americans are
celebrating the holidays and the millennium.

GORE SEEKS TO MOBILIZE BLACK ELECTORATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With Democratic presidential contender Bill Bradley
temporarily sidelined for health reasons, Vice President Al Gore on
Saturday dropped attacks on his rival's health-care plan and
instead took aim at Republicans for thinking that ``if the economy
ain't broken, let's break it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was here to launch a national effort to mobilize black
voters for his campaign, was showcasing the breadth of his support
among African-American movers and shakers in the hope that it will
influence black voters, some of whom have been drawn to Bradley's
message of racial inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Gore typically seizes such opportunities to draw distinctions
between himself and Bradley, often saying that th orr New Jersey
senator's health care plan is too costly, and would hurt blacks and
Hispanics because it would end Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   But other than a passing reference to having fought against
President Ronald Reagan's 1981 spending cuts, which Bradley voted
for, Gore's only mention of his Democratic opponent Saturday was at
the top of his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to say a word of gratitude for the news that my
opponent, Senator Bradley is back on the campaign trail today,''
Gore said. ``That's good news. He's a good man, a great competitor.
I look forward to continuing our discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore officials said that Gore sidestepped criticism of Bradley
not out of fear of antagonizing African-American voters, but in
deference to concerns about his health. Bradley, who was
hospitalized briefly in California Friday because of an irregular
heartbeat, Saturday said his health is fine and that his campaign
will not be affected.
</P>
<P>
   The outh is key to Gore's strategy of wresting the nomination
from Bradley, and as a Tennessee native, Gore is expected to do
well there. But in a poll conducted last month by the University of
Alabama that asked respondents in that state to choose a favorite
in the Democratic presidential primary, 39 percent named Gore,
compared with 32 percent for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Among blacks, however, a recent poll by the Associated Press
showed Gore leading Bradley 57 percent to 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the strength of the black voters in the South, who
make up close to 50 percent of the vote in Georgia, for example,
the vice president Saturday touted the Clinton-Gore
administration's record that he said includes the most diverse
Cabinet in histor an economy that has cut African-American
unemployment rates in half, and a defense of affirmative action
against Republican efforts to roll back the federal program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyoe who says affirmative action is no longer needed because
we've reached the promised land, has confused wilderness with
Canaan,'' Gore said to wild applause. ``We fought for the black
farmer. We have fought for the downtrodden, and we are going to
continue fighting for them, because we know what obstacles lie out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent gibe at GOP front-runner George W. Bush, without
specifically mentioning the Texas governor's name or his large
tax-cut proposal, Gore said: ``The other side . . .they want to
adopt an economic policy that would put us right back into deficits
and threaten the programs that have made progress. Their position
is if the economy ain't broke, let's break it. We're not going to
break it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their position on health care _ they are opposed to even the
health care patients' bill of rights. They are afraid to say no to
the right-wing extreme. Their position on the environment is to
tolerate pollution and environmental injustice,'' he said. ``We are
not satisified. We certainly don't want to go back, and we are not
going back.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gore spoke, he was surrounded on stage by some of the state's
leading business leaders and politicians, including civil rights
stalwart John Lewis, a Democratic congressman from Georgia, and
black elected officials from Texas and Tennessee. His speech was
often interrupted by applause from the audience of about 300
African-Americans gathered in the auditorium of the black-owned
Atlanta Life Iurance building on Auburn Avenue, the same street
where Martin Luther King Jr. grew up, went to church, and has a
museum named after him.
</P>
<P>
   In kicking off his campaign in the South, Gore's aides released
a list of 2,000 African-Americans leaders who support him
nationwide, including 28 of the 38 members of the Congressional
Black Caucus. Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Gore, said that seven
members have privately committed to Gore but have not publicly
endorsed him.
</P>
<P>
   Odessa Roberson, a 63-year-old retired nurse and cook of
Atlanta, said before Gore spoke, ``I'm trying to like Al Gore.''
She added that she was looking for him to offer proposals to help
uninsured senior citizens and tackle neighborhood crime.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to several elected officials praise Gore and
hearing him speak, she changed her tune.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore made his way out of the door while the 1970s O'Jays hit
``Love Train'' blared from the speakers, Roberson said, ``I'm going
to get on the Gore wagon, not that train. And I'm going to get busy
barbecuing and raising money for him.''

STATE DEPARTMENT WARNS OF POSSIBLE TERRORIST ATTACKS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The State Department announced on Saturday that it
had received ``credible information'' about plans for terrorist
attacks against American citizens from now until the beginning of
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The department released what it called a ``worldwide terrorism
warning,'' advising Americans to stay away from ``large gatherings
and celebrations'' throughout the world. The statement was not
specific about which groups were planning the attacks or where
attacks might take place. But it specified the period ``up to and
through the beginning of the New Year and Ramadan events and
celebrations from now until January 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   A department spokesman, James Foley, said he could not give
specifics. He said the department had issued a similar
``worldwide'' warning early last month after the administration
imposed sanctions on the Taliban, which rules most of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   For the last year or more, the State Department has issued many
such warnings, often around holidays. This one is notable in part
because it urges Americans to avoid large crowds, and yet people
all over the world are likely to gather to celebrate the beginning
of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official said he believed that Saturday's
warning had been issued because the department had received
information that Osama bin Laden, who the administration says was
behind the bombing of two American Embassies in Africa in August
1998, was planning attacks against Americans and that some
``targeting'' information may have been received.
</P>
<P>
   The department issues such general statements to ensure that if
an attack does occur, citizens have been warned, the official said.

ELIZABETH ZIMMERMANN IS DEAD AT 89; REVOLUTIONIZED ART OF KNITTING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., England)  (rk) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elizabeth Zimmermann, who brought a penetrating intellect and a
sculptor's sensitivity to revolutionizing the ancient art of
knitting, died Nov. 30 at a hospital in Marshfield, Wis., where she
lived. She was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Zimmermann's best-known gift to knitting was a mathematical
formula for figuring the proportions of sweaters and other
garments, depending on how many stitches per inch the knitter
wanted to use. But her passion, expressed in magazine columns, in
four books and at her knitting camp, the nation's first, was
creating beauty. She gently urged knitters to challenge the limits
of their imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   ``She allowed people to be intuitive about their knitting,
rather than just being blind followers of the written word,'' said
Nancy J. Thomas, editor of Knitter's Magazine. ``She had a way of
being breezy and fun. She made everything seem easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Ligon, president of Interweave Press, which specializes in
traditional textile crafts, said Mrs. Zimmermann ``brought
intelligence and validity to a craft that had been trivialized as
women's work.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Lloyd-Jones was born near Devon, England, in 1910, the
daughter of a naval officer and the woman who invented Meals by
Motor, a British forerunner of Meals on Wheels. Her youthful
memories, as recalled in ``Knitting Around'' (Schoolhouse Press,
1989), suggested a bucolic paradise, framed by plum trees and plum
jam, governesses and private schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a wonderful hideyhole in a gone-to-seed cabbage patch,''
Mrs. Zimmermann said, ``and one day had the excitement and glory of
falling through the roof of an abandoned chicken house, garnering
the first permanent scar on my leg.''
</P>
<P>
   The women of her mother's family knitted. One day, she asked her
mother if she could try knitting, perhaps the most important words
she ever uttered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're good all day today, I'll teach you tomorrow,'' her
mother answered.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lloyd-Jones attended art schools in Lausanne, Switzerland,
and Munich, where she sold sweaters of her own design to a local
shop for pocket money. She also met Arnold Zimmermann, a brewer. He
had to flee Hitler's Germany because an SS agent overheard him
making a snide remark about Hitler. They married in England,
immigrated to New York and moved several times before settling in
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Zimmermann began spending morning after morning with local
knitters, exchanging tips. She became frustrated with many of her
friends' lockstep reliance on precise instructions in printed
patterns. So, in 1955, she submitted her designs for
Norwegian-pattern sweaters to Woman's Day magazine, resolving to
use clear language. Other magazines also accepted her designs, and
in 1959, she started her own knitting publication.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, the family, with three children, moved into
a derelict schoolhouse in the middle of the woods and remodeled it.
She combined her newsletter with a mail-order business for knitting
supplies, books and video productions under the name Schoolhouse
Press.
</P>
<P>
   She was hostess of a knitting program shown on many public
television stations and in 1974 began a knitting camp under the
auspices of the University of Wisconsin. The camp has continued
every summer since. She also led workshops throughout the United
States and in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ``Knitting Around,'' her books included ``Knitting
without Tears'' (Scribner's/Macmillan, 1971); Knitter's Almanac
(Scribner's/Dover, 1975) and ``Knitting Workshop'' (Schoolhouse
Press, 1981).
</P>
<P>
   She was a woman who held to strong principles about her work,
like never using any thread but wool. But she never criticized
another knitter's use of other materials, including the dreaded
polyester. She developed a reputation for giving pithy advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``A knitter's question which arises perennially,'' she wrote in
Knitter's Almanac, ``is, `How much wool should I buy?'''
</P>
<P>
   She said there was no blanket answer, but advised, ``If you are
using very thick wool, buy more than you could possibly imagine; if
you are using very thin wool, use surprisingly little.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Zimmermann's larger influence was in design, making
sweaters and other garments in round tubes, rather than in flat
pieces to be joined together. The result was a sculptural quality,
said her daughter Meg Swansen, who is also a noted knitter and will
carry on her mother's business. By contrast, Kaffe Fassett, a
knitter whose work is often exhibited in art galleries, is known
for his painterly approach, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Ligon said sculptural effects were just the beginning.
She said Mrs. Zimmermann's mathematical formula for constructing
sweaters in the round freed knitters to concentrate on other
creative concerns, like yarn and stitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was more than a sculptor,'' Ms. Ligon said. ``She was an
engineer.''
</P>
<P>
   Many knitters said the system opened up new possibilities to
them. ``She made me a thinking knitter,'' said Joyce Williams of
Sparta, Wis., who attended three knitting camps with Mrs.
Zimmermann.
</P>
<P>
   A woman from Reading, Mass., in an online customer review of
``Knitting without Tears'' on Amazon.com, said: ``Elizabeth's
wonderful instructions, comments and faith gave me the OK to go
ahead and have fun. I made a patterned yoke sweater that not only
looks great, but fits as well.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ms. Swansen, who lives in Pittsville, Wis., Mrs.
Zimmermann is survived by her husband Arnold; another daughter,
Lloie, of Pittsville; a son, Thomas, of New Hope, Pa.; two
grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Zimmermann chose to play down her influence on knitting,
coining the term ``unventions'' for her woolly inventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The products of science and technology may be new, and some of
them are quite horrid, but knitting?'' she wrote in Knitter's
Almanac. ``In knitting there are ancient possibilities; the earth
is enriched with the dust of millions of knitters who have held
wool and needles since the beginning of sheep.''

BANNED ELSEWHERE, FALUN GONG MEETS IN HONG KONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   HONG KONG _ Several hundred members of the Falun Gong spiritual
group, banned in China, tested Hong Kong's autonomy from Chinese
rule Saturday by demonstrating peacefully to urge Beijing to stop
repressing their organization.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong, the former British colony that returned to Chinese
rule in 1997 with the promise of autonomy, is the only place in
China where Falun Gong is not illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration Saturday, and the conference Sunday of 1,000
Falun Gong members from around the world at Hong Kong's convention
center, follow a five-month crackdown and thousands of arrests of
Falun Gong members in China. The events are a test of China's
effort to stamp out any challenge to its authority, as well as of
its promise to maintain Hong Kong's autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong is the center now for Falun Gong for the whole
world. . . . In China, you can't even practice in your own home,''
said Janet Xiong, 45, a Wuhan native who now works for the New York
City government.
</P>
<P>
   Xiong said she flew from New York for the conference and to
demand that China end its ban on the group. ``We don't have a
political motive. . . . It was the Chinese government who made it
political.''
</P>
<P>
   About 600 adherents who said they were from Hong Kong and 13
other countries, including Taiwan, Japan, Sweden, France, and the
United States, gathered at dawn in a park near the government news
agency office and meditated all day before leading a procession
across town. They left a petition, since no official would meet
them.
</P>
<P>
   With raised arms and closed eyes, they stretched in unison to
the sound of gongs and string instruments from boom boxes. Most
members, many of them elderly, wore yellow T-shirts and nametags,
and some carried banners with the motto ``Peace, Compassion,
Patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong combines the ancient religions of Buddhism and Taoism
with breathing exercises and meditation, and is a branch of qi
gong, an ancient teaching to channel inner energy for healing and
power. Unlike some other Chinese physical disciplines such as Tai
Chi, Falun Gong has an intricate belief system and a single leader.
</P>
<P>
   The group claims 100 million followers worldwide, although the
Chinese government says only 2 million followers are in China.
Adherents preach clean, ascetic living and follow the teachings of
a New York-based spiritual leader, whom Beijing wants to extradite
for trial as the head of an ``evil cult.''
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong was the first mainstream mass movement to emerge that
is not under Communist Party control since the 1949 Revolution.
Some analysts say it reflects frustration among dispossessed
workers who have not benefited from economic reforms. China also
has a history of cracking down on religions seen as a threat to the
leadership, including foreign missionaries 100 years ago, and the
followers of a messianic Chinese peasant in the mid-19th century.
</P>
<P>
   China says that Falun Gong has political ambitions, and that its
practices _ such as discouraging medical treatment _ have caused
the deaths of 1,400 ill members. Beijing banned the group in July,
three months after 10,000 followers surrounded the leadership
offices to demand official recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Since, Beijing has arrested and jailed more than 150 key
leaders, and last week a spokesman for the Chinese State Council,
or Cabinet, said police had detained followers 35,792 times in
Beijing in the past four months. Some Falun Gong members are
reported to have died in recent months in police custody.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong authorities, in contrast, granted permission for the
weekend demonstration and conference without difficulty, although
the police presence at the convention center has been stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   When Falun Gong was banned on the mainland and hundreds of
thousands of its practice manuals were destroyed, a Hong Kong
subsidiary of a Chinese publishing company stopped printing the
books, even though their sale had never been banned. Falun Gong
books are now shipped here from the United States. Several months
ago, a Hong Kong pager company refused to take messages related to
Falun Gong, in a violation of local rules for which the company was
reprimanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practicing kung fu, doing exercise, and keeping fit are all
worthwhile activities,'' said Tung Chee-hwa, Beijing's choice as
chief executive of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   But, he cautioned, ``We have taken note of the Falun Gong in
Hong Kong. . . . These activities must comply strictly with Hong
Kong laws, and the organizers and participants must not act in any
manner'' against the interest of China Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Kan Hung-cheung, a businessman and group spokesman, said that
despite Hong Kong authorities' leniency, ``some people here are
still worried, with Hong Kong so close to China. Will there be
repercussions like phone taps and people followed? I'm sure it
happens, we just don't know to whom.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiona Ching, 41, a Shanghai native who lives in Hong Kong, said
she has paid for her beliefs. Ching said her boss had spotted her
on the local news handing out Falun Gong pamphlets, and had fired
her for being a ``troublemaker.''

GORE BEGINS NATIONAL EFFORT TO GET BLACK VOTES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Invoking the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his
own Southern roots, Vice President Al Gore came to a historic black
section of Atlanta Saturday to launch a national effort to
encourage African-Americans to turn out for him at the polls, both
in the primaries and next November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other side is counting on blowing the roof off all of the
election finance and breaking all the records and lining up all of
the special interests,'' Gore declared in a speech rife with
biblical cadences after entering to the throbbing beat of ``Love
Train,'' which is fast becoming his campaign theme song.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I can tell you that here in the South,'' he said, ``we
have the capacity to blow the roof off voter registration and
turnout and grass-roots enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to his failed 1988 presidential bid, when he
campaigned as a candidate of the South, Gore rarely mentions the
South this time around, presenting himself as a national candidate.
But he talked Saturday of the special bond that Southern whites
have with blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, especially those of us here in the South, are intensely
proud of what we have done together,'' he said, lauding ``those who
took the blows, shed blood that was redemptive for our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign considers the black vote crucial to the vice
president's ability to stave off former Sen. Bill Bradley,
especially with several Southern states holding primaries in March.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Brazile, the Gore campaign manager, said blacks
traditionally make up more than a fourth of the turnout in
Democratic primaries in the South. Most surveys show Gore with a
substantial lead among African-Americans over Bradley. The goal,
Gore advisers said, will be to get them to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been courting black voters for years, but Saturday his
campaign began a nationwide push.
</P>
<P>
   With simultaneous events in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and
Des Moines, the campaign announced the support of nearly 3,000
prominent African-Americans, most of whom have already endorsed
him. They included hundreds of elected officials and members of the
clergy as well as the singer Aretha Franklin and the comedian Bill
Cosby and athletes like the basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and
the track star Carl Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Gore chose to kick off his campaign for the black vote in
Atlanta, where the black community's roots run deep and because
Georgia is the first Southern state to vote in a primary, on March
7.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of today's events reflected the quickly advancing
primary schedule and the fact that the candidates are in the
process of fielding delegates in several Northern states with
significant black populations, including New York, Pennsylvania,
Ohio and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke Saturday morning in the small auditorium of the
Atlanta Life Insurance building on Auburn Avenue, just up the
street from the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King preached and is
buried. The life insurance company was started by a former slave,
Alonzo Herndon, in 1905 and became a cornerstone of black
businesses in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was praised by a succession of black politicians, who cited
his support for affirmative action, his father's record of support
for civil rights and, mostly, the Clinton administration's record
in reducing crime, reducing black unemployment, helping more blacks
attend college and appointing a record number of blacks to
positions in the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's supporters Saturday included Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. Lewis
reminded the audience that the Georgia primary fell on the 35th
anniversary of the civil rights march in Alabama from Selma to
Montgomery, a coincidence that the Gore campaign intends to
exploit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our sisters and brothers died for the right to vote,''
Lewis told the audience. ``On March 7, we will go to the polls and
we will vote like we never, ever voted before, and then in November
2000 we will come back to the polls and vote again.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore told the crowd: ``I make you this pledge. Together, with
your enthusiasm, your ideas and your commitment, we're going to win
this nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The next president is going to appoint three to four justices
of the Supreme Court,'' Gore said. ``What would Thurgood Marshall
have thought if he took his historic cases to a Supreme Court that
was stacked with ideological right wingers predisposed to say no?''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Anyone who says affirmative action is no longer
needed because we've reached the promised land has confused the
wilderness with Canaan.''

OFFICIALS DESCRIBE LOSS OF NUCLEAR SECRETS AT LOS ALAMOS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When a former scientist at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory was indicted on Friday on charges that he had improperly
removed American nuclear secrets from the lab, the government
outlined a possible compromise of classified information far
greater than previously disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was not charged with espionage, senior government
officials now say that Wen Ho Lee, the former Los Alamos scientist
arrested Friday and charged in the case, jeopardized virtually
every nuclear warhead in the American arsenal through unauthorized
computer transfers of many of the country's most sensitive nuclear
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also said much of the information Lee removed was
missing because he had copied the data onto portable computer
tapes, many of which the Federal Bureau of Investigation cannot
find. The officials said they found the methodical and
comprehensive way in which the data had been copied particularly
alarming.
</P>
<P>
   Although early accounts of the investigation described nuclear
secrets being mishandled on a large scale, never before has the
complex case been presented in such detail.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the government's case, and what finally persuaded
prosecutors to seek an indictment and arrest Lee, is the evidence
developed by FBI computer experts to show that Lee copied thousands
of pages of nuclear-related documents onto 10 computer tapes in
1993, 1994 and 1997. Only three of those tapes have been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said it was the discovery that the tapes were missing
and the extraordinary breadth of the secret nuclear details on
them, more than the initial discovery of Lee's unauthorized
transfers of data, that prompted the government to treat the case
so seriously.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury in Albuquerque issued a 59-count indictment
against Lee, charging him with violations of the Atomic Energy Act
and the Foreign Espionage Act. Some of the most serious offenses
are punishable by life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   It was previously known that Lee had, mainly in 1993 and 1994,
transferred onto an unsecure computer system computer data used to
design nuclear weapons, analyze nuclear test results and evaluate
weapons materials and the safety characteristics of America's
nuclear warheads. But in the indictment, the government said for
the first time that Lee had transferred information in a more
determined manner and for a far longer time than investigators
initially believed.
</P>
<P>
   The government charged that Lee had copied secret nuclear data
onto a tape as recently as 1997. Officials initially believed that
Lee's unauthorized computer activities had ended by 1995.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the indictment says that in 1997, Lee copied onto a
tape the ``complete source code for the current version'' of the
government's most advanced primary weapon design, which is an
atomic bomb that acts as the trigger to explode a hydrogen bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence about the processes Lee used to transfer the material
is also being used by the government to argue that his actions were
not accidental or intended to protect the information, as he has
asserted. According to the indictment and government officials, as
Lee moved the material from the classified network to an open
system, he deleted classification markings identifying it as
secret. After they were in the open system, he copied them onto
tapes on the office computer of another employee.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is being held without bail pending a hearing on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the government is not saying Lee committed espionage by
giving the classified information to another country or person.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, while Lee's arrest was the culmination of an FBI
investigation into his computer activities that began in March, the
broader espionage inquiry that first brought Lee to the
government's attention is continuing at a much slower pace.
</P>
<P>
   The government stumbled onto evidence of Lee's unauthorized
computer transfers because he was under investigation in connection
with an inquiry into evidence that China may have stolen secret
data related to America's most advanced nuclear warhead, the W-88,
which was designed at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   That investigation began in early 1995 by the Department of
Energy, which owns the national weapons labs, and the FBI. The
investigation started after American intelligence received
sensitive information about a 1992 Chinese test of an advanced
nuclear warhead that appeared to be modeled after an American
weapon. Subsequently, the Central Intelligence Agency received a
Chinese government document that included secret data about the
W-88, indicating that the Chinese had obtained classified
information from the American nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, when the FBI opened a formal criminal investigation,
Lee had emerged as the prime suspect as the source of the leak.
</P>
<P>
   But after the case became public in March, a national furor
erupted over the way the government had handled the investigation,
leading to a series of reviews of the actions of officials at the
FBI and the Energy and Justice departments.
</P>
<P>
   By September, the FBI and the Justice Department had determined
that the initial administrative inquiry by the Energy Department
and the FBI that began the investigation had been flawed and that
investigators had prematurely focused on Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Officials determined that the secret data about the W-88
included in the Chinese government document handed over to the CIA
in 1995 did not necessarily come from Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese document was dated 1988, and by that time the
classified information on the W-88 included in the document might
have been available at other laboratories or federal agencies, or
even at defense contractors.
</P>
<P>
   So the FBI went back to square one on the W-88 case this fall,
broadening its investigation in an effort to account for how the
information about the warhead was disseminated through the
government and its contractors. On Friday, a senior government
official said that renewed inquiry is continuing on a separate
track from the criminal case pending against Lee. He said Lee's
indictment ``does not answer the original referral from the
Department of Energy on the W-88.''
</P>
<P>
   The official added that the Chinese intelligence service tends
to rely on many sources. The Lee case ``could be one source, or it
may have nothing to do with it,'' he said.

INFLATED PRICES, Y2K UPROAR DASH TRAVEL INDUSTRY'S HOLIDAY HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EDWARD M. EVELD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ What a New Year's Eve this was going to be.
</P>
<P>
   In search of scrapbook memories, travelers would head to exotic
hither and romantic yon in great numbers. Demand for New Year's
trips would be huge.
</P>
<P>
   At least that was the thinking a year ago. Let's just say your
travel agent is still waiting for your call. He or she is not as
lonely as the Maytag repairman _ these are the holidays, after all
_ but the year 2000 bombardment has yet to bombard.
</P>
<P>
   ``May I tell you everything is available?'' said travel
executive Kathy Sudeikis, only half-jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   The travel industry geared up for what it thought would be a
titanic travel opportunity. Certainly everyone would want to be
someplace memorable on the night of Dec. 31, 1999, right?
</P>
<P>
   Sure. And many will be. But for lots of Americans, factors
economical and psychological altered the New Year's Eve equation.
</P>
<P>
   The economic reasons are easiest to explain: Prices were too
high. Way too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just weren't going to be gouged,'' Sudeikis said.
</P>
<P>
   The irony now is that many prices are beginning to fall, from
airline fares to cruise prices, but it might be too late.
</P>
<P>
   About 14 months ago Sudeikis heard from a group of friends, 10
couples who wanted to spend New Year's together on a cruise ship.
But when it came time to book the package, they found the prices
absurd and backed out. She tried to call them when prices started
to drop, but she never heard back. Apparently they were out of the
mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the travel industry shot itself in the foot,'' said Ed
Perkins, who writes a syndicated consumer column on travel.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins said plenty of people got sticker shock as they tried to
book hotel packages. Many hotels required minimum stays of five or
seven nights. It turned people off, and they started to make
cheaper, close-to-home plans.
</P>
<P>
   The American Automobile Association says 44.6 million Americans
are expected to travel 100 miles or more from their homes during
the Christmas-New Year's period. That is a lot of people, but it is
a 1 percent drop from last year and the first decline since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Youngman, marketing director for the Caribbean Tourism
Organization, reported that except at a few exclusive resorts that
often sold out at the holidays, space was available in the
Caribbean island nations.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons go beyond price, he said, to psychology. Youngman
makes the ``too much fuss'' argument: that all the talk about Y2K
and the worries about delays, breakdowns and crowds soured people
on anything potentially complicated, such as travel. It was easier
to avoid the whole idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a global thing,'' Youngman said. ``People feel they don't
want to go too far from home. It's not the fear of falling out of
the sky so much; it's just the ballyhoo.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently there is some fear about falling out of the sky,
reducing the demand for flights on Dec. 31. But the Air Transport
Association, an airline industry trade group, said such concerns
had lessened. Only about 10 percent of passengers questioned in a
recent poll said they would be worried about flying as 1999 turned
to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Still, airlines have cut flights 20 percent to 30 percent in
response to a lack of demand Dec. 31 and Jan. 1. Southwest Airlines
will stop flying for 10 hours starting at 10 p.m. on New Year's Eve
to give employees a chance to spend time with family.
</P>
<P>
   Staying close to home could mean booking a hotel and restaurant
package right in town. You might think the Hyatt Regency Crown
Center hotel, known locally for its New Year's Eve bashes, would be
booked solid by now. But there is room at the inn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we'd be farther ahead in the game based on the
trends in New York, Las Vegas and Chicago,'' said Mark Champa,
director of sales and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite slower-than-expected bookings, the hotel's New Year's
reservations are still ahead of last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyatt offers several hotel and restaurant packages with two
nights' lodging. Prices range from $595 to $800 a couple and
include food, entertainment and tickets to Science City. Packages
that include Skies restaurant are sold out, Champa said.
</P>
<P>
   One brake on New Year's planning has been work schedules. Many
companies want workers on hand, or at least on call, in case Y2K
problems crop up. Some employees have waited until work schedules
firm up.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of folks have called to say as soon as they get the
green light, they'd be more willing to commit,'' Champa said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lodge of Four Seasons, in Lake Ozark, is using billboards to
draw area residents to its New Year's offering, a two-day package
of meals and parties for $600 a couple.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Knoke, marketing manager, said the lodge was 60 percent
booked, a figure she considered reasonable considering the Y2K
hullabaloo in the media. Reservations accelerated after
Thanksgiving, she said, and she expects them to continue. The lodge
has not dropped its prices for the package, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many people want to share the moment with family and friends
when the calendar flips to 2000. Trying to arrange trips or even
local hotel stays for large numbers of family members and friends
has stymied some people.
</P>
<P>
   Sudeikis faced that challenge herself. A large group of her
relatives and friends wanted to do something unforgettable together
to commemorate the year 2000. It also happens that Jan. 1 is the
21st birthday of her daughter, Kristin.
</P>
<P>
   They decided to find the highest spot in Overland Park, Kan.,
and gather there to watch the sunrise together. If they can arrange
it, and depending on the weather, they may also ask a priest to
celebrate Mass for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could just share the moment, that's what this is all
about,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But for revelers who still harbor thoughts of sharing that
moment in a more exotic locale, there's still time to make
reservations, said Robert Vohs of TravelSmart.
</P>
<P>
   While steep prices and lack of availability probably will keep
you out of places such as London, New York and Las Vegas, most
other spots are at least worth a try, Vohs said. In some cases
cruise prices are coming down, he said, and cruises are good
choices because they are all-inclusive and feature warm-weather
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Parsons, editor of the online Bestfares.com, reported last
week that airfare to some European cities was a third of what it
was a month ago, that cruise lines were offering steep discounts
and that those long minimum stays at hotels, even in New York and
Hawaii, were being abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   One hitch so late in the season, Vohs said, will be finding
flights, which fill up as the holidays approach. Travelers with
flexible schedules will have more options.
</P>
<P>
   Or wait till New Year's Eve 2000, which will actually usher in
the first year of the new millennium. By then, maybe the travel
industry gurus will have learned their lesson.

`MEDICAL NECESSITY' ISSUE PUTS PATIENTS, HEALTH-CARE PROVIDERS AT
ODDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Keith Steil already was battling brain cancer
when he got into a new fight.
</P>
<P>
   Steil, a 38-year-old Olathe, Kan., resident and father of two,
this month sued Humana Health Care Plans Inc. The lawsuit, which
was filed in federal court in Kansas City, Kan., contends that
Humana refused to pay for a brain cancer treatment that Steil's
doctor recommended.
</P>
<P>
   In letters sent to Steil, Humana officials have said Humana will
not cover the treatment, known as ``blood brain barrier
disruption,'' because it is considered experimental.
</P>
<P>
   Steil is receiving the treatments, which consist of injections
that are meant to make brain tumors more treatable by chemotherapy.
Each treatment costs thousands of dollars. Steil and his wife, Kim,
have been agonizing over Humana's decision not to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should be taking care of my husband and my children,'' Kim
Steil said. ``Instead, I'm spending a lot of time and energy
fighting for approval from the insurance company. Half the time I
forget the calls I need to make or the things I need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Zarina Shockley-Sparling, executive director of Humana health
plans in the Kansas City area, said Humana did not comment on
individual cases, because of confidentiality concerns.
</P>
<P>
   She said, however, that Humana ``puts the health and wellness of
our members as our No. 1 priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Steil is one of many consumers around the country who have
gotten into disputes with their health insurance companies in
recent years. Many of the disputes relate to the issue of medical
necessity, or who should decide what is medically necessary for a
patient.
</P>
<P>
   Medical necessity is one of the issues that surfaced recently in
a contract dispute between at least 1,000 area doctors and Blue
Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross said last week that it was willing to talk to doctors
about the issue, which has been influenced by a national backlash
against managed care. UnitedHealthcare, for instance, recently said
it would no longer require doctors to seek approval before
recommending medical treatment or hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   While the controversy may seem like a power struggle between
doctors and insurance companies, the ultimate outcome affects
health-care consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer is the end user of the plan and gets caught in
the middle of the fight between what the physician is recommending
and what the insurance company will approve,'' said Karen
Daugherty, head of the Kansas City office of Aon Consulting, a
benefits consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Take Linda Belinke, a 52-year-old Prairie Village, Kan.,
resident who is undergoing reconstructive breast surgery after
having a double mastectomy to treat breast cancer. She said a Blue
Cross official told her employer in mid-November that the Blue
Cross doctor contracts were ``in place'' and that ``everything is
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   She subsequently learned that her plastic surgeon had not signed
the Blue Cross contract, and she feared she could not keep using
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was horrified and devastated,'' she said. ``I couldn't
believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   To make sure she could continue to see her surgeon, Belinke
dropped out of the Blue Cross HMO and switched to another plan.
</P>
<P>
   Belinke has since learned that her plastic surgeon planned to
sign an amended contract with Blue Cross and that Blue Cross would
have continued to cover her treatment by the surgeon, whether he
signed with Blue Cross or not.
</P>
<P>
   Belinke's employer is trying to help her get back into the Blue
Cross HMO, but the experience has left her leery of the health-care
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a concern that in the future...these types of
situations can continue to occur,'' she said. ``HMOs have just
pushed it too far. I get worried that they're so focused on the
bottom line that they forget they're in the business of providing
health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Edwards, executive director of the Missouri
Association of Health Plans in Jefferson City, said managed care
companies generally approved coverage of most medical procedures
recommended by a patient's physician. When such coverage undergoes
greater scrutiny, managed-care companies look at cost and quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managed-care companies try to compare physician practices in
their networks to national guidelines established by their peers in
their own medical specialty groups,'' Edwards said. ``That concern
for quality helps patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald B. White, a spokesman for the American Association of
Health Plans in Washington, said insurance companies generally
approved nearly all medical services recommended by physicians.
</P>
<P>
   White said an independent study based on 1995 data, the latest
available, showed that insurance companies approved at least 94
percent of such recommendations. Ultimately the insurance companies
agreed to pay for between 97 percent and 99.3 percent of such
services, the study showed.
</P>
<P>
   Patti Beardall, a 47-year-old Shawnee, Kan., resident who has
hepatitis C, said, however, that she had to fight with Blue Cross
and Humana to get them to pay part of the cost for vaccines for
hepatitis B and hepatitis A.
</P>
<P>
   ``How I really feel is scared,'' Beardall said. ``It's my
health, and I don't know if I can trust the system now.''
</P>
<P>
   The medical necessity debate is about consumers, said Richard
Hellman, president-elect of the Metropolitan Medical Society of
Greater Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to realize that their safety is endangered if a
company can profit by denying them care,'' he said. ``Although not
every company would do that, the temptation is great, and some
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors have decided not to deal with health insurance
companies at all. One of them is Jane L. Murray, a physician who
operates the Sastun Center of Integrative Health Care in Mission,
Kan.
</P>
<P>
   The center incorporates alternative therapies such as
acupuncture into traditional medical procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Patients at the center may seek reimbursement from insurance
companies, but Murray and her colleagues do not seek or accept
payments from insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Not every health-care dispute involves doctors as consumer
champions. Beardall, for instance, said she got into a dispute with
a doctor over whether she should have received additional tests for
a possible liver problem. Beardall wanted to have the tests, but
her doctor said they were unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Beardall said the doctor finally called her a ``nervous ninny''
and abruptly dismissed her from his office.
</P>
<P>
   Beardall, who also suffers asthma and a digestive problem, said
she had concluded that the health-care system as a whole ``doesn't
work a lot of the time if you have chronic illnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials say they are trying to make it work.
</P>
<P>
   John P. Mascotte, president and chief executive officer of Blue
Cross, said the health insurer could not discuss individual
members' cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``But our philosophy has always been to put the health of our
members first and foremost,'' Mascotte said. ``It's our constant
focus, underpinning everything we do, from the design of our health
plans to our medical review procedures to the training of our
customer service team.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri has an external review procedure for medical necessity
disputes between consumers and insurance companies, and Kansas is
instituting a similar procedure Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas an independent physician will review medical necessity
disputes after an insurance company's internal appeals process has
been exhausted. The independent physician will then make a
recommendation to the insurance commissioner, who will implement
that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is going to change the landscape of the consumer
complaint process,'' said Denney Clements, director of public
information for the Kansas Insurance Department.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri system works similarly but does not require the
consumer to complete all internal appeals with the insurance
company before turning to the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri external review system and the planned Kansas
system do not apply to consumers who receive health insurance from
so-called self-funded insurance plans, which come under the
supervision of the U.S. Department of Labor. Efforts are under way
in Washington to extend external review protections to members of
self-funded plans.
</P>
<P>
   Under a self-funded plan, an employer assumes the financial risk
for employees' health-care costs and typically pays an insurance
company to administer the plan. Consumers should ask their
personnel departments what type of plan they are in.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, consumers hope that doctors and insurers will live up
to their stated goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health insurers need to realize that they and the doctors are
there to provide service to consumers,'' Belinke said. ``They need
to work as a team.''

KANSAS STATE RADIO STATION CELEBRATES 75 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN, Kan. _ It's a voice heard across Kansas _ even parts
of Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska and Oklahoma _ ethereal words emerging
from 580 kilocycles on the radio dial.
</P>
<P>
   It's KKSU public radio. Serious talk and news. Sober.
Intelligent. No bells and whistles. No psychoanalysis or political
parodies.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Chechnya? Probably there'll be a guest on live.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of Massachusetts on the settlement of Kansas?
Variable application of nitrogen? The weather and farm prices? Iron
deficiency in fields? Health trends? Legislation in Topeka?
Personal computer use? Ditto.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 1, KKSU celebrated its 75th anniversary with a reception
at the studio at McCain Auditorium here. The affair marked the date
in 1924 that a 500-watt station with the call letters KSAC, for
Kansas State Agricultural College, signed on just up the dial at
880 kilocycles.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, then as now, was ``to take the university to the
people.'' In doing so, KSAC (KKSU since 1984) became one the first
public radio stations in Kansas, one of the first in the nation,
and is among a thimbleful still directly funded by a state.
</P>
<P>
   Today KKSU has another distinction: It is one of the few
time-sharing radio stations left. From 12:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. on
weekdays, tuning to 580 means KKSU coming from a transmitter on the
campus of Kansas State University; the rest of the time and on
weekends the signal radiates from the WIBW antenna 60 miles to the
east in Topeka.
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary reception was mainly friends talking over old
times. Still, it was more than just a group of men and women who
love radio.
</P>
<P>
   There were ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those phantasms are still visible, such as the two
long-retired transmitting towers outside Nichols and Calvin halls.
The towers, which are on the National Register of Historic Places,
were made, not surprisingly, by a windmill manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Other specters were more ephemeral: Doc Brinkley, the goat gland
doctor who put radio on the map in Kansas; the legion of speakers
who abandoned the lectern for a microphone to discuss subjects as
diverse as hog farrowing and drip irrigation; and the scratchy
voices of Dev Nelson and Paul DeWeese, who broadcast K-State
football and basketball during the lean and seemingly hopeless
years.
</P>
<P>
   The school that would become K-State got into the radio business
early, in 1903, buying a Marconi receiver _ the first in the state.
</P>
<P>
   By 1912, the school had a radio station of sorts _ called 9YV
and transmitting with 1 kilowatt of power. It sent out weather
information, the first such regularly scheduled broadcasts in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1920s came J.R. Brinkley. His station, KFKB (Kansas
First, Kansas Best) in nearby Milford, promoted his prescription
drug business and clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkley claimed to cure male impotence by surgically implanting
goat glands, a procedure that, by all accounts, was excruciating.
</P>
<P>
   KFKB was a 100,000-watt blowtorch that blanketed the United
States. Looking for an outreach program, the Kansas Cooperative
Extension Service at the university connected a telephone line to
Milford and broadcast courses in agriculture, home economics,
science and engineering. Almost 1,000 students in 39 states _ and
38 from Canada _ enrolled. There was no charge for Kansans;
out-of-staters paid 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The response, especially in an era when receivers were the
exception rather than the rule, validated radio's value to the
university. It asked the Kansas Legislature for an appropriation.
On Dec. 1, 1924, KSAC went on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Titus, who retired as general manager of the station in
1994, recalled that the University of Kansas also got an
appropriation for its own station, KSKU, which signed on about a
week after KSAC went on the air. KU entered into a time-sharing
arrangement with station WREN, but ultimately dropped out after
several years. It returned to the air in 1952 with KANU-FM.
</P>
<P>
   KSAC moved down the dial to 580 in 1929, the same year that it
embarked on its time-sharing deal with WIBW.
</P>
<P>
   Old-timers said the change was precipitated, in part, by KFKB's
potent signal, which, depending on atmospheric conditions, often
overwhelmed stations up and down the dial. That problem disappeared
in the early 1930s after The Kansas City Star ran articles
unmasking Brinkley as a quack, resulting in the demise of the
Milford clinic and the removal of his radio operation to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   KSAC went about its business. It ignored swing music and soap
operas, Jack Benny and Walter Winchell _ then staples of radio _
and concentrated on getting information out to its listeners, those
Kansans whose taxes paid the freight.
</P>
<P>
   An example: KSAC pioneered what were called filmstrip
broadcasts, equivalent then to instructing today by using
videotapes. Students would gather in a school or meeting hall, KSAC
would be tuned in, a projector would be turned on, and lectures
coming out of the radio would be illustrated with images on a strip
of film. The projectionist knew it was time to advance a frame when
he heard ``ding,'' which, truth be known, was a spoon hitting a
glass in the KSAC studio.
</P>
<P>
   It was no-nonsense stuff, said Titus, aimed, as always, at
helping Kansas farmers and ranchers understand a world that was
changing around them.
</P>
<P>
   Over the following years, KSAC modernized, produced programs for
other stations and pushed for a nationwide public radio service.
Titus was on the committee that helped create the ``All Things
Considered'' news show on National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   One oddity, said Titus, was that for years K-State sportscasts
were provided free. Stations had only to pay the telephone line
charges _ maybe $20 a game. That meant, he said, that more than a
few small, struggling stations were able to survive by selling
commercials at almost pure profit.
</P>
<P>
   While sports were important, the bedrock audience remained the
farmers, ranchers and homemakers//wives who held it all together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always leaned toward the production farmer,'' said
Richard Baker, KKSU news director, ``meaning, getting information,
and lots of it, out to our listeners in rural areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, he said, is essentially the mission of the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's been an effort by some university public radio
stations to distance themselves from their schools,'' Baker said.
``Tune in and, except for the call letters, there's hardly any
indication that they are part of a university. But I understand.
It's a matter of money. They have to raise funds. They have to
reach a big audience.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade the station here, because of the loss of
federal funds, dropped the National Public Radio network and went
to almost all locally produced news and information _ a return to
its roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it intelligent news,'' said Baker. ``I don't care if we
have it first. But I do care that we have it all. There are people
all over this campus who can help that guy who is farming or
ranching. That's what we're about.''

KC POTTER CREATES WHITE HOUSE ORNAMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The letter arrived in Kansas City in July, and the
return address said simply, ``The White House.''
</P>
<P>
   But all Irma Starr thought was, ``What did I do wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was a matter of what she had done right.
</P>
<P>
   The envelope contained an invitation: The Clintons wanted Starr
to create an ornament for the annual White House Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   Although Starr was astonished by the invitation, her inclusion
should be no surprise, given the tree's ``holiday treasures'' theme
that seeks to honor the nation's artistic heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, the potter at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, is a
historic potter. A specialist in lost techniques, she is one of a
handful across the country who reproduce a 17th-century style of
ceramics known as slipware.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thrilled because to think I was good enough to do an
ornament for the White House, it was one of the biggest thrills of
my pottery career,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the area's role as a jumping-off point for the West,
Starr molded her ornament in the shape of a covered wagon, taking a
month and five attempts to get it right. One hurdle was to keep the
ornament to just 1 pound of clay.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the weight limit? The glittering, 18-foot fir
that graces the Blue Room is festooned with crafts, tin icicles and
historical dolls by artisans from throughout the country. It also
is laden with state decorative balls, colored glass balls and
thousands of lights.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 11,191 ornaments cover the tree.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's whimsical covered-wagon ornament is inscribed with the
names of American Indian tribes, slogans like ``Westward Ho!,'' and
an old stagecoach company ad that reads: ``Wanted: wiry, skinny,
wiry young fellow willing to risk death daily. Orphan preferred.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr is petite, with blue eyes and rarely without a ``glitzy''
dragonfly barrette holding her blond hair in place. She favors
jeans and black turtlenecks. She's also a grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Her one-room studio is cluttered with her collection of Old
World Santa Claus figurines that she makes every season. Filled
with the telltale aroma of the potter's kiln, it is more home to
Starr than her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like walking into a kitchen with the smell of an apple
pie baking,'' she said, ``that warm feeling that says, `Oh, you're
home. This is where you belong.' &UR; ''
</P>
<P>
   Starr has been the resident potter at the Nelson Gallery for
more than 25 years. Her primary role is to reproduce objects from
the museum's Burnap collection for the gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   The Burnap pieces, which came from England, are the type of
housewares brought to the colonies, Starr said. The collection is
one of the largest displays of 17th-century slipware in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   Slip, a coating used to decorate pottery, has the consistency of
heavy cream. For the White House ornament, Starr said, she
fashioned a covered wagon out of a type of red clay used by potters
200 years ago. She then coated it with slip _ ``slyppe,'' in the
Old English spelling _ with the kind of device she might use to
frost a cake.
</P>
<P>
   To decorate the ornament, she retreated to the past again, using
tools employed by 17th-century potters, such as a comb and a white
goose feather.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I love the most about being an historical potter, what I
love most about when I walk through the museum doors, is knowing
that I'm part of eternity,'' Starr said. ``It just gives me the
greatest feeling. I'm part of those who have died, those who will
be coming. I'm part of a group of artists. When I walk into the
museum, it's like an old, very special smell that puts me in touch
with the past. It's like a perfume.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr grew up in Boston and attended art school there, in New
York and at the Kansas City Art Institute. While studying ceramics
at the Art Institute, she discovered slipware after her instructor
told her to find something in the nearby Nelson Gallery that she
wanted to reproduce. In the Burnap collection, she saw a plate with
a slip rendition of a mermaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell in love with that mermaid,'' Starr said. ``I knew I had
found something in my life I knew as my destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually she found a home at the museum as well. From there
she has made her reputation as one of the country's foremost
practitioners of an Old World craft. Two of her pieces are in the
museum's permanent collection, and the Nelson Gallery and the
Smithsonian Institution's Renwick Gallery in Washington, which
specializes in American crafts, have asked her to create
commemorative plates.
</P>
<P>
   She also travels and gives workshops. She shares her skills as
far away as Japan and as close as the schoolhouse next door when
she invites her grandchildren's elementary classes at Pembroke Hill
School into her studio to make Christmas gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Starr will be at the White House with other artists to see their
work on display.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after receiving the letter, she still is in awe of
her unexpected good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been the biggest year of my life,'' she said. ``I'm
just so grateful. But I don't take it to my head, because I realize
they are gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   And more lasting gifts than any she might find beneath a tree.

   WORCESTER _ Exhausted but determined searchers retrieved two
more bodies Saturday from the rubble of a cold storage warehouse
where sixfeighters died in a raging fire on Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, the search continued for the body of the sole
remaining firefighter, Paul Brotherton, 41.
</P>
<P>
   Working around the clock and battling biting winds and frigid
temperatures, firefighters recovered the remains of 42-year-old
Lieutenant Thomas Spencer about 4 a.m. near a wall that borders
Interstate 290 and Grafton Street, officials said. Six hours later,
rescuers found the fifth victim, later identified as Jeremiah M.
Lucey, 38, in the same area.
</P>
<P>
   The search was halted temporarily just before noon when high
winds threatened the remaining walls of the brick building, said
distrit fire chief Walter Giard. Engineers were concerned that the
highwinds would cause the weakened walls to collapse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Workers continued clearing the site using heavy equipment as
searchers, dressed in black and yellow jackets, emerged from
sifting through piles of scorched beams and distorted metal with
their faces covered in sadness and soot. The search resumed later
in the afternoon when winds died down.
</P>
<P>
   ``My muscles ache and fatigue take its toll, but as soon as one
of us gets tired, there's another waiting to take our place,'' said
one firefighter, who declined to give his name. ``No matter how
long it takes, we'll be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, about 1,000 mourners packed Our Lady of Rosary
Church to attend the funeral for Timothy Jackson, 51, the first of
the six firefighters to be recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters wore black, yellow and red ribbons, symbolizing
courage and bravery, while members of Jackson's two motorcycle
clubs donned leather jackets and boots.
</P>
<P>
   Quiet sobs could be heard as Joh lligher, pastor of the church,
eulogized Jackson. A yellow firefighter's helmet was laid on the
casket, which was carried to and from the church on a firetruck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Friday at 6:13 p.m., time stopped in Worcester,'' said
Kelligher.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was described as a vivacious man who turned a life of
``hell into everyday heaven on Earth,'' said Diane Flynn
Pellegrino, Jackson's stepdaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was a Vietnam veteran who drove his 1997 Harley-Davidson
motorcycle to rallies in Washington, said friends.
</P>
<P>
   He liked nothing more than to sit on the deck of his Hopedale
home, watching the birds and drinking a cup of coffee with his wife
Mary, said Pellegrino.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife and stepdaughter, Jackson leaves sons Timothy,
Scott, and Knoel.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral for 34-year-old James F. Lyons III is scheduled for
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Also killed when teams of firefighters entered the burning
Worcester Cold Storage and Warehouse Co. building looking to see if
anyone was inside was Joseph McGuirk, 38, whose body was recovered
on Friday. Jackson's remains were pulled from the rubble last
Sunday. Lyons's body was recovered Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A homeless couple, Thomas S. Levesque, 37, and Julie Ann Barnes,
19, are accused of accidentally starting the blaze. The two pleaded
not guilty to charges of involuntary manslaughter and are being
held on $1 million cash bail. Prosecutors say the fire started in
the building after the couple knocked over a candle during a fight.
</P>
<P>
   During Saturday's funeral Mass, Kelligher said the site of the
blaze will symbolize the city's week of tragedy, but he said one
day it will serve as a symbol of pride for Worcester residents.
</P>
<P>
   Even as mourners began to gatherat the church for Jackson's
funeral, there were signs across the city of how the tragedy had
galvanized residents.
</P>
<P>
   Fire stations held car washes to help raise money for the
victim's families, signs along the Massachusetts Turnpike spelled
out condolences, and a billboard bearing the images of the six
firefighters towered above the fire scene.

45,000 CIVILIANS STILL IN GROZNY AS EVACUATION DEADLINE PASSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV AND DMITRY SHALGANOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALKHAN-YURT, Russia _ As Russia's deadline for civilians to
leave Grozny or face annihilation expired Saturday, a column of
trucks and buses pulled up to a makeshift checkpoint on the
battle-scarred road leading south from the besieged Chechen
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The column was there to transport to safety anyone taking
advantage of a new ``safe corridor'' opened by Russian forces
surrounding Grozny. The vehicles were also intended to underscore
Moscow's desire to clear Grozny of civilians before it unleashes an
assault on several thousand militants holed up in the war-ruined
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin sent its top civilian official for emergency
situations, Sergei Shoigu, to open the new escape route. A little
publicity never hurts _ Shoigu is also the leader of the main
pro-Kremlin party contesting next Sunday's parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one problem _ there were no refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Shoigu waited for over an hour, but no one approached the two
armored cars perched on the road where he stood just outside
Grozny, even though the pro-Moscow Chechen administration estimates
that 45,000 civilians are still in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Their fate was unknown Saturday as Moscow gave mixed signals on
whether its forces planned to back up the leave-Grozny-or-die
ultimatum issued in thousands of leaflets dropped on the city last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Facing increasing concern at home and growing criticism abroad,
Moscow has tried to shift attention from the sinister tone of its
ultimatum to concern for civilians trapped in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be no undue concern for the civilian population.
We will look after them ourselves,'' Russian news agencies quoted
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as saying during a visit to the
central Asian republic of Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the people left in Grozny to accept Russian guarantees
will be difficult, as Russia's three-month campaign against
separatists in Chechnya has been marked by the military's seeming
lack of concern for civilians who get in the way.
</P>
<P>
   The latest testimony to that is what remains of the village of
Alkhan-Yurt, which was not so much captured as leveled by Russian
forces 10 days ago. Hardly a building remains standing. Market
stalls, gardens, and the local mosque are shattered ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the town told the New York-based Human Rights Watch
that the army had gone on a rampage after capturing the town on
Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The residents described looting and summary executions. People
inside Alkhan-Yurt, they said, are not allowed out of their houses
for most of the day. Anyone who protests is shot; residents
interviewed by Human Rights Watch in the neighboring Russian region
of Ingushetia said that 17 villagers had been killed since Russian
troops entered the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian troops in Alkhan-Yurt are killing civilians and
looting their property with what appears to be complete impunity,''
said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central
Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. ``It's a shocking case of
Russian force's intentional violation of international law.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports of Russian attacks on civilians in Chechnya have been
common during the campaign to subdue the separatist republic. Not
all the reports have been confirmed, and there have been reports of
rebel attacks on civilians. But the main obstacle for refugees
seems to be the Russian habit of targeting everything that moves in
areas of fighting _ a tactic aimed at avoiding the heavy Russian
casualties that sapped popular support for Moscow's failed
1994-1996 campaign to subdue the separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Shoigu and other officials continued to insist that the warning
did not mean that Russia would not wait for all civilians to get
out even though the deadline passed. But the semi-official Interfax
news agency quoted Russian military officers in Chechnya as saying
that a ban on airstrikes apparently in effect for several days was
to expire Saturday and that Russian troops would resume air and
artillery strikes against the positions of ``bandits and
terrorists,'' Moscow's terms for the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The military issued a statement blaming separatist fighters in
Grozny for preventing civilians from leaving the capital, implying
that the rebels were trying to use noncombatants as human shields.
Shoigu himself said he thought civilians, many of whom have been
hiding in their cellars for days, might not have heard about the
new route.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees trickling out of Grozny via a northern route Friday
offered another version _ that they feared being fired on by
Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   As Shoigu waited, guarded by wary troops and a helicopter
gunship circling overhead, a battery of howitzers nearby unleashed
a salvo in the direction of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military commanders, meanwhile, said that they would
soon capture Grozny. Colonel General Valery Manilov, speaking in
Moscow, spoke of ``unconventional measures'' that would be used,
although he did not elaborate. Another Russian general, Vladimir
Shamanov, told reporters in Chechnya that he had orders to ``pound,
pound, pound'' the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The insurgents will not meet the New Year in Grozny,'' he
said.

FISHER BACK ON BENCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ The look of disappointment on Derek Fisher's
face is clear, even if his words are diplomatic. For the second
time since February, he's earned a starting job, only to be
shuffled back to the Los Angeles Lakers bench.
</P>
<P>
   This time, at least, he could see it coming. Coach Phil Jackson
has a clear preference for big-guard tandems and he wants Kobe
Bryant _ who returned to the starting lineup Wednesday _ paired
with the experienced Ron Harper.
</P>
<P>
   That left the smaller, less-experienced Fisher as the odd man
out.
</P>
<P>
   He's getting used to the routine, though. Last season Fisher
opened as the starting point guard only to be replaced by Derek
Harper, but he reclaimed the job in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   He's taking the recent role change in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little different'' playing in relief, Fisher said.
``I'm a guy, I like to set the tone more so than adjust to it. But
when you're part of a team, you have to be willing to make
adjustments and sacrifice, and this is part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The adjustment proved tough in his first game back on the bench.
Fisher shot 4 for 14 against the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   But against the Vancouver Grizzlies on Saturday, Fisher settled
down to hit 3 of 7 shots and appeared more at ease as he teamed
with Rick Fox and Robert Horry in one of the Lakers' better bench
efforts of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert and Rick and I play well together. . . . The three of
us kind of play the game the same way _ good defenders, smart
players, have an understanding of the game, and I think that kind
of starts to blend together, it makes a nice combination,'' Fisher
said. ``As long as I know that's the way it's a going to be, I'm
cool. The thing is, we get compensated for playing basketball,
whether you start or come off the bench. Whatever the case may be,
it's your responsibility to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Ouch report: Jackson said the idea to place Travis Knight on
the injured list Friday came from Knight. The little-used forward
is trying to recover from a sprained right ankle that's dogged him
since Oct. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to Gary (Vitti, the Lakers' trainer) and asked Gary to
recommend he go on the IR, because his ankle at this point hasn't
been able to get any strength and lift off of it,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   It leaves the Lakers with just one backup center, John Salley,
and one backup power forward, Robert Horry. Knight will travel with
the Lakers on their four-game trip to the East next week and will
be eligible to play by the third game, at Toronto.

 &HT;    Prosperous nation a result of Gore's input, Clinton says
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ In a raspy, hoarse voice, President Clinton
asked Florida Democrats on Saturday to back Vice President Al Gore,
who supported ``every tough decision that I ever had to make as
president.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nostalgic look back at the seven years of his presidency,
Clinton told the more than 2,300 delegates attending the state
Democratic convention here that he and Gore have helped America
reach a level of prosperity ``that I have never seen in my
lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Before they took office, Clinton said, society and the economy
were in disastrous shape. ``Don't let anybody forget it,'' he said.
``What a difference in seven years. We are ending the century on a
high note.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are hoping that a strong economy combined with
portraying Republicans as a party dominated by extremists and
special interests will be enough to help them overcome the enormous
setbacks they have had throughout Florida and the nation in recent
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans can have all the rhetoric they want,'' Clinton
said. ``Let people choose between their rhetoric and our record.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a shot at attempts in Florida to ban affirmative action,
an issue Democrats hope to use against the GOP, Clinton told the
cheering crowd, ``Don't give up on affirmative action. Go out there
and defend it.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat wistfully, Clinton said, ``I can't run for anything
this year.'' Then he reminded delegates that in 1991 as a little
known candidate from Arkansas, ``you put my campaign on the map.''
Clinton won a straw ballot at the convention that year.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the supporters of former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley
came to the convention worried about reports that Bradley had
suffered Friday from a minor heart problem, known as atrial
fibrillation. Bradley will speak to the convention today.
</P>
<P>
   During an afternoon news conference in California on Saturday,
Bradley said his doctors told him that his occasional problems with
an irregular heart beat are not serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling great,'' Bradley said. ``No problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a nuisance, quite frankly,'' said Bradley, who
takes medication twice a day for the condition.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot at stake for Florida Democrats in the 2000
election. If the party fails to win control of either the House or
Senate, they will be at the mercy of Republican lawmakers who will
be creating new legislative districts after the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could mean that Democrats will be out of power for years if
that happens,'' said state Sen. Tom Rossin (D-West Palm Beach), who
will become Senate president in November if the party wins the six
seats it needs for control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The families in this state can't afford to let the Republicans
stay in power,'' said state Rep. Lois Frankel. ``We are disgusted
with the `For Sale' sign that has gone on the state House since
Republicans took over. If they control reapportionment, the state
will be up for grabs.''
</P>
<P>
   Before going to the convention, Clinton met privately for about
45 minutes with Nelson Mandela, who is visiting Florida. Their
conversation was about world peace, said Clinton spokesman Barry
Toiv.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically filled each other in on what they've been doing
to promote peace in various parts of the world,'' Toiv said, adding
that Clinton spoke about the Middle East and Mandela talked about
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech at the convention, Clinton played a round of
golf and then traveled to Fort Lauderdale where he attended a
dinner to raise money for U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings (D-Miramar).
Hastings, who flew on Air Force One with Clinton from Orlando to
Fort Lauderdale, is seeking a fifth term next year.
</P>
<P>
   In a rousing speech to the convention delegates, Hastings
scoffed at the notion that Democrats are in trouble because of
``Clinton fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you tired of low interest rates? Are you tired of
Democrats working like hell for a woman's right to choose?''
Hastings shouted. ``I'm sick and tired that Americans are still
being bombarded with distortions about the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ended his trip to Florida raising money in Miami for the
Democratic congressional and senate campaign committees. The money
will be used for candidates nationwide in the effort to wrest
control of Congress from the Republicans.

 &HT;    Gore blasts Bush record on protecting Florida Everglades
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Since Gov. Jeb Bush took office, decisions are
being made by the South Florida Water Management District that may
not help with restoring the Everglades, Vice President Al Gore said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about saving the Everglades,'' said Gore, who
then went on to question, without offering any specifics, whether
the water management district is acting independently or at the
behest of the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a couple of decisions by the majority of the
board that would have been different under the Lawton Chiles
team,'' Gore said during an interview after his speech to state
Democratic convention delegates. ``I don't fully understand why
they are getting off track a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 40 minute speech, he slammed Republicans, bragged about
being a grandfather and did a little stand-up comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Notably absent from his speech was any reference to his
political rival Bill Bradley, who is threatening to derail Gore's
campaign in New Hampshire and Iowa. Gore's only remark about the
former New Jersey senator was to wish him well on his return to the
campaign after a minor problem with his heart on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in his interview with reporters, Gore was more critical
of Bradley, saying he does not have the experience to keep the
economy moving forward. Gore also said that Bradley doesn't have a
good answer for how he would protect Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Gore, who began the campaign earlier this year
believing Bradley would not be a serious threat, has taken Bradley
to task on a host of issues. On Saturday, however, Gore decided to
spend his time going after Republicans instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is going to determine a great deal about who we
are as a people,'' said Gore, who warned that Republicans are
controlled by extreme elements in the party who want to get rid of
affirmative action and a woman's right to have an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think is going on in those closed door meetings
when they meet with Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson?'' asked Gore.
He said that when leaders of the religious right leave the room and
say they heard everything they wanted to hear, that is code that
Republicans have agreed to ``give the ultra right wing
fundamentalists control of the Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the crowd cheered as Gore said, ``I fought against the
Newt Gingrich Republican Congress when they came in.'' He said he
intends to continue that fight against extremists.
</P>
<P>
   He said it's up to Democrats to make sure that progress is
continued in winning more rights for women and minorities,
including making sure ``there is equal pay for equal work.''
</P>
<P>
   In a strong appeal to labor, Gore said, ``You need to know this.
I am pro-labor, pro-collective bargaining, pro-union.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he stepped into the middle of Florida's debate about
affirmative action and Californian Ward Connerly's attempt to amend
Florida's constitution so that affirmative action would be banned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida doesn't need Ward Connerly,'' he said. ``And they
don't need any new ballot propositions or phony quota systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing Florida as ``a battleground next year,'' Gore said
the next president must be someone who cares about the state's
environmental needs. He promised to ``fight big polluters,'' and
said he would ban new offshore oil drilling and do whatever it
takes to protect the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that Texas Gov. George W. Bush has allowed his state to
become No. 1 in water, air and land pollution, Gore warned, ``We
don't want that kind of environmental policy nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said his first act as president would be to send back to
the Senate the nuclear test ban treaty that was rejected by
Republicans and ``demand that they ratify it.''
</P>
<P>
   After his speech Gore met privately with the black and Hispanic
caucuses. He also had private meetings with Florida Democratic
leaders. Some of them warned Gore not to take Florida for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a competitive state,'' said Steve Pajcic, a
Jacksonville attorney and former candidate for governor who is
supporting Bradley. ``I think you're going to see a very positive
reaction to Bradley when he speaks to the delegates.''

 &HT;    Necessary precautions to take with gas logs and fireplaces
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The use of gas fireplaces and gas logs has
increased so dramatically in recent years that sales of gas
fireplaces now easily outstrip sales of wood-burning fireplaces,
stoves, fireplace inserts and pellet stoves.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Hearth Product Association, sales of gas logs
and fireplaces grew from 149,000 units in in 1992 to nearly 800,000
in 1998. Sales of wood-burning appliances were at 541,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising, then, that problems associated with
gas-burning fireplaces are increasing, too.
</P>
<P>
   Properly manufactured gas-burning fireplaces are safe when used
as directed, but Jeff Cooper, an air pollution control specialist
with Montgomery County's environmental health division, said many
consumers don't use them as intended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have detected elevated levels of carbon monoxide and carbon
dioxide in homes that are beyond what would be considered safe in
an industrial environment,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a gas fireplace or intend to get one to burn natural
gas, propane or liquefied gas, you should be aware of safety issues
associated with their use.
</P>
<P>
   THE THREE TYPES OF GAS FIREPLACES
</P>
<P>
   Modern gas-burning fireplace products imitate the look of a
natural wood fire much better than gas logs of a few years ago, but
not all gas-burning fireplaces are the same. The products come in
three types: vented, ventless and direct-vented.
</P>
<P>
   Vented gas fireplaces and gas logs produce the most
authentic-looking flames, but they are the least energy efficient.
These units must be used with a chimney or flue to carry combustion
products out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Vented gas logs can be used in the same fireplaces that once
were used to burn wood, said Tom Stegman, vice president of the
Patio and Hearth Shoppe in Centerville. He said the damper on the
fireplace must be left open when vented logs or fireplace inserts
are used.
</P>
<P>
   Air from the room in front of the fireplace is drawn in to feed
the flames as the gas burns in these units, and most of the heat
escapes through the chimney. But because the flames have a vigorous
air supply, they burn brightly and have the look of a natural wood
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Direct-vented fireplaces are self-enclosed boxes that draw their
air from outside the house through a small plastic pipe. They are
normally placed against outside walls in any room of the house, and
the vent pipe usually goes through the wall directly behind the
unit.
</P>
<P>
   The exhaust gases escape through the same vent pipe used to
supply air to the fire. Because the firebox is a closed system,
most of the energy released by burning the gas remains in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said direct-vented fireplaces are the best choice for
most consumers because of their safety and energy efficiency. But
they are not quite as energy efficient as ventless fireplaces, and
their flames are not as dramatic as vented fireplaces.
</P>
<P>
   The last type of fireplace is ventless. These units can be used
in any room because they are designed to burn gas without producing
large amounts of carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   Since no waste gases are vented outside, practically all the
heat a ventless fireplace produces stays in the room. The flames
may not be as impressive as vented models, however, and ventless
fireplaces raise some safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID INJURY
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said the health department has been called to homes
frequently in recent years on complaints of headaches, dizziness,
respiratory irritations and difficulty concentrating in homes using
gas fireplaces.
</P>
<P>
   He said burning fuel always produces byproducts, but ventless
fireplaces are designed to burn their fuels as completely as
possible so potentially harmful byproducts are minimized.
</P>
<P>
   Stegman said ventless fireplaces are very safe, but when they
are used in airtight houses _ and most houses built in the past 10
years are fairly airtight _ they can cause problems.
</P>
<P>
   The small amount of carbon monoxide they produce may be able to
build up in a closed room. ``If you're concerned, then by all means
you should have a carbon-monoxide detector in the room with your
ventless fireplace,'' Stegman said.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is oxygen depletion. No fire burns without
consuming oxygen, and a ventless fireplace in a tightly closed room
could reduce the available oxygen in the air to dangerously low
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Stegman said ventless fireplaces are equipped with oxygen
depletion sensors that cut off the flames when the oxygen in a room
drops below a certain level.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said the manufacturers of ventless fireplaces suggest
that people using them crack a window in the room to bring in
oxygen and allow combustion byproduct gases to escape. ``But hardly
anybody does that,'' he said. ``It seems like you're defeating the
purpose of the fireplace if you've got a window open.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading the owner's manual and following its directions are
vital for anyone using a gas fireplace product of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have an owner's manual for your fireplace or gas
logs, do not use them until you can contact the manufacturer for
detailed operating instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Also take care when purchasing a gas-burning fireplace product.
Any product you buy should include a seal from the American Gas
Association indicating the product meets safety standards. Also
check with the retailer and your local government zoning department
to be sure the type of fireplace you're considering is allowed
where you live.
</P>
<P>
   Another consideration is sizing. The fireplace product you use
should not be too large or small for your home, and the retailer
should be able to help you decide what you need.
</P>
<P>
   A professional installer knows how to avoid some of the problems
associated with installing a fireplace incorrectly. Many gas
fireplaces and gas logs can be installed by a competent
do-it-yourselfer, but the extra cost of hiring someone with
experience may be a good investment.

 &HT;    Philbin helps tennis charity win a million
 &HT;    By Stephen Kiehl
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELRAY BEACH, Fla. _ Ree-gis! Ree-gis! We want to be
millionaires, too!
</P>
<P>
   The autograph hounds hit on tart-tongued talk show host Regis
Philbin like a Rhodes scholar on an easy-money question Saturday at
the Chris Evert Pro-Celebrity Tennis Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin, host of ABC's hit ``Who Wants to Be A Millionaire'' has
played this charity tournament at the Delray Beach Tennis Center
before, but this year there's no pro or celebrity who can match his
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   He's huge. Bigger than Evert. Bigger than Jimmy Connors. Bigger
than Chevy Chase. Bigger _ maybe _ than former President George
Bush, who will play today.
</P>
<P>
   And the 3,500 fans who showed up got their fill of Philbin
during a doubles match he played with Chris Evert against his wife,
Joy, and Connors.
</P>
<P>
   In a matching blue shirt and shorts, Philbin stalked the clay
court, stoking the crowd, flinging his racket to the ground after
bad shots and pumping his fists after good ones. A few times, he
even got shots past five-time U.S. Open winner Connors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too much!'' he bragged. ``Honest to God, I'm too much!''
</P>
<P>
   After the match, which he and Evert won 6-5, Philbin recounted
the victory as he signed the glossy photos and magazine covers his
fans brought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see me out there?'' he asked. ``I kicked Connors' ass.
I wasn't intimidated at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10th annual two-day tournament benefits Chris Evert
Charities Inc., which gives money to drug abuse programs and
children's programs in South Florida. In its first nine years, the
event has raised about $7.5 million. And organizers expect the take
this year to be the biggest ever _ about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Evert, who won 18 Grand Slam events during the peak of her
tennis career, lives in Boca Raton with her three children and
husband, Andy Mill. She plays an active role in organizing the
tournament every year and bringing in some of the top names in
tennis and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first year Connors and John McEnroe have
participated.
</P>
<P>
   ``When friends call, you're happy to help them,'' Connors said,
praising Evert's philanthropy work. ``It's amazing what can be done
when you have the right name and you put your mind to it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his matchup with Philbin, Connors said he was ``shaken
but not stirred.'' And on Philbin's caliber of play: ``He's come a
long way, but he still has a way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the weekend's most anticipated matches will take place
today, when Bush and McEnroe square off against Evert and Chase.

LAKERS ARE SORE WINNERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ Ron Harper's left quadriceps was imprinted
with Bryant Reeves' large kneecap. Shaquille O'Neal's knees ached
through 40 minutes of near-nonstop movement. And Glen Rice's
shooting only looked painful.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder, then, that coach Phil Jackson didn't fret over
the Los Angeles Lakers' failure to put away the Vancouver Grizzlies
early on Saturday at G.M. Place. A win, any kind of win, was
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   And this one, a 106-94 victory, was even encouraging, achieved
through the relief work of Robert Horry, Rick Fox and Derek Fisher
as much as O'Neal, Rice or Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   The bench trio combined for 20 of the Lakers' 36 fourth-quarter
points as the Lakers broke a late tie and pulled away for a
hard-earned road win. It was easily the Lakers' best second-unit
performance in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been waiting on it,'' Harper said, ``like Christmas.
They finally showed up tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   With impeccable timing, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies, 4-16 but playing surprisingly well of late, were
positioned for the upset. They had the game tied at 75 with 9:33
remaining. But Fisher and Fox propelled an 8-0 run to pull away,
and Fox later hit a 3-pointer to make it a 10-point game by the
4:40 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bibby, who led the Grizzlies with 23 points, powered a
brief Grizzlies rally to cut the deficit to 91-88 with 2:25 to go,
but Rice, Horry and Bryant all made their free throws down the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we played decent,'' said Horry, who had seven rebounds
and a season-high 11 points. ``We went to the boards, we played
good defense, we made a little run.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox also finished with 11 points, on 5-of-6 shooting. And Fisher
played steady defense and kept the second unit humming while
scoring six.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big relief for us,'' Jackson said of the bench play,
``because obviously road games are games that you play your
starters 35 minutes, maybe 40. For us to be able to sit Harp and
A.C. (Green) and Glen on the bench for that period of time helped
us a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly with back-to-back games _ the Lakers have a date
with the Detroit Pistons tonight at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone rested, of course. O'Neal played a routine 44
minutes to get his 30 points and 10 rebounds. Bryant, in his second
start of the season, played 39 minutes and did a little of
everything: 14 points, six rebounds, seven assists and a
career-high five blocked shots, with just two turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Rice scored 22 points but labored to get there. He was 5 of 15
from the field, making up for it with a 12-for-13 performance at
the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, O'Neal complained of stiff knees and Harper limped on
a sore leg caused by a first-half collision with Reeves. He had to
ask out of the game early in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got tight,'' Harper said. ``Long year _ I didn't need to go
out there an try to kill myself.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal blocked three shots in the game but admitted his defense,
and the team's, has slipped a notch this week. Vancouver shot 46.9
percent and was able to capitalize on second efforts thanks Shareef
Abdur-Rahim's seven offensive rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that can be fixed,'' O'Neal said. ``A lot of
guys have colds. And my knees are kind of stiff today. . . . I was
a couple steps slow, but my homeboys helped me out today.''
</P>
<P>
   The cavalry was a little late in arriving. The Lakers trailed
50-49 at halftime and by as many as six points in the third
quarter. It wasn't until they scored 36 in the fourth that the
offense got untracked. Until then, they endured an assault from
Abdur-Rahim (19 points) and the Grizzlies backcourt of Bibby and
Michael Dickerson, who outscored Harper and Bryant 34-19.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a feisty young team and they played a rather good
game,'' Jackson said of the Grizzlies. ``I expected a game like
this. Vancouver's been playing real good basketball, they've been
sticking real close to teams. They're losing, but they're giving
them a run, they're competitive, they don't make a whole lot of
turnovers . . . and they have enough offensive weapons that they
could hold us at bay for awhile.''

NEW YORK CITY SCHOOLS SAID TO HAVE INFLATED ATTENDANCE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A commission that Gov. George Pataki appointed to
investigate possible corruption in the New York City school system
has found evidence of inflated student attendance figures at dozens
of high schools, state officials who have read the panel's
preliminary report said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance figures help determine how much state aid a school
receives, and state officials have long suspected that some New
York City schools inflate the numbers to get more money.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have read the report, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the investigation had found that some high schools
kept students on the attendance rolls even after they transferred
to private or parochial schools or moved out of state. One student
who died unexpectedly in the summer of 1998 was kept on his high
school's attendance rolls for the entire 1998-99 school year, the
officials said, even though the student's mother had informed the
school of his death.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they expected Pataki to disclose more details
about the investigation in a news conference this week. Pataki
convened the commission in January to check the reliability of the
attendance figures, which help determine how much state aid each
school receives. He also directed the commission to investigate
possible corruption and mismanagement at the city's School
Construction Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Neither investigation is finished, the officials said, but
Pataki is disclosing some preliminary findings this week because he
gave the commission an initial deadline of Dec. 1 to report back to
him. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and other Democrats have
criticized the commission as a waste of money _ Pataki has budgeted
$2.8 million for the commission in the current fiscal year _ and
questioned whether the investigations were necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Pam McDonnell, a spokeswoman for Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew,
said Saturday that she could not comment on the preliminary
findings because nobody at the Board of Education had seen them.
</P>
<P>
   The state officials refused Saturday to discuss whether Crew or
any Board of Education officials would be implicated in the
commission's findings. The preliminary findings come after a
scathing report last week by Edward F. Stancik, the special
investigator for New York City schools, which charged that 43
teachers, 2 principals and 2 paraprofessionals at 32 city schools
had been involved in cheating on standardized math and reading
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Crew fired three school aides and six teachers who did not have
tenure on Thursday after concluding that they had directed students
to cheat on standardized tests. Both Stancik's report and the state
commission's report come at a sensitive time for Crew, since the
Board of Education is considering whether to extend his contract
and he is weighing whether he even wants to remain on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki created the commission under the terms of the Moreland
Act of 1907, which grants the governor the authority to establish
panels with the power to subpoena witnesses and documents. He
appointed Roslynn R. Mauskopf, the state inspector general, to lead
the panel, which has a staff of about 30 lawyers, auditors and
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The state commission was originally seen as a swipe at Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani when Pataki convened it last winter. The two men
had a chilly relationship at the time, and Giuliani at first
criticized the commission as a waste of time and money. But since
then, Giuliani's relationship with Pataki has improved and his
relationship with Crew has deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   The state officials who had read the preliminary findings were
already pointing figures at the Board of Education Saturday, saying
that city education officials had dragged their heels in turning
over documents and insisted that board lawyers be present at state
investigators' interviews with school officials.

IT WON'T BE SAME WITHOUT SIR CHARLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; The NBA lost one of its 50 greatest players this week but just
as sadly also lost its human reality-check.
</P>
<P>
   When Charles Barkley crumpled to the floor in Philadelphia after
the left quadriceps tendon tore away from his kneecap and ``rolled
up like a Venetian blind,'' according to Sixers president Pat
Croce, the NBA lost much more than a legend.
</P>
<P>
   It lost a real, thinking person. Not someone hidden behind
shades, cell phones or bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, like Magic Johnson, was part of that dying breed of
approachable superstars.
</P>
<P>
   He was refreshing, even if the public didn't always see this
side of him, because of the blaring headlines surrounding his
problems with fans.
</P>
<P>
   No one could light up a locker room like Barkley. He didn't
brood before games, like Penny Hardaway. Or try to declare himself
off-limits, like Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley held court. His presence was so commanding that when the
Rockets played the Lakers in the first round of the playoffs, the
crowd around his cubicle dwarfed then-teammate Scottie Pippen's,
just a few feet away.
</P>
<P>
   He would talk to anyone. Ball boys. Reporters. Ushers. And if
you wanted an honest answer, he was your go-to guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I weren't earning more than $3 million a year to dunk a
basketball,'' Barkley once said, ``most people on the street would
run in the other direction if they saw me coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was perhaps his most famous quote, regarding role
models.
</P>
<P>
   ``Professional athletes should not be role models,'' he said.
``Hell, I know drug dealers who can dunk. Can drug dealers be role
models, too?''
</P>
<P>
   The irony was that Barkley was often a role model, going out of
his way to give little kids his shoes or other mementos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball doesn't owe me a thing. I owe basketball,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Try finding that type of response the next time the Knicks come
to town.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a reason Barkley became embroiled in feuds with
temperamental stars like Pippen and Philadelphia's Allen Iverson.
He didn't mind puncturing a bloated ego if someone wasn't pulling
their weight. He usually won these battles too, because few could
match him in verbal jousts.
</P>
<P>
   During his post-injury press conference, Barkley found time for
humor, noting he would be limited from certain activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf and sex are the only two things you can be bad at and
still have a blast doing them,'' Barkley said.
</P>
<P>
   Always the king of the one-liners, even 'til the end.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley's list of accomplishments is considerable: NBA player of
the year in 1993, an All-Star 11 times, a member of the All-NBA
first team five times, two Olympic gold medals and MVP of the 1991
All-Star game. He played 1,072 games, scored 23,755 points and
grabbed 12,545 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   But he'll be missed nearly as much for his honesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be 37 in a couple of months and I've never had a real
job,'' Barkley said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hughes blues: The 76ers would love to unload point guard
Larry Hughes, who has been in coach Larry Brown's doghouse, but
Toronto pulled out of a deal that would have sent forward Tracy
McGrady.
</P>
<P>
   Raptors coach Butch Carter described Hughes as being ``one of
the top 10 young players in the league,'' but said that in the
6-foot-8 McGrady, ``we have the top 20-year-old in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Philly then called New Jersey and asked for guard Kerry Kittles,
but the Nets nixed the deal because of salary-cap complications.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, after both trades fell through, Brown said, ``We're
absolutely not shopping Larry Hughes.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Company man: Bulls star Toni Kukoc was asked if he trusted
team vice president Jerry Krause and replied, ``That's a question
I'm not going to answer to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc was then asked if Krause had ever made a promise and then
broken it? ``Uh, I'm not going to tell you that one, either,''
Kukoc said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Krause heard about this and brought out his brass
knuckles. Kukoc later called a reporter and asked for a chance to
respond to the questions again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes. I trust Jerry Krause,'' Kukoc said. ``Why not? He's never
done anything wrong to me.'' As for the second question, Kukoc
said, ``No, Jerry Krause has not made any promises to me that he
didn't keep. Everything that he promised me, he has done what he
said he would do.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Latest critic: Magic Johnson was in Cleveland this week and
made the mistake of watching the Cavaliers play the hapless Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Bulls management) had a master plan and the master
plan was destroyed,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Pack your bags: Washington Wizards forward Tracy Murray is
prepared for his departure as he becomes more and more irrelevant
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worn out my welcome here,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   __ First fired? Golden State coach P.J. Carlesimo is the
likeliest candidate to be the first coach relieved of his duties.
Warriors owners have reportedly told general manager Garry St. Jean
they are prepared to fire Carlesimo and make him the coach for the
remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   They are also prepared to fire St. Jean if he can't turn things
around. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
TOP 10 AND NO. 29 &QL; 
1. Lakers (15-5) &QL; 
Maybe Charlotte will take back Rice for Jones, Campbell? &QL; 
2. Miami (15-4) &QL; 
Pat Riley abandons plan to acquire a point guard _ this week. &QL; 
3. San Antonio (15-6) &QL; 
NBA champs had 6,000 empty seats for game with Grizzlies. &QL; 
4. Portland (16-5) &QL; 
Hitting a rut, time for Pippen to disappear. &QL; 
5. Sacramento (12-5) &QL; 
If they only played home games, NBA finals would be a lock. &QL; 
6. Seattle (14-6) &QL; 
What's Westphal doing to keep these malcontents in line? &QL; 
7. Toronto (12-7) &QL; 
Hmmm, why isn't Vancouver up here, too? Ask Stu Jackson. &QL; 
8. Utah (12-7) &QL; 
Decision to add only Olden Polynice in offseason really worked. &QL; 
9. Phoenix (13-6) &QL; 
Surprise! Penny injured when Magic comes to town. &QL; 
10. Indiana (12-7) &QL; 
Bird scrimmages with team, nearly collapses. &QL; 
No. 29 Chicago (2-15) &QL; 
Courtside seats at United Center aren't what they used to be. &QL; 
__ By The Numbers &QL; 
10,000 &QL; 
Career points for Miami's Dan Majerle after scoring eight in
Tuesday night's 86-76 win over Portland. &QL; 
20 &QL; 
Number of times in 21 games Portland has held its opponent under
100 points. &QL; 
19 &QL; 
Double-doubles for San Antonio's Tim Duncan in his first 21 games
this season. &QL; 
4 &QL; 
Triple-doubles this season: Two by Sacramento's Chris Webber and
one each by Dallas forward Michael Finley and Clippers guard Derek
Anderson. &QL; 
__ Sign Of The Times &QL; 
On the night Charles Barkley's career ended with a knee injury in
Philadelphia, 76ers point guard Allen Iverson was not even in the
arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers' leading scorer and defending NBA scoring champion
called in sick Wednesday but felt somewhat better later in the
evening and went to TGI Friday's on City Avenue, an establishment
popular with many of the players.
</P>
<P>
   When Iverson arrived, the phone lines at a local sports-talk
radio station went wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry the whole thing even happened,'' Iverson said. ``If
I had known it was going to have this type of response, I would
never have come out. I would have eaten a peanut butter and jelly
sandwich.'' &QL; 
__ Rumor of the Week &QL; 
The Knicks are the latest team with an inexplicable interest in
Lakers forward Glen Rice. The Knicks wouldn't mind dumping Charlie
Ward or Chris Childs but would probably have to send a marquee
player (Allan Houston, Marcus Camby) for Rice. &QL;

JEFFERSON LOSS WOULD CREATE CHARACTER VOID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shawn Jefferson was walking down the steps toward the locker
room when Patriots vice president of personnel Bobby Grier
intercepted him, put his arm around him, and said, ``I want you
back here next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are no different from other teams that want to
retain their ``character'' players, hoping to appeal to their sense
of being wanted and needed. These players are rare in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Teams try to look for a hometown discount with these players but
seldom get it. The Patriots didn't get it with Willie McGinest or
Ted Johnson or Ty Law. They probably got a bit of a break with
Bruce Armstrong, who stayed in New England rather than take more
money to go to New York with Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are already $5.6 million over the salary cap for
next year and that doesn't include free agents such as Jefferson,
Troy Brown, Tedy Bruschi, Steve Israel, and Chris Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, like Brown, is a hard receiver to fit into a money
slot. Neither is considered a No. 1 receiver and therefore ill not
command the $5 million-$6 million per year that Antonio Freeman and
Herman Moore make. Brown would like to be considered at least in
the No. 2 slot. Jefferson, who makes $1.8 million this year and
leads the league in receiving average (18.4 yards) f e second
straight year, is a No. 2 receiver, but given his many
contributions to the team on the field and off, he is more like a
1A. He's one of those players who is more valuable to the team he's
with than he would be to another team.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Jefferson is not expecting to be a Patriot when the
2000 season rolls around. It's not that he doesn't want to be; in
fact, he said he will make New England his home either way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here four years, we've got younger guys,'' said
Jefferson. ``I can't speak for anybody else, but I don't think I'll
be here. There are a lot of guys they have to re-sign. I'm a
realist. That's all. I'd like to be back, but . . .''
</P>
<P>
   There are teams, including the Cleveland Browns, New York Jets,
and New York Giants, that would love to sign Jefferson. Cleveland
can give Jefferson what he deserves, which is probably twice as
much as he currently makes. Only the Baltimore Ravens have a better
overall cap situation than the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   While the Patriots feel they can replace Jefferson on the field
with Tony Simmons (with Vincent Brisby in the wings), Jefferson's
presence in the locker room is huge.
</P>
<P>
   Losing Jefferson will be like losing Sam Gash or Dave Meggett.
Jefferson does the housecleaning for Pete Carroll, just as Gash and
Meggett did for Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   How much is that worth?
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson is about to find out.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly handshakes by Grier and appreciation offered by
Carroll and owner Bob Kraft have made Jefferson feel, at the very
least, that the team appreciates what he does on a day-to-day basis
in terms of setting a positive example.
</P>
<P>
   However, no contract has er been discussed with Jefferson. The
Patriots may be waiting until the season ends, but they might be
wise to do what they've done with Lawyer Milloy: lay the
groundwork. At least begin some form of negotiations, especially
with the stadium zoning now approved.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson may fall between the Darnay Scott/Johnnie Morton
level, which is about $3 million a year, and Yancey Thigpen's $4
million.
</P>
<P>
   If he does leave New England, he will leave on good terms, with
fond memories and a feeling that he helped the younger receivers.
He will leave knowing he did everything he could to bring the
Patriots together, to get Terry Glenn on the right track, to offer
common sense when none seemed to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Last week before the Dallas game, Jefferson rounded up the
receivers after having a one-on-one with Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (Bledsoe) to tell me what's up so I can be the
mouthpiece and relate it to the other guys,'' said Jefferson. ``We
had a good talk. I went back to the guys and I told them: `We're
going through tough times and nobody can determine the outcome of a
game except for us and the quarterback. We need to make plays. He's
having a little trouble right now so we have to make plays for him.
We have to make tough catches. We have to make them when the ball
is behind us or wherever it's thrown.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson would leave here with a growing appreciation for
Carroll and the feeling that the coach got a bad shake in this
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I speak for every one of my teammates when I say we're not
quitting on Pete,'' said Jefferson. ``We all respect Pete. Pete is
a damned good coach. Pete don't go out there and make the wrong
reads, mental mistake or fumble the ball. The responsibility lies
with the guys on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me when I hear people blaming Pete. Start blaming
players. Hold the players accountable. Hold me accountable if I'm
not getting the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   The older Jefferson gets _ he's 30 and in his ninth year _ the
more he feels he needs to add more leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to do more,'' he said. ``Each year I'll try to do
more. Whether I'm here or not next year, they need me here now. If
I'm not here next year, hopefully Tony and Sean Morey will have
seen something in me they can learn from. I know I've given those
young guys and this team everything I have.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've learned is, it's not about what you've done. The
league has become where you have to fit under the cap. If you can
find a younger guy to do what I can do, you do it. If that's the
decision, then I'm a big boy. I can still run. I'm in great shape.
I can play another five years at this level. I pride myself in
woring hard. I'll always do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I see guys out there with stats. They also get more
opportunities. If I was getting the opportunities those guys are,
my stats would be higher. That's not what motivates me. What I care
about is what can I do to help this team win.''
</P>
<P>
   What is that worth?
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, it cannot be figured on a computer or calculator.
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes this decision so tough.
</P>
<P>
   The over/under line
</P>
<P>
   Which AFC East team is in the best shape to make moves in the
offseason? Indianapolis, of course. According to the latest
management figures obtaine by the Globe, the Colts are $9 million
under the salary cap for 2000. But the figures are sed on this
year's cap, which should increase by almost $5 million next season,
giving the Colts about $14 million to work with. The second-best
situation is Miami, which is $3.15 million under. Teams over the
cap are the Patriots ($5.6 million), the Jets ($9.3 million), and
the Bills (a whopping $17.5 million). The Patriots' situation isn't
dire, but they will have to let a player or two go if they're going
to attempt to sign a free agent . . . If the Patriots drop some
payroll, they might go all-out for Jon Runyan, the Tennessee
Titans' talented right tackle, who will be an unrestricted free
agent. On the defensive side the Patriots would have to look at
free agent tackle Sam Adams of the Seahawks. Adams's father, Sam,
was a guard for the Patriots from 1972-80 . . . The Patriots have
sold about half of their 80 luxury boxes for the new stadium; the
6,000 stadium club seats will likely be snapped up quickly.
Therefore, that won't be a big issue in whether they retain Carroll
. . . From the ``Where are They Now'' file: Former Patriots wide
receiver Hart Lee Dykes is running a trucking company in Houston .
. . It's odd that, with so many former players living in the area,
the Patriots don't use them as coaches. Even if they're not hired
full time, what's wrong with utilizing Steve Grogan, Steve Nelson,
Fred Smerlas, Ronnie Lippett, Steve DeOssie, John Hannah, Pete
Brock, Tim Fox, etc., in training camp or for special instruction?
It's a different sport with a different set of rules, but the Red
Sox have always used Ted Williams, Carl Yastrzemski, Bobby Doerr,
Dwight Evans, and now Carlton Fisk as instructors . . . Desmond
Howard, whom we know in the parts as the man who ruined th
Patriots' Super Bowl hopes, was cut by the Packers for the second
time in his career because he didn't practice enough. He signed
with Detroit, and in his first game he ran a punt back 68 yards for
a touchdown . . . Thurman Thomas is set to return to the Bills as a
third-down back, which means Antowain Smith and Jonathan Linton
will share duties on first and second downs . . . Agent Ray
Anderson thi one of his clients, Minnesota offensive coordinator
Ray Sherman, has taken heat for the ``system'' he had in Pittsburgh
now that the Steelers have gone through bad times. ``Ray could be
saying a lot about that situation but he won't,'' said Anderson.
``He's too classy a guy. It's just one of those things where you
blame the coordinator when something goes wrong. It's done all over
the league.'' Certainly he doesn't mean in New England? . . . The
same kind of mean-spiritedness that's often directed at Carroll
lives in the hearts of Steeler fans for Bill Cowher. Cowher told
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, ``People say things that sometimes you
kind of bite your tongue and you wonder why they say them and where
they come from. I guess you have to sit down and appreciate the
fact that when you're in the public eye, people can say whatever
they want with no repercussions, with no feelings that you have a
wife and children and that you're trying to live a life of
normalcy, too.'' Those same Carroll bashers speak of wanting Cowher
to coach in New England. My advice to Cowher: Don't even think
about it. It's worse here. Much worse . . . Faced with a cap
overload of $24 million for next season, the 49ers are making plans
to restructure rry Rice's contract. Rice, 37, was scheduled to earn
$2.25 million next season, but his cap number was $5.49 million . .
. Denver offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak is rumored to be going
to either Houston or New England. Kubiak has been in three Super
Bowls and has 10 playoff wins and one loss on his resume. Despite
``inside'' information by national types, the Patriots think the
reports are ludicrous. Unless Kraft is being disingenuous
concerning his public support for Carroll _ which would be
uncharacteristic of the Ptriots' owner _ then the reports are trash
. . . Dan Reeves has been a successful coach but he may go down in
history as the only one who twice went from a Super Bowl appearance
to a five-win (or worse) season. In 1990, the Broncos went 5-11
after a Super Bowl appearance. This season, Reeves's Falcons are
3-9 . . . Bo Jackson has purchased a Birmingham, Ala., franchise in
the Spring Football League, an eight-team league that begins in
March with a 12-game season. The league has franchises in Canton,
Ohio; Houston; Jackson, Miss.; Los Angeles; Miami; San Antonio; and
Washington, D.C. It will be used as a ``developmental league'' for
the NFL, though the NFL has no formal affiliation with it. Also in
the spring league's ownership loop are former NFL stars Eric
Dickerson and Tony Dorsett . . . We write about players' fights and
transgressions, so we'll write about what they do that's good and
honorable, too. Max Lane and Bledsoe collecting money from
teammates for the Worcester firefighters' families was a wonderful
thing, as was Ben Coates donating thousands of dollars for the Ben
Coates Room at Hasbro Children's Hospital in Providn.

OFF-FIELD PROBLEMS DON'T REFLECT WELL ON LEAF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by wor Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The mere mention of the name understandably might
cause him to cringe even more than the torn right shoulder labrum
almost five months ago that turned his would-be season of
redemption into a second straight eternity in purgatory. ut Ryan
Leaf was nobly diplomatic _ or at least as noble and diplomatic as
Ryan Leaf can be.
</P>
<P>
   Standing outside the San Diego Chargers' training complex
Thursday, the second-year non-quarterback was asked whether he felt
an extra burden because of the breathtaking success of the
Indianapolis Colts' Peyton Manning, with whom Leaf formed a
celestial 1-2 punch at the head of the 1998 National Football
League college draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' Leaf replied without hesitation. ``I wish him
the best.'' Pause. Impish grin. ``Unless we're playing them. Then I
hope he dies like a dog on the field.'' Pause. Impish grin. ``Other
than that, I wish him the best.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an ironic season's greeting, for being a canine corpse
would constitute a professional resurrection for Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Considered virtually inseparable in talent and promise on draft
day some 20 months ago, Tennessee's Manning and Washington State's
Leaf have followed slightly divergent paths since then. In a
scenario a fabulist couldn't concoct, Manning has been the ultimate
can't-miss prospect. In a nightmare beyond the devil's imagination,
Leaf has been a complete can't.
</P>
<P>
   So Manning will continue to pad his resume in Indianapolis when
he faces the Patriots as the Colts close in on what had been the
unthinkable: theAC ast championship. Meanwhile, fresh from a
four-game suspension for cursing out general manager Bobby
Beathard, Leaf will try to forget his dossier as he stands on the
sideline in Seattle, the aptly designated ``disaster quarterback''
for the second week in a row, as the Chargers close in on the
unbearable: a 5-8 record.
</P>
<P>
   And to think there was grave doubt that the Colts had chosen
correctly in April 1998, while Beathard was hailed for pulling off
a personnel coup when he sent wide receiver/kick returner Eric
Metcalf, linebacker Patrick Sapp, plus two firsts and a
second-round draft choice to Arizona to obtain the No. 2 pick _
whichever quarterback Indianapolis didn't take. At least that's the
way San Diego's ebullient first-year coach, Mike Riley, chooses to
interpret it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know (Colts president) Bill Polian,'' said Riley, ``and I
believe him when he says it was a tossup who they'd take right to
the very end.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, the early returns would cause Leaf supportes to throw up.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf had an ignominious rookie season, as he lost his starting
job after nine games, having compiled a 3-6 record, while one head
coach, Kevin Gilbride, got fired and another, interim successor
June Jones, decided he'd prefer a more tranquil setting at the
University of Hawaii. Manning actually compiled a worse record _
3-13 _ and was outpassed in his lone encounter with Leaf, 160 yards
to 137, though the Colts won the battle of the prodigies, 17-12,
Oct. 4. But Manning took every snap in 1998 while establishing
rookie standards for touchdown passes and yardage. And this year he
has merely burnished his image as the All-American success story.
Leaf hasn't played since last Dec. 13, when he established rocky
standards for ineptitude by firing two interceptions in relief of
his illustrious successor, Craig Whelihan, putting the finishing
touches on a two-TD, 15-pickoff NFL introduction. This year he has
merely tarnished his image as a one-man police blotter.
</P>
<P>
   True, he shouldn't be condemned for having suffered an
unfortunate injury. And it's equally true, as Riley maintained last
week, that ``the comparison (to Manning) is unique, but it's out
there because it was such a focal point. Manning would have been
extraordinary any year. The other point is that guys develop in
different stages. Look how long it took Brett Favre.''
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps Leaf, who Wednesday bemoaned the fact that ``I'm so
used to being superhuman, it's tough not to have full arm
strength,'' will blossom into the caliber of rifleman that was
envisioned after he led Washington State from the depths of the
Pacific-10 to the Rose Bowl in his junior season. His college
coach, Mike Price, who previously tutored a quarterback named Drew
Bledsoe, certainly is a believer: ``I'm a big Ryan Leaf fan. I
think he's going to do just fine. I don't think it's all over yet.
He's going to get through the tough times.''
</P>
<P>
   Litany of controversy
</P>
<P>
   It's those tough times off the field that keep haunting Leaf,
that he keeps bringing on himself, that magnify his on-field
failures _ and that nobody in Chargers management is willing to
discuss. But maturity must be factored into the development to
which Riley refers, and in that regard, Leaf has been a poster boy
for arrested aolescence.
</P>
<P>
   So even as he and his ologists look to a fingers-crossed rather
than star-crossed future _ now that medical clearance has been
given, in fact, Riley hopes to use him before the year is out,
though probably only for a cameo _ let us count the errors of
Leaf's ways.
</P>
<P>
   With the draft looming last year and the 1-2 sweepstakes still
too close to call, Leaf followed up his Rose Bowl glory by putting
20 pounds on his 6-foot-5-inch frame, tilting the scales at 261.
</P>
<P>
   During the NFL scouting combine in February, he skipped a
meeting with the two men who would make the top pick, Polian and
Colts coach Jim Mora.
</P>
<P>
   After his first pro loss, a 23-7 decision at Kansas City, he
screamed at a cameraman he believed was infringing on his locker
space.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, when a San Diego reporter detailed the incident in
print, Leaf went profanely ballistic on him. This time the cameras
were whirring instead of merely blocking his way, and the tirade
was featured on television screens nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Benched in the fourth quarter the following week after throwing
four interceptions in a 34-16 loss to the Giants, he was booed by
the home fans at Qualcomm Stadium when a Make-A-Wish Foundation
public service announcement featuring him appeared on the
scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   During the Chargers' bye week at the end of October, he returned
to Washington State to make a $200,000 donation, half of it in the
name of former Cougars and NFL quarterback Mark Rypien's recently
deceased son. This good deed was overshadowed by reports of boorish
and belligerent behavior in watering spots on and around the
Pullman campus _ reports that both Leaf and Price, who says he
questioned several witnesses, roundlyeny, claiming the rowdies were
members of Leaf's entourage. Still, that served as the enduring
image of his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   That season ended for all intents and purposes when he was
benched a week later in the wake of a 27-10 thrashing at Denver.
</P>
<P>
   All of which was a mere warmup for this year's travails, which
began when Leaf took an unappreciated hiatus from a June minicamp
to play in a charity golf tournament, then jammed his shoulder the
day he returned when he fell on a fumble resulting from a botched
handoff.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a half-hour into his first offcial training camp
workout in July, he suffered the torn labrum while throwing a deep
pass. Pegged as the third-string QB behind retreads Jim Harbaugh
and Erik Kramer, Leaf hoped it was just a sprain. But surgery was
deemed necessary, reducing him almost to tears when he met the
media two hours after receiving the diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop him from having to be restrained when he
confronted a heckler later in camp.
</P>
<P>
   Before an exhibition game against Miami, he informed Riley that
he would request a trade if the Chargers tried to place him on the
injured reserve list, which would have rendered him ineligible for
the season. He wound up being fined $10,000 after that game for
refusing to wear the team-issued Adidas jersey _ heresy to Nike
client Leaf _ on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   There were as many alibis as there were transgressions, promises
from Leaf and his supporters that the sideshows, or perceived
sideshows, were isolated mistakes and wouldn't be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   But there could be no bailing out, no pointing fingers
elsewhere, when a disagreement over a rehabilitation leg exercise
turnedhdeously ugly Nov. 1. To that point, Leaf had been a model
citizen since training camp. But when he claimed a doctor had told
him doing the exercise might damage his shoulder and the doctor
denied it, strength coach John Hastings, who had been overseeing
his rehab, confronted Leaf. The patient responded with an
ear-splitting harangue, and when Beathard was called in to
intervene, Leaf began dropping expletives on him, too. The toxic
exchange spilled out into the hallway, where Riley and several
players witnessed the fallout before defensive backs Michael Dumas
and Scott Turner interceded, Turner going so far as to walk Leaf
away from the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, Leaf was suspended for four weeks and fined
an additional week's pay _ a total of $73,530 in lost salary. Leaf
spent one Saturday morning of his enforced hiatus playing flag
football in a local park _ technically a breach of contract because
such activity is prohibited without club permission. Later the San
Diego Union-Tribune reported that Leaf told two people in a Kansas
City bar he hated Beathard and would fire Leigh Steinberg (who did
not return calls from the Globe) unless the agent arranged a quick
trade.
</P>
<P>
   And in the most bizarre truce in the history of conflict, armed
or otherwise, Leaf celebrated his return to the team by filing a
grievance with the players' union, claiming the fine had been
excessive. The Chargers responded by filing a grievance with the
NFL Management Council seeking to withhold the final $2.95 million
installment, due next March, of the $11.25 million signing bonus
Leaf received when he agreed to a five-year, $31.25 million
contract. The antagonists finally reace an equally illogical
settlement: The grievances were withdrawn and a year was added to
Leaf's contract, which he now can't escape until after the 2001
season if he chooses to void the final two years.
</P>
<P>
   As we peer through the looking glass, it only makes sense that
Leaf would put this spin on the mishmash: ``The bottom line is it
puts me here two more years. That's what I'm ecstatic about.''
</P>
<P>
   Quest for respect
</P>
<P>
   He has been back in good graces _ as good as they can get,
anyway _ since the ban expired Nov. 29, when Leaf got up at a team
meeting and apologized, made amends privately with Beathard, and
told reporters his behavior toward the boss had been inexcusable.
</P>
<P>
   That's all Leaf and the other principals will say about the
past. Leaf will talk only about the future, as vague as that may
be; while Riley vows he'll see action, the quarterback isn't so
sure, though he maintained last week, ``Just being back is the
great part. Football is the big issue for me. It's been almost a
year away. This year's basically been a washout. I think that's why
they wanted the extra year.''
</P>
<P>
   The washout certainly hasn't lacked for notoriety, which Leaf
believes is harder on his family than on him: ``They don't have the
shell I do.''
</P>
<P>
   He may need it to regain _ or in some cases gain _ the respect
of his teammates, who, after all, have heard this tune before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's trying really hard, working hard, to make sure he
does the right thing,'' said offensive tackle John Jackson. ``But
he still has a long way to go. He has to prove it's not just one
day but every day. He still has to prove himself. It's easy to tell
people what they want to herYou have to let them see it.''
</P>
<P>
   And linebacker Junior Seau, the heart and soul of the Chargers,
hardly offers an endorsement while trying to stay noncommittal: ``I
really haven't paid attention to the guy. We have two quarterbacks,
quarterbacks who are going to participate in games. The fact is, he
hasn't been part of the package the whole year.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, others openly root for Leaf, even while expressing
caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody welcomed the man back,'' said wide receiver Mikhael
Ricks, one of Leaf's friends and confidants on the team. ``I think
he realized the role he has to play on this team.Hopefully, he can
turn it around. He's been through tough times that led to some
teammates being against him. Now everybody is supporting him,
helping him be a better team player.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, the peacemaker Nov. 1, made an extraordinary goodwill
gesture in that regard. A devout Christian, he hosted a Bible study
group three weeks ago at his apartment complex. It included the
ministers of his parish, Shoreline Christian Church; 10-12
teammates who are group regulars; their wives _ and Leaf, who had
accepted Turner's invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a chance to minister to Ryan,'' said Turner. ``It was
good not only for us to see Ryan but for him to see that God has a
real direction for him. It was a time for him to come and be
nurtured in faith. I don't think anything radical has happened so
far. I think there will be a transformation, and like any
transformation, it takes time. He knows it's time for him to move
forward, not only to forget what happened but to make sure it
doesn't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who began last season as Leaf's quarterback coach, has't
altered his initial opinion that his former pupil can be ``a
big-time player.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he showed in the first part of his rookie year that he
can play in the NFL,'' said the Hawaii coach. ``He's just got to
get in the right surroundings, do some soul-searching, put his
problems behind him. Ultimately, the only thing that matters is
on-field performance. If a player performs on the field, he's going
to rally his teammates. If he doesn't, he's just not going to get
it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Placekicker John Carney has noticed positive signs since Leaf's
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a guy eager to work, get back in the mix,'' said Carney.
``He seems hungry for competition. Certainly, all are positive
aspects of his comeback.''
</P>
<P>
   Carney also believes that deep down, Leaf doesn't _ and
shouldn't _ shy away from the implicit competition with Manning:
``It's natural for an athlete to rate himself or judge himself
according to his peers' performance. I know I do. I think it's
natural for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Price, who minimizes Leaf's behavior with the exception of the
Beathard incident, draws a different frame of reference _ with
Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bledsoe was always steady _ mmmmmm,'' said the Washington
State coach. ``He was like, `If we win, we win; if we don't, we
don't. If I get sacked, I'm going to keep going.' It wasn't that he
didn't want to win or wasn't fiery. He just kept it to himself
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan is different. He has a burning desire to be the best.
It's like that plant in `Little Shop of Horrors': `Feed me,
Seymour, feed me.' I'd be like, `Goddamn it, can't we go home?'
`No, I want to watch another (game) film.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan's much more volatile than Drew. He wears hiheart on his
sleeve. He'll tell you what's on his mind, and it's ot always what
you want to hear. By the same token, you can do the same with him.
I always thought that was a good thing. The people close to him
really like Ryan. He's more like a roller coaster _ he's up, he's
down; he's up, he's down. I'd try to smooth out the valleys.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have worked in college, but so far in the NFL, the Ryan
Leaf roller coaster is stuck in an abyss.
</P>

TIME FOR YEAR-END ACCOUNTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You are at home one spring and your phone rings. You answer and
an executive from a professional sports team is on the line. He
offers you a five-year, $30 million deal to be the coach and/or
general manager of his team. You can be the next Pitino or Wallace,
Duquette or Williams, Carroll or Grier, Sinden or Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Question: Can you handle the job?
</P>
<P>
   Predictable answer: Of course. Realistic answer: No chance. And
even if you did accept, I say you'd be submitting your resignation
soon.
</P>
<P>
   December is the year-in-review month in pro spt That means you
can be a terrific football coach who relaxes by sewing intricate
defensive formations into your socks, but in December a reporter
who thinks a two-deep zone is a personal pan pizza can say you had
a terrible year and call for your job. Next thing you know, the
guys at the cleaners are doing the same thing and your favorite
doctor now thinks you're an idiot for calling that sweep on fourth
and goal from the 2.
</P>
<P>
   There is criticism of your dumb draft choices, inane statements,
and sorry game plans. One newspaper editorializes that you should
be given an immediate police escort to the airport. Another says
your assistants should be fired. A national television commentator
says you've got a swagger _ a Fred Rogers/Al Gore swagger.
Basically, according to the December evaluators, you're a joke.
</P>
<P>
   The Year in Review has become a standard in pro sports. Imagine
if we were all given similar reviews based on our work the previous
12 months. Artists, truck drivers, financial analysts, and cooks
throughout New England would be able to offer their opinions on
whether you should be dismissed or not.
</P>
<P>
   Let me tell you, that idea makes the Holley Lama very nervous. I
might be unemployed if Pete Carroll, Rick Pitino, Dan Duquette, and
Harry Sinden criticized me with the same vigor that I have
criticized them. If Carroll thinks he has it bad now, I'd be
routing him in the criticism-absorbed department if my 1999 report
card were ever released. Well, now that I think of it, here are
some excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   --January (writing about Michael Jordan reviving the NBA):
``Jordan's nature is to revive all things askew. But the task is
too big for even he.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch. The are some brave people who edit my stories, but I was
clever enough to slip that grammatical error by them. Him. It was
my mistake. Why did I write it? That would be like the Patriots
having a choice etween Chris Canty and Sam Madison and happily
choosing Canty.
</P>
<P>
   --February/March: Some individual tutoring might be in order.
What a brutal stretch. I say the Houston Rockets will win the NBA
title. Right state, wrong city (San Antonio won it). Still feeling
good about myself, I remind Duquette that his team will be
fortunate to win 80 games (the Red Sox won 94). Obviously
encouraged by my success, I write that George Steinbrenner is crazy
for destroying the chemistry of the Yankees with his trade for
Roger Clemens (the Yankees win the World Series).
</P>
<P>
   My predictions were wildly off, but Pitino seemed to have a
clue: ``We will make the playoffs next season. Come July 1, I'm
going to make the changes _ the right changes _ it takes for us to
be a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   --April/May: This may register as the remark that triggers my
demotion to special teams coach. Before he NFL draft, I criticized
the silly Indianapolis Colts for trading their Pro Bowl running
back, Marshall Faulk. In fact, I think I said the trade to the Rams
was ``stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colts traded Faulk to make room for a running back named
Edgerrin James. You may have heard of him. He is the leading
candidate for AFC Offensive Rookie of the Year. He is a member of
the AFC East-leading, 10-2 Colts. Now, I'm not saying I predicted
James would be a bust. In fact, I raved about him and said I could
envision him in the Patriots backfield (e team drafted center
Damien Woody).
</P>
<P>
   --June/July: At least I passed my take-home, open-book test. ``I
think all the (trade discussions) of Ron Mercer will eventually
result in Mercer playing somewhere else next season.'' Not being
able to contain myself, I wrote that Sinden should throw in an
extra million to end the Byron Dafoe holdout. I told him he would
have to do that if he wanted to have a good team. A few months
later, Dafoe and his agent parted ways and Sinden got the deal he
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   --August: Given Major League Baseball's awful pitching and
inconsistent strike zone, I wrote that we should not hold the
single-season home run record as something sacred. I stand by that
comment, but the problem is I was convinced Sammy Sosa would break
Mark McGwire's record of 70 in 1998. He didn't. (I also said that
``Blonde on Blonde'' is Bob Dylan's best CD;I stand by that, too.)
</P>
<P>
   --September: A month in need of a split screen. On one side of
it, I am endorsing the Michael Bishop campaign. I suggest using him
as some newfangled, lightweight H-back. I do not endorse taking
Drew Bledsoe out of the game. Ever. I say Bishop should be used for
8-10 plays per game. The Patriots are not going to use Bishop (am I
allowed to say that's a mistake?).
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the split screen, I am doing the Bruiser
Flint thing. I am taking myself out of the game. I am suspending
myself from making predictions.
</P>
<P>
   --October/November: You have to give me my props: No one is
better at riding shotgun on the bandwagon. In fact, I equipped the
wagon with some woofers and Bose speakers for my listening
enjoyment. I predicted the Red Sox would go seven games wih the
Yankees and head to the World Series. The Red Sox did not win the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   --December: Doing all right so far. But there are still 19 days
left in the month. Who said Carroll should be fired? Not me.

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ News item: Cincinnati Reds general manager Jim
Bowden, after a meeting Saturday with Seattle Mariners GM Pat
Gillick, calls a press conference to announce that the Reds are
abandoning their attempts to trade for Ken Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no chance at all. Zero,'' Bowden said. ``We have a
better chnc of bringing Goofy back than Griffey.''
</P>
<P>
   What it all means: Maybe less than it seems. Yes, the Griffey
deal is dead this weekend, with the Mariners' insistence that the
Reds include Pokey Reese as part of any package the deal-breaker.
Reds shortstop Barry Larkin will be 36 next spring, and the
nine-time All-Star is nearing the end of his marvelous career. The
Reds are adamant about keeping the 26-year-old Reese, who came up
as a shortstop and may return there when Larkin goes.
</P>
<P>
   But as one major league executive said minutes after Bowden
called the Griffey talks DOA: ``I'm betting that Griffey winds up
in Cincinnati, if not now, then in a spring training deal. If not
then, then in July before the trading deadline. And if not then, as
a free agent. We're not in it because we believe Cincinnati is
where Griffey wants to go.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bowden has made no secret of his passion for landing
Griffey. He said that, in the last three months, he offered Gillick
numerous packages: five-player deals, four-player deals, and
Saturday a three-player deal, with impact players on both the major
and minor league level. All-Star reliever Scott Williamson has been
discussed, as well as outfielders Mike Cameron and Dmitri Young,
shortstop prospect Travis Dawkins, and pitcher Brett Tomko.
</P>
<P>
   But Bowden, who already has picked up outfielder Dante Bichette
as a hedge against losing free agent slugger Greg Vaughn, made it
clear that he didn't want to break up the nucleus of a team that
won 96 games last season. That makes Williamson, first baseman Sean
Casey, and Reese off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   The other teams expected to be in the Griffey hunt have not
materialized. The Yankees can never be entirely ruled out, but
Griffey has made it known he doesn't want to play for them. The
Indians were said to have some interest, especially with Kenny
Lofton out until at least midseason because of shoulder surgery,
but they haven't leaped in. Neither have the Braves, who seemed to
be a natural fit because of Griffey's desire to play for a team
near his Orlando home. But the Braves will be looking to lock up
Chipper Jones, who will be a free agent next year. The Astros have
been reported in the mix, but that isn't the case.
</P>
<P>
   Could Griffey remain inSeattle for another year? Sure,
especially if he believes the Mariners can win next season, a
scenario that looks a lot more feasible with their signing of free
agent first baseman John Olerud and their pursuit of lefthander
Chuck Finley. But Gillick still can't afford the chance that
Griffey will walk after the season without getting something in
return.
</P>
<P>
   So the Reds, Griffey's hometown team, have been the one serious
candidate, and Bowden's pronouncements notwithstanding, they remain
so. It may all just be a matter of timing.
</P>
<P>
   A step back for Phillies
</P>
<P>
   The announcement that Phillies ace Curt Schilling will require
shoulder surgery is a major blow to GM Ed Wade's attempts to put
together a contender next season. The Phillies had taken
significant steps by acquiring righthanded starter Andy Ashby from
the Padres and signing free agent closer Mike Jackson, but
Schilling will be out until at least May and maybe longer after he
undergoes surgery Monday to tighten the front of his shoulder.
Schilling's shoulder woes flared after the All-Star Game in July.
He went on the disabled listfom Aug. 8 to Sept. 3, made one start,
then shut it down. He discovered the shoulder was still hurting
when he resumed throwing last week. Schilling underwent surgery to
repair a torn labrum four years ago and recovered to become one of
the National League's premier righthanded strikeout pitchers. But
he turned 33 last month, and his shoulder is showing the wear from
leading the majors in pitches in both the 1997 and '98 seasons . .
. The signing of slugger Carlos Delgado to a three-year contract
Friday stopped the bleeding in Toronto, where the Blue Jays have
been under siege after trading former Cy Young award winner Pat
Hentgen and star outfielder Shawn Green. But Delgado still could be
a short-timer, despite agreeing to a deal that will pay him $36
million in the next three years. There's a clause in his contract
that will allow him to demand a trade after next season. If the
Jays fail to trade him by a Feb. 15 deadline _ insisted upon by
Delagdo's agent, David Sloane _ Delgado can become a free agent.
Delgado had been asking for as much as $38.25 million, but
acknowledged that the three-year, $20 million deal accepted by
fellow first baseman Olerud from Seattle affected his negotiations.
Delgado insists he'd like to stay put in Toronto, for whom he has
hit 137 home runs the last four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He shall return
</P>
<P>
   He openly fought with George Steinbrenner while filling in as
Yankees manager during Joe Torre's absence, and he defended Jimy
Williams when the Boss accused the Sox manager of inciting a Fenway
Park crowd during the playoffs. He hobbled around on knees so
painful it wasn't a question of whether he could continue
year-to-year, but day-to-day. But Don Zimr will be back for his 52d
season, Torre told reporters last week, remaining with the Yankees
for another go-round as bench coach. That should be good news for
anyone who recognizes Zim for what he is, one of the game's grand
treasures. Torre, meanwhile, just finished another round of
radiation therapy, a follow-up to his prostate cancer surgery last
spring. Torre reported no untoward side effects, other than some
fatigue, and said he's working out four or five times a week . . .
The Reds may not land Griffey, but they made a significant addition
to their staff when they hired Gary Hughes as director of
professional scouting. Hughes, 58, is the man who nearly made a big
league ballplayer out of John Elway, signing him for the Yankees.
But that was merely a novelty act in a distinguished career in
which Hughes helped cultivate top young talent first in Montreal,
then with the Florida Marlins, signing such players as outfielder
Marquis Grissom and catcher Charles Johnson. Hughes went on to
Colorado, but after being passed over for the GM job that went to
Dan O'Dowd, he landed with the Reds. Recently, Hughes was named one
of the top 10 scouts of the century by Baseball America. Hughes's
responsibilities with the Reds will include evaluating free agents,
scouting talent for trades, and evaluating minor leaguers. He also
will oversee all professional scouting coverage . . . Police
blotter: A former minor league player from the Chicago Cubs system
was charged with first-degree murder last Wednesday after the
bludgeoning death of his next-door neighbor in Chandler, Ariz.
Fabio Evelio Gomez, 31, was charged by Maricopa County prosecutors
after poce discovered the body of Joan Rachelle Morane in a
dumpster at he apartments where both lived. Gomez also was charged
with kidnapping and burglary. Meanwhile, Roger Blanco, a minor
league pitcher in Atlanta's system since 1996, was shot and killed
last week in his hometown of Caracas, Venezuela. Blanco, 23, was
murdered by robbers who broke into his sister's home. He was 1-3
with a 9.71 ERA in Single A Macon last summer.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman fields offers
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins made an offer last week to first baseman/outfielder
Jeff Conine, a Marlins original who ranks as the most popular
player in team history, though his days in Florida became numbered
when then-manager Jim Leyland oddly became disenchanted with him.
But Conine, who finished last season with the Orioles, received a
better offer to stay put in Baltimore, where he would share first
base with the oft-injured Will Clark, DH, and play some outfield .
. . Terry Francona, the Phillies' 40-year-old manager, is just five
years older than his new closer, Mike Jackson, the free agent
signed away from Cleveland. The two played together for Maracaibo
(Venezuela) in 1986. ``Someone on the (Caracas) team said something
to me one day and Mike wasn't very happy about it,'' Francona
recalled. ``The next inning, he hit the guy right in the ribs with
a pitch. That kind of loyalty goes a long way when you're away from
home in a foreign country.'' . . . Mariners manager Lou Piniella
was otherwise occupied when the team signed Olerud. Piniella was at
a hospital, where his daughter-in-law was giving birth to
Piniella's granddaughter, Sophie. ``We've had a delivery here,
too,'' Gillick told Piniella whnhe finally reached him. ``Who?''
Piniella asked. ``We just signed John Olerud,'' Gillick said.
Piniella, needless to say, felt doubly blessed . . . The Mariners
are hardly done with the signing of Olerud, who elected to return
home rather than re-up with the Mets. They're pursuing Finley for
their starting rotation and Arthur Rhodes for their bullpen, and
also have offers out to free agents Graeme Lloyd, Aaron Sele, Stan
Javier, and Mark McLemore . . . As if the Yankees haven't bedeviled
Texas enough, the Rangers must go to New York for the world
champions' home opener April 11. They'll have the privilege of
watching the Yankees, who have swept them in each of the last two
playoffs, hoist another World Series flag. Including postseason
play, the Rangers have lost 28 of their last 36 games at Yankee
Stadium . . . Williams and his Jimywocky may have some competition
from new Cleveland manager Charlie Manuel, who tends to play up his
country roots. A recent sample from Manuel: ``The hardest thing for
me about this job will be when I have to talk to players who are
smart and educated _ and I've got to get on their level.''

NORTON COURSE A TOUR ATTRACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though it's no more than a sand wedge away, you can't
distinguish the green. Unless, that is, you are one of the
surveyors armed with maps and an uncanny sense of direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The red-and-white striped flg,'' says the man, pointing you
through a group of leafless trees. ``That's where the green will
be. The white poles are center lines (for fairways).''
</P>
<P>
   Even the architect from the Arnold Palmer Course Design Co.,
Greg Stang, laughs and shakes his head. Standing amid trees, thick
brush, and wetlands, he is very much at home, for his business is
turning unusable land like this into lavish, green playgrounds for
golfers. But it takes a lot of experience, said Stang, to get your
bearings straight and figure out just what you are looking at.
</P>
<P>
   Stang, designer of more than 20 courses worldwide, was part of a
team that recently conducted a walk-through at the site in Norton
that will become the newest addition to the Tournament Playes Club
network. TPC of Boston at Great Woods _ an $18 million partnership
between FleetBoston, PGA Tour Golf Properties, and Boston
businessman William F. Connell _ will begin to take shape in a
femths when they begin to clear the land and shape fairways. If all
goes well, it will open in spring 2001.
</P>
<P>
   That's a trip to Mars for some, particularly since it will be a
private club geared toward a corporate clientele, but the project
is noteworthy for local golf fans given this reality: Where there
is a TPC course, there usually is a pro tour stop. Since the
golf-crazed Boston area has lost PGA Tour and LPGA Tour stops in
recent years, that's good news.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the PGA Tour and its TPC Network have not
guaranteed anything for the Norton site. There is a membership
drive ongoing (if you join TPC at Boston, you join the TPC
network), likely capping off at 350.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first 100 would be identified as founding members,'' said
Scott Ferrell, regional director of marketing for the TPC, ``and we
are quickly approaching that number.''
</P>
<P>
   No surprise, because Tour officials have said that in all their
marketing endeavors, they have rarely seen an area so thirsty for
golf as Greater Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The TPC of Boston figures to draw many membership inquiries
(Woolf Associates in Boston is involved in the marketing), but it
is also an intriguing project for those starving to be part of a
gallery at a PGA Tour event. Especially when Christopher Gray, a
vice president with PGA Tour Design Services Inc., concedes that
these TPC venues are built with tournaments in mind. The numbers
prove this point: Of the 17 TPC Clubs already built, eight host PGA
Tour stops, seven host Senior PGA Tour events.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching TPC of Boston at Great Woods with this same
philosophy, both Stang and Gray talked about all the routing plans
they worked on befo settling on the Norton site. It will feature a
starting hole that is well away from the clubhouse and a front side
that takes you to the most remote points of the course. Somewhat
odd, until you look at holes 12 through 18, which will run
virtually parallel, a short walk from the clubhouse, and offer
splendid spectator viewing.
</P>
<P>
   Having holes 12-18 routed tis way is a concession to the needs
of a tournament. So are the areas that will be devoted to corporate
tents, and a practice range that will measure 75,000 to 80,000
square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Located close to Route 495, the land involves some 400 acres,
said Stang, though more than 100 will remain open space. Plans have
been roughed out (it will play 7,115 yards from the tips, but there
will be five sets of tees on most holes) and some intriguing
features include a par-5 18th with a split fairway; a drivable
par-4 17th; and a 12th green situated so that a cropping rock comes
into play.
</P>
<P>
   The latter figured into the plans once Stang and his crew really
got onto the land and stumbled upon the rock. Too costly and too
big to move, said Stang, they decided to work it into the
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   The land has been surveyed, and colored flags are everywhere;
though they indicate greens and fairways, they meant little to the
hunters who were on the prowl during the FleetBoston walk-through.
It was the opening day of deer season and Stang, Gray, and others
in the party laughed (nervously, perhaps, as gunshots rang out) as
they put on their bright orange vests.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, deer hunters and golf course designers shr the same
property. In less than two years, however, golfers chasing after
birdies hopefully will have the place to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The mighty Quinn
</P>
<P>
   It didn't come with a green jacket or million-dollar check, but
Fran Quinn's victory at the Thailand Open last week provided an
awful lot of gratification. ``It was a lot of fun out there,'' said
the two-time Massachusetts Open champion after closing with a
1-under 71 to claim the top spot in Bangkok. ``This is some
consolation for missing out on my US Tour card.'' Quinn, who had
come up two shots shy at the final stage of the PGA Tour Qualifying
Tournament two weeks earlier in Miami, was tied for the lead as he
made the turn, but vaulted in front with birdies at the 13th and
14th, and preserved his first win on the Asian PGA Tour with a
par-par finish. Quinn is in China this weekend, playing in the
Omega PGA Championship. Peter Teravainen of Duxbury is also in the
field . . . What are they feeding these amateurs Down Under? First,
18-year-old Aaron Baddeley wins the Australian Open, then Brett
Rumord, 22, takes the ANZ Players Championship. Indeed, Rumford
drew inspiration from his fellow amateur in the days between
events. ``We went out to dinner,'' said Rumford, ``and Aaron was
waiting for me in the bar, surrounded by five women. I thought that
was really good.'' Baddeley finished 17th in the ANZ Players
Championship, but declined an invitation to this week's Australian
PGA Championship. There is an event, however, that he certainly
would not pass up _ the Masters. Bruce Devlin reportedly talked to
Baddeley's father and said he would lobby on behalf of the
youngster for an invite to Augusta . . . eaking of the Masters,
W.W. ``Hootie'' Johnson, chairman of Augusta National, recently
told a reporter that the club batted .500 with its two most
significant changes to the famed layout. The 1-inch cut of
``rough'' was a good decision, he said, but lengthening the par-4
17th wasn't. ``We really missed it on 17,'' Johnson is quoted as
saying, ``but we've made adjustments.'' . . . Nancy Scranton, a
16-year member of the LPGA Tour, was named by her colleagues to
receive the 1999 Heather Farr Player Award for exemplary attitude
on and off the course . . . The PGA of America will move its PGA
Seniors Championship _ the over-50 crowd's oldest major _ to
Ridgewood CC in Paramus, N.J., in 2001. This year's event again
will be staged at PGA National at Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., with
Norwood's Allen Doyle the defending champion . . . So how do you
put an exclamation point on a season that included seven wins and
more than $2 million in prize money? By going back to work in the
pro shop, of course. At least if you are longtime club pro Bruce
Fleisher, it seems. The Senior PGA Tour Player of the Year was
tracked down by Golfweek's Richard Mudry working at Donald Trump's
new course next to Palm Beach International Airport. Fleisher told
Mudry he was doing it as a favor to a friend but doesn't mind the
work because he still enjoys meeting people . . . Cheers to
longtime New England pro Bob Lendzion, who was one of the eight
players to earn his 2000 Senior PGA Tour card at qualifying school
last week . . . The eighth annual EMC Skills Challenge (taped Nov.
15, but televised this weekend) turned into a battle between those
Rhode Island buddies, Brad Faxon and Billy Anade. No surprise that
Faxon drained a 25-footer to win the putting portion, but Andrade
refused to be outdone. After winning the bunker competition by
holing out, Andrade flexed his muscles and drove it 344 yards to
take that event, too . . . Strange end Wednesday to the 49th season
of the Cape Cod Pro-Am League. Because an amateur entrant played
the wrong set of tees, his 3-under 51 at par 3 Blue Rock in South
Yarmouth was disallowed, giving the low round (a 54) to another
amateur, the always-present Joe Keller of Oyster Harbors. Needing a
win to overtake Jeff Bailey for the Sullivan Award, Bob Miller
stumbled with bogeys on two of the final four holes at his home
course and finished at 56, in a tie for second for low pro honors.
Bailey, head pro at the Country Club of Norwood, tied for 12th with
a 58, good enough to secure the award for overall performance . . .
Barbara McIntire, 64, a lifelong amateur who lost in a playoff for
the US Women's Open in 1956, was named recipient of the USGA's Bob
Jones Award. The honor pays tribute to someone who emulates Jones's
spirit toward the game.

RED SOX HAVE STAKE IN FINLEY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ After confirming that the Red Sox had acquired
backup infielder Manny Alexander from the Chicago Cubs for
outfielder Damon Buford, general manager Dan Duquette Saturday
acknowledged his interest in free agent Chuck Finley, saying that
acquiring a lefthanded starter would be the best move the Sox could
make at Major League Baseball's annual meetings.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few lefthanders on the market,'' Duquette said.
``Ideally, we'd like to have a lefthander.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette claimed he had no meeting scheduled with Finley's
agent, Tim Shannon, but added that he expected it would take a
three-year deal to sign the 37-year-old pitcher. The Sox are
competing against Seattle and Cleveland, among others, for Finley's
services. Both the Mariners and Indians already have three-year
offers on the table, reportedly for less than $25 million; Duquette
said he has yet to make an offer.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said the Sox are also looking into trading for a
pitcher. He said he had meetings set up Saturday with five or six
clubs, including the San Diego Padres, who might be willing to part
with lefthander Sterling Hitchcock, who turns 29 next spring and
was 12-14 with a 4.11 earned-run average for a lousy team last
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had looked into dealing for Finley before last July's
trading deadline, but, according to Duquette, Finley told the
Angels he was willing to be dealt to only the Indians or Yankees,
both of whom appeared at the time to be certain of going to the
playoffs. But Duquette said he has been assured that Finley, who
has 165 career wins, all with the Angels, now has no qualms about
pitching for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette acknowledged that Finley's success against the Yankees
over the years makes him especially attractive. ``Absolutely,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1987, Finley is 15-9 with a 3.3 ERA against the Yankees.
He has beaten only the Mariners and Twins more often in his career.
He is 6-6 with a 3.74 ERA in Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Duquettelso acknowledged mild interest in free agent lefty Kenny
Rogers, who was 10-4 with a 4.19 ERA in a 1999 season split between
the A's and Mets, though he added wryly: ``Does anybody have
interest in Kenny Rogers?''
</P>
<P>
   If the Sox are unable to acquire the starter they'd like,
Duquette envisions another scenario in which they would try to
obtain a closer and convert Derek Lowe into a starter. If the
season started today, Duquette said, Lowe would be the closer, with
Rod Beck his setup man.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's acquisition, Alexander, comes with a modest price
tag. He signed a one-year deal with the Cubs last week for
$612,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our reports on him are good,'' said manager Jimy Williams. ``I
think he'll be able to help us on both sides of the line. I pretty
much remember him as a shortstop, but will we expose him to the
other side of the diamond? We're not afraid to move people
around.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Duquette confirmed that reliever Tom Gordon will have surgery on
his right elbow Monday at Centinela Hospital in Inglewood, Calif.
Lewis Yocum, the Angels' team orthopedist, will perform the
procedure, which will be attended by Sox doctor Bill Morgan.
Duquette said he still hopes Gordon will not require Tommy John
tendon-transplant surgery.

OBSCURE FIGHETER DIED PURSUING DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like most boxers, Stephan Johnson lost his final fight. The
tragedy is that he lost his life along with it.
</P>
<P>
   Until that moment three weeks ago, when he was carried from an
Atlantic City ring on a stretcher with an oxygen mask over his face
and no future in his blank eyes, few people had ever heard of
Stephan Johnson and even fewer cared about him.
</P>
<P>
   He was just a fighter to most people, a faceless man in a savage
sport. That's the fate of most of those who sacrifice their bodies
and youth without notice, gambling their lives in the most savage
arena in sports with slim hope anyone will ever remember they were
there.
</P>
<P>
   If they are lucky, you might remember them for a night, when the
savagery and the bravery are so compelling that you cannot ignore
them. If they are very lucky, you might notice them for a year or
two for the same reasons. If they are lucky beyond good fortune,
they g even make a few dollars selling out their bodies for your
viewing pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Few fighters ever really make it in the sport, but from where
they come, few make it in life, either, and the odds are better in
the ring than on the streets. It is almost a requirement that
fighters come from the most desperate circumstances, otherwise why
would they choose to do what they do? There is the occasional rare
exception, like Gene Tunney, but the address of most fighters is
Hell's Kitchen, either the real one in New York or the one society
has made for them elsewhere, in whatever corner of poverty they
spring from.
</P>
<P>
   Fighters are far too undervalued in today's sporting society,
far too often mocked by peoplewho don't know any better. They are
seldom the ones behind the machinations that lead to federal
indictments or shoddy decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Fighters come to fight every night, most often for chump change.
There is no harder way to try to feed yourself in sports than to be
punched in the mouth for your pay.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, they come as Stephan Johnson did, with hope, making a
fool's bet on a sport that is cruel far more often than it is kind.
There is an endless supply of fighters like Stephan Johnson, who
died at 31 last Sunday, hoping to get a title shot or write a
novel. He was working on both Nov. 20, the night he stepped into
the ring for the last time, believing if he could just upset former
world champion Paul Vaden he would get his chance, and if he
didn't, he'd have more material for that book.
</P>
<P>
   Forget that he had collapsed in the ring last April in Canada
and was on a medical suspension across the boder. Forget that he
had fought twice after that in US towns willing to ignore that
suspension if they could find a doctor who would judge Johnson fit
to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody protects the boxer who doesn't protect himself, and few
are capable of that. After all, what they do is fight, the most
unreasonable decision in sports, so why would they stop unless
someone makes them?
</P>
<P>
   In Stephan Johnson's case, he stopped for the worst reason. He
stopped fighting because he stopped breathing.
</P>
<P>
   So now the hue and cry probably will begin again. The
abolitionists will call for the end of the sport. They will say
boxing is barbaric, a form of sporting slavery.
</P>
<P>
   But fighters like Johnson understand the bet they are making
when they become prizefighters. They know the odds are long that
they will become a champion and even longer that they will make any
real money even if they do win a champion's belt.
</P>
<P>
   For many fighters, that gamble is worth taking because
everything in their life is a gamble. If there were more Beverly
Hillses and fewer Hell's Kitchens, boxing would die on its own from
a lack of practitioners. But as long as there is poverty, there
will be struggle, and as long as there is struggle, there will be
someone willing to fight to overcome it, and as long as there is
someone willing to fight, there will be someone else willing to
fight back and someone with a cigar in his mouth willing to promote
them for a piece of the action.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, as long as we are fascinated by this brutal art and pay
to watch it, there will be men like Stephan Johnson, who fight in
obscurity until they die under the bright lights.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was, from all reports, a wonderful young m who taught
boxing fitness to rich guys on Wall Street, went to school, hoped
to write a book, and could fight like hell. But too many guys could
fight better than Johnson, so he fought in obscurity until he
ignored the warning in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In a few weeks or a few months, Stephan Johnson will be
forgotten. But people will still fight because they have no other
choice and young boys will watch them and dream of a better day.
They will dream not of Stephan Johnson, who died fighting for his
dream.
</P>
<P>
   They will dream instead of Oscar De La Hoya with his millions of
dollars and the starlets on his arm. They will dream of Roy Jones
Jr., the best in the world at the moment. They will dream of
Evander Holyfield or Mike Tyson because his life looks good if you
haven't had to live it.
</P>
<P>
   They will dream the boxer's dream and fight the good fight. If
they are lucky, you will notice them one night and marvel at their
courage or their skill.
</P>
<P>
   If they are very lucky, you won't notice them the way you
noticed Stephan Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Around and around
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, De La Hoya will announce from New York that he will
fight Derrel Coley Feb. 26, but it is unclear why De La Hoya wants
this fight. Coley was the World Boxing Council's No. 1-rated
welterweight for nearly two years and De La Hoya had no interest in
fighting him. Once De La Hoya lost his WBC welterweight title to
Felix Trinidad, his promoter, Bob Arum, convinced Coley's people to
accept $1 million to fight De La Hoya for the IBA welterweight
title. Coley had been offered $375,000 to fight Trinidad for the
more widely recognized WBC portion of the belt but went for the
larger purse withoutonsulting his promoters, America Presents.
However, Coley was in a pickle with Trinidad because of a rule Arum
rammed through at the WBC convention in South Africa two years ago.
Under that rule, any fighter weighing above 135 pounds who had not
made a major purse but became a No. 1 contender did not get to go
to a purse bid and receive 25 percent of the take. Instead, he
could not receive more than 15 times his highest previous purse,
which in Coley's case was $35,000. Coley's promoters fought that
rule but lost. Arum pushed it, not coincidentally, because he knew
De La Hoya was facing a Coley mandatory defense and he didn't want
to pay him in excess of his value. Until De La Hoya was without a
title. But Coley's promoters, insiders say, had already arranged
for him to receive mony to step aside and allow Trinidad to fight
World Boxing Association 154-pound champion David Reid while
keeping his rights intact with the WBC as the next challenger for
the 147-pound title. He would have received a tuneup fight as well.
In addition, he would have gotten more money if Trinidad or his
replacement didn't honor the commitment with Coley. But Arum
convinced Coley's manager that he would pay more and get Coley a
shot at the WBC title because if Reid and Trinidad fought, he would
demand that Trinidad be stripped by the WBC and that De La
Hoya-Coley serve as a fight for the vacant title. Well, guess what?
Arum got what he wanted _ which is an opponent for De La Hoya _ and
Coley did get $1 million. But he would have gotten as much or more
if he had let the Trinidad-Reid fight go forward and still would
have had his No. 1 WBC ranking, which he will now lose in a fight
for nothing b cash on Feb. 26. ``We don't know what the fight
isfor,'' said HBO executive Lou DiBella Friday. ``It could be an
eliminator, with the winner to get a title shot. It could be for a
vacant title. It could be for an interim title. Or it could be just
a good 12-round fight.'' Whatever it is, it may be the first time
in boxing history that a $1 million deal wasn't a good one for the
kid getting the money . . . America Presents has signed
International Boxing Federation top-rated heavyweight David Tua
away from Main Events, marking another defection from the newly
revamped company started by Dan Duva. Word is Tua received a $1
million signing bonus, although Dan Goossen of America Presents
denied it . . . Former cruiserweight champion Marcelo Dominguez has
been added to the list of fighters promoted by Germany's Universum
Box-Promotion, which also handles world champion Juan Carlos Gomez,
who twice beat Dominguez. The Argentine is 3-0 with three knockouts
since he lost the rematch to Gomez in March to push his record to
29-3-1. His management team said it is looking for a shot at
Vassily Jirov but has no interest in a third fight with Gomez . . .
Peter Hanraths, manager of European champion Wladimir Klitschko,
says he would like to match him early next year with either Andrew
Golota or Zeljko Mavrovic . . . Tyson has officially set the date
for his next fight, Jan. 29 in Manchester, England, vs. Julius
Francis. He might as well be fighting Julius Caesar for all the
fight Francis will put up . . . Tyson's decision leaves Jones with
a wide-open TV date for Jan. 15 on HBO when he fights hard-hitting
David Telasco in the first fight ever at Rado City Music Hall in
New York . . . As promised here before, undefeated WC super
bantamweight champion Erik Morales will defend his title against
World Boxing Organization champion Marco Antonio Barrera Feb. 19 at
Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. Morales is 35-0 with 28 KOs. Barrera is
49-2 with 36 knockouts . . . Word is Arturo Gatti will appear on
the undercard of the De La Hoya fight against either Joey Gamache,
Shea Neary of Ireland, or Billy Irwin . . . In a bit of a surprise,
Ring magazine named Paulie Ayala its fighter of the year.

MILLER PAID PRICE; LOYALTY IS REWARDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LrMiller had some tough decisions this summer. The owner of the
Utah Jazz for the last 15 years had some key free agents to sign
and it speaks volumes about the man's love of his team, and the
players who made it one of the very best, that he did what he did.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, Miller put his bottom line on the line. He signed
36-year-old Karl Malone to a four-year deal for $66.5 million. He
signed 37-year-old John Stockton to a two-year deal for $22
million.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a successful businessman who bought the Jazz for $22
million, did what successful businessmen rarely do: He basically
guaranteed that he will lose money in the next couple years.
</P>
<P>
   Because Malone's big hit ($14 million) and Stockton's ($11
million) will have been on the books for only two months in 1999,
``I think this year, we'll be all right,'' said Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year, it's a big concern. I'm not sure if we can make
money even if we win the championship. I know it doesn't make
sense, but to do it any other way would not be fair to those two
guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that was going to be the case when I did it. We've had
a lot of years of prosperity and those two guys are responsible for
a lot of it. If I have to take a hit, so be it. I feel I have to
hold up my end.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller is going through what the Celtics' owners went through in
the early 1990s with Larry Bird and Kevin McHale. Namely, how do
you reward the players who made you all that money even though
their best days are behind them? Money, of course, is one
expression of loyalty, certainly the most understood one.
</P>
<P>
   You could argue that Bird, McHale, Malone, and Stockton were all
compensated richly in their careers and u'd be right. But the NBA
has its own currency.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that Bird and McHale broke down, physically.
Bird got a $7 million balloon payment _ enormous at the time _ and
could have made scads more but decided he didn't want it if he
couldn't be Larry Bird. McHale's feet gave way and the best he did
was a $3.5 million hit at the end. At one point late in his career,
he was making less than Brad Lohaus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had opportunities to trade players,'' former Celtics
general manager Jan Volk said. ``Were they good deals? Well, two
years after the fact, if you still had something to show, you could
probably make an argument for it. But Red (Auerbach) always felt
there was tremendous value in developing a sense of loyalty. It was
there then. I'm not so sure it still is.''
</P>
<P>
   It is in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Malone will be 40 when this current deal expires. He has shown
no signs of slowing down and has not missed a game because of
injury since the 1988-89 season. (There have been three
DNP-suspensions along the way.) In that final year, he'll make
$19.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I look at the whole thing,'' Miller said, ``I do feel that
there's some risk to paying him the most when he may be the least
productive. But we've also been hearing that those two are slowing
down for the last six or seven years. And, actually, I think Karl's
last two or three years have been among the best of his career. You
just never know where that cliff is going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz under Miller's stewardship have been a profitable
enterprise. He's the first to admit it. The team lost $17 million
in its first 11 years of operation. Since Miller arrvd, it has
shown a profit every year, including a modest one of around
$120,000 in his first year. (He credited ex-president Dave
Checketts for that.)
</P>
<P>
   That's what made it easier for him to agree to these deals. He's
done well. His mainstays have done well. He has a new building that
sells out more often than not. He, Malone, and Stockton are Salt
Lake fixtures; all three realize that the players might have made
more elsewhere, but they chose to stay put.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never looked back,'' Miller said. ``I've always told John
and Karl I wanted two things from them: that they'll finish their
careers in a Jazz uniform and that, when it's all over, they can
turn around and say, `It's been good and fair for me.' I think now,
with these deals, it's got the making of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tall tales
</P>
<P>
   What's left to say about Charles Barkley? How about this: Let's
get out the tape measure and see how tall he really is. If he's
taller than 6 feet 4 inches, I'd be stunned. Barkley's height made
his achievements even more remarkable. As writers, of course, we
loved his candor and his outlandish stuff. This was, after all, the
fellow who said he was misquoted in his autobiography. ``I guess
you could say he pioneered the genre of the unauthorized
autobiography,'' cracked Jeff Neuman, the editor at Simon &AMP;
Schuster who oversaw Barkley's book. ``I had the opportunity to
know how David Stern felt every time he picked up the newspaper and
wondered, `What has he done to us today?' But I'll say this.
Charles was the only athlete I ever did a book with who looked you
in the eye and asked you about you. Most of them are interested
only in themselves. And in this era where wesw Michael Jordan so
carefully packaged, Charles always said what was on his mind and
interacted with people. How many athletes these days do that?'' . .
. Suns boss Jerry Colangelo, who, like a lot of owners, is ringless
thanks to Jordan, had this to say about Barkley: ``Charles was one
of the great entertainers that's ever played in the league, a
terrific player.'' However, Barkley basically made himself a
pain-in-the-you-know-what after his superb first year in Phoenix
(1992-93). The Suns lost in the Finals to the Bulls and Barkley was
the league MVP. Phoenix was a logical successor to the Bulls after
MJ retired, but the Suns instead regressed to the point they were
out in the first round in Barkley's last season there, 1995-96.
``In his first season, he brought us to a level we hadn't been at
for a number of years,'' Colangelo said. ``He had a fabulous
season. I would say for that year, I am grateful for the
contributions he made.'' . . . Patrick Ewing is back, but it
remains to be seen how it all unfolds for the 37-year-old center.
The story of his return was covered in mystery and, some might say,
duplicity. None of Ewing's teammates knew he had made up his mind
to return on Friday and, according to an article by Selena Roberts
in the New York Times, the only player on the team who treats Ewing
with what Ewing feels is the obligatory, unconditional reverence,
is Mirsad Turckan. Also out of the loop was a rather important
fellow, coach Jeff Van Gundy. He heard, like millions of others,
that Ewing would play Friday after it came out of the mouth of
ex-Georgetown coach John Thompson on TNT. Meanwhile, Ewing was
fined, twice, for not being press-accessibland the Knicks were
similarly docked. Ewing has never cared about his public persona
and it looks as though he cares even less now. But someone whom he
listens to, someone like Thompson, should tell him to stop scowling
and smell the coffee. He has no beefs. None. He's got his money.
Now, as Bill Russell would say, ``What else do you have?'' . . .
Looking for a feel-good comeback story for the holiday season? You
could do worse than the Scott Williams saga. This is the same
fellow who bagged three rings as a Jordanaire in the early 1990s
and then, basically, went into (well-heeled) hibernation the last
five years. He went to Philadelphia as high-priced free agent and
either was hurt or ineffective. He played a total of 46 minutes
last season and was sent to the Bucks in the Tim Thomas-Tyrone Hill
deal, mainly as a salary cap balancer. Now, he's starting for
Milwaukee and putting up very serviceable numbers. ``This summer, I
made a decision that I wasn't going to be one of those players who
looked back and didn't give themselves every opportunity,''
Williams said. ``I participated in the summer camps in Salt Lake
City and that kind of jump-started me into training camp. And I had
the best camp since I've been in the NBA. But for whatever reason,
coach (George) Karl didn't have me in the rotation.'' Williams said
his teammates went to Karl and suggested that the coach play the
North Carolina vet (among the teammates: Tar Heel teammate J.R.
Reid). ``That meant a lot to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Back with more stuffs
</P>
<P>
   Get ready for the return of the Slam Dunk Contest during
All-Star Weekend. Commissioner Stern said last week that the event,
held on Gimmick Saturd, will be back after a three-year absence.
(The last winner was Kobe Bryant in 1997.) ``We've had a lot of
interest expressed by the best people _ the players _ who've said,
`I have a few moves that are reminiscent of Dominique or Michael,''
Stern said. ``So we'll see what our players have.'' . . . After
watching Ron Mercer struggle in his return to Boston Wednesday,
Paul Pierce vowed he will not let the same thing happen when the
Celtics play Kansas . . . The train wreck known as the Washington
Wizards had its starting lineup outscored (by 9 points) by Cliff
Robinson and Tom Gugliotta in a Thursday bludgeoning by the Suns.
Washington is off to its worst start in 32 years, but owner Abe
Pollin is saying he'll stick around until the team improves, an
actuarial challenge . . . The Timberwolves got spanked in the
Pacific Northwest by surprising Seattle and a bored Portland team.
Wolves coach Flip Saunders did not appreciate Brent Barry hoisting
a trey at the end of the loss to Seattle. The fans wanted it; free
goodies at Taco Bell were at stake. ``It's a Barry trait. It's
genetic,'' Saunders said, referring to Barry's dad, the
self-assured Rick. ``Every dog has his day. That's how you have to
look at it. I chew guys out for taking shots like that.'' The
Sonics will be in Minnesota in 11 days . . . Glenn Robinson signed
on for another year with the Bucks. But he already was under
contract through 2004. Why only one year? It's all the Bucks could
offer, given that he has five years remaining and if a player signs
an extension, it can't be longer than six years. ``He came in and
we talked. He wants to finish his career here,'' GM Ernie Grunfeld
said. The one-yr extension will pay the Big Dog a shade more than
$12 million. Also, he'll have 11 years in the league, he'll be only
32, and he'll be eligible for a Malone-type hit assuming he
continues to improve . . . If you watched Court TV last week, you
might have seen Charlotte owner George Shinn on the stand, and he
wasn't getting grilled about trading Alonzo Mourning or Larry
Johnson. He's getting sued for sexual assault. There already has
been evidence introduced that Shinn carried on a two-year affair
with a Hornets cheerleader. The assault charge comes from another
woman. Shinn has denied any wrongdoing.

CONFIDENT PATRIOTS CHANGE ATTITUDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Serice clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the steel-cage match. The heavyweight championship. The
seventh game of the World Series. The Super Bowl. The last lap at
Indy.
</P>
<P>
   Alast it is for the Patriots Sunday when they meet the
Indianapolis Colts at the RCA Dome. Even so, the atmosphere in the
Patriots' locker room was very confident, bordering on
``dangerous,'' following their final practice of the week Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The offense, which tried a few new wrinkles last week, will add
a few more things to the mix this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something changed in here,'' said wide receiver Vincent
Brisby. ``Maybe it's because we've reached this stage where we have
to win, but the guys in here are so intense and there seems to be a
real purpose every time we go out to practice now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how good we are. We know we have talent. I think
everyone in here is mad that we've lost five games. We shouldn't
have lost that many with what we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Jefferson called it ``the best week of practice of the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been heard before. The Patriots, and Pete Carroll in
particular, have commented on the success of practices in the past,
and the Patriots have not always come out victorious thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the guys are really together,'' said defensive end
Ferric Collons. ``This team is as close as I've ever seen it. We
want to go out there and prove a point. This is a tough team we're
playing against. They're the best in our division. We need to beat
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Indianapolis, some fans truly believe the Colts are destined
to lose this game. They speak of the Patriots being a team the
Colts just can't beat. The Patriots have won seven straight against
the Colts, including the memorable game in September when they came
back from a 28-7 deficit to win, 31-28, on Adam Vinatieri's 26-yard
fid goal with 1:57 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look back, that was quite a game for us,'' said
Vinatieri. ``To battle back and not give up and then to win it in
the last couple of minutes is a tribute to the heart of our team. I
think we'd all like to be in position for me to kick another
game-winner, but hopefully we can put some points up early.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri could be a huge weapon for the Patriots down the
stretch. He will be kicking in a dome Sunday for the first and only
time this season, and he relishes the thought of not having any
wind to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Ted Johnson also remains a key figure. If he's able
to dominate the Colt guards and contain Edgerrin James, the
Patriots will challenge the Colts' passing game to beat them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid is an outstanding runner,'' Johnson said of James.
``He's so strong and so hard to bring down. We have to pay
attention to him with the run and also as a pass catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   Another concern is Ty Law's ability to play effectively against
Colts receiver Marvin Harrison with a broken hand. Law is sporting
a very large padded cast, and that weight on his thumb should
restrict him, especially on any physical play at the line of
scrimmage. He may have to play back, more of a Deion Sanders style.
</P>
<P>
   And if he feels he can't play effectively, this could be the
time for Tebucky Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever plays out there, we have to be at the top of our
games,'' said safety Lawyer Milloy. ``Nobody can make excuses. If
you can play, you'd better play your best. We don't have time for
excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Did the Thanksgiving week fightbetween Brisby and Milloy bring
this team closer together? Like the old New York Yankees? Like the
old Oakland A's?
</P>
<P>
   Neither combatant would touch that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of us as receivers are excited by the offense
we're seeing right now,'' said Brisby. ``We're trying different
things, spreading it out. I think with our weapons, we can create
some things with the way we're approaching offense right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The last thing the Patriots want to do is leave their enthusiasm
on the practice field. They've done that before and had to face the
music. But if they do it this time, there will not be a chance for
redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we have to win out,'' said Brisby. ``I think that's one of
the things that motivates everyone in here. We don't want to let
the fans and the organization down. We don't want to let ourselves
down.''

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The fact of the matter is that Peyton Manning
went after Ty Law, as no other quarterback has done. Three times,
three touchdown passes in one half to Marvin Harrison, three times
the Patriots cornerback scorched and burned back in September.
</P>
<P>
   The reason?
</P>
<P>
   Simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ty Law is their left cornerback and Marvin is our right
receiver,'' said Manning. ``That was something different from last
year because last year I probably wouldn't have done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tinges of a Southern drawl color the many words of the
Indianapolis Colts quarterback, a gentlemanly drawl, for Manning is
the truest of gentlemen. The drawl is pleasant to the ear, just as
Manning is pleasant to chat with, but even more pleasant is the
fact that the most promising quarterback to step into the National
Football League in years seems blissfully unaware that other star
QBs have their media time arranged for them, a few moments here, a
few questions there, but always controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Not Manning.
</P>
<P>
   He'll talk and talk. Then talk some more.
</P>
<P>
   Ask a question.
</P>
<P>
   A gentleman replies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I probably wouldn't have had the confidence (to go
after Law) because I didn't have the confidence just where we were
in our timing,'' said Manning. ``But due to the experience from
last year, the offseason work I had thiyr (with receivers), I feel
really confident in my timing. We have the utmost respect for Ty
Law and his abilities and the respect he gets, but when you have a
guy like Marvin Harrison, you can't take him out of the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Same way with Deion Sanders of the Cowboys, the best of the
best. Other quarterbacks avoid Sanders. Not Manning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like when you play against Deion,'' said Manning, who also
burned Sanders with a TD pass to Harrison. ``You've still got to
get the ball to Marvin but how do you do it? You run really good
routes, and you be accurate with the football. If you're off a
little bit, Law or Deion are going to make you pay for it, but
Marvin ran some good routes and we were able to make some good
throws and we were able to execute.''
</P>
<P>
   The confidence oozes. Youthful confidence. Manning struggled
mightily early in his rookie year of 1998, particularly in the
second game of the season against the Patriots, when the New
England secondary suckered him into interception after
interception. And the marvel, said Colts coach Jim Mora, is that
Manning was not scarred by his rookie year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of that,'' said Mora, ``is probably due to his father.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough, said Manning, because his father gave him the best
advice any father could give any quarterback breaking into the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad told me this isn't going to be easy,'' said Manning.
``He said it was going to be tough. And you know what? My dad was
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Peyton Manning's father is ArchManning, another Southern
gentleman, and Archie Manning was a superb college quarterback at
Mississippi and then an outstanding quarterback for the New Oeans
Saints, even though the Saints never were better than .500 with
him.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Bradshaw, Fran Tarkenton, Kenny Stabler, Dan Fouts, Roger
Staubach, Jim Plunkett, and other quarterbacks of the 1970s won
fame and adulation, but Archie Manning was as good as or better
than any of them. Archie Manning, unlike the others, never had a
team.
</P>
<P>
   And Archie Manning is still Peyton Manning's favorite
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Career wasn't destined
</P>
<P>
   Peyton Manning really doesn't have many clear memories of
watching his father play for New Orleans (``He retired in '84 and I
was like 8 then''). What he does remember, though, is going into
the locker room in the Louisiana Superdome and just hanging with
the team before or after games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can emember being in the locker room after the game and
going to Hawaii for the Pro Bowl and meeting people,'' said
Manning. ``And it was always a lot of fun on Saturdays going out to
the facility and lifting weights and doing those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning and his brother would go to the locker room after games,
too, not knowing or caring whether the Saints had won or lost.
There are more vivid memories than wins and losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tape and candy bars,'' said Manning. ``There's always a lot of
tape and candy bars in a locker room. We'd eat those candy bars and
then we'd make a football out of tape and we'd go out and play
football games _ one-on-one, 100-yard football games. Two guys here
couldn't do that now _ they'd be worn out _ but kids, you could run
all day. And my dad would be finishing interviews and finishing
autographs and he'd come out and get us and say, `Let's go home.'
''
</P>
<P>
   So tas a natural course of events, right? Peyton Manning always
wanted to be a quarterback. Just like Archie Manning. Right?
</P>
<P>
   No, said Manning, ``I was a fat little kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the sports TV guys from time to time would ask little
Peyton what he wanted to be and the boy would say, ``I want to be a
quarterback like my dad,'' it really wasn't so.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of kids are asked when they're 3, 4, 5 years old what
they want to be when they grow up,'' said Manning, ``and they
always say, `I want to be a football player' or `I want to be a
baseball player.' But I was only a young kid then. That's what I
said, but I was never on a mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning's parents were far from stage parents. Archie Manning
may still be a legend at Ole Miss and still a revered figure in New
Orleans, but Peyton Manning was not pushed into football. It sort
of all happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always see some players say it: `This has always been a
dream of mine,' '' said Manning. ``But that's certainly not the
case with me. I guess I always had natural dreams like any kid but
I remember when I got to the seventh grade, I was kind of slow and
I was kind of stiff and I was playing quarterback and I remember
thinking, `You know what? It's going to be hard to get a
scholarship to play in college.' You have to be a good high school
player.''
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth grade, said Manning, ``That's when I started
working at the position a little bit. I'd ask questions of my dad
and my teammates _ you know, in high school your teammates are your
best friends _ and they'd tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, with incredulity still in his voice, he said, ``In my
junior year, I got a personal letter from (FloridaSte coach) Bobby
Bowden and that was the first tip that told me maybe I was good
enough to play college football.''
</P>
<P>
   He chose Tennessee, in part because of his mother's influence
and in part because Ole Miss had some NCAA problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again,'' said Manning, ``when I got to college, I was
thinking in my sophomore year, `Can I do it?' You know, `Can I
throw against these corners?' and `Can I beat the blitz?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even after the Colts made him the No. 1 pick, the self-doubts
lingered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to have things happen last year,'' he said. ``I had to
do it. We won only three games but I threw some touchdowns and we
made some plays and it sort of gave me confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   And through it all, he recalled the words from Archie Manning.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Peyton,' he told me, `This thing is going to be tough.
You're the No. 1 pick and the reason it's going to be tough is
you're going to a bad team. That's the way it works.'
</P>
<P>
   ``In college, everything went pretty good for me; I had good
players around me at Tennessee. But I had that attitude from my dad
that I might have to struggle in the pros and when you have that
attitude, it helps.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do throw three interceptions against New England and
you get killed, it helps to get up and say, `I've got to keep
going, I've got to learn.' I've seen a lot of guys who've been
thrown to the wolves and never overcome it. And I knew I was going
to be thrown to the wolves _ that was Mora's and (president Bill)
Polian's plan. They said, `You've got to learn. You've got to
play.' And I think that's the only way you can learn. You can't
learn from the sidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Images from the past
</P>
<P>
   The Colt_ and all of professional football _ debated 18 months
ago whether Peyton anning or Ryan Leaf should be chosen first in
the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We studied Ryan hard and we studied Peyton hard and it was
very thorough,'' said Mora. ``But we all knew what kind of a
background Peyton came from and we all knw that's why he is what he
is. We knew about his intangibles. We knew there'd be some tough
situations and we felt Peyton was a bit better equipped to handle
them. We were sure Peyton had those qualities of leadership; we
weren't sure Ryan didn't, but we were sure Peyton did.''
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom was that Manning was the more
accomplished quarterback at the moment but that Leaf had more
potential because of his size and throwing arm. Mora, Polian, and
the Colts staff would list the pros and cons of each for hours on
end.
</P>
<P>
   A factor in the final choice was where Mora had coached for the
previous decade: New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had watched Peyton and I knew Archie from my time with the
Saints,'' said Mora, whose opinion of the Mannings coincided with
most others': They are very, very solid people.
</P>
<P>
   Still in all, said Mora, ``I'm very surprised with what happened
to Ryan.'' The Colts' exhaustive study of Leaf gave no indication
of the personality and maturity problems that have plagued Leaf in
San Diego. The Colts, of course, are more than happy they chose
Manning.
</P>
<P>
   And now Manning stands in the Colts' locker room, having told
rookie running back Edgerrin James 20 minutes earlier that he'd be
leaving with James ``in just a moment.''
</P>
<P>
   James is forced to wait as Manning tells tale after tale, ancote
after anecdote.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a boy, for instance, Peyton had heard so much about
his father's greatness at Ole Miss that he would go to the tapes of
Mississippi games _ audio tapes, mind you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to do that, just sit there and listen to the
broadcast,'' said Manning, ``and it'd be so much fun trying to
imagine what was happening on the field from the broadcast. I've
always loved imagining things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning calls it ``pictures in my mind'' and those long-ago
broadcasts still resonate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm watching film or studying defenses before a game,''
he said, ``I do the same thing I used to do with those tapes _ form
pictures in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   All week long he has prepared for this Sunday's game against New
England by drawing those pictures in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picture the New England defense, in their white jerseys, and
what it's going to look like,'' he said. ``It's always helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   He is as shocked as anyone that the Colts are 10-2. His goal
before the season was that ``we might go 10-6. I wanted to go to
the playoffs _ but in this division? The only thing I knew was that
we'd have a chance in every game this year _ last year we didn't
have a chance in a lot of games _ but I knew how tough this AFC
East was.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the ever-candid Manning went on, his No. 1 goal this
season was only to mature as a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to have better discipline and better
decision-making,'' he said. ``I wanted to learn how to throw the
ball away. That's so tough. When they've got you by your ankles and
you're going down, you go down. You don't try to be a hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned one lesson: A punt's n a bad play. Coming out of
college that's hard to lern. Coming out of college, you feel you
can make every third down. I mean, they're paying Ty Law all that
mony for a reason. Sometimes he's got your guy covered. So you
throw it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning moves into his next tale, of how the fun in the family
is when son calls father after a Colts game, not to hear father
tell son what went right and what went wrong, because that doesn't
happen unless Peyton Manning asks Archie Manning.
</P>
<P>
   No, the son asks his parents how many different places the
father sat while watching the game on television: couch, sofa,
recliner, or wherever. Archie Manning's superstition is to move
from seat to seat until the Colts score, after which he remains in
the lucky seat. ``That's the first thing I ask,'' said Peyton.
``How many places Dad sat.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgerrin James was still waiting.
</P>
<P>
   And Peyton Manning, the Southern gentleman, was still talking
until that rarest of events in the NFL occurred: The media had to
curtail an interview with a star quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   But not before Manning talks one last time of his father, of how
his father was ``battered and bruised playing on a bad team'' but
week after week, year after year, even though the Saints did little
to help Archie Manning ``my dad came back and played.'' Game after
game, year after year.
</P>
<P>
   It means nothing, said Peyton Manning, that he's had success in
his second year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say what (Dan) Marino did his second year and try to
compae me to him,'' said Manning. ``But I'm more impressed with how
long Dan has played and how well he's played for so long. That's
what's important to me: to be able to plaquarterback well for a
long time.''

BRADLEY DOWNPLAYS HIS HEART CONDITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The presidential campaign of Bill Bradley was put on hold
Saturday, when he canceled all appearances in California and
checked himself into a hospital because of an irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   A Bradley aide said the former New Jersey senator ``felt a
little different'' Thursday night from the heart condition. Bradley
hoped the condition, which was first diagnosed in 1996, would
correct itself as it has in the past, and attended a campaign event
Saturday morning in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   But by the afternoon, Bradley checked himself into a hospital
near Palo Alto, Calif., and met with cardiologist Dr. Edward
Anderson. According to a campaign spokeswoman, Bradley expected to
receive a mild electric shock to the heart, a treatment he had
received in the past. But Anderson said that before Bradley arrived
at the hospital, ``he had converted to a normal heart rhythm and no
therapeutic action was needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters expecting to see Bradley in nearby Berkeley were instead
read a statement by the candidate. Bradley, 56, was remaining
overnight in California, but not in a hospital, aides said. He has
canceled his appearances in Washington state Sunday, but plans to
resume his schedule Monday, with a trip to Orlando, Fla., to
address the state Democratic Party convention.
</P>
<P>
   Heart specialists said the condition should not hamper Bradley's
campaign, while the candidate's aides quoted his doctor as saying
the condition ``does not in any way interfere with his ability to
function.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, news of his condition, which had not been disclosed until
now, will bring new scrutiny on the candidate. Political analysts
said voters would be watching Bradley carefully in the coming days,
concerned with whether he can manage the strain of the campaign
trail, let alone the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a problem anytime a presidential candidate has a
health problem that requires hospitalization,'' said Darrell M.
West, a political science professor at Brown University. ``Voters
will be asking, `Can this guy handle the rigors of the job?' ''
</P>
<P>
   John J. Pitney, a political scientist at Claremont McKenna
College in California, said voters would be concerned only if the
heart problem is a serious one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a minor problem, then it shouldn't have a serious
impact,'' said Pitney. ``After all, we reelected Dwight Eisenhower
after his health problems in the '50s.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower had suffered a major heart attack. So did Lyndon B.
Johnson, when he was Senate majority leader in the 1950s. Johnson
was elected vice president in 1960 and then president in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   But when former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas ran for
president in 1988, he provided an overly rosy picture of his health
after a serious battle with cancer. Tsongas died after a relapse in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Tsongas experience has led many candidates in recent years
to release detailed medical records in order to prove that they are
healthy and physically capable of holding the highest office in the
land.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Arizona Senator John McCain released his medical
records in order to refute whispered suggestions that he may have
suffered mental impairment because of his 5 1/2 years in a North
Vietnamese prison camp. He also reported removing a cancerous mole
from his shoulder in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Atrial fibrillation, an irregular beat of the heart's upper
chambers, is a common condition, affecting at least 2 million
Americans. It can be caused by many factors, such as overactive
thyroid (the cause of former President George Bush's atrial
fibrillation), high blood pressure, and some medicines. But most of
the time, specialists said, there is no known cause.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike potentially deadly ventricular fibrillation, which
affects the heart's main pumping chambers and was linked to the
death of basketball player Reggie Lewis, the condition that Bradley
has is usually not life-threatening. The main risk, specialists
said, is that a clot will form within the heart because atrial
blood flow stagnates. Even a tiny clot in the left atrium can cause
a stroke if it migrates to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, patients with persistent atrial fibrillation
are routinely put on blood-thinning drugs. Sometimes a short
electrical shock is used if the atrium does not spontaneously
revert to normal rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Deeb Salem, chairman of medicine at New England Medical
Center, said Bradley's atrial fibrillation is likely to be ``a
minor inconvenience'' for him.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James E. Muller, director of cardiology research at the
Massachusetts General Hospital, agreed: ``There are many people in
important positions who have atrial fibrillation,'' Muller said.
``If all he has is AF, it is not a significant factor in his
capability to perform the job of president.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Bradley's cardiologist was similarly describing
his condition as ``more of an inconvenience than a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign also released results of the recent
physical exam, which showed no other sign of disease and no
structural damage to the heart. The exam reported about a
half-dozen incidents of atrial fibrillation since 1996, three of
which were treated with a mild electric shock. Bradley was also
prescribed Procanbid to prevent or shorten the duration of the
episodes, without side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's campaign had good wishes for a speedy
recovery. ``Our hearts and thoughts and prayers are with Senator
Bradley,'' said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Bradley is to travel to Claremont, N.H., to meet
McCain and shake hands on the need to overhaul the campaign finance
system. On Friday, he is scheduled to meet Gore in a forum at
Daniel Webster College in Nashua.

RESERVES-GAY _ The Army is moving forward with plans to discharge
openly gay state Rep. Steve May, an Army reservist, under the
``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, despite glowing performance
evaluations. Officials had rated the east Phoenix Republican
legislator as ``one of the finest young officers'' in the Army and
had urged quick promotions, according to a report obtained by The
Arizona Republic. By CHRIS MOESER. Story will move in the ``A''

 &QL; 
AUTISM (First of two part series) _ Evan O'Neal, 4, who ambles into
an examination room at the Southwest Autism Research Center
cradling a worn Big Bird, is one of the lucky ones. Out of hundreds
of candidates, he was one of 30 Phoenix area children selected for
a double-blind test. Two-thirds of the kids got secretin, the drug
that many hope will cure the enigma that is autism. By JODIE
SNYDER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN _ (Undated) During the hot, humid summer of 1977,
knew the names of all four men killed that July 22 by a forest fire
in southern New Jersey. I could have told you they were members of
the Eagleswood Fire Co. out of Ocean County, N.J., and were among
crews responding to a 2,000-acre arson fire in the Pine Barrens.
What I couldn't have told you _ because I wouldn't have believed it
_ is that all these years later I wouldn't even remember how many
men died that day. Or their names. Or even the name of their fire
department. By E.J. MONTINI. Story will move in the ``A'' and ``K''
categories. &QL;

NOT THE TIME TO RUSH TO CONCLUSIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At the first whiff of scandal, your gut reaction
is to crinkle your nose in disgust. You hear that UCLA forward
JaRon Rush has been suspended for at least two games and that an
agent and a summer-league coach might be involved and your visceral
reaction is: But of course. Another athlete milking the cash cow
that is college athletics.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, that would seem a Rush to judgment.
</P>
<P>
   There are athletes who arrive on college campuses with their
hands out and their hearts cold as currency. By all accounts, the
20-year-old Rush is not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   You suspect this isn't your football team's dirty linen when
UCLA administrators, who have seen their share of self-indulgent
behavior lately, express heartfelt sympathy for Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the nearly two dozen football players who thought they
were owed preferred parking, Rush was not asking what the system
could do for him.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the hallowed halls of Pauley Pavilion you can find
plenty of people who have given serious thought to what Rush could
do for them. And therein lies the problem.
</P>
<P>
   To be a standout basketball player at an outstanding basketball
school is to learn quickly what it's like to be double- and
triple-teamed on and off the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``At UCLA, you have a lot of people steadily in your ear,''
junior guard Rico Hines said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Oh that it were only well-meaning boosters talking to the
players. The reality is prospective agents also sidle up to them
and whisper sweet endearments in their ears. The words can be as
intoxicating as perfume.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough on a 20-year-old,'' Hines said, speaking in
generalities since he knows none of the specifics of Rush's
situation. ``You don't know who to turn to. You need some help,
some guidance, but it's sometimes hard to know who to trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Hines was addressing reporters shortly after the No. 11 Bruins
had suffered a 59-43 upset loss to No. 24 Gonzaga in the first game
of Rush's suspension. Rush sat on the UCLA bench in street clothes
for the game's entirety, his usual smiling self.
</P>
<P>
   He was there but he was sorely missed.
</P>
<P>
   Rush, who was slowed by a strained elbow before he was stopped
by the suspension, wasn't simply the leading scorer off the bench
and the second-leading rebounder in the previously unbeaten Bruins'
first three games. He was the human surge of adrenaline that kept
everybody's collective pulse racing.
</P>
<P>
   Without him, the Bruins were flatter than a shredded tire. The
nine-day layoff between their victory over Morgan State and their
meeting with Gonzaga wasn't the only nail that deflated them. They
felt sharply Rush's absence on the boards, especially at the
Bruins' end where Gonzaga outrebounded UCLA 31-14.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, who made only seven field goals in the second half,
had no answer for the Bulldogs' tenacity. Nor were they equipped to
answer even the most rudimentary questions about Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Earl Watson, Rush's best friend on the team, wrote
Rush's initials and jersey number on his sneakers as a show of
support. Watson said he didn't know any of the specifics that led
to Rush's suspension, only the sketchy details that appeared
Saturday in published reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm letting JaRon have his space,'' said Watson, who got no
such consideration from Gonzaga. The Bulldogs gave him so little
room to create he finished with seven turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's ready to talk,'' Watson said, ``he knows I'm there
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush could have stayed away. He had to know he was going to be
front and center Saturday no matter where he sat. That he came,
anyway, to face the television cameras and the UCLA student body,
was a simple act that provided a window into his character, his
teammates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows how strong he is,'' Watson said of Rush, who declined
interview requests. ``He's not hiding from anything. It had to be
tougher on him than on us, sitting (through that game).''
</P>
<P>
   That's saying something, considering how hard it was on Rush's
teammates, sitting alongside their friend, pretending not to smell
the smoke from the nearby fire.
</P>
<P>
   Hines spoke of feeling ``strange vibes'' in the gym. A couple of
the Bruins admitted the situation was mildly distracting.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it is. They're just kids, after all, not
professionals. No matter how quickly some of them are forced to
grow up.

MAMIIT RALLIES INTO FINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Defending champion Cecil Mamiit of Eagle Rock
battled his way back into the singles final of the drkoop.com
Tennis Championships of Burbank on Saturday, outlasting Jimy
Szymanski in a stirring 6-3, 2-6 7-6 (7-3) semifinal at Burbank
Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   Mamiit, who needed to win three of the final four games to force
the tiebreaker, launched the comeback by following a Szymanski
service break in game eight with a break of his own in game nine.
Then, Mamiit rallied from 0-30 with seventh-seeded Szymanski
holding a 5-4 set lead in a dramatic 10th game.
</P>
<P>
   Before prevailing, Mamiit would need to fight off two match
points _ the second with a running volley pass that brought a roar
of applause from a tennis-appreciative crowd treated to big shots
by both players throughout the final set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was that a great match, or what?'' gushed Steve Starleaf,
tournament director for the $37,500 USTA Challenger Series event.
</P>
<P>
   But Mamiit, who won a NCAA singles title as a freshman at USC,
had little time to savor his semifinal victory. He was back on
court for his doubles semifinal barely an hour and a half later,
thanks to Alex O'Brien's quick 6-2, 6-4 win over Bob Bryan of
Camarillo in Saturday's other singles semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Mamiit, seeded third, and eighth-seeded O'Brien meet in the
singles final today at noon, to be followed by the doubles
championship, in which Mamiit will be busy again _ teaming with
Scott Humphries against the top-seeded team of Bob Bryan and Mike
Bryan.
</P>
<P>
   Team Mamiit/Humphries advanced with a 6-3, 6-4 win over Michael
Joyce/Kyle Spencer in Saturday's first doubles semifinal. The Bryan
twins followed with a 6-4, 7-6 (7-4) victory over Adam Peterson/Jim
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, who knocked off top-seeded Paul Goldstein in Friday's
singles quarterfinals, looked sharp most of the way against fellow
Stanford alumnus Bob Bryan.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien broke Bryan in the first game of the match, added
another break six games later to go up 5-2 and included a third
break while winning five straight games during a stretch that
spanned both sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of energy today,'' said O'Brien, who combined
quickness with a soft touch that produced some applause-drawing
drop-shot winners.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed headed for an even quicker victory before Bryant
rallied from a 2-5 second-set deficit with back-to-back wins in
games eight and nine. In the process of that rally, Bryan outlasted
one of the most entertaining shots of the day _ O'Brien's charge to
the back wall and overhead, high-lob backward return that caught
Bryan's backline and induced a return into the net.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien wound up bowing happily to a whooping crowd after that
remarkable point, and although Bryan won the game, O'Brien took
both the set and match two games later by winning five of the final
six points.

NETS BEAT ROCKETS, 106-94  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ One night after crumbling in humiliating
fashion against perhaps one of the worst teams in National
Basketball Association history, the Nets continued their
ebb-and-surge routine with an artistic display against the Houston
Rockets Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   With sleight-of-hand passing, accurate shooting and textbook
execution, the Nets beat the Rockets, 106-94, at Continental Arena.
On Friday night, the Nets dropped a miserably played contest,
71-69, to struggling Chicago, giving the Bulls only their second
victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday night, the 9-point fourth quarter and 37.5 percent
shooting that cost the Nets against the Bulls seemed an ancient
memory. Instead of sulking, the Nets regrouped to dominate the
struggling Rockets, who were playing their second game without the
probable Hall of Famer Charles Barkley, who sustained a
career-ending knee injury last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas the Nets lacked balanced scoring against the Bulls, they
shot 50 percent from the field and had plenty of firepower Saturday
night. Six Nets scored in double figures, including the reserve
point guard Sherman Douglas, who dropped jump shots with surprising
accuracy in scoring 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Van Horn, shooting at least 50 percent for the fourth
straight game, led the Nets with 21 points. Kerry Kittles followed
with 16, and Kendall Gill, his jump shot falling regularly for one
of the few times this season, had 17.
</P>
<P>
   Stephon Marbury scored all of his 14 points in the first half,
but do not be fooled by his low point total. Marbury, who made 6 of
13 field-goal attempts and had 7 assists, played an outstanding
floor game, making numerous nifty passes, including a no-look dish
from the hip to a cutting Jamie Feick (14 points) to put the Nets
up by 27 points, 76-49, late in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets outscored the Nets by 36-24 in the final period to
close the gap, but the Nets were never challenged. The victory
improved the Nets' record to 5-16, but, more important, it gave
them a 3-1 mark in a week that included victories over tough teams
from Sacramento and Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   From tip-off to buzzer Saturday night, the Nets were strong in
the first half. Their offense flowed smoothly as they executed as
well as they have all season. They notched 12 assists, several of
them on nice backdoor feeds and cuts, in the first two quarters _
they average 17.5 assists a game _ and shot 53.5 percent from the
floor, both statistics being testaments to the symmetry they
displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury accepted the challenge delivered by Steve Francis, and
the result was an enticing matchup between two of the league's most
exciting point guards. Francis, one of the league's top rookies,
along with Lamar Odom of the Los Angeles Clippers, had the early
advantage, using between-the-leg dribbles and spin moves to create
space for his jumper or to drive past Marbury altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Francis' most dynamic move came on a miscommunication by the
Nets that left Marbury hanging out to dry. Marbury had Francis
covered on the wing but, anticipating help from a teammate on the
backside, allowed him to drive baseline toward the basket. By the
time Feick arrived to help, Francis was rising high for a
ferocious, one-handed, lean-in dunk. The play gave Francis 11
points, and clearly lighted a fire under Marbury.
</P>
<P>
   On the Rockets' next possession, he called off the help and
guarded Francis one-on-one, forcing the rookie to commit two
turnovers in the final three minutes of the quarter. Marbury, who
attempted to answer Francis' dunk with a 3-pointer, shut down
Francis for the rest of the half, and the Nets pulled away.
</P>
<P>
   After Francis' dunk put the Rockets ahead by 19-18, the Nets
closed the quarter with a 14-4 run to take a 32-23 lead into the
second. The Nets' bench, behind 6 points from Douglas, maintained
the advantage, and then the starters re-entered midway through the
quarter to increase the lead to 55-43 at the half.

NFLTODAY WEB SITE OWNER: JUST A FAN 
</HEADLINE>

 By BLEYS W. ROSE   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEARLAKE PARK, Calif. _ From his modest home in northern
California, and using his love of football and newly gained
knowledge of the Internet, Ken Miller has managed to get slapped
with a penalty in the form of a hefty lawsuit from the National
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL wants Miller to give up the rights to his ``NFLtoday''
sites on the World Wide Web. The football organization says the
sites impinge upon its trademarks and copyrights. Miller, 48, says
he started the Web sites last February to satisfy his thirst for
news about the daily doings of his favorite football teams and
heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a guy who was a lineman in high school and had dreams
of getting drafted someday and playing football,'' Miller said.
``Well, they didn't draft me, but I did get noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   He got noticed all right. In the form of lawsuit filed in New
York on Tuesday by NFL attorneys who allege that Miller's sites
amount to a form of cyberpiracy that recently became illegal under
new federal legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still trying to find an attorney, but I would like to get
this settled because I didn't have any intention of doing anything
wrong,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Domain names are addresses on the Internet where Web sites are
located. For a small fee, individuals or organizations can register
the names with a special Internet agency, which licenses the rights
to those addresses. In the rush to use the Internet as a public
relations and marketing tool, many companies have staked out
cyberterritory as part of their corporate identity.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has three Web sites that are identical, in that they
offer a compendium of links to other places on the Internet where
information such as statistics, game results, schedules, player
injuries and betting odds are available. The sites all begin with
``NFLtoday'' and end with either .com, .net or .org, the three most
common domain name suffixes.
</P>
<P>
   They offer little original content and act basically like a home
page for anybody looking for information about the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what a fan is? A fanatic. That's me,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who has coached Pop Warner leagues, said NFL fans turn
to his sites for advice about gambling odds as well information
about teams and players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a lot of hits when Walter Payton died,'' said Miller,
referring to the former running back for the Chicago Bears who died
last month. ``I thought the concept of the Internet was to put
together relevant information on the highway.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller had a previous brush with notoriety about when he was 19
and living in Anaheim. He created and marketed the ``Ticky Dicky''
wristwatch, the face of which featured a likeness of then-President
Richard Nixon flashing his famous double-fisted V-signs.
</P>
<P>
   He said his little company sold thousands of those watches. From
there, he went on to a career in marketing and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, he first got interested in the Internet and used it to
search for football news. Not finding a comprehensive site, he
designed one himself and he recalls his mother being the person who
picked the name ``NFL Today'' as the best domain name.
</P>
<P>
   Finding it owned by someone named Hank Miller, no relation, he
bought it for $200. He launched the site last February, but didn't
start working on its content until September when advertisers began
to get interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became a full-time job. I am either sleeping or on the
computer,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   A letter from CBS in October demanded that Miller relinquish the
``NFL Today'' name. CBS has televised a Sunday afternoon pregame
show by that name since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Then another letter, this time from the NFL, offered Miller $270
for the domain name. Miller countered with a request for $120,000
and there the matter sat until NFL filed its lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit contends that the repeated use of NFL trademarks
causes people to mistakenly believe that the sites are sponsored or
approved by the NFL. The organization owns the rights to NFL.com,
which it promotes as the official league site.

RON DAYNE WINS HEISMAN TROPHY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ron Dayne has set rushing records during his
four-year career at Wisconsin. He has collected honors in the past
week and tonight earned college football's most prestigious: the
Heisman Trophy. But none of that matters more to him than the prize
that is 2 years old and growing, his daughter, Jada.
</P>
<P>
   She was with him Saturday night at the Downtown Athletic Club
and smiled when her father was named the runaway winner of the
famous trophy by a better than 2-1 margin _ 2,042 points to 994 _
over Georgia Tech quarterback Joe Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Just as she was in the stands at Camp Randall Stadium in
Madison, Wis., on the afternoons when Dayne crushed Big Ten
Conference records, became the major college career rushing
record-holder, and had his No. 33 retired.
</P>
<P>
   Jada is the reason Dayne passed on the National Football League
to return to college for his senior year. She is the reason he is
determined to complete the 12 credit hours he needs to finish his
degree in African-American studies. He reminded his daughter of
that again Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm having a bad day at practice or I'm having a bad day at
school, I can look at her and forget all about it,'' said an
emotional Dayne, who was voted the first-place finisher by 586 of
the Heisman's 922 voters. ``I want to thank Jada for being the
biggest inspiration in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayne spoke often Saturday night of family, perhaps because he
has worked so hard to build one. He survived a fractured childhood
in southern New Jersey. His father, Ron Dayne Sr., was abusive to
his mother, Brenda. His mother struggled with drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   When the couple divorced, Dayne and his younger sister, Onya,
moved in with an uncle, Rob Reid, a minister in Woodbury, N.J.
Dayne dedicated the trophy to Reid and thanked his parents, who
also were on hand.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he showed up at Wisconsin, Dayne was not only far
larger than his teammates _ Eddie Faulkner, his backup of four
years and former roommate, thought the 254-pound Dayne was a nose
guard _ but he was far more mature. His coach, Barry Alvarez,
quickly recognized this.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Alvarez's prize recruit was a persistent
visitor to his office and rarely confined their conversations to
football.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne was a listener, not a talker. He said Alvarez taught him
to be a father. Alvarez says Dayne gave far more than that back to
Wisconsin football. ``He was an instant celebrity in Madison,''
Alvarez said. ``He has epitomized our program _ with his no cutting
corners and going about his business.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayne's natural reserve at times hampered his Heisman campaign.
His postgame responses were often as concise and punishing as the
hits he put on the unfortunate defensive backs who were often the
last obstacle before the end zone. Halfway through the season,
Steve Malchow, the Wisconsin sports information director, urged
Dayne to smile more when speaking to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have Ron wrong,'' Faulkner said. ``He is
passionate about people, and I think that is far more impressive
than anything he has done on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet Dayne's bruising, straight-ahead running style has also
been criticized despite his extraordinary numbers. He topped 200
yards in three of the final four games this season as he led the
Badgers (9-2) to the Big Ten title and a second straight Rose Bowl
berth. He was the nation's second-leading rusher with 1,834 yards
on 6.1 yards a carry with 19 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne broke the major college career rushing record set last
year by Ricky Williams of Texas with a 216-yard performance in a
41-3 victory over Iowa. In four years, he carried the ball 1,115
times for 6,397 yards and 63 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   He was also awarded the Maxwell Award as college football's best
all-around player and the Doak Walker Award as the best running
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fun to watch from behind,'' the Badgers' captain,
offensive tackle Chris McIntosh, said.
</P>
<P>
   As far as football company goes, the other Heisman finalists
represented the best of the college game.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who was voted first on 96 ballots, returned Georgia
Tech (8-3) to national prominence and won the Davey O'Brien Award
as the nation's outstanding quarterback. He completed 203 of 305
passes for 3,060 yards and 29 touchdowns, and ran for 730 yards and
6 more scores.
</P>
<P>
   Vote totals for third to fifth place were very narrow. By
finishing third, Virginia Tech's Michael Vick joined Herschel
Walker of Georgia in 1980 and Clint Castleberry of Georgia Tech in
1942 as the highest freshman finishers in the award's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only had dreams about a season like this,'' said Vick, who
has led the Hokies (11-0) to the national title game against
Florida State in the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   His most likely rival for the Heisman next year, junior Drew
Brees of Purdue, finished 11 points behind him, and Chad
Pennington, a senior quarterback from Marshall, was fifth.
</P>
<P>
   None of them begrudged Dayne his moment. ``He has been a great
player and deserved it,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne acknowledged the classy football company he kept for the
evening. But what mattered most was the family he has brought
together. Jada sat in the lap of her mother, Alia Lester, who was
seated next to Onya Dayne, now a track athlete at Wisconsin. And no
one needed to remind Dayne to smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very special,'' he said. ``I'm very lucky I have all
these people.''

AN ECHO OF A DISTANT LAST BELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a time during the hot, humid summer of 1977, I knew the
names of all four men killed that July 22 by a forest fire in
southern New Jersey, not far from the small town where I lived.
</P>
<P>
   I could have told you the men were members of the Eagleswood
Fire Company from Ocean County, and were among crews responding to
a 2,000-acre, arson-caused fire in one of the most quietly lovely
spots on Earth, the Pine Barrens.
</P>
<P>
   I could have told you the four firefighters were in an Army
surplus truck, trying to overrun the flames in what's called Bass
River State Forest.
</P>
<P>
   I could have told you that the next day, July 23, there was to
have been a party celebrating the 50th anniversary of the founding
of the Eagleswood Fire Company.
</P>
<P>
   I could have told you how news of the four deaths spread as fast
as the fire itself, and had the same effect, robbing oxygen from
those who heard it, leaving them ashen.
</P>
<P>
   What I couldn't have told you _ because I wouldn't have believed
it _ is that all these years later, I wouldn't even remember how
many men died that day.
</P>
<P>
   Or their names. Or even the name of their fire department.
</P>
<P>
   I had to look it up, which I did last week after watching TV
coverage of the memorial service for six firefighters killed in a
warehouse in Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   One of the many speakers in Worcester was President Bill
Clinton, who said, ``Too often we take them for granted, our
firefighters. In the days ahead, I hope every American will find an
occasion to thank those in their communities who stand ready every
day to put their lives on the line when the alarm bell rings.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a big memorial service back in 1977, too.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters from Mount Holly, N.J., where I worked for a weekly
paper, let me ride along with them. Their uniforms were dark and
made of wool. The guys in the truck kept their jackets off.
</P>
<P>
   The ride went along happily at first, nothing but small talk and
breezes through the windows. Then, we pulled onto the main road
leading to the service and stopped.
</P>
<P>
   For as far as we could see in front of us, there were
firetrucks. There were even more trucks behind.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighters put their jackets on, and we inched along,
finally reaching a big, open area near where the service was to be
held. Trucks were squeezed into rows like red and yellow bricks,
paving the landscape like a shiny dance floor. The service was held
outside. Uniformed men and women walked toward the main podium
until the crush of firefighters in front of them, and the crush
behind, forced them to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere off in the distance, there were eulogies and speeches
and testimonials. And sad, sad music.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't see any of it, neither could the hundreds around me.
Still, throughout the ceremony, the mass of firefighters stood at
attention, not wavering unless someone nearby collapsed in the
heat, which happened more and more as the service stretched into
the miserable afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Worcester, TV cameras focused again and again on
six shiny yellow helmets on the stage of a packed concert arena.
Next to them were photographs of the men who died:
</P>
<P>
   Joseph T. McGuirk, 38; James F. Lyons III, 34; Lt. Thomas E.
Spencer, 42; Timothy P. Jackson, 51; Paul A. Brotherton, 41, and
Jeremiah M. Lucey, 38.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the dead were repeated again and again during the
service. Twenty-two years ago in New Jersey, the only thing
different was the roll call:
</P>
<P>
   Chief Harold Cranmer Jr., 32; Assistant Chief Marcus Cullen, 28;
Herb Blackwell, 23, and John Baker, 52.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial service in 1977 went on for an eternity. So did the
one last week. The speeches. The salutes. The endless procession of
vehicles. The horns and bagpipes and silent, flashing lights.
</P>
<P>
   It's always that way at a firefighters funeral. I see that now.
It's an extravagant, unrelenting event, and the only public
ceremony in America that's not nearly excessive enough. &QL;

GONZAGA BATTERS BRUINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA wasn't beaten Saturday at Pauley Pavilion. It
was banished.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after No. 3 Stanford crossed the country to win at
Georgia Tech and No. 2 Arizona hammered No. 4 Michigan State, the
Bruins failed miserably against a Gonzaga team making its third
long road trip in eight days.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, someone doesn't belong in the Pac-10's first-class
seats, at least for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a long way to go,'' Bruins guard Earl Watson said
after a 59-43 loss to No. 24 Gonzaga before 9,951 stunned fans.
``We're nowhere close to where we need to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have three months to prepare for the NCAA Tournament,
which means nothing. After all, they had 10 days to prepare for
Gonzaga and responded with 16 turnovers, bad shots, clueless zone
offense, sloppy passes, a heartless second half _ ``We rolled
over,'' forward Rico Hines said _ and 26.2 percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   In addition:
</P>
<P>
   __ The Bruins set Pauley Pavilion records for lowest point total
and lowest shooting percentage.
</P>
<P>
   __ The point total was UCLA's lowest since the shot clock was
implemented in 1985-86.
</P>
<P>
   __ The 16-point margin equalled the worst nonconference home
defeat in school history.
</P>
<P>
   It was a memorable day, indeed, under those 11 NCAA championship
banners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had 10 days off to prepare and we played very poorly _
that one's on me as the head coach,'' said UCLA's Steve Lavin, who
also has the worst loss in school history (48 points, at Stanford)
on his record.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes for the Bruins, 3-1, who played without suspended
forwards Matt Barnes (academics) and JaRon Rush (possible NCAA
violation) and injured guard Ryan Bailey (tendinitis).
</P>
<P>
   They have six days to prepare for No. 20 DePaul, which lost at
Duke by one point. They have 18 days to ready for Purdue and they
have 25 days to prepare for the rugged Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   And those back-to-back January games against North Carolina and
Arizona? Oh, boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely aware of what Stanford and Arizona are
doing,'' Hines said. ``This game lets us know where we are. In the
second half, we didn't counter Gonzaga's spurt. We laid down and
let them run over us. Everybody was looking at each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs, who played Cincinnati and Temple last week, opened
the second half with a 22-6 surge, then braced for a UCLA riposte
that never came.
</P>
<P>
   Watson made 3 of 15 shots and had seven turnovers. ``Shooting''
guard Ray Young was 1 of 7. Forward Jason Kapono was 3 of 10, and
the Bruins were as inept against Gonzaga's zone as they were
against Detroit Mercy's zone in the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just didn't play with a lot of fire today,'' Gonzaga
guard Matt Santangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't play with a lot of Jerome Moiso, either.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-10 sophomore, Moiso is UCLA's leading scorer and leading
rebounder, and he has one eye on the NBA. Perhaps he was
overzealous Saturday when Lakers Executive Vice President Jerry
West showed up. More likely, Moiso was confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got my third foul, I thought it was my second foul,''
Moiso said. ``That's why I kept going hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for long. Moiso committed his fourth foul with 19 minutes
left in the game, a silly reach-in 15 feet from the basket. He
spent nine minutes on the bench watching center Dan Gadzuric
struggle (2-of-7 shooting) against Gonzaga's collapsing defense.
</P>
<P>
   When Moiso returned, the Bulldogs had taken control and they
weren't about to let it go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were outcompeted in the paint,'' Lavin said, ``and it
wasn't as though we played a dominant frontcourt team like
Stanford.''
</P>
<P>
   That comes Feb. 3.

UCLA LOOKING INTO TWO SEPARTE ISSUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA is investigating unrelated issues concerning
suspended forward JaRon Rush _ one involving his former
summer-league coach, Myron Piggie, the other involving his dealings
with a sports agent, according to sources close to UCLA and Rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told an agent is involved and that sickens me,'' Pac-10
commissioner Tom Hansen said. ``Agents are the biggest problem
facing college athletics today.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush was suspended indefinitely by the school Friday for a
possible NCAA-rules violation. Hansen said the potential infraction
won't violate UCLA's three-year NCAA probation, which was imposed
in 1998 for violations committed by former Bruins coach Jim
Harrick.
</P>
<P>
   Rush, a sophomore from Kansas City, Mo., missed several
practices last month to testify in a trial involving Piggie in
Kansas City, sources said, and the current investigation is related
to that situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what's going on, but (Piggie) is a very touchy
situation,'' said UCLA guard Earl Watson, who also played for
Piggie and is Rush's best friend.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA athletic director Peter Dalis and faculty athletics
representative Donald Morrison are conducting the investigation.
The Pac-10 and/or NCAA will join the process only if UCLA requires
help with interviews and fact-finding. The investigation could take
one week or several weeks, depending on the availability of the
interviewees.
</P>
<P>
   Rush won't practice until the investigation concludes, if then.
Asked Friday if Rush's future at the school is in jeopardy, Dalis
said: ``It's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Dalis and Morrison will submit their findings to the Pac-10's
Compliance Committee, which determines if a violation has occurred
and recommends sanctions if warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school can also self-impose penalties,'' Pac-10 assistant
commissioner Jim Muldoon said. ``That happens a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush was on the bench in street clothes Saturday watching UCLA's
59-43 loss to Gonzaga. He was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was here today, early, slapping our butts and being his
usual, energetic self,'' Bruins forward Rico Hines said. ``He told
us, `I'm with you in spirit.' ''

PARENTS HOLD HOPE `MIRACLE DRUG' WILL SAVE KIDS LOST TO AUTISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (First of a two-part series) 
 By JODIE SNYDER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time, once again, for the screaming.
</P>
<P>
   Evan O'Neal, 4, ambles into an examination room at the Southwest
Autism Research Center cradling a worn Big Bird. His other hand, as
usual, hangs from his mouth like a large extra tooth.
</P>
<P>
   As he's hoisted onto the table for an injection to test
secretin, the drug his parents hope will cure his autism, Evan
explodes with a piercing, sirenlike scream. His father drapes his
body over the writhing boy. The doctor with the needle hums in a
soothing baritone. Evan's mother strokes his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   Evan stops long enough for a couple of mucus-choked coughs.
Then, he screams again.
</P>
<P>
   As Evan flails, the needle pops out. As the doctors and nurses
scramble to reinsert it, Evan's arms come free and he grabs his
father as if his neck were the last life preserver on a sinking
ship.
</P>
<P>
   Evan's mother, Mary, also draped over her son, starts singing
the alphabet. His father, Benton, joins in. So do the nurses and
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it working?'' one asks.
</P>
<P>
   Another responds, half-jokingly, ``I don't know about him, but
it's comforting for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The five-minute procedure seems to last a day. Finally, his
parents rip off the Velcro restraints. Dazed and red-eyed, Evan
grabs Big Bird and wanders off to a playroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``God,'' someone says, ``I hope he got the real thing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Evan is one of the lucky ones. Out of hundreds of candidates, he
was one of 30 Valley children selected for the double-blind test.
Two-thirds of the kids got secretin, the drug that many believe
will cure the enigma that is autism.
</P>
<P>
   More and more families are suffering its heartbreaking effects.
</P>
<P>
   Their babies are born seemingly typical; then, within two or
three years, they stop looking Mom and Dad in the eye, they stop
making sense when they talk. Some stop communicating at all.
</P>
<P>
   In some profound way, autism throws a child's world out of
balance. Either the child becomes overly sensitive and withdrawn,
or nothing stimulates him and he become disengaged. Everything, it
seems, is too much or too little.
</P>
<P>
   Such children can't distinguish their grandparents from
strangers. They can't look forward to Christmas or make best
friends. Hardly ever do they say, ``I love you, Mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   They wear weighted vests in preschool play circles to keep their
bodies, at least, from wandering off. They scream when movie
theater lights go down. They live in houses without doorknobs.
Houses where playmates never come to visit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, physically, they look like other children. How do you so
completely lose your child who's right there, nestled in your arms?
</P>
<P>
   So, parents cling to the idea that there ``is'' an answer, that
it will take only one good nudge to bring their child back. And,
like Mary O'Neal, they pray that secretin is that nudge. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Evan's day begins with a ritual to reinforce that he's part of
this world.
</P>
<P>
   While her son is still in his pajamas, O'Neal firmly massages
his arms and legs. Then, she gently pushes up against his bones.
</P>
<P>
   Some with autism get too much stimulation. It's like living with
a headful of stereo speakers and a psychedelic light show, so they
turn off their senses and seem blank.
</P>
<P>
   But other autistic children, like Evan, have too little
sensitivity. Evan once grabbed a cactus and got a palmful of
needles; he didn't cry. His eardrum burst; he didn't cry.
</P>
<P>
   As O'Neal presses against her son's pale skin, she sings softly.
He never looks at her. He wiggles down into his parents' dark green
comforter. His back is rigid, his head cocked. He listens intently
to something no one else hears.
</P>
<P>
   When the 45-minute massage is done, Evan skitters across the
room, his arms flapping to continue the stimulation. The flapping
is so typical that parents and researchers call it ``stimming.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan never played with any of his toys, O'Neal recalls. But he
loved carrying around his father's blow dryer and listening to the
noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought that was the greatest thing since cream cheese,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   When Evan was 2{, his pediatrician delivered a diagnosis that
sounded more like a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``She spent 20 minutes with him and closed her book and said to
us, `Well, I think he is autistic, probably mentally retarded. You
should probably be aware of the fact that you will have to put him
in an institution someday,' '' O'Neal says.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the O'Neals have tried to outfox the diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   They've eliminated wheat and cow's milk from Evan's diet. Added
vitamins. Attended support groups. Consulted doctors and more
doctors. Analyzed and reanalyzed his urine. Searched the Internet.
Second-guessed themselves. Gone through physical therapy, speech
therapy, occupational therapy. They've turned their living room
into a gym.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Mary O'Neal, 39, watches her younger son, Tim, for
signs of autism. The risk of having a second autistic child is
about one in 20.
</P>
<P>
   At the breakfast counter, O'Neal leans into Evan's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's Tim?'' she coos. Evan points to his brother.
Delighted, her face nearly splits with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a high,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Then she asks, ``Where's Mommy?'' He points to her.
</P>
<P>
   Then she asks, ``Where's Evan?'' His gaze wanders off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our highs are so high,'' O'Neal says.
</P>
<P>
   That's because everything is such a struggle. Evan doesn't like
things near his face, so he can stand to have only half of his
teeth brushed at a time. He doesn't like mushy foods. He screams
when he touches Play-Doh. He's never been calm enough to eat at
McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, I would give my right (arm) not to do this,'' O'Neal
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I used to take the easy way out. I was a follower,
not a leader, but I can't be that way anymore. I am his advocate,
and I cannot let him down.''
</P>
<P>
   So now, she spends her days trying to get her son potty-trained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure he's cute now,'' she says. ``But no one is going to want
to change his diapers when he's 18.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan doesn't speak, emitting only an undulating warble when he's
excited or happy. But he can grab the picture cards attached to
objects throughout the house to indicate when he wants to watch a
video.
</P>
<P>
   Even the smallest payoffs demand vast patience.
</P>
<P>
   Evan can now dunk a ball into a hoop 4 feet off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us a year to do that,'' his mother says proudly,
sadly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to set them off?'' Karen Jason wonders as she
waits for her two kids after school.
</P>
<P>
   Jason carries that worry around all day, starting at 6 a.m. when
she hides their shoes and socks in the trunk of her car. If they
saw them, they'd throw a fit and never leave the house.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her best efforts, something goes awry. Instead of
getting off the school bus and running toward her, 6-year-old Sean
runs the opposite way.
</P>
<P>
   He's like a hummingbird with a snootful of caffeine. Running
behind a pole, zigzagging across the parking lot, completely
unmindful of people and cars.
</P>
<P>
   Jason, her face flushed, chases him, scoops him up and gives him
a piggy-back ride. It does no good to scold him; words ricochet
off.
</P>
<P>
   Jason speaks deliberately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean, Sean. We have to get into the car. Rebecca is waiting
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though onlookers are fascinated by the spectacle, Rebecca
pays it no mind. At 8, Sean's big sister doesn't have an ounce of
girlishness or silliness. She gives off no sparks, no spasms of
giggles or tears. She is purposeful as she plays, her mouth set in
a straight line that almost never bends.
</P>
<P>
   This is Karen Jason's family: Sean, the rambunctious 6-year-old
with the mind of a 3-year-old, and Rebecca, quiet and aloof but
considered high-functioning because she communicates more easily.
</P>
<P>
   With both of her children diagnosed as autistic, ``in my world,
it's autism that is normal,'' Jason says.
</P>
<P>
   To live in her world, you have to know the language. What Jason
calls ``video talk'' is the only way Sean communicates.
</P>
<P>
   When someone gets angry at him, Sean puts his fist in the
person's face and says, ``Will this help?'' It's not a threat, it's
a line from ``The Prince and the Pauper'' when Mickey Mouse shows
his regal ring and is released from his captors.
</P>
<P>
   At times, translation is more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Once Jason made an unexpected potty stop. Because they were in
an elementary school after hours, Sean's words echoed in the
hallway.
</P>
<P>
   Sean started roaring. To Jason, it made sense. The echoing made
the same sounds as ``Once Upon A Forest,'' a favorite dinosaur
movie.
</P>
<P>
   But his roaring was so loud that the school staff gave them
dirty looks as they left the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   After she told them he was autistic, they apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I told them, `Thanks for the look,' '' Jason says.
</P>
<P>
   An elementary school teacher, Jason knows it's a gamble to take
her kids out. Once interested in something, they become fixated.
After spending six hours in a Disney store, they want to stay and
will scream like extras in a horror movie when it's time to leave.
</P>
<P>
   When Sean wants reassurance, he'll rush over to Jason and wiggle
his head into her thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``He craves that kind of pressure,'' his mother says. ``Of
course, it looks really weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason knows she must get her kids out of their usual life with
its built-in eccentricities _ Sean must have his right sock and
shoe on before putting on his left sock. She's got to get them into
the real world.
</P>
<P>
   So, damn the dirty looks, full speed ahead.
</P>
<P>
   She's enrolled them in special baseball programs and had them in
talent shows. She takes them grocery shopping even though the trips
take twice as long and often end up in temper tantrums.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Jason will sneak into her son's room and rearrange his
two dozen stuffed animals, just to provoke him into communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to pick your battles,'' she says. Some nights, she
lets them interrupt dinner for the umpteenth time to make sure the
computer screen hasn't gone blank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is so regimented because they like it that way,''
Jason says. ``Life has glitches, and they have to get used to
it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Karen Jason sits expectantly in the center's waiting room as
children like Evan O'Neal scream while getting shots. The
expectation level is so feverish that the waiting room feels like a
prayer hall.
</P>
<P>
   Sean, playing with his omnipresent stuffed-animal gang, is
oblivious of the other children's screams. Rebecca, as suspicious
as an old woman, frets around the room.
</P>
<P>
   For so long, Jason has been doing the best she can _ coping,
praying, cajoling, crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could this drug actually help them?'' she wonders, for the
thousandth time. ``Is this what they need?'' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Sam Leve, a scenic and lighting designer, died on
Monday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was
91 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   His work set the mood for more than 100 Broadway and
Metropolitan Opera productions, as well as events for five
presidential administrations, beginning with Harry S. Truman's.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Russia, Leve moved to New York City with his family in
1920. He began his career with the Mercury Theater, where he
designed Orson Welles' 1937 production of ``Julius Caesar.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his most famous, although unintentional, touch was the
lighting he designed for Marilyn Monroe's birthday serenade to
Kennedy at Madison Square Garden, which caused her dress to become
see-through.
</P>
<P>
   Leve and his wife, Shirley Book Leve of Manhattan, had been
separated for 42 years. He is survived by a daughter, Teri Leve, of
Manhattan, and a sister, Lottie Weiss, of Monsey, N.Y.

   &UR; THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND &LR;  By Giles Foden. Vintage
International, $13. Nicholas Garrigan, a young Scottish doctor in
the employ of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, is anything but
heroic: He's weak, indecisive and easily manipulated. ``Therein
lies the admirable risk'' of this ambitious first novel, Michael
Upchurch wrote in The New York Times Book Review last year, and
despite the doctor's moral failings he emerges as an oddly
sympathetic protagonist.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AT HOME WITH THE MARQUIS DE SADE: A Life &LR;  By Francine du
Plessix Gray. Penguin, $14.95. Talk about standing by your man:
Renee-Pelagie de Montreuil de Sade, the wife of the legendary
18th-century sexual rogue, persevered through sex scandals, police
raids and prison terms (the marquis spent 15 of the 27 years they
were married in prison or on the run). In fact he might never have
written a word had it not been for her saintly servitude, according
to this biography, which effectively defangs Sade while suggesting
that perhaps a bit of the scoundrel's unfettered narcissism lurks
deep in every psyche. The result is a ``bold, imaginative'' book,
Emily Eakin wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TALE OF THE 1002ND NIGHT &LR;  By Joseph Roth. Picador USA, $14.
The Austrian writer's final work of fiction, published in 1939, is
an erotic fairy tale set in Hapsburg Vienna, featuring the shah of
Persia and a string of pearls that dooms everyone who gets near it.
Last year the reviewer Iain Bamforth praised Roth's ``wonderful
style ... for the way it plunges us into the swim of time.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BIBLE AS IT WAS &LR;  By James L. Kugel. Belknap/Harvard
University, $19.95. The author draws on diverse sources to explain
how the Torah, the first five books of the Bible, was understood by
ancient peoples and how the interpretations of early scholars
altered our perceptions of biblical teachings. In 1997, Phyllis
Trible called this a ``fascinating study'' handled ``with erudition
and enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; THE HIDDEN JESUS: A NEW LIFE &LR; , by Donald Spoto (St. Martin's
Griffin, $14.95), a theologian (and celebrity biographer) examines
the life of Jesus of Nazareth and argues that his true vision
remains alive and active today. The result is ``a personal
statement of faith'' that ``thoughtfully challenges some of
Christianity's traditions,'' Alexandra Hall wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JESUS THROUGH THE CENTURIES: His Place in the History of
Culture &LR; , by Jaroslav Pelikan (Yale University, $13.95), is a
celebratory study of Jesus' impact on Western art, thought and
culture over the last 2,000 years. ``Believers and skeptics alike
will find it a sweeping visual and conceptual panorama,'' John
Koenig wrote in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE SHE WENT: Stories &LR;  By Kate Walbert. Penguin, $12.95. In
these 14 linked tales, a lonely company wife moves from place to
place, a journey echoed years later by her adult daughter, who
travels the world in search of fulfillment. ``Their stories are
small, elegiac and inconclusive,'' Molly Giles wrote in 1998.
```Where She Went' contains many quick flashes of beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA &LR;  By Richard Hughes. New York Review,
$12.95. This dreamlike 1929 novel explores the tangled fates of a
group of children en route from the West Indies to England and the
ragtag crew of pirates that reluctantly captures them. ``There is
an air of fantastic credibility about this odyssey,'' The New York
Times Book Review wrote, and it is a fascinating study in child
psychology.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE DOCTOR STORIES &LR;  By Richard Selzer. Picador USA, $14. These
tales by a former surgeon, culled from three decades of short
fiction, explore lives on both ends of the scalpel and are
carefully imbued with the language of sickness. ``Selzer's fiction
is refreshingly old-fashioned: His prose is formal, his ironies
straightforward,'' Tobin Harshaw wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DOSSIER: The Secret History of Armand Hammer &LR;  By Edward Jay
Epstein. Carroll &AMP; Graf, $15.95. The larger-than-life oil magnate
(1898-1990), who courted world leaders from Lenin to George Bush,
emerges in this well-researched biography as ``a morbidly
fascinating compound of ambition, greed, unscrupulousness and power
hunger,'' Joseph E. Persico wrote in 1996. ``It is hard to imagine
a sharper picture of how a tycoon is both born and made.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OH, JACKIE &LR;  By Maudy Benz. Berkley, $12.95. The 15-year-old
narrator of this first novel, left by her parents to spend the
summer of 1963 with her wealthy cousins in Michigan, tries to
imagine what her idol, Jackie Kennedy, would do to escape the
clutches of her lecherous uncle. Benz tells the story ``with
tenderness and impressive control,'' Sally Eckhoff wrote in The New
York Times Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BREAKING NEWS &LR;  By Robert MacNeil. Harvest/Harcourt, $13. This
lively novel by the former PBS news anchor centers on a 60-ish
network anchorman grappling with both a life crisis and a career
crisis. The result is ``a provocative cri de coeur aimed at what
one character calls `information/entertainment television,''' Eric
Alterman wrote in 1998.

FINN SHOWS JITTERS, SKILLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Jere Karalahti struggled in his long-awaited NHL
debut, but when the Los Angeles Kings saw him tear off a blistering
slap shot during the third period, they came away impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could he not have been nervous?'' said defensemate Mattias
Norstrom. ``He's played in world championships over in Finland, but
believe me, there is nothing like your first game here. There is
nothing you can say until you experience it.''
</P>
<P>
   Karalahti was signed by the Kings last summer, but his arrival
from Finland was delayed because of a history of drug abuse. He has
been clean for two years after completing a nine-month
rehabilitation program but was tied up in red tape for three months
after his signing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you could see the skill,'' coach Andy Murray said. ``And
he has a bit of an edge, which can be rare for a European player.
His quickness will pick up just by being here.''
</P>
<P>
   Karalahti was besieged by Finnish reporters after the game. He
appeared calmer than anyone, which Murray said is a big part of his
easy-going personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what was coming,'' Karalahti said. ``I've waited a long
time for this. I thought as the game went on, things got a little
better. The best part is that we won.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Blake back? Mattias Norstrom's usual defensive partner Rob
Blake missed his second consecutive game with a strained groin and
is not certain if he will play Tuesday in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is better, but we'll see,'' he said. ``I won't skate on it
again until Tuesday, so that should give it some time to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   On Karalahti, who probably would be the one to be benched when
Blake returns: ``That was a tough spot for him tonight. Everyone is
telling him to relax. Matty told him to have fun in his first NHL
game, but it isn't easy. You just want to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Stepping up: Is it a coincidence that defenseman Aki Berg is
playing the best hockey of his career with Blake out of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to do what I can do,'' said Berg, who Murray
claimed was the best player on the ice Saturday. ``It hasn't always
been easy this year, but I feel very comfortable. I don't know if
having (Blake) out has made a difference in me. I'd like to think I
play hard all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg, who played in his native Finland last year during a
contract dispute, was benched twice back in October for poor play.
Norstrom thinks he is finally settling in after his holdout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we're 30 games in, but losing a whole season takes a
lot of adjusting,'' Norstrom said. ``He looks great on the power
play now. He looks great every time he's on the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Palffy flies: Injured right wing Ziggy Palffy tested his sore
lower back Saturday in Los Angeles and will rejoin the team today
in New Jersey. Palffy, the Kings' leading scorer with 27 points,
skated, but the team isn't sure if he will be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me he was flying (today), so I have to think he's
better,'' Murray said. ``The fact that he's coming is encouraging,
but we really won't know until we practice Monday. We need to make
sure he's healthy before he plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Palffy missed his third consecutive game Saturday. Before this
year, Palffy missed a total of three games because of injury.

USC BOUNCES BACK BIG AFTER FRUSTRATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Perhaps still stung from its loss to Long Beach
State, the USC women's basketball team took out its frustrations on
Sacramento State on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   USC scored the first 12 points of the game and breezed to an
84-42 victory at the Lyon Center, a result that helped ease the
pain from Wednesday's loss to Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurt everybody. It was a big stab,'' forward Danielle
Golay said. ``It was kind of a wake-up call.''
</P>
<P>
   The Women of Troy (4-2) so easily dominated Sacramento State
(2-5) that the Hornets went scoreless the first six minutes of the
second half and did not score a field goal for nearly 8{ minutes.
Sacramento State's 42 points were the ninth-fewest ever allowed by
a USC team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question the Long Beach game . . . we were very,
very disappointed,'' USC coach Chris Gobrecht said. ``We're not
good enough to let anybody outhustle us.''
</P>
<P>
   Three USC players scored in double figures, with Golay getting a
game-high 12 points. Forward Tashara Carter and point guard Lauren
Smith-Hams each had 11. Forward Denise Woods, a transfer from San
Francisco, added six points and 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Smith-Hams, a true freshman, made three shots from 3-point range
in just her second start of the season, as Gobrecht searches for a
reliable point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to find the right leader for this team,'' Gobrecht
said. ``That position is really a mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   USC guard Erica Mashia scored eight points, as she makes an
impressive comeback after missing the past two seasons with a hip
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a tremendous boost in terms of intelligence,'' Gobrecht
said. ``She's not the player she was before the injuries, but Erica
at less than what she was is still a huge boost.''

ARMY MOVES TO DISCHARGE GAY STATE REPRESENTATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Army is moving forward with plans to discharge openly gay
state Rep. Steve May, an Army reservist, under the ``don't ask,
don't tell'' policy, despite glowing performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   Officials had rated the east Phoenix Republican legislator as
``one of the finest young officers'' in the Army and had urged
quick promotions, according to a report obtained by ``The Arizona
Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   May's case has become a lightning rod nationally for opponents
of the Army policy since ``The Republic'' reported in August that
he was under investigation for violating it.
</P>
<P>
   This comes at a time when the policy is under increasing
scrutiny after the beating death of a gay soldier at an Army base
in Kentucky. Last week, Hillary Clinton called ``don't ask, don't
tell'' a failed policy.
</P>
<P>
   And one of President Clinton's staunchest allies in Congress,
Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., blasted Clinton's handling of May's
case in a letter to the president Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Frank also called on Arizona Sen. John McCain, whom May is
supporting in the presidential race, to be supportive of May.
McCain is courting gay Republican voters and expects to raise
$50,000 at fund-raiser held Tuesday night by the Log Cabin
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   May, 28, a lieutenant in the Reserves, who is scheduled to be
interviewed tonight on ``60 Minutes'' (Channel 5, 6 p.m.), argues
that his case proves the policy has been a disaster that forces
highly qualified people out of the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at my evaluations, they say, `Yep, he's a great
officer, but we're going to kick you out anyway.' It's absurd,''
May said. ``This is stupid. This makes no sense. There is no
justification to prevent qualified gay and lesbian Americans from
serving their country in uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army investigation, which May provided to ``The Republic,''
was launched this spring after a soldier in May's Phoenix reserve
unit noticed news stories in which May said that he is gay. The
Army notified May of the report's findings when he reported for
exercises Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   May made the comments Feb. 3 in a legislative hearing in
response to an anti-gay bill. Two days later, he was recalled to
active duty.
</P>
<P>
   The Army concluded May violated the policy by discussing his
sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on evidence from multimedia sources, coupled with your
open admissions, I have determined that you have made statements
that you are a homosexual,'' investigator Patricia Maddox wrote.
</P>
<P>
   May and his attorneys have argued that he made the comments in
his role as a state legislator and not while he was on active duty.
To prevent him from exercising his rights as a legislator amounts
to a violation of his rights, May's attorneys wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even for people who like the policy, it seems to me this is a
clear violation of a basic principle of legislative independence
and the notion that the federal government would in effect be
censoring what a state legislator says in the course of legislative
business. It's outrageous,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   May's attorneys also plan to argue in their response to the
charges that an obscure Defense Department directive allows a
commanding officer to disregard the ``don't ask, don't tell''
policy if discharging the person would not be in the best interests
of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chain of command keeps hiding behind the regulations and
saying they have no choice,'' said Dixon Osburn, co-executive
director of the Service Members Legal Defense Network, a
Washington, D.C.-based group that has defended more than 2,000
service people facing discharge over the policy. ``Losing
Representative May would be detrimental.''
</P>
<P>
   May's evaluations confirm that view. His commanding officer,
Maj. Eileen Norton, concluded in her final report that although May
had openly acknowledged his sexual orientation, he is an excellent
officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my recommendation that each commander in Lt. May's chain
of command . . . take into consideration Lt. May's outstanding
military performance . . . and his unlimited potential to be an
outstanding asset as a future officer and leader in the Army
Reserves,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Other soldiers in May's outfit agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe that this knowledge has in any way been
detrimental to the morale of my troops or the morale of the troops
directly under Lt. May's command,'' Lt. Jeffrey Clark wrote.
</P>
<P>
   May's attorney, Christopher Wolf, has written to Norton and
asked her to terminate the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Norton did not return a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   But the architect of the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy,
Northwestern University sociology Professor Charles Moskos, said
May doesn't have a case.
</P>
<P>
   ``By telling, he should be discharged. . . . A state
representative, of all people, should not be above the law,''
Moskos said.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested the policy shortly after the Clinton administration
became engulfed in controversy surrounding the issue of gays in the
military in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Moskos argues it would violate the rights of heterosexual
service men and women to be housed in ``intimate'' conditions with
gay members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the Army will survive without Steve May,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   May calls the argument ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that homosexuals should be prohibited from military
service because of the fears of a few homophobes is unfounded,'' he
said. ``We don't forbid Blacks from serving even though there are
racists in the Army.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents also point out that with 1,149 gay and lesbian service
personnel being discharged under the policy in 1998, military
readiness is being damaged. May, for example, is trained as a
chemical-weapons defense officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that the policy is dumb. It's not based on reality;
it's based on political perception,'' Frank said. ``This has never
made a lot of sense militarily, particularly when they come to
complain to us that they can't get enough people in the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Frank wrote Clinton and asked him to call off the
investigation of May. He received a reply from a White House
counsel, Beth Nolan, stating that his request had been forwarded to
the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I well remember the political difficulties that arose that led
to this decision, . . '' Frank wrote back to Clinton last week.
``But none of that justifies the brush-off that Ms. Nolan has given
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank also is critical of McCain, whom he said should take up
May's cause: ``This is an issue at home. He knows Steve May well.
Does John McCain think he should be kicked out of the military?
McCain thinks I have been very unfair to him when I've said he's
been very unsympathetic to the question of fair treatment for gay
people. Steve May is a supporter of his. He certainly does not seem
to be reciprocating.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign spokesman did not return calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   May, who donated $1,000 to McCain as part of the fund-raiser
Tuesday night and has been a vocal supporter, said he has not
discussed his situation with McCain. May was inspired to join the
military as a kid after talking with McCain about his experience in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he wants his opinion to be confronted by the
facts of this case,'' May said. ``I think it would be hard for a
man like John McCain not to recognize this is a failed policy.''
</P>
<P>
   May hopes his attorneys can persuade his Army commanders to end
the discharge proceedings. If they don't, the case will progress
and he likely will be discharged in the next four to six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel my sexual orientation should be an issue. I
should be judged on the basis of my performance, . . .'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army evaluates me on the basis of honesty, integrity,
courage, responsibility and service. At the same time they expect
me to live a deceitful life. It's immoral.'' &QL;
