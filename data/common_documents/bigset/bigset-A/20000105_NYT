POTENT ON OFFENSE BUT LAX ON DEFENSE, NETS LOSE TO PACERS  

</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The Nets marched into the sparkling new yet retro
Conseco Fieldhouse minus a starter and shot a season-high 51.9
percent Tuesday night against the surging Indiana Pacers. Their
starting guards, Stephon Marbury and Kerry Kittles, were superb,
combining for 59 points in an energetic display of athleticism and
explosiveness. Johnny Newman scored 16 points to fill in admirably
for the injured Kendall Gill, who watched the game from the locker
room while suffering from a sore neck. And the Nets scored more
points than all but one other Indiana opponent this season.
</P>
<P>
   But Coach Don Casey would have given back much of his club's
potent offensive attack for a hint of ferociousness on defense.
Almost totally ineffective in protecting the basket, the Nets
allowed Indiana to shoot 56.3 percent and score 22 points off
offensive rebounds en route to winning the Pacers' 10th consecutive
game at their new-sprung facility.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers won by 116-111 but the score was deceptive. It was so
close at the end because of a courageous, though ultimately
irrelevant run by the Nets over the final five minutes. With 5:30
left, the Pacers, who never trailed, led by 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't do a good job of defending those guys,'' said
Kittles, who led everyone with a season-high 33 points and 5
steals. ``That's pretty much it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets (12-19) saw their four-game winning streak vanish and
their unsightly road record decline to 2-11. Indiana, the winner of
six consecutive games, improved to 21-9 over all and 13-2 at home.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller led the Pacers with 24 points, despite being
ejected in the third quarter, and Rik Smits, hitting numerous
outside shots, followed with 22. Jalen Rose added 19 points, and
the reserve forward Austin Croshere (16 points) teamed with Dale
Davis to dominate the Nets near the basket.
</P>
<P>
   With Keith Van Horn struggling through one of his worst games of
the season _ 11 points, one rebound, seven turnovers (all in the
first half) _ the Nets were forced to lean hard on Kittles and
Marbury, and both players were up to the task. Kittles drove
fiercely to the basket in earning 15 free-throw attempts (he made
13), and Marbury played a terrific game, despite tendinitis in both
hamstrings. Marbury, who attributed the soreness in his legs to
overly exuberant weightlifting on Sunday, recorded 26 points and 10
assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets fell out of close contention midway through the second
quarter, when Casey subbed for his starting guards. Down by 39-37
when the reserves Elliot Perry and Lucious Harris replaced Marbury
and Kittles with 6:52 left in the half, the Nets trailed by 50-39
three minutes later. Casey went back to his top backcourt but by
then it was too late, and Indiana, full of momentum, built a 63-45
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kittles and Newman rallied the Nets in the third quarter,
pulling them to 78-69, and New Jersey seemed to get a break when
Miller was ejected for mocking referee Ronnie Nunn with 4:12 left
in the quarter. After hitting a beautiful 20-footer following two
head-fakes on Kittles, Miller, thinking he was fouled, shouted at
Nunn, who responded by giving him a technical foul. Miller
derisively applauded Nunn's technical and was hit with a second
technical and automatically ejected.
</P>
<P>
   When Kittles drained the two free throws to make it 80-71, it
seemed to be a new game. But Indiana outscored the Nets 14-6 over
the remainder of the quarter and moved ahead by 108-88 midway
through the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Casey removed Van Horn, Marbury and Jamie Feick, and the unit of
Kittles, Perry, Newman, Scott Burrell, and the rookie Evan
Eschmeyer (seeing his first action of the season), put together a
surprising rally, chopping a 108-91 deficit to 112-107 with 46.9
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, it seemed logical for Casey to reinsert Marbury
and perhaps Van Horn, but he opted against it. On top of that, the
Nets allowed 10 seconds to tick away before fouling Rose, who made
1 of 2 free throws with 36 seconds left. The Nets could not pull
closer, despite Indiana's making just 3 of 6 foul shots in the
final 26 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining why he kept Marbury on the bench, Casey said:
``There was no thinking to it. We just played who hustled and got
us back. We rewarded the team that put us where we were. We thought
they were the best players at that moment on the floor.'' When
asked if he wanted to go into the game during the waning moments,
Marbury, who showed no hint of contempt on the bench, said, ``No
comment.''

HATCHER KICKS BOOT, PROMPTS OPTIMISM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ His steps were tentative, yet Stars defenseman
Derian Hatcher walked through the locker room in his bare feet
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want Hitch to see this,'' Hatcher said jokingly as he
passed Stars coach Ken Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Hatcher walked temporarily without a protective
boot on his right leg a week-and-a-half before the boot is supposed
to come off for good has prompted optimism in a lot of people,
including Hatcher. But it's a cautious optimism laced with
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to expect,'' Hatcher said. ``So far, it's
gotten better every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher sustained a calf laceration on Dec. 17, when a skate cut
one third of the way through his muscle. The original prognosis was
that he would miss six to eight weeks. But unlike a sprained knee,
there isn't a lot of previous cases and six to eight weeks is just
a best guess.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher said he'll be re-evaluated when the boot comes off next
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it as six weeks, and we'll see from there,'' Hatcher
said. ``If they say six weeks \Ror\S another month, then I'll start
to panic.'' SKRUDLAND OUT TWO MONTHS
</P>
<P>
   The chest contusion center Brian Skrudland suffered in Monday's
4-1 victory against Los Angeles will sideline him for two months,
Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   And while Hitchcock said the injury isn't career-ending, it is
chronic.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third time in the past two years that this injury
has caused Skrudland to miss an extended period of time, including
16 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the sorest I've seen him,'' Hitchcock said. ``He was
really in tough shape today.''
</P>
<P>
   Skrudland's injury, along with uncertainty of center Roman
Lyashenko's status for Wednesday's game, prompted the Stars to
recall center Aaron Gavey from their minor-league affiliate
Tuesday. Lyashenko has been battling a sore shoulder, and his
availability won't be known until today.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars also could get winger Grant Marshall (groin) back
Wednesday. He practiced for the second consecutive day without
pain. Center Joe Nieuwendyk also practiced and continues to make
progress. NEW PERSPECTIVE
</P>
<P>
   Not that he wants to make a habit of it, but defenseman Brad
Lukowich said watching instead of playing in Monday's game gave him
a new perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hitchcock benched Lukowich, who had been struggling lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that's what I needed, a little wakeup call,'' Lukowich
said. ``It was good for me to watch that game and see it right up
close.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what did Lukowich learn?
</P>
<P>
   He does the same things as defenseman Richard Matvichuk, but he
doesn't do them with the same authority. Lukowich said he realized
he needed to play stronger in his own end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The could'ves and should'ves have to be stuff that I did it,''
Lukowich said. ``I have to turn those 50-50 plays into 100-percent
plays.'' nn

 &HT;    Sugar Bowl a perfect ending for Bowdon, Seminoles
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ After watching a 28-7 first-half lead turn into a
29-28 deficit in the third quarter, No. 1 Florida State dug deep
into its well of composure Tuesday night and rallied to beat No. 2
Virginia Tech 46-29 in the 2000 Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the Seminoles delivered coach Bobby Bowden his
second national championship and first-ever undefeated season.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 79,280, the largest to ever see a Sugar Bowl in the
Super Dome, thought an upset was brewing after Virginia Tech drove
59 yards to take to take its first lead of the night with 2:13 left
in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But junior quarterback Chris Weinke, like he had done so often
during Florida State's undefeated season, calmly put together an
85-yard drive on 11 plays which ended in a 14-yard touchdown pass
to Ron Dugans. After the successful two-point conversion, Florida
State led 36-29 with 12:59 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Then Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Vick, who had been
nothing less than brilliant all night, finally made a mistake,
fumbling at his own 34-yard line. Florida State turned that error
into a 33-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski to take a 39-29
lead with 10:26 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the knockout punch for Florida State. After a fake
Virginia Tech punt failed, the Seminoles had the ball on Hokies'
43-yard line. On the first play Weinke found All-America wide
receive Peter Warrick open for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick, the star-crossed senior who lost the Heisman Trophy
after his arrest on theft charges, had a final college game that
Florida State fans will never forget. He caught a 64-yard touchdown
pass in the first quarter and also returned a punt 59 yards for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   This was Florida's third national championship game appearance
in four years and its fourth this decade. It was career win 304 for
Bowden, 70.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 28-14 at halftime, Virginia Tech used punts returns of
23 and 56 yards by Ike Charlton to set up a 23-yard field goal by
Shayne Graham and a 29-yard touchdown run by Andre Kendrick.
</P>
<P>
   After a failed two-point conversion attempt, Virginia Tech had
cut the Florida State margin to 28-23 with 5:57 left in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   After an interception by Virginia Tech's Anthony Midget ended
Florida State's next drive, quarterback Michael Vick became a
one-man wrecking crew on the ensuing Hokies drive, scrambling for
carries of 15 and 22 yards before running for a 6-yard touchdown.
After another failed two-point conversion, Virginia Tech had its
first lead of the night, 29-28, as the final quarter began.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech came out of gate fast, as the Hokies took the
opening kickoff and methodically marched down the field, thanks to
a pair of scrambles by Vick of 25 and 9 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a fourth and less than 1 at the Florida State 4-yard
line, Virginia Tech elected to go for the first down instead of the
field goal. Vick was tackled by Derrick Gibson and the ball popped
loose and was kicked into the end zone. Florida State's Corey Simon
outwrestled Andre Kendrick for the ball. Virginia Tech had held the
ball 10 plays and over five mintues.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Florida State grabbed the momentum. First,
quarterback Chris Weinke spotted Peter Warrick in single coverage
and lofted a 64-yard scoring strike with 3:22 left in the first
quarter. Then, only a minute later, Tommy Polley blocked a Virginia
Tech punt and Jeff Chaney picked it up on the 4-yard line and ran
it in for a score.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech responded on its next possession with a 49-yard
touchdown pass from Vick to Andre Davis to make it 14-7, but
Florida State never slowed down.
</P>
<P>
   Facing third-and-3 at the Florida State 37, Weinke hit Ron
Dugans on a slant pattern which he turned into a 63-yard touchdown
catch to make it 21-7 with 13:45 left. Then, Warrick electrified
the Florida State fans when he took a punt on one bounce and
returned it 59 yards for a touchdown to give the Seminoles a 28-7
lead with 11:40 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech tacked on a touchdown with 37 seconds left in the
first half. Vick's 43-yard run gave the Hokies a first down at the
Florida State 19-yard line and Vick later scored from 3 yards out
to bring Virginia Tech to within 28-14 at halftime.

CORKUM CONTRIBUTES FOR KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The center spot was the last position the Kings
needed help when they signed Bob Corkum a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Kings have lost Jozef Stumpel and Ian
Laperriere. Corkum, signed as an unrestricted free agent to add
depth, suddenly was playing major minutes.
</P>
<P>
   He also scored the Kings' first goal in Tuesday's 2-2 tie with
the St. Louis Blues, his first since last May when he played with
the Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a long time,'' said Corkum, who also has played
with Mighty Ducks. ``It's good to get back in there after six
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Corkum scored five minutes into the second period on a pass in
front by defenseman Jaroslav Modry. Dan Bylsma and Steve McKenna, a
late addition when Ziggy Palffy was scratched with back problems,
cleared the area in front of Blues goalie Jamie McLennan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a very hard shot, but it didn't have to be,'' Corkum
said. ``That was a great team effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Corkum had not seen much of the Kings before he signed a
prorated contract of $700,000 for this season with an option of
$800,000 for 2000-01. Even though he walked in during the Kings'
six-game losing streak, Corkum said he did not find a demoralized
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no finger pointing or bickering,'' said Corkum.
``That was a good sign. This team just needed to catch a break.''
</P>
<P>
   Palffy out again: Ziggy Palffy, tied with Bryan Smolinski for
the team lead with 34 points, missed his fourth game in the last
three weeks with back spasms.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, who had a goal and an assist in Thursday's 8-2 victory
over Edmonton, appeared sluggish in Monday's 4-1 loss at Dallas.
His back flared up overnight and told the coaches he could play
after participating in pre-game warmups.
</P>
<P>
   Without Palffy, and with Stumpel already sidelined with a
bruised knee, the Kings' first line consisted of Vladimir
Tsyplakov, Marko Tuomainen and Len Barrie. That group has a
combined 14 goals, the same number as Palffy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to watch what has happened there,'' said Stumpel,
who could not bend his knee before Tuesday's game. ``I wanted to be
out there, but I'm not sure when that will be. It is tough when you
lose someone like Ziggy. He is so important to our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Audette sighting: Donald Audette returned to the lineup after
being bench the past two games. Audette, who opened the season on
the Kings second line, has been replaced there by Luc Robitaille.
He played 14:38 on Tuesday and had two good scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult to sit there and watch,'' Audette said.
``I signed here last December (after a holdout in Buffalo) because
I thought I could help. When they sit you down, you wonder. I know
I've been in a slump (one goal in 12 games, none in the last six)
but it wasn't from not working hard. If I do that I'll get my
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Stumpel and Palffy will be seen today by team
doctor Ronald Kvitne. After back-to-back road games, the Kings will
not practice today. But they will hold a conditioning workout.
Stumpel said he had no idea when he might be back. &QL;

CATTLE RUSTLING SUSPECTED IN LOS ANGELES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- In the car-clogged suburban San Fernando Valley,
an old breed of criminal has made a comeback: the cattle rustler.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, detectives investigated the theft of 60 head of
cattle that thieves on horseback rounded up and stole from the
Hansen Dam Equestrian Center in Lake View Terrace over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a first. This is stuff they do in Wyoming or Montana.
This is a weird deal,'' said LAPD Detective Charles Uribe, who
heads the burglary unit at Foothill Division.
</P>
<P>
   Cattleman and equestrian center operator Eddie Milligan said
that immediately after discovering the theft, he and his ranch
hands found some 37 cattle scattered over the mountainside and the
Big Tujunga Wash.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, however, 20 of the cattle worth $800 apiece were
still missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There ain't no hide or hair of them,'' said Milligan.
</P>
<P>
   He believes his young rodeo cattle were stolen sometime between
9 p.m. Saturday and 4 a.m. Sunday, perhaps while he was watching
``City Slickers,'' a movie about a group of urbanites who spend two
weeks on a western cattle drive.
</P>
<P>
   Milligan was awakened about 6 a.m. Sunday by a ranch worker who
told him that four corrals had been emptied, and it wasn't just a
case of escaped cattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be somebody rustling them,'' he said. ``They
opened up their corrals and drove them out. Some of them had to be
on horseback. They moved them several miles up the canyon.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Milligan sent about a dozen ranch workers on
horseback to search the rugged hills and valleys. And he placed a
$10,000 bounty on information leading to the arrest and conviction
of the rustlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is grand theft and we're not fooling with it. We don't
want it happening again,'' Milligan said.
</P>
<P>
   Milligan, who has operated the ranch for a decade, said the
crooked wranglers were highly organized and obviously experienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever try to load up a bunch of wild cows? It ain't easy,''
Milligan said.
</P>
<P>
   The cattle are used for special events and rodeos and eventually
are marketed to the slaughterhouses, Milligan said.
</P>
<P>
   The cattle each had red tags on their ears and some of them were
branded, detectives said. They are each a couple years old and
weigh about 800 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives planned to show nearby residents photographs of
cattle from the same herd. They also plan to call packinghouses
that might have purchased the bovines.
</P>
<P>
   The LAPD's cargo-theft unit was alerted to watch for cattle on
big rigs traveling within California or state to state, said
Detective George Morales of the Foothill Division.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Julian Almaraz, who took the theft report, said many
people own horses in that area, but cattle are more rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``People all know each other over there. Somebody may say
something about somebody having new livestock,'' Almaraz said.
</P>
<P>
   Almaraz said that before the owner rounded up the 37 cattle,
officers were called out to Foothill Boulevard to herd them off the
roadway about 4 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a traffic hazard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, a few horses get stolen in the more rural sections
of the Northeast Valley, Almaraz said, but the number taken this
time is high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty steers that's a lot of animals to take. They must have
had a trailer on Foothill Boulevard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with information about the stolen cows is asked to
contact Foothill detectives at (818) 834-3115 during business hours
or (818) 756-8861.

TEACHERS PUSH FOR SIMPLE MAJORITY SCHOOL BOND VOTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TERRI HARDY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Contending that voters are ready to spend more to
fix and build campuses, supporters of a March ballot measure that
would make it easier to pass local school bond measures statewide
launched a $10 million advertising campaign Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for Proposition 26, led by the California Teachers
Association and Silicon Valley CEO Reed Hastings, stresses the need
for more classrooms and promises strict monitoring of how the bond
funds are spent.
</P>
<P>
   Not mentioned in the ads is what Proposition 26 does. It changes
the percentage of voters needed to pass a local bond election from
two-thirds to a simple majority, meaning nearly all bond issues
would pass.
</P>
<P>
   Gale Kaufman, the lead political consultant running the
Proposition 26 campaign, said the ads ``made it clear what
(Proposition 26) is really about: investing in our schools and new
and tougher accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure say the ads are a smokescreen masking
the fact that Proposition 26 could mean a substantial hike in
property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a $10 million to $20 million campaign to obfuscate
issues,'' said Jon Coupal, the president of the Howard Jarvis
Taxpayers Association, the organization leading opposition to
Proposition 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be a debate over taxes and how much of a tax
increase the public is willing to spend. We have no doubt that this
will lead to hundreds of millions of dollars in additional tax
liability.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Constitution requires a two-thirds vote for local
school-bond measures because passage means increased property
taxes. The amendment itself will need a two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
   Coupal contends that making it more difficult to pass a local
bond issue protects the homeowner, who is obligated to pay the
increased taxes. Even with that higher standard, he said
communities committed to improving their schools have passed
$12billion in local school bond issues over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   CTA leaders argue that the two-thirds percentage is unfair and
that California is one of the few states requiring more than a
simple majority. Of 771 local school bonds on ballots since 1986,
they say 54percent passed, but 95percent were favored by at least a
simple majority.
</P>
<P>
   Voters historically have been unwilling to change the two-thirds
requirement. In 1993, a similar measure failed by a 70-30 margin,
Coupal said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he admits his opposition campaign is outgunned
financially, with a $2million advertising budget, Coupal said
voters are likely to turn down Proposition 26 ``when they find out
what it's really about.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's advertisements began Monday. The initiative will
appear on the March 7 state ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Last month in a California Field Poll, 43 percent of respondents
favored Proposition 26.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Latner, project manager for the Field Institute,said
that although voters have in the past decade favored bond measures,
Proposition 26 is unlikely to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a measure starts out behind, there is virtually no chance
of its passing,'' Latner said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Proposition 26 say both California's vibrant
economy and the clear need to improve schools have created a
climate in which voters are willing to go against tradition and
change the bond-approval percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hauk, president of the California Business Roundtable, said
voters have a real obligation to prepare students for the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   With a history of problems in the spending of Los Angeles
Unified School District's Proposition BB bond money, supporters of
Proposition 26 were quick to assure those attending a news
conference that there would be better accountability under their
plan. However, the measures they cited, such as independent audits
and a list for voters of projects to be funded with the bonds, were
also part of the Proposition BB plan.
</P>
<P>
   Coupal said claims that there would be greater accountability
for bond money under Proposition 26 are
</P>
<P>
   ``So far we've had $350 billion spent on public education, and
have we gotten the product they promised? I don't think so,''
Coupel said. &QL;

SENSATIONAL VICK PROVED BCS RIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ They were rolling along, whirling and dashing,
dazzling the national television audience _ and, at times, Virginia
Tech _ with their speed and confident swagger.
</P>
<P>
   But that's when America began to learn all about Michael Vick.
</P>
<P>
   He was college football's most prominent freshman this season.
More to the moment, though, Vick was the young quarterback who gave
the wings to the Virginia Tech Hokies' dreams.
</P>
<P>
   As the Florida State Seminoles chased and lunged, watching their
first-half magic slip away, Vick showed the nation that he and the
underdog Hokies were for real.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will _ and some of us have muttered plenty _ about
the meatless meal known as the Bowl Championship Series. A
convincing beef could have been lodged by Nebraska constituents who
had claimed that the Cornhuskers, and not the Big East Hokies,
belonged in this season's national title game.
</P>
<P>
   But as of late in the second quarter Tuesday night, when Vick
threatened to take over and steal this Sugar Bowl, the Huskers'
point was moot. Virginia Tech belonged.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Seminoles righted themselves and rightfully
stamped themselves as the best team in the land, winning going
away, 46-29. But if Florida State is No. 1, clearly the BCS was
properly astute in making the Hokies No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Warrick, the night's hero, we knew. Billed as the most
talented playmaker and discount shopper in the land, the Seminoles
senior rose to the occasion with big-play flourish. His 59-yard
punt return for a touchdown and his 64-yard dash with a scoring
pass, both in the first half, appeared to leave the Hokies
breathless and reeling.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a hint of a crater forming underneath the
fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   The reason was Vick, who, despite finishing third in the Heisman
Trophy balloting, had played his freshman season with little
relative fanfare. When asked to cite the game that put Vick on the
map, his teammates talked about the big season opener against James
Madison.
</P>
<P>
   James Madison? Dolly's husband?
</P>
<P>
   As Virginia Tech ran the Big East table undefeated, Vick passed
for 1,840 yards while completing better than 59 percent of his
passes. He also ran for 585 yards and eight touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But the kid from Newport News, Va., turned as many heads with
his elusive feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is a threat, because he can beat you with either the
run or pass,'' Florida State coach Bobby Bowden had said, nearly
prophetically, ``All year long, it seems he's shown the ability to
escape and make the big play.''
</P>
<P>
   As the second quarter ticked on Tuesday night, the escape was
on.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in large part to Warrick's magic, Florida State made an
early 21-7 lead appear larger than it was. Smugly, some of us
wondered what happened to the ``wish you were here'' postcards we
meant to send the Cornhuskers.
</P>
<P>
   But Vick kept dodging and ducking his way away from the
seemingly inevitable. On a second-and-nine play at his own 38, Vick
dropped to pass, circled toward his right, then tucked in the
football and angled 43 yards. Four plays later, the Hokies were in
the end zone and the Florida State lead had been sliced to 28-14.
</P>
<P>
   It proved to be a hint of the third quarter to come.
</P>
<P>
   When the crystal trophy gets back to Tallahassee, Fla., and the
last of the war chants finishes echoing in the air, Florida State
fans should remember that a rousing football game broke out. Thanks
to Vick, who ended up rushing for 97 yards and passing for 225, the
Hokies stormed back to take the lead.
</P>
<P>
   There was no denying Warrick. A solid case could be argued that
he, not Wisconsin's Ron Dayne, was the true Heisman man. But when
Warrick was suspended for two games because of a much-publicized
department store discount theft, Heisman voters relegated him to an
also-ran.
</P>
<P>
   In the buildup to the Sugar Bowl, Warrick suggested that he had
paid his dues and surely deserved a second chance. Tuesday night,
as the Seminoles struggled to spank down the Hokies' midgame
challenge, Warrick showed the nation what a true crime his Heisman
omission was.
</P>
<P>
   The winners were the Seminoles, but it was a deserved and noble
consolation prize that Virginia Tech walked away with Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Hokies deserved to be here. The BCS, we must humbly admit,
was right. nn

SCORING COMES CHEAPLY FOR WARRICK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Peter Warrick, the Seminoles' consummate consumer,
discovered yet another basement bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick bypassed the local department stores and sought Virginia
Tech's ballyhooed special teams and overmatched secondary for
discount yards Tuesday night at the Lousiana Superdome.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick's three-touchdown performance fueled the No. 1 Seminoles
(12-0) to a second national championship after their 46-29 victory
against the No. 2 Hokies (11-1) in the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick, who this season served a two-game suspension after his
arrest for accepting discounted merchandise from a department
store, ensured the Seminoles' victory with his 43-yard touchdown
reception from quarterback Chris Weinke with 7 minutes, 42 seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick also hurt the Hokies' vaunted special teams by returning
a second-quarter punt 59 yards for his second touchdown. Warrick
fielded the 37-yard punt of Virginia Tech's Jimmy Kibble on one
bounce and eluded the Hokies' Larry Austin before breaking toward
the sideline and racing into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick, who was selected as the game's most valuable player
after scoring a Sugar Bowl record 20 points, finished with six
receptions for 163 yards. That included a 64-yard touchdown
reception from Weinke that gave the Seminoles a 7-0 lead with 3:22
remaining during the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Hokies dominated the Seminoles during that initial quarter,
but their inability to punch the ball across the goal line afforded
Warrick an opportunity to make the evening's first big play.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick beat Hokies cornerback Ike Charlton to the middle of the
field on a post pattern, and the helpless defender received no
support from free safety Nick Sorensen as Warrick raced to his
first touchdown. nn

their reservation and sat down in the bar for a glass of wine or a
cocktail. Friends met there, not at the table. But now, this hardly
happens at all. Restaurant designers are constructing more
beautiful and inviting bars. But if people stop to have a drink, it
is either a fluke of good traffic that they were early, or more
likely, that the host has placed them there in a holding pattern

SEMINOLES WIN NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP WITH VICTORY OVER VIRGINIA
TECH
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ It took 392 games, 34 years and many final-second
heartbreaks. But finally, Bobby Bowden completed an undefeated
season as top-ranked Florida State captured its second national
title of the 1990s with a 46-29 victory over previously undefeated
and second-ranked Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, sure enough, had his 70-year-old heart tested again _
largely by Michael Vick, Virginia Tech's 19-year-old freshman
quarterback. When Vick waltzed through the Seminoles' defense like
a ballroom dancer changing partners _ not once but twice in the
waning moments of the third quarter _ it seemed as if Bowden's
dream of a perfect season may have had to wait till next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a moment of the truth in the late third quarter
where they had the momentum and was fixin' to win the ballgame and
our kids came back,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Warrick, Florida State's spectacular senior receiver, was
selected the game's most valuable player after finishing with six
receptions for 163 yards and 2 touchdowns, and a punt return for
another score. Quarterback Chris Weinke completed 20 of 34 passes
for 329 yards and 4 touchdowns in lifting the Seminoles to a 12-0
record.
</P>
<P>
   Vick accounted for 342 yards of Virginia Tech's offense: 23
rushes for 97 yards and a touchdown, and 15-for-29 passing for 245
yards and another touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Vick was on the verge of wiping out a 14-point halftime deficit
by igniting a 15-point rally. His 15-yard scramble was elegant, his
22-yard streak ethereal. When Andre Kendrick bulled the final 6
yards after the second of the dashes to put Virginia Tech (11-1)
ahead, 29-28, late in the third quarter, even the most hard- and
Hokie-hearted in the crowd of 79,280 had to feel for the old man on
the sideline _ except for another old man, Weinke.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke, a 27-year-old former minor-league baseball player,
proved that he wanted the national title as much as Bowden did.
Three more times, he marched the Seminoles down the field _ first a
methodical, 11-play drive that was capped by a 14-yard touchdown
pass to Ron Dugans _ the receiver's second and Weinke's third of
the night.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when Vick fumbled the ball away at the Hokies' 34 after a
12-yard gain, Weinke got the Seminoles close enough for a 32-yard
field goal by Sebastian Janikowski. Suddenly, the Seminoles were
back ahead, 39-29, and a perfect season once more appeared in
sight. In fact, it was assured when, on the next possession, Weinke
lasered a 33-yard touchdown strike to Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles' victory came in a milestone season for Bowden,
one that included a historic father-son matchup against the Clemson
Tigers coached by his son Tommy.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 32nd meeting between the top two teams in the
Associated Press's Top 25. But it was only the 13th time that the
meeting had occurred in a bowl game. With Florida State's victory,
the top-ranked team improved to 19-11-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made some great plays,'' Virginia Tech Coach Frank Beamer
said. ``We did some things that were uncharacteristic of our team
in the kicking game and letting long plays in the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   Before this No.1-vs.-No.2 matchup in front of the largest crowd
to see a Sugar Bowl at the Superdome, both coaches had said that
special players and special teams would break open the game. In
taking a 28-14 halftime lead, Florida State seemed to have the
better of both. In a seven-minute span, the Seminoles scored 14
points off special teams. Throughout the first half, Warrick was
more spectacular than Vick.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick scored the game's first touchdown on a 64-yard
reception, ripped a punt return 59 yards for another score.
</P>
<P>
   Vick, meanwhile, was valiant and dazzling, but he did not have
enough help from his teammates as he scrambled for 71 first-half
yards and a touchdown in the final seconds of the half. He tossed
for another 93 yards and a score.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bowden and Beamer believed special teams might be the
difference in the game. But neither could have anticipated how
swiftly those units would shape the game.
</P>
<P>
   With 2:14 left in the first quarter and Florida State holding a
7-0 lead, the Seminoles blocked Jimmy Kibble's punt from the
Virginia Tech end zone, and Jeff Chaney returned the ball 6 yards
for the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech, which wasted little time unleashing the array of
offensive weapons it employed to go undefeated and get to this
national-title game, needed a quick response.
</P>
<P>
   The Hokies had wasted an impressive 77-yard drive to open the
game when, on 4th-and-1 at the Florida State 3-yard line, Beamer
decided to go for the first down rather than attempt the field
goal. Instead of powering over the center, Vick tried the option to
the right side, but linebacker Derrick Gibson stripped him of the
ball, which squirted into the end zone. Seminoles nose guard Corey
Simon smothered it for a touchback.
</P>
<P>
   Now, trailing by 14-0, the Hokies needed points; Vick took just
1:44 to get them. With three plays, the Hokies went 80 yards, the
final 49 of them on a rainbow to Andre Davis.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Florida State offense a while to rev up. But Weinke
did so emphatically. He answered Vick's strike with a rapid flick
of his own, this time for 63 yards and a touchdown to Dugans.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Warrick again reminded the Heisman Trophy voters who did
not put him on their ballot after his arrest and guilty plea in a
shopping scam that one bad decision doesn't short-circuit
electrifying talent.
</P>
<P>
   When Kibble sliced a short punt off his left foot, Warrick
gathered the ball in on the Florida State 41-yard line and, with a
burst, zigzagged down the hashmarks between Hokies all the way to
the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give this whole victory to Coach Bowden,'' Warrick said.
``He's been like my father away from home. We came together as a
team for him.''

BOWDEN, SEMINOLES CAP PERFECT SEASON WITH TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 BOWL-LEDE-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Despite all the victories and all the national
championship chances, it's never easy for Bobby Bowden. Seven years
ago, Bowden had to sweat as Nebraska missed a last-play field goal
that gave the Seminoles the 1993 national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Title Number Two came with similar anxiety here Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, 70, watched his Seminoles build leads of 14-0 and 28-7,
then died a thousand deaths as his defense was Vicktimized by a
redshirt freshman quarterback. But Florida State responded like
champions with 18 fourth-quarter points to turn back an inspired
Virginia Tech, 46-29, in the national championship game at the
Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 79,280, a Superdome record for a Sugar Bowl,
witnessed perhaps the most exciting national title game since
Miami's upset of Nebraska in the 1984 Orange Bowl. The teams
combined for a Sugar Bowl record for points in a game where the
momentum swings were plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   They saw Florida State's Peter Warrick, the game's most valuable
player, score a Sugar Bowl-record 20 points. Warrick, a senior wide
receiver, scored on a 64-yard touchdown pass for the Seminoles'
first points, a 59-yard punt return to give them a 28-7
second-quarter lead and a 43-yard juggling pass reception that was
the final piece to this championship puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to be like Tommy and Terry,'' said Bowden of his
first undefeated season, which matches the accomplishments of his
coaching sons. ``There was a moment late in the third quarter. They
had the momentum and they were fixing to win the ballgame. We
stopped them there, got a score, got a score, and we pulled away.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State, playing for its third national title in the past
four years, will go down as the 1999 national champions. But the
Seminoles got an up close-and-personal look at one of 2000's
Heisman Trophy favorites _ Virginia Tech freshman quarterback
Michael Vick. He completed 15 of 29 passes for 225 yards and rushed
23 times for 97 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's victory was built on its reputation for
quick-strike scores. And the Seminoles took the Hokies' reputation
for special teams play and sent it back in their faces.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's two first-half touchdown drives lasted a total
of 2:17. On the first, quarterback Chris Weinke found Warrick on a
64-yard strike that gave the Seminoles a 7-0 lead. That possession
lasted 32 seconds. Then, early in the second quarter, Weinke
connected with Ron Dugans on a 63-yard catch and run that made it
21-7. That scoring drive required 1:45.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles other first-half touchdowns were produced by their
kicking game. First, linebacker Tommy Polley _ who blocked a key
punt in FSU's victory at Florida in November _ blocked Jimmy
Kibble's punt from his own end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's Jeff Chaney got a perfect artificial turf bounce
and returned it six yards for the Seminoles' second touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virginia Tech had been doing a lot of talking and we wanted to
prove we were No. 1,'' Polley said. ``We've got great special
teams. I talked today in our special teams meeting and said I was
going to get one tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick, who touched the ball five times in the first half, gave
FSU a 28-7 lead with a 59-yard punt return. Kibble's punt, his
first since his blocked kick, fluttered. Warrick caught it on one
hop, another fortunate FSU bounce, and switched on his hyper drive.
He wasn't touched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big-time players step up in big-time games,'' Florida State
nose tackle Corey Simon said of Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   As for his team's fourth quarter surge, Simon said, ``We've been
down before. We showed the real character of this team by coming
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech, which prides itself on its special teams play,
found itself redfaced. Warrick's punt return touchdown was the
longest given up in Frank Beamer's 13 seasons. The Hokies lost a
fumble when a fake field goal attempt fizzled. In the fourth
quarter, a fake punt was stopped before Warrick's final touchdown
reception.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 28-7 after Warrick's punt return, Virginia Tech
responded by going 80 yards in seven plays. Vick got 43 yards on a
cross-the-field gallop. He scored on a 3-yard option keeper 37
seconds before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Tech continued with a dominating 15-0 third quarter. Shayne
Graham kicked a 23-yard field goal and Kendrick scored on runs of
29 and six yards. Beamer elected to go for two after the first
touchdown. It failed, which led to another unsuccessful 2-point try
after the second touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles started the fourth quarter by converting a
fourth-and-one at their own 46. Travis Minor gained 16 yards on the
play and FSU got another 15 yards on a personal foul. Two plays
later, Weinke hit a wide-open Dugans for a 13-yard touchdown.
Weinke's 2-point conversion pass to Warrick gave the Seminoles a
36-29 lead they would not lose. nn

NUGGETS DEFEAT MAVERICKS, 98-86
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
DENVER _ Apparently, the Mavericks forgot to place a call to the
Y2K exterminator.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That nasty bug, that constantly ate at the mere foundation of
this franchise during the 1990s, reared its ugly head again Tuesday
night, as the Mavericks opened the new year with a 98-96 loss to
the Denver Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks, who had the worst winning percentage in
professional sports during the '90s, have dropped 11 of their past
13 games.
</P>
<P>
   Two late 3-point field goals by former Mavericks forward George
McCloud helped send the Mavericks back to Dallas with long faces.
McCloud's last of five 3-pointers with 8.8 seconds remaining erased
a 96-95 Mavericks lead and was the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody on the court you don't want to leave open, it's George
McCloud,'' Michael Finley said. ``Even though he missed a couple, I
knew he was bound to hit them, and he hit them in clutch
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who finished with 28 points, eight rebounds and 10
assists, misfired on a 20-footer at the buzzer that could have tied
the score. It was reminiscent of the last-second 3-point field goal
Finley missed that could have won the Dec. 27th game against the
Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another situation where I could have either won the game
or tied it, and I came up short again,'' Finley said. ``I still had
a good look at the basket; I should have knocked it down.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Mavericks (9-22), this game had the same irritating
pattern as many of their others during this disappointing season.
They hustle a lot, play hard, and then manage to find a way to
lose.
</P>
<P>
   This marks the 16th time this season the Mavericks have lost a
game by 10 or fewer points. The trend is wearing a little thin on
the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stinks,'' guard Erick Strickland said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks came out as though they were unaware they're on
the verge of having an ownership change. Dallas played with passion
and a purpose, as it rolled to a 31-28 lead after the first period
and bumped that up to 54-45 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   But in the third period the Nuggets outrebounded the Mavericks
21-5 with Antonio McDyess and Keon Clark each bringing down seven
rebounds. That enabled Denver to take a 76-74 lead into the final
period.
</P>
<P>
   The injury bug bit the Mavericks again, costing them another key
player. Forward Gary Trent jogged off the court late in the third
period, and wound up straining his left groin. Trent missed the
first 22 games of the season with a slightly strained left
hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a quick move and I felt something pop,'' said Trent,
who will be examined by team doctors Wednesday. ``I can't even get
10 games under my belt.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, with 5:46 left in the game and the Mavericks trailing,
83-80, forward Dirk Nowitzki went to the locker room with an upset
stomach. That threw the Mavericks' defensive game for a loop as the
McDyess (6-foot-9) often found himself guarded mostly down the
stretch by Strickland (6-3).
</P>
<P>
   McDyess led the Nuggets with 27 points, 13 rebounds and three
blocks. Nick Van Exel had 17 points and 13 assists, and McCloud
scored 19, and made 5 of 9 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Trent had 20 points before he exited, Nowitzki had 14 and Cedric
Ceballos added 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran out of big players,'' Mavericks coach Don Nelson said.
``It was a totally different game in each half.''

WARRICK TURNS IN SIMPLE, VINTAGE PERFORMANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ As it turned out, Florida State's strategy to get
the ball to Peter Warrick involved no trickery. The Seminoles just
let their talented senior wide receiver catch passes and return
punts in a simple, understated manner.
</P>
<P>
   Simple and understated, but for the results.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick scored two first-half touchdowns for Florida State and a
clinching fourth-quarter score to help lead the Seminoles to
victory Tuesday night in the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   On the first TD, Warrick was one of two wide receivers lined up
to the right. He buzzed past Virginia Tech cornerback Anthony
Midget. Hokies safety Nick Sorenson had cheated up near the line of
scrimmage and gave no help to Midget. Warrick caught Chris Weinke's
pass in stride for a 64-yard touchdown and 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the second quarter with the Seminoles leading 21-7,
Warrick fielded a one-bounce punt and made Virginia Tech's Larry
Austin disappear before racing untouched 59 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick also got free for a two-point conversion reception that
gave Florida State a 36-29 lead with 12:59 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick then sealed the outcome with 43-yard TD reception,
beating one-on-one coverage by Tech's Ron Yellwhitaker. Warrick's
20 points set a Sugar Bowl scoring record. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ The crowd of 79,280 was a record for a Sugar Bowl held in the
Superdome.
</P>
<P>
   _ Virginia Tech wide receiver Ricky Hall, who suffered a broken
bone in his foot during practices here, did not start. He was
replaced in the lineup by Emmett Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shyrone Stith, Virginia Tech's leading rusher, suffered a knee
injury on a 34-yard kickoff return early in the second quarter. He
returned and sprained his left ankle later in the quarter. Florida
State linebacker Tommy Polley sprained his left knee in the second
quarter. He did not return. Florida State defensive end Roland
Seymour suffered a sprained right knee in the third quarter and did
not return.
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida State's blocked punt for a touchdown was the first
such play in the Sugar Bowl since Syracuse blocked a punt for a TD
in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prior to Peter Warrick's 59-yard punt return for a touchdown,
the last time a punt was returned for a TD in the Sugar Bowl was
Virginia Tech's Bryan Still (60 yards) against Texas in the 1995
Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   _ Analyst Lee Corso was a perfect 11-0 this season when
predicting the winner during ESPN's ``College GameDay'' when the
show was at a game site. Tuesday night during the pregame show,
Corso picked Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   _ Robert Moderhak of Holmes Beach, Fla., made one of the biggest
plays at the Sugar Bowl. He picked up $500,000 with a little help
from former NFL quarterback Joe Theismann. Moderhak had a chance to
win $2 million during a halftime contest that involved throwing a
football through a 2-by-2 opening. But Theismann connected on only
one of four passes, good for $50,000. Moderhak then stepped up and
added a zero to that figure by throwing the football through the
square from 15 yards.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sugar Bowl officials estimated the crowd outside the Superdome
before kickoff at 120,000. There were about 73,000 seats for the
game, leaving ticket-sellers with a brisk business. Tickets with a
face value of $85 were selling for as much as $600, according to
some buyers outside the Superdome. Tickets in prime locations were
reportedly selling for as much as $1,500 earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Being the underdog at the Sugar Bowl has paid off in the past
when No. 1 and No. 2 have squared off. In the first three such
meetings, No. 2 won. No. 2 Alabama beat No. 1 Penn State, 14-7, in
1979; No. 2 Penn State beat No. 1 Georgia, 27-23, in 1983; and No.
2 Alabama beat No. 1 Miami, 34-13, in 1993. Florida was No. 3 when
it beat No. 1 Florida State 52-20 for the national title in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   _ Winning paid off for both coaches. Virginia Tech's Frank
Beamer received three month's salary, about $45,000, for making it
to the game. He would have received another $100,000 for a victory.
Florida State coach Bobby Bowden got $75,000, win or lose. nn

SPORTS COLUMN: FLASHY WARRICK SCORES 20 POINTS OF LIGHTD 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Ever since that fateful afternoon last September
when he soiled a stellar reputation, Peter Warrick has tried to
live down the humiliation of a felony count of grand theft that was
reduced to a misdemeanor count. Warrick became the latest poster
boy for the evils of big-time college sports and triggered debates
that were so intense that the deeds that elevated him to prominence
were obliterated.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick was rightly punished by the law but wrongly ostracized
by Heisman Trophy voters, who used their ballots to punish Warrick,
clearly one of the top three players in the nation. He was then
shunned by the Biletnikoff award voters despite being the country's
best wide receiver by a landslide. Warrick was stripped before he
was honored.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, in the frenzied atmosphere of the Superdome,
Warrick finally let his feet and hands do the talking.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half Warrick accounted for 159 yards of offense and
2 touchdowns. He sliced up the Hokie secondary with three catches
and created holes even when he was the decoy. Just as Virginia Tech
was settling into an emotional groove in the first quarter, Warrick
burst the Hokies' bubble on a 64-yard touchdown pass from Chris
Weinke, the 27-year-old quarterback, to give Florida State a 7-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic touchdown confirmed the Hokies' worst fears: they
had no answer for the Heisman candidate that never was. When
Warrick walked out to take a second-quarter punt, you almost knew
he was going to explode. He took the punt on a hop, raced down the
right sideline past everything and everyone for a 59-yard touchdown
and a 28-7 Seminole lead. Warrick would go on to score 20 points
for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bounced back; that's the mark of a man _ to admit to a
mistake and move on,'' he said. ``I made a mistake, and I'll tell
this: I'll never make it again. I'm ready to focus on the next
level.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that kept Virginia Tech close was the fact that
the Hokies had a super player of their own, Michael Vick, the
freshman quarterback. From the third play of the opening drive when
Vick ran for 25 yards on 2nd-and-16, Florida State realized that
Tech had a weapon nearly as potent as its own. Vick accounted for
both of Tech's touchdowns _ a 49-yard pass to Andre Davis in the
first quarter and a three-yard run in the second.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd way the controversy surrounding Warrick _ his crime,
the punishment and the fact that he graduated _ contributed to make
the national championship a great college football game. Warrick's
poor judgment got him into a national mess, and his poor judgment
on Tuesday night nearly cost his team the title.
</P>
<P>
   With Florida State leading, 28-23, in the third quarter, Warrick
picked up a personal foul when he shot an unnecessary forearm at
Ronyell Whitaker, the Hokies' defensive back, at the end of the
play. Why? He made the catch, tried to maneuver past Whitaker, but
couldn't get by _ end of story. Instead, Warrick gave way to ego
and was penalized. On the next play, Weinke was intercepted trying
to go long to Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 19-year-old Vick was making all of the right
moves and all of the great decisions. After the interception, Vick
gained 15 yards on one play, was sacked and then came back with a
22-yard run that set up Virginia Tech's go-ahead touchdown in the
third quarter. But Warrick atoned. After his team scored, Warrick
caught the 2-point conversion, and Florida State led, 36-29.
Moments later, Vick made his only mistake of the game. He fumbled
after a 12-yard gain with 11 minutes 58 seconds to play. By the end
of the game, fans were chanting, ``Peter Warrick.'' With 7:42
remaining, Warrick scored on a 43-yard touchdown pass to seal Coach
Bobby Bowden's first undefeated season.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden dismissed the notion that contemporary athletes were
doing more bad things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not bad guys who are bad all the time,'' he said. ``It's
your good guys who come from great families. They go out and do
something wrong. The truth is the kids haven't changed. The
difference is that everybody knows about it now.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach's solution: ``If you don't want everybody to know
about it, don't be No. 1, be No. 50.''
</P>
<P>
   The arc of change has been dramatic for Bowden, who was born in
Birmingham, Ala., in 1929. He told of an incident one spring in the
late 1940s when he and friends sneaked onto a local golf course
early in the morning. ``One day there was a young black kid on the
course _ he was a caddie. We invited him to play. I looked up the
fairway and here comes this truck bearing down on us. I thought,
`Uh-oh, we've been caught, playing golf not paying money. This guy
jumps out with a .38, goes over to the black kid and puts the gun
to his forehead. `What are you doing playing golf out here?' They
berated him, then they put him in the car; that's the last I saw of
him. That's the first time I really understood what this
segregation was about.''
</P>
<P>
   Time heals all wounds; time allows meaning to unfold. And if you
recruit well, and you're lucky, time might even bring forth a
national championship or two.

Previewing Big 12 women's basketball 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
Iowa State coach Bill Fennelly might not regard his team's
thrashing of Texas Tech on Sunday as a statement, but there's no
doubt that at least the women's Big 12 preseason favorites turned
in a strong position paper. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it was a statement or not,'' Fennelly said
Tuesday. ``But the kids were really ready to play. There was a
great crowd, everything pointed to the start of conference play and
it was one of those games where we were playing someone who had
beaten us pretty good last year, they were the defending champions,
they were nationally ranked and we really played well _ especially
on defense.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones' 62-37 victory against Tech avenged last season's
71-47 loss in Lubbock. They held Tech to its second-lowest point
total ever in handing the Lady Raiders' only their ninth loss in
three seasons of Big 12 competition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State moved up to No. 10 in The Associated Press rankings
and plays at fast-improving Missouri (10-1) Wednesday before
traveling to Colorado (5-6) on Saturday. Texas A&AMP;M plays at Baylor
and Texas opens at home against Kansas State. The first full slate
of conference play is scheduled for Saturday with two other key
games _ Texas at Nebraska and Tech at Oklahoma. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fennelly hasn't yet cleared room in the trophy case. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no,'' he said. ``I told my kids they were in first place
for one day, so enjoy it while they were there.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones will have to shift gears on the fly against
Missouri, a team that presses and loves to play transition
basketball. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They play a style we don't see much in the Big 12 _ that 40
minutes of hell stuff,'' Fennelly said. ``It's such a long haul
when you play 16 \Rconference\S games. And like I've said over and
over again, the teams in this conference are so even. We're going
to see some clashing styles and there are going to be a lot of
interesting games. It's going to be a real battle to see who comes
out of it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An update on the Big 12 women's teams, in order of how they were
picked in the preseason coaches' poll: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Iowa State &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Record: 9-2 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   National ranking: No. 10 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What you need to know: Coach Bill Fennelly was worried about how
the Cyclones would bear up under the pressure of being the
conference favorite. That might yet be a concern, but Sunday's
62-37 thrashing of two-time defending champion Texas Tech was
certainly a statement of some kind. &QL; 
Kansas &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Record: 9-3. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   National ranking: No. 23 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What you need to know: The Jayhawks have stumbled twice
(Creighton on the road, Arkansas State at home) and lost to ranked
Illinois in Chicago. They have given no reason to believe they are
any better or any worse than picked, but did not have a
breakthrough December. Still an NCAA Tournament participant,
however. &QL; 
Nebraska &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Record: 6-5 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   National ranking: None &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What you need to know: Nebraska has been the most disappointing
team in nonconference play. Casey Leonhardt (6-foot-5) has given
the 'Huskers needed rebounding power. She and center Charlie Rogers
combine to average 18 rebounds a game and Nicole Kubik can still
score. But this team apparently lacks winning chemistry and must
find it quickly. The Cornhuskers open with Texas, at Kansas and at
Iowa State. &QL; 
Texas &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Record: 8-4. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   National ranking: None &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What you need to know: The Longhorns' 7-3 start was their best
in three seasons and they have a quality victory against Illinois,
a winnable overtime loss at UCLA, a close loss at Rutgers and were
blown out at Tennessee. They need injured sophomore forward Tracy
Cook back in the lineup and more production from the post. But
they've played the Big 12's best nonconference schedule, were
ranked for three weeks and will be a tough team to beat at home. &QL; 
Texas Tech &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Record: 10-1 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   National ranking: No. 13 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What you need to know: The Lady Raiders might be the best
defensive team in the conference, as good as any from an athletic
standpoint and they can run with the best. They have impressive
victories against No. 14 Louisiana State and at Southern California
in overtime. But they have shortcomings in their perimeter shooting
game and that showed big-time against Iowa State. Still a tough
opponent and likely NCAA participant. &QL; 
Oklahoma &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Record: 9-3. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   National ranking: None &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What you need to know: The Sooners are off to their best start
in coach Sherri Coale's four seasons. They catch Tech at home
Saturday in the conference opener and a victory would serve notice
that OU is indeed ready to move into contention for a Big 12
tournament seed. &QL; 
Kansas State &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Record: 7-6. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   National ranking: None &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What you need to know: The Wildcats have just pulled out of a
four-game losing streak and don't at this juncture appear to be a
team capable of moving up. &QL; 
Colorado &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Record: 5-6 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   National ranking: None &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What you need to know: A troubled program, Colorado lost three
players who transferred and lost its best player (Linda Lappe) to a
knee injury early this season. The Buffs recently upset Illinois,
but don't appear to measure up to a conference-beginning stretch of
Iowa State, at Tech and at Kansas. &QL; 
Missouri &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Record: 10-1. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   National ranking: None &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What you need to know: Coach Cindy Stein has been awarded a
contract extension. The Tigers are one of the conference's
most-improved programs and appear capable of contending for a seed
in the Big 12 tournament. Their pressing style will give headaches
to a lot of teams. &QL; 
Oklahoma State &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Record: 8-4. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   National ranking: None &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What you need to know: Coach Dick Halterman's intent was to put
more points on the board this season and the Cowgirls have done
that. Jennifer Crow (21.5) and newcomer Tari Cummings (17.0) rank
in the top five in conference scoring for a team averaging 75.5
points, a dozen more than last season. &QL; 
Baylor &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Record: 5-5. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   National ranking: None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What you need to know: Coach Sonja Hogg is reloading and the
Bears have shown growing pains by lack of consistency after
consecutive Women's National Invitation Tournament seasons. This is
a program that might indeed fall in the standings, but has some
good young players. &QL; 
Texas A&AMP;M &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Record: 8-2. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   National ranking: None &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What you need to know: The Aggies are making a move in coach
Peggy Gillom's second season. Transfer forward Jaynetta Saunders
has lived up to her pick as the conference's top newcomer and
guards Brandy Jones and Tina Jones (not related) have also helped
take pressure off of Prissy Sharpe. This team will not finish in
its predicted last-place slot. &QL;

MAVS' OWNER-TO-BE READY TO LIVE FAN'S FANTASY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Cuban isn't holding back.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet tycoon banked more than $1 billion last year,
bought a huge mansion in Dallas and went online to buy a $40
million jet.
</P>
<P>
   The icing on the cake came Monday, when the lifelong sports fan
agreed to pay up to $280 million to buy the Dallas Mavericks, the
long-suffering professional basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am gonna have a blast,'' Cuban said Tuesday, stretching
every word as if to savor it. ``Life is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban, by his estimation, is living a sports fan's fantasy. At
the age of 41, he is ready to take over the toy shop he has always
coveted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody dreams about what they'd do if they won the
lottery,'' Cuban said. ``Well, this is it for me, owning a team I
really care about.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban, who said the purchase will prove to be a good investment,
said he isn't concerned about financial returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's winning and then there's everything else,'' he said.
``I'll do everything in my power _ financially and with sweat
equity _ to make this team a champion. I won't accept anything
less.''
</P>
<P>
   Look for Cuban to move at Internet speed.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes to have control of the Mavericks before March,
unless the National Basketball Association stretches out the
process. He declined to discuss specific plans for players and
coaches, but seemed primed for action.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could sign Grant Hill, Tim Duncan, Eddie Jones and Brian
Grant all at once, I'd write the check,'' he said, referring to the
top players who could become free agents at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'm even allowed to say that,'' he added,
alluding to league rules that bar owners from tampering with
players under contract. ``But I'm still not official yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban has been following the Mavericks since he moved to Dallas
in the early 1980s, and said he fondly recalls the days when he was
part of the Reunion Rowdies, the boisterous fans who packed Reunion
Arena to cheer on what was then a model expansion franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Although an avid fan, Cuban said he missed the '80s playoff runs
because he couldn't afford the higher ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was living with six guys in a three-bedroom apartment in the
Village,'' he said, referring to the singles area in east Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   That was a long time _ and many millions of dollars _ ago.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban made his first fortune in 1990, when he sold his
7-year-old computer systems business, MicroSolutions, to CompuServe
for $5 million. Five years later, he co-founded what became
Broadcast.com, the leader in providing audio feeds over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban and Todd Wagner, both graduates of Indiana University,
wanted a way to follow the Hoosiers basketball team without leaving
Dallas. They hit upon the idea of ``streaming'' the radio
broadcasts over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That simple idea helped usher in the Internet age by providing
audio and video to accompany text files. Broadcast.com's initial
public offering in July 1998 was the most successful in history at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   By early '98, the company was climbing higher and Yahoo acquired
it for stock valued at about $5.7 billion. Cuban's net worth,
estimated at $1.2 billion, vaulted him to the 199th spot on
``Forbes'' magazine's list of richest Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's tapping some of that wealth, acquiring the Dallas
mansion, the Gulfstream V plane and the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, he has become something of a celebrity. Hours
after the basketball deal was reported Tuesday, TV crews were
flocking to interview Cuban at his office in Deep Ellum, near
downtown Dallas, and fans around the world were sending him hopeful
e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   He served notice Tuesday that he will become deeply involved in
the basketball organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't be out there trying to play point guard, but I'll be
doing all the things I can to contribute,'' he said. ``You'll find
me making sales calls, introducing the team to the community, being
the biggest cheerleader at the games and answering e-mails.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross Perot Jr., the current majority owner of the Mavericks, has
been far less involved with the team. Perot always said he wanted
to use the team as a catalyst for real estate development.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Zaccanelli, a minority owner of the Mavericks, said he
appreciates Cuban's enthusiasm, but has a warning: Keep your
emotion in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a fan, you have a right to get emotional about the team,''
Zaccanelli said. ``But as an owner, you have to take out the
emotion and manage the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaccanelli, who said he played basketball in college, briefly
ran the Mavericks for Perot. His tenure was widely ridiculed,
however, and the media blasted him for engineering the trade of
star guard Jason Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only business where your results are printed every
day,'' Zaccanelli said. ``There's no place to run and hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hicks, who owns the Texas Rangers baseball team and Dallas
Stars hockey club, helped arrange the meeting four months ago
between Perot's group and Cuban, which led to the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks was an early investor in Broadcast.com. ``I made a lot of
money investing in Mark,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban is paying a rich price for the Mavericks, even higher than
Hicks paid for the Rangers two years ago. But Hicks said he
believes that Cuban can make it work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark is uniquely positioned to see how the Internet will be
the next wave to create value in sports franchises,'' Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Cuban's newfound fame as a sports owner will
change his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a two-edged sword,'' Hicks said. ``Valets will park your
car a lot closer to the door, but you lose your privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said he is eager to embrace fans and bring them into the
Mavericks' world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that Mavs' fans have not been communicated with at
all,'' Cuban said. ``That's one of the first things that will
change. People will know what's going on _ and why.'' nn

INJURIES, PARITY INCREASE FOCUS ON NFL PASSERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If further evidence is required on the degree of
loopiness in the NFL this season, take this short quiz:
</P>
<P>
   Can you name the six quarterbacks who were last season's Pro
Bowl picks, either by vote or injury replacement?
</P>
<P>
   If you said John Elway, Chris Chandler, Randall Cunningham,
Vinny Testaverde, Steve Young and Doug Flutie, you must have had a
ticket to the Old Fogeys Ball _ the NFL playoffs last year. Where
was Johnny Unitas?
</P>
<P>
   None of those guys are starting in the playoffs this season.
</P>
<P>
   Elway retired, Chandler's Atlanta Falcons bombed, Testaverde and
Young were injured, and Cunningham and Flutie, the only two whose
teams are in the playoffs, have been benched.
</P>
<P>
   The shutout from last year becomes even more pronounced when
it's considered who did make the playoffs: Nine of the remaining 12
quarterbacks are either unproven or former busts.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the NFC's seven highest-rated passers are in the
playoffs: Kurt Warner of St. Louis, Jeff George of Minnesota, Brad
Johnson of Washington, Charlie Batch of Detroit (now out with a
broken thumb) and Troy Aikman of Dallas. The other NFC QB is Shaun
King, a rookie replacement for Trent Dilfer, the bust among busts.
</P>
<P>
   In the AFC playoffs, Seattle's Jon Kitna is joined by fellow
youngsters Peyton Manning of Indianapolis, Steve McNair of
Tennessee and Rob Johnson of Buffalo. Jacksonville's Mark Brunell
is the lone prime-time guy; Miami's Dan Marino is on a fast fade
toward retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The flush is startling. Only Aikman and Marino remain from the
NFL's landed gentry. Though, from a fan's point of view, there's
much delight in all the fresh faces, such volatility in the game's
most important position is very helpful in grinding up coaches and
franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Kordell Stewart's collapse in Pittsburgh might help doom coach
Bill Cowher. Poor seasons from Brett Favre in Green Bay and Drew
Bledsoe in New England were factors in the firing of their head
coaches this week, both of whom had the audacity to finish 8-8 _
the same record over which Dennis Erickson was fired in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   That was also the final mark of Bill Parcells, whose Jets won
seven of their last nine behind a quarterback named Ray Lucas,
formerly a head-hunter on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' case is illuminating because Parcells landed on Lucas
late, and only after trying and failing to replace Testaverde with
veteran Rick Mirer, a bust in Seattle, Chicago and Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   It's not likely that the quarterback vulnerability hastened
Parcells' retirement announcement this week. But it did nothing to
improve his health, which was the main reason the 58-year-old is
getting out of coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Before their game Sunday, Parcells chatted extensively with
Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren, who was tipped by Tuna that this
would be his last game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill told me before the game that he thought this was his best
team _ prior to Vinny getting hurt _ ever, anywhere,'' Holmgren
said Monday. ``He said that's how fragile this business is. You
lose a player and that cost them.''
</P>
<P>
   Though much has been written about the NFL era of liberal free
agency and the salary cap that has allowed teams such as
Indianapolis and St. Louis to complete single-season turnarounds
while draining the powerhouses of quality talent, the impact on
quarterbacks is less well chronicled.
</P>
<P>
   It seems plain that good quarterbacks have become even more
valuable because what surrounds them in the offense is subject to
so much personnel change. Yet the steady turnover is damaging to
quarterbacks because of the lack of familiarity with teammates and
schemes.
</P>
<P>
   The point hits home this week in Seattle, where the NFL's
longest postseason drought has ended, however ingloriously. The
novelty brings up the Seahawks' historic QB bankruptcy that is the
chief on-field reason for the long void.
</P>
<P>
   Since Dave Krieg last took the Seahawks to the playoffs in 1988,
they have tried Mirer, Kelly Stouffer, Dan McGwire, Warren Moon,
John Friesz, Jeff Kemp and Stan Gelbaugh, as well as several snaps
for a couple of the Spice Girls.
</P>
<P>
   As a partial consequence, the Seahawks have more playoff games
(seven) than only New Orleans and Tampa Bay (excluding recent
expansion teams).
</P>
<P>
   There is more to playoff success than the QB spot, but as
Parcells suggested, it is often the difference-maker. Holmgren
seconded the notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt that if your quarterback was hot, if injuries
didn't hit key people, you have as good a chance as anybody in the
playoffs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Easy for him to say. The only quarterbacks he's taken to the
playoffs have been Favre and Joe Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has to try to get hot with Kitna, starting his first
playoff game after a six-week slide that included almost no running
game and a profound inability to connect with the team's best
offensive player, Joey Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is, not many teams are better off. The bad news
is, the situation eats NFL coaches for breakfast, with reservations
for lunch and dinner.

SONICS BOUNCE ROCKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Forget the monkey. The Sonics got Gary Payton off
their back.
</P>
<P>
   Unusually quiet in public throughout the team's recent
struggles, Payton privately implored teammates to avoid a dispatch
to his rookie season. It was the 1990-91 campaign when Payton last
played on a team that lost six straight games.
</P>
<P>
   And that depressing slide remains a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics followed Payton's brashness on the floor and ended a
five-game losing streak by beating up the Houston Rockets, 103-96,
Tuesday night in Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to speak my peace,'' Payton said about his role during
the team's recent five-day break in the schedule. ``Hopefully, it
stays with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton was speaking of victories, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics won for the first time since beating Chicago on Dec.
20. All five losses were against teams with winning records. In
winning their first game of the millennium, the Sonics took
advantage of a depleted, young Rockets team that is without its two
future Hall of Famers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Sonics were back to having fun and flourishing in the
brand of basketball that had made them successful.
</P>
<P>
   They forced turnovers, converted easy baskets and rebounded with
intensity. What had been a stagnant offense throughout the skid ran
smoothly in the fourth quarter when the Sonics pulled away.
</P>
<P>
   Payton scored 12 of his game-high 29 points in the fourth. At
one point, Payton converted four straight layups and hit the
Rockets with an 8-0 run that provided the Sonics with a comfortable
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were leading 89-87 with 5:56 left in the game when
Payton took over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept running the same play,'' Payton said. ``Coach
(Westphal) told me to keep running the play and give him something
special. So I got four layups.''
</P>
<P>
   Vin Baker eventually gave the Sonics their largest lead _ 103-92
_ when his 16-foot jumper fell with 28.8 seconds left. The Sonics
went into the final period ahead 82-76 but wore down the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the few times this season when the Sonics held a
distinct advantage inside. Houston's Kelvin Cato and Hakeem
Olajuwon were unavailable because of injuries, and Charles Barkley
has retired.
</P>
<P>
   That allowed the Sonics to outscore the Rockets 54-30 in the
paint. Baker scored 19 points and finished with a season-high 18
rebounds _ just three short of a career high.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you feel like you're getting off a schneid and when you
play like you can play, the game is easier and the game is more
fun,'' Baker said, adding ``our defense in the second half allowed
me to get a lot of boards. (The Rockets) were taking a lot of bad
shots and I was getting deep (post) position.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton and Baker kept the Sonics in command most of the game.
</P>
<P>
   After briefly falling behind 26-21, the Sonics led 54-53 at
halftime. They trailed 68-64 with 6:33 left in the third. But the
Sonics' defense kept the Rockets shooting jump shots.
</P>
<P>
   Houston started out hot but finished the game shooting 41
percent, and the Sonics forced 19 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really had to play some defense in the second half,''
Westphal said. ``We brought their shooting percentage way down and
got some turnovers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't easy. They have a lot of quickness and good
one-on-one players. Rudy (Tomjanovich) is really using what he has.
Obviously, he's shorthanded right now. But they're really playing
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets have adopted a fast-paced style of play since their
dominant post players, Olajuwon and Barkley, were sidelined by
injury. Olajuwon went on the injured list Nov. 29 after hernia
surgery. Barkley retired last month after rupturing a tendon in his
left leg.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their lack of bulk down low, the Rockets have counted
on their speed and athleticism to outrun teams.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Sonics play the same way with a more experienced
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really needed this win for more reasons than one,'' said
center Horace Grant, who finished with 18 points and seven
rebounds. ``Especially, going into San Antonio. ... We needed to
build some momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   As good as their victory was Tuesday night, the Sonics realize
they could start another dismal streak tonight when they play at
San Antonio before hosting the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that we came in here and got a win. It would have
been bad had we lost,'' Payton said. ``But we haven't proven we can
beat the tough teams yet. ... We have to play hard and stay
together as a team and hope a good run will come our way.''

   ST. LOUIS _ It could have been a perfect night, but the Kings
know better than to wish for that.
</P>
<P>
   There was Luc Robitaille scoring the potential winning goal
Tuesday in his 1,000th game in the National Hockey League. It came
in the first minute of the third period and gave the Kings a chance
to beat the St. Louis Blues, one of the elite teams in the Western
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the Kings had to settle for a 2-2 tie in front of 16,302
at the Kiel Center when the Blues scored with less than five
minutes to play in regulation. For a team with just one victory in
its last eight games, a tie is better than a loss. But the Kings
knew they should have had more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great thrill to play in this game,'' said Robitaille,
who scored his 16th of the season and the 533rd of his career. ``No
one even knew if I was going to play one game in this league. After
all that's happened it was nice to get a point. But it would have
been better to get two.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings lost that chance at the 15:06 mark of the third period
when Mike Eastwood took a Jeff Finley pass from behind the Kings
net and poked the puck past goaltender Stephane Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues caught a break on the play when winger Tyson Nash
collided with Fiset and knocked off his goalie mask. In the
confusion, Eastwood scored, and suddenly Robitaille's goal did not
seem so momentous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody wanted this one for Luc,'' coach Andy Murray
said. ``There isn't a harder working guy on this team. But I
thought we played well tonight. There were a couple spots where we
could have improved. But I saw good things, things we can build
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the night, the Kings set the tone between teams that
were playing the second of back-to-back games. The Blues won in New
York on Monday night to make them 6-2-2 in their last 10. But
Tuesday, they lost captain Chris Pronger in the second period
Tuesday when he took a Rob Blake slap shot off his right foot.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings lost 4-1 in Dallas the night before and learned before
Tuesday's game that Ziggy Palffy, tied with Bryan Smolinski for the
club lead in scoring (34 points), would miss the game with
recurring stiffness in his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   Without Pronger, the Blues lost probably their best defenseman,
but they responded by limiting the Kings to just four shots in the
third period and two in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Without Palffy, the Kings had to improvise their lines. Again.
Already missing Jozef Stumpel, who injured his knee Monday in
Dallas, the first unit consisted of Len Barrie, Vladimir Tsyplakov
and Marko Tuomainen.
</P>
<P>
   They also had to pull healthy scratch Steve McKenna out of the
stands when they learned just before game time that Palffy couldn't
play. The 6-foot 7 McKenna will never be confused with Palffy, but
he cleared enough room in the Blues end to let newcomer Bob Corkum
tie the game early in the second period with his first goal as a
King.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings also were gritty on defense, ending the scoring string
of Blues' center Pierre Turgeon at 15 games. Turgeon had a goal and
an assist in Monday's victory, which tied him with Pittsburgh's
Jaromir Jagr for the longest streak this season.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Kings return home for three games, including the Blues
on Jan. 13. They open the homestand on Thursday against the Florida
Panthers, who are running away with the Southeast Division.
</P>
<P>
   And next Monday, before their game with the Ottawa Senators, the
Kings will honor Robitaille.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted this one for him,'' said Stumpel, whose knee will be
examined today. ``This was his kind of game. Tough.''

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Gary Payton had seen enough. He had thrown everything at Steve
Francis shy of the kiss he had planted on Francis' cheek to welcome
him to the mistreatment he planned for the rookie back during a
preseason game in October.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Seattle point guard was in Francis' face and in his ear
again Tuesday night. But Francis would not back down. Payton kept
coming at him, and Francis kept answering. Midway through the
fourth quarter, Francis and Payton had played to a spectacular draw
and the Rockets were within two points.
</P>
<P>
   But with that, Payton took over and scored the next eight points
as the SuperSonics rushed to a 10-point lead and swept to a 103-96
victory at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen it a couple times in the past couple weeks with
superstar players getting into situations, and they deliver,''
Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``I was just talking about
that before the game. You can have ups and downs during the game.
But when you need it, the great players come through.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton did not score again after his 8-0 run, but by then, with
3:39 remaining, the Sonics didn't need much more.
</P>
<P>
   Payton led Seattle with 29 points and 10 assists, although he
had to take 28 shots and make 12 to get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm frustrated because my man had 29 points,'' Francis said.
``He made a lot of big shots. I was putting my hand on the ball a
lot, and he still put the ball in the basket. He hit some tough,
big shots with hands in his face. There's not much you can do about
that if a guy's making runners with two 6-11 guys' hands in his
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis scored 27 points to match his career high, recorded
against Payton in Seattle on Nov. 20, and had seven assists. He
made nine of 14 shots.
</P>
<P>
   With center Kelvin Cato out with a sprained wrist, the Rockets
were short-handed. Matt Bullard, moved into the starting lineup to
replace Cato, scored the Rockets' first 12 points and finished with
a season-high 20.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Rogers, weakened by the flu, moved to center. Although
Rogers fought for a season-high 14 rebounds, he made only five of
15 shots and scored 11 points. Cuttino Mobley made only two of 15
shots and finished with six points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the whole game they tried to (double-team Francis
to force him to give up the ball),'' Tomjanovich said. ``He's
really coming along so well. He's made some great passes out of
double teams.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the exception of Bullard's rapid start and Bryce Drew's
4-of-6 shooting off the bench, the Rockets were unable to burn the
Sonics and take advantage of the attention they paid Francis.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Francis, the Rockets made only 25 of 68 shots from
the field and were 3-of-17 in the fourth quarter. The Rockets
missed 11 layups and were outscored 54-30 in the paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed a lot of easy shots,'' Francis said. ``We had a lot
of open shots, and we couldn't put them down, down the stretch. We
missed layups and even some of the jump shots. We've got guys that
can shoot the ball pretty well, but we weren't able to knock down
some of the jumpers we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Rockets hung around within range for most of the
fourth quarter. Not known for their late rallies, they had lost
each of the previous 16 games in which they trailed heading into
the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Francis scored six of the Rockets' first seven points of the
quarter, and the Rockets trailed by five with 6:52 left. After
Bullard and Greg Foster traded jumpers, the Rockets got a follow
and a free throw from Rogers and were behind 89-87 with 5:56 left.
</P>
<P>
   But that only served as a cue for Payton to take over. He first
scored on a drive to his left. He then missed a jumper but slipped
in for the rebound and laid it in with his left hand. He used a Vin
Baker pick to score on another drive. He then went back to his left
for another successful drive.
</P>
<P>
   In two minutes, Payton single-handedly had outscored the Rockets
8-0 to give the Sonics a 97-87 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of times I thought I was right there and had him,''
Rogers said. ``A couple of times, the referee called fouls when I
thought I had it straight up and altered his shot. Other times, he
was just aggressive. He just didn't stop. They saw something and
kept going to it until we made an adjustment. Seattle will exploit
whatever was working.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew cut the lead to seven with a 3-pointer _ his fourth
straight field goal of the night and seventh trey in a row over a
four-game stretch. And with the Rockets double-teaming Payton on
screens, he had to give the ball up or force tougher shots. After a
Vernon Maxwell miss, Payton missed two shots and threw the ball
away three times.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Rockets could not close the gap. Mobley and Drew each
missed 3s, and Francis was called for charging Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Francis scored the Rockets' final six points, but they could not
slow the Sonics long enough to put together one last run.
</P>
<P>
   Although his team didn't win the game, Francis won the respect
of one of the NBA's toughest critics. Rather than tormenting him as
he did in October's first meeting, on Tuesday when Payton and
Francis were hit with a double technical, the veteran Dream Teamer
merely offered advice this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was telling me some stuff about my game,'' Francis said.
``I started laughing. I guess the referee (Scott Wall) thought we
were arguing with each other. He was telling me some good stuff
about pulling up and taking some jump shots instead of trying to go
to the basket every time. He said he was going to pay my fine. He
said that's chump change to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that was far kinder than anything Payton had said in
Seattle. But on Tuesday, his game spoke louder than even he could.

   NEW ORLEANS _ All week, Virginia Tech players said the Florida
State Seminoles refused to give them their proper respect.
</P>
<P>
   Upturned noses in public encounters, snide comments in the media
and an overall attitude of superiority are what the Hokies said
they had seen from Florida State as the teams prepared for the
Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time they figure out we can beat them, it'll be too
late,'' Virginia Tech defensive end Corey Moore said before the
game.
</P>
<P>
   No, by the time the Seminoles figured out the Hokies could beat
them, they had been pushed around for nearly an entire quarter. But
unfortunately for the Hokies, the game was still scoreless. Not for
long, though.
</P>
<P>
   Ignited by a dazzling performance from receiver Peter Warrick,
No. 1-ranked Florida State ran past No. 2 Virginia Tech 46-29
Tuesday in a wild contest to claim the NCAA Division I national
championship, becoming the initial team to be ranked first in the
Associated Press poll all season and win the title.
</P>
<P>
   A Hokies-tinged crowd of 79,280, the largest to watch a football
game in the Superdome, was treated to an entertaining display of
offensive football, and the lead entertainer was Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   The senior was named the game's Most Valuable Player after
catching six passes for 163 yards, returning a punt 59 yards for a
touchdown and setting a Sugar Bowl record by scoring 20 points
(three touchdowns and a reception for a two-point conversion).
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give it to him,'' Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer
said. ``That was one great performance. What can you say?''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick capped his spectacular night with a 43-yard reception to
seal the win with just under eight minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said in the huddle, `Y'all want me to go ahead and finish
them right here?' And that's what I did,'' Warrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Tech was not without its star performances, either, led by
freshman quarterback Michael Vick, who completed 15 of 29 passes
for 225 yards and a touchdown while eluding a gang of Florida State
blitzers for much of the game. He also rushed for 97 yards and
another score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Pete to match his big plays,'' Florida State coach
Bobby Bowden said. ``It was a team win, but it would have been hard
to win this one without Pete.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hokies outgained the Seminoles 503 yards to 299 but turned
the ball over three times, came up short on a fake field-goal
attempt and a fake punt, missed two two-point conversion attempts
and allowed seven sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Tech (11-1) took its first lead at 29-28 with 2:13 left in the
third quarter, but Florida State (12-0) scored 18 unanswered points
in the fourth period.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a moment of truth late in the third quarter where
they had taken the lead and the momentum and was fixing to win the
ballgame,'' said Bowden, whose team earned him his second national
championship and first undefeated season. ``But our kids came back
and scored, and scored and scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game could have been a runaway for both teams at times,
but each one of us kept breaking the other's momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's Chris Weinke passed 14 yards to Ron Dugan (five
receptions, 99 yards, two touchdowns) to regain the lead with 12:59
remaining, capping an 85-yard drive. Weinke then hit Warrick on a
quick slant for the two-point conversion and a 36-28 lead.
</P>
<P>
   On the next series, Vick lost a fumble, his second of the game
but only his fourth of the season, which led to a 32-yard field
goal by Sebastian Janikowski that stretched the Florida State edge
to 39-29.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick then closed out the scoring with a spectacular diving
grab, despite pass interference by Tech's Ronyell Whitaker in the
end zone.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing at one point by 21 points and 28-14 at the half,
the Hokies dominated the third period to take the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Two punt returns by Ike Charlton set up the first two scores of
the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Charlton put the Hokies in business with a 24-yard return to the
Florida State 40 to set up a 23-yard field goal by Shayne Graham
midway through the period.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, Andre' Kendrick burst down the left side with
an option pitch from Vick for a 29-yard scoring run.
</P>
<P>
   The Hokies elected to attempt a two-point conversion, but Vick,
under pressure from a blitz, had his pass knocked away, leaving the
Hokies down 28-23 with 5:57 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be long before the Hokies took their first lead.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Midget, who was beaten for two first-half touchdowns,
intercepted a long pass intended for Warrick on the second play of
the Seminoles' next possession.
</P>
<P>
   A throwback screen pass from Vick to a wide-open Cullen Hawkins
gained 23 yards, and Vick ripped off another 22 with a nifty burst
on an option to get to the Florida State six.
</P>
<P>
   Kendrick banged his way up the middle for the touchdown on the
next play to put the Hokies on top. But again, Vick's pass attempt
on the two-point conversion fell incomplete, leaving Tech with a
29-28 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles then got their offense going, driving 85 yards in
11 plays to regain the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this team needs to fall behind, then come back,'' said
Weinke, who passed for 329 yards and four touchdowns. ``We came out
flat in the second half, but we knew we could get it together. They
came at us, but we responded like champions.''

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW ORLEANS _ If you're Ron Dayne, you bolt the doors and lock the
windows. Maybe rent an extra-large safe deposit box before Peter
Warrick comes to claim what is rightfully his.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The little bronze stiff-arming Heisman Trophy guy.
</P>
<P>
   Although the last thing you'd think anyone from Florida State
would want is another police investigation, it's pretty clear
there's been a crime committed.
</P>
<P>
   Theft.
</P>
<P>
   That was the official charge that drew a two-game midseason
suspension for Warrick after his part in scamming $400 worth of
clothing from a department store.
</P>
<P>
   Theft.
</P>
<P>
   That was the result of the balloting that wound up giving the
Heisman Trophy to Dayne, the powerful Wisconsin running back,
instead of Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, never mind the debate over the best player
in the nation. All that mattered Tuesday night is that Warrick was
the best performer in the Nokia Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick was super inside the Superdome. He was near perfect in
the 46-29 clincher to a perfect 12-0 season that wrapped up Florida
State's second national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick didn't smash down the Virginia Tech defense the way
Dayne might have; he flashed past it like a laser beam and was just
as difficult to catch.
</P>
<P>
   He made it look so-o-o easy in the Big Easy. He was a one-man
Mardi Gras parade down Bourbon Street, dancing and marching to his
own jazz beat.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick caught a 64-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Chris
Weinke to start the party and a 43-yard strike to close things out
in the highest-scoring Sugar Bowl ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a special show,'' said Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden.
``It was something to truly watch and behold.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also just part of the Warrick show. There was also a
59-yard punt return for a touchdown in the second quarter that
showed he has not only the speed of a sprinter and the moves of a
cat but also the steely nerves of a jewel thief. As Jimmy Kibble's
punt came down on the artificial turf on one high bounce, everybody
among the crowd of 79,280 assumed that Warrick was just going to
let it roll dead. So did the Virginia Tech defense.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Warrick stepped up and sniffed an opportunity, then
reached out and grabbed the ball and in a heartbeat had darted
beyond the grasp of two Hokies defenders and was gone as Florida
State raced out to a 28-7 lead in what looked like the beginning of
a rout.
</P>
<P>
   But give the Hokies credit. For not only battling off all of
their critics all season long, but for not rolling over and
quitting.
</P>
<P>
   This was a night when Virginia Tech served notice that the
landscape at the top of college football has changed for good. The
domain of championship contenders no longer belongs solely to the
familiar, traditional powers.
</P>
<P>
   Just as parity has turned the March Madness of the NCAA
basketball tournament into a wide-open affair, now it seems just
about anybody can lay claim to the Division I-A football throne
room.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it helps to have a Michael Vick on your side. The
redshirt freshman quarterback was sensational all night long and
nearly did enough to pull off the upset. He is at his most
effective when those all around him are losing their heads, when
plays break down and it seems there is no way.
</P>
<P>
   In a wonderfully exciting championship game, Vick so often found
a way. He ran 23 times for 97 yards and one touchdown on the night,
and he passed for 225 yards and another TD on 15-for-29 throwing.
He was the gleam in the Hokies' eye that always gave them a chance
until his fateful, fatal fumble with 11:58 left in the game was
recovered by Florida State's Sean Key. Five plays later, the
Seminoles got a field goal from Sebastian Janikowski to take a
39-29 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Warrick who locked it away and gave Bowden, the
grandfather of 21, his first unbeaten season. He streaked deep down
the right side of the field and reached up and outfought Ronyell
Whitaker of the Hokies for the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right before the play, he pulled about four guys together and
said, `Do you want me to put this thing away right here?''' said
Bowden. ``And that's what he did. He really said that. Of course,
he made the catch, too, and put it away.''
</P>
<P>
   That catch gave Warrick 20 points for the night, a Sugar Bowl
record. It also gave him a measure of redemption after having let
down himself and his school for his part in the Oct. 7 scam.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, I think I'm better, stronger for what
happened,'' Warrick said. ``In the short run, it set me back on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, Virginia Tech might have wished that Peter
Warrick had come into the Superdome with the Heisman under one arm.
That 30-pound bronze trophy might have slowed him down a little.

WARRICK-LED SEMINOLES ACHIEVE SWEET PERFECTION IN SUGAR BOWL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TED MILLER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ An empty picture frame sits on Florida State coach
Bobby Bowden's desk in his office in Tallahassee, Fla. It is empty
because it is reserved for perfection, something Bowden has never
touched while building college football's most dominant program.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   Focus the lens and click the camera: College football has its
first wire-to-wire, top-ranked team, and Bowden has his first
perfect record in 40 years of coaching.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy. Second-ranked Virginia Tech was more a brawling
biker than a wide-eyed Cinderella.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Peter Warrick led a barrage of big plays in the first
half and shut the door on a Virginia Tech rally Tuesday night as
FSU slipped the Hokies 46-29 in the Sugar Bowl, this season's Bowl
Championship Series national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's meaningful,'' said Bowden, understating what those close
to him have said was his single-biggest coaching goal. ``It's a
milestone.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick caught touchdown passes of 64 and 43 yards, returned a
punt 59 yards for another touchdown, and, with a two-point
conversion, set a Sugar Bowl record with 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick, the game MVP, erased the memory of a one-reception
disaster in FSU's 1999 national championship defeat to Tennessee
and put behind him a season of turmoil that included a two-game
suspension for a department store scam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been so focused in my life,'' Warrick said.
</P>
<P>
   FSU, the preseason No. 1 team in both The Associated Press media
and USA Today/ESPN coaches polls, won its second national title.
The winningest team of the decade with 13 consecutive top-four
finishes, the Seminoles hail in the new millennium with a 12-0
record, while V-Tech finished 11-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having gotten here is the first step. Now we need to come back
and win it,'' Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer said. ``We had a
good crying session a few minutes ago.''
</P>
<P>
   FSU saw a 28-7 second-quarter advantage disappear in the third
quarter. Tech, led by thrilling redshirt freshman quarterback
Michael Vick, rallied for a 29-28 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Vick and the Hokies dominated statistically. Tech outgained FSU
503 yards to 359 and led the time of possession tally by nearly 13
minutes. Vick, a whirling dervish of speed and elusiveness, threw
and ran for touchdowns and had 225 yards passing and 97 yards
rushing (145 yards rushing if you don't count yards lost on seven
FSU sacks).
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think that he was that good,'' FSU defensive tackle
Jerry Johnson said. ``I feel sorry for teams who have to face him
the next few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Added defensive end Jamal Reynolds, ``He's like a motorcycle.''
</P>
<P>
   FSU, stagnant for the entire third quarter while Tech scored 15
points, answered the Hokies' rally decisively and with aplomb,
scoring 18 unanswered points in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Amid chants of his name from FSU fans, Warrick hauled in a
43-yard touchdown immediately after a fake punt by Tech failed. He
informed his teammates before the play that it was his time to
shine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Hey, you want me to finish them?' and they said,
`Yea,''' Warrick said.
</P>
<P>
   After Tech jumped ahead 29-28 on Andre Kendrick's 6-yard scoring
burst _ his second touchdown after filling in for injured starter
Shyrone Stith _ the Seminoles retook the lead on the ensuing
possession.
</P>
<P>
   In its only sustained drive on the evening, FSU went 85 yards in
11 plays, converting three third downs and one risky fourth down in
its own territory and jumped ahead for good.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Travis Minor's 16-yard run on that fourth-and-1 from
the Seminoles' 46 proved critical when a personal foul penalty on
Hokies linebacker Jamel Smith added another 15 yards to the play.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a third-and-11 from the 14, FSU quarterback Chris Weinke
found a strangely wide open Ron Dugans for the score, which put the
Seminoles back ahead 36-29 after a successful 2-point conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Then Vick's magic wore out. After scrambling for an apparent
first down, he fumbled, and FSU took over on Tech's 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``They deserve to win,'' Vick said. ``We did everything in our
power that we could do to win, but that wasn't good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian Janikowski, who hasn't missed inside of 45 yards this
season, booted a 32-yard field goal and FSU's lead was 39-29.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate, Tech's fake punt attempt on its next possession in
its own territory failed. FSU took over on the Hokies' 43. Warrick
went up top for the knockout punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, he's got a burst, doesn't he,'' Beamer said.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like it might turn into a FSU blowout in the first
half. But Tech went 80 yards in seven plays to cut FSU's lead to
28-14 seconds before the break, a drive that was indicative of how
nutty the half was.
</P>
<P>
   Vick set up his 3-yard touchdown run with a 43-yard scramble as
he made the Seminoles look disjointed. When the halftime horn
sounded, the Hokies had outgained FSU 264-193 and owned an
astounding 21:17 to 8:43 advantage in time of possession.
</P>
<P>
   Yet FSU was in control because two of its scores took no time,
while the others sliced just over two minutes off the clock _
combined.
</P>
<P>
   After the Hokies went 80 yards on the game's opening possession,
only to fumble at FSU's 4-yard line, the Seminoles opened the
scoring in quick and spectacular fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick slipped behind three defenders, who bit on a play-fake
from Weinke, for a 64-yard score. Time of possession: 32 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, FSU linebacker Tommy Polley blocked a punt at
Tech's 10-yard line and Jeff Chaney scooped up the loose ball and
scooted six yards a 14-0 lead. Time of possession: zero.
</P>
<P>
   Vick's 49-yard touchdown pass to Andre Davis, cut FSU's lead in
half _ that is until Ron Dugans split two defenders, hauled in a
short connection from Weinke, rambled for a 63-yard touchdown and
pushed the count to 21-7. Time of possession: A positively grueling
1:45.
</P>
<P>
   The Hokies then went three-and-out, and Warrick sped 59 yards
with the ensuing punt for a 28-7 lead. Time of possession: zero.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden and Warrick, who suffered like father and son this year,
enjoyed the euphoria of success after a year of struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back (for my senior year) for two reasons: to win the
national championship and to graduate,'' Warrick said. ``I
accomplished both of those goals.''

PUNDITS TOUT `HIS AND HERS' TICKETS _ FOR BOTH PARTIES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ No sooner had Elizabeth Dole endorsed George W.
Bush for president than the chattering class began talking up the
prospect of a woman on the 2000 ticket.
<P>
   ``A genuine chance,'' said Geraldine Ferraro, the Democrats'
1984 vice presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``A real possibility,'' said Ron Faucheux, editor of Election
and Campaign magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the chances are very good there will be a woman on
both tickets this year,'' said former California Democratic Party
Chairman Bill Press, co-host of CNN's ``Crossfire.''
</P>
<P>
   But behind the giddy talk is a sobering reality _ the field of
nationally prominent women is tiny. Though women comprise a slight
majority of the electorate, men dominate leadership positions in
Washington and most state capitals.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, 80 years after women won the right to vote, the
prospect of a female vice president remains slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, after (California Sen. Dianne) Feinstein, there
isn't a lot,'' said California Assemblywoman Carole Migden.
</P>
<P>
   ``In theory, (a female candidate) sounds good,'' said Migden,
who serves on the Democratic National Committee. ``But you have to
look specifically and say, `Who?' There's not exactly a vast array
of choices.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection of a running mate _ while a favorite avocation of
the political class _ is actually a ``very technical process'' said
GOP strategist Rich Galen.
</P>
<P>
   The nominees must map out what states they expect to win and
lose, and those where they expect to be competitive. In a close
election, a running mate should be able to help win those
competitive states.
</P>
<P>
   The early prognostications show that the 2000 presidential
contest may be most closely fought in Midwestern states such as
Ohio, Michigan and Illinois, and Eastern states such as
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   That has focused vice presidential attention on Republicans such
as Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar and Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, and
on Democrats such as Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for women is that even though there are more women
in the House and Senate than during any previous time in history
(66), they are still outnumbered by men about 8 to 1. Of the nine
female senators and three female governors, none are from the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a small pool'' said Marie Wilson, president of the
nonpartisan White House Project, which works toward creating a more
favorable climate for female candidates. ``Even if it doesn't
happen this year, each conversation that is held moves up the time
when it will.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, front-runner Bush can be expected to
look for someone to compensate for his lack of foreign policy
experience and his reputation as a policy lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who was secretary of transportation and labor, has never
been elected to any public office and has no formal foreign policy
experience. And while that might not eliminate a man from
consideration, it may present a huge obstacle for a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think her greatest asset is her chromosomes,'' said Stuart
Rothenberg, editor of a Washington political newsletter. ``I think
the likelihood is for Bush to play it safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican women might include: New Jersey Gov. Christine
Todd Whitman and Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe, whose support for legal
abortions have made them popular among moderates but anathema to
conservatives; and Arizona Gov. Jane Dee Hull, who backed Bush over
her own senator, John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Feinstein is the clear front-runner,
with most insiders scratching their heads to consider anyone else.
But Feinstein has repeatedly downplayed her interest in the matter.
And her aides insist that she is an unlikely candidate _ too
independent, too caught up in her own re-election to the Senate,
and too old to serve as vice president in the hopes of one day
becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't read into the future,'' Feinstein said dismissively
when asked about her prospects last summer. ``I can't say what may
happen. ... The probability is very strong that I will be a United
States senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats mentioned include New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne
Shaheen, whose state owns only four electoral votes, and Maryland
Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, who is regarded as untested.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democratic senators, including California's Barbara Boxer,
Washington's Patty Murray and Maryland's Barbara Mikulski, are
considered too liberal.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll show conducted by CBS News found that 9 of 10
respondents said they would vote for a qualified woman for
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to happen,'' said Ferraro, who recalled wistfully
the excitement generated by her own vice presidential run. ``I
thought it would happen before this. It was wonderful to be the
first, but I do not like the idea of being the only one.''

 SOME AIDS DRUGS FOUND TO CAUSE LIVER DAMAGE  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Powerful anti-HIV drugs may attack not only the AIDS virus but
also the liver, causing such severe side effects that 10 percent of
all patients must stop therapy, a new study has found.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said the findings, reported Wednesday in the Journal of
the American Medical Association, underscore the dangers of
indiscriminate use of the latest weapons in the fight against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   One drug, ritonavir, a so-called protease inhibitor marketed by
Abbott Laboratories Inc. under the trade name Norvir, showed liver
toxicity problems five times as severe as the other drugs studied.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Johns Hopkins University, led by Dr. Mark
Sulkowski, studied 298 patients who were prescribed anti-viral
drugs during a two-year period ended in January 1998. In 31 cases,
standard tests for elevated liver enzymes showed severe toxicity _
defined as enzyme levels five to 10 times higher than the upper
limit of the normal range.
</P>
<P>
   Sulkowski said less pronounced toxicity was also ``quite
common,'' but only the most severe problems, which forced patients
to halt treatment, were tabulated in the study.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of side effects from AIDS drugs, including liver
damage, has been known for years, but the new study appears to be
the first careful attempt to quantify one of the most significant
health risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``These drugs are hard on the liver,'' Sulkowski said. ``We just
didn't know how common (these problems) can be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Johns Hopkins team focused on liver toxicity in part because
of the growing problem of AIDS patients who also harbor the virus
that causes chronic hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   HCV, as the hepatitis virus is known, also attacks the liver,
and is estimated to be present in about one-third of all those
infected with the AIDS virus in the United States. Researchers
estimate that co-infection with hepatitis C is found in 90 percent
of those who acquired HIV through intravenous drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Given the higher dangers of liver damage from ritonavir,
Sulkowski said, clinicians may be wise to look for a different drug
when treating co-infected patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ritonavir was far and away the most toxic drug,'' he said.
``If you have a choice, it may be prudent in a patient with HCV to
avoid using ritonavir if you can.''
</P>
<P>
   The study also looked at three other protease inhibitors _
saquinavir, indinavir and nelfinavir _ and an older category of
drugs such as AZT, called nucleoside analogues. Both types of drugs
are generally used in combination to fight the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   One limitation of the study, however, is that it examined
particular drug combinations and dosages that may no longer be in
widespread use, because drug companies continue to introduce new
formulations and doctors frequently alter practices in light of
patient reports and ongoing research.
</P>
<P>
   Drugmaker Dupont Merck, for example, has recently introduced a
once-daily pill called Sustiva (efavirenz) that appears to be
relatively free of liver-related side effects when used in standard
multidrug combinations. It was not included among the drugs studied
by Sulkowski and his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potentially severe side effects on the liver,
Sulkowski said, patients should not be frightened away from
potentially life-saving AIDS drugs if their doctors are
recommending them.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, the study showed most AIDS patients, even
those with hepatitis C co-infections, were not overwhelmed with
liver-toxicity problems. Overall, only 12.2 percent of the HIV-HCV
co-infected patients had to stop treatment with any protease
inhibitor because of effects on the liver. And once those patients
stopped the drugs, none suffered any permanent liver damage.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Abbott Laboratories said its own
clinical trials, which enrolled 900 patients, found abnormal liver
function only one-third as often as did the Johns Hopkins study.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman said the drug has been shown to be safe and
effective, with appropriate monitoring. But she also noted that the
new study is the first to look at the Abbott drug's side effects in
direct comparison with the other medications.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jay Levy, professor of medicine and director of AIDS
research at the University of California at San Francisco, said the
new study results were not surprising in light of anecdotal reports
from AIDS clinics.
</P>
<P>
   He said the findings show a clear need for caution before even
starting anyone on potent anti-viral medicines. Besides toxic
effects, he noted, the AIDS drugs can also create drug-resistance
problems when used improperly.
</P>
<P>
   ``These drugs are marvelous,'' Levy said, ``but you've got to
recognize their side effects. They're powerful and very effective
when used at the appropriate time. But there are trade-offs.''

 CALIFORNIA LT. GOV. NAMED TO U.S. CENSUS COMMITTEE  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ President Clinton appointed California Lt. Gov.
Cruz Bustamante to the nation's census board Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-member, bipartisan U.S. Census Monitoring Board is
made up of presidential and congressional appointees and is charged
with overseeing the implementation of the 2000 census, which will
be used to allocate federal funding and U.S. House of
Representative seats.
</P>
<P>
   California is estimated to have lost $2 billion in federal
funding and one Representative because more than 800,000 people,
many of them minorities and immigrants, were not counted in the
1990 census, Bustamante said.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that a recent Supreme Court decision prohibiting
statistical sampling means that minorities and immigrants will
continue to be missed by census workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``An undercount will take place again,'' Bustamante said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the possibility of an undercount, the strong population
growth in the South and West may allow California to pick up an
additional House seat while New York and Pennsylvania may lose one,
according to a recent report.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bustamante led efforts to create the California
Complete Count Committee, which will use $25 million in state funds
for census outreach activities.
</P>
<P>
   Although the committee was Bustamante's idea, Gov. Gray Davis
refused to appoint him chairman of the committee. Bustamante said
Tuesday that he would have liked to lead the commission but is now
looking forward to working on a national level.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert Casellas, the chairman of the national board, said
Bustamante will lend credibility to a process that is regarded with
suspicion by many people.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a background that brings that credibility to reaching
communities and instilling a sense of confidence to people who
distrust and fear anything associated with government,'' Casellas
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante is well-regarded by minorities since he stood up to
Davis when the governor asked a federal appeals court to mediate an
appeal of Proposition 187. The 1994 ballot initiative halted state
services, including education, for illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante said he expects to play a major role on the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``A plan is a plan until it is executed,'' he said. ``Just like
any campaign or business plan, it has to have really good
execution. As things take place, we might be able to move from the
plan and make adjustments if necessary.''

GORE LOSES CALIFORNIA CAMPAIGN DIRECTOR
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a startling shakeup just two months before the March 7
primary, the head of Vice President Al Gore's California campaign
team has abruptly resigned to return to a post with the state
Democratic Party, The Chronicle has learned.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign officials downplayed the reorganization, saying it
will not affect their aggressive new strategy in California. But
some political insiders suggested that the resignation of the
campaign's director reflects mounting disarray in the vice
president's bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Bowler, California director of Gore's presidential
campaign, will be replaced by Gore insider Sky Gallegos, according
to Donna Brazile, Gore's national campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new season for us in California. ... We want to have
an energized team out there,'' Brazile said in an interview
Tuesday. ``Kathy Bowler has done an excellent job at putting us
where we need to be and given us a sound foundation, and Sky will
put together a team and carry us on to victory.''
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization comes on the heels of earlier national
troubles for Gore's campaign, which relocated to Nashville in
October after being plagued by persistent reports of internal
problems and staff reshuffling.
</P>
<P>
   The news of Bowler's December 31 resignation, which was not
publicly announced by the campaign, revived speculation that the
old problems had returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Gore) campaign in California is in disarray. ... It's no
reflection on her (Bowler),'' said one longtime Democratic party
insider. ``It's a reflection of the lack of importance that the
Gore campaign has put on an organizational structure in
California.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowler is expected to return to her former position as executive
director of the California Democratic Party, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For health reasons, she told us about a month ago she would
not be able to do the kind of travel (needed for the campaign),''
said Brazile. ``She's done a yeoman's job in helping us to complete
all our fund-raising objectives in California. ... (But) people are
excited that the Gore express train will be out West,'' said
Brazile. ``We have time to build the momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazile lavished praise on Gallegos, a veteran of the Clinton
political campaign who was in intergovernmental affairs at the
White House and was a former special assistant to HUD Secretary
Andrew Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was national political director, I took her out of
California to help build the political operation,'' Brazile said.
``Now I'm sending her back out West to reinvigorate the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   In a move some Democrats said was long overdue, Brazile said
Gore's campaign will reopen offices in Los Angeles, and that unlike
the largely fund-raising functions there, the focus will be ``more
political in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Political insiders said that focus will help Gore's statewide
campaign _ now headquartered in Sacramento _ better tap the
political motherlode in Southern California, where the bulk of
crucial ethnic voters and political contributions lie.
</P>
<P>
   Brazile also said the vice president and key supporters,
including his wife, Tipper, will come to California regularly next
month, said Brazile. The vice president, she said, will approach
campaigning in California with ``the kind of attention he's given
New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Gore 2000 California campaign is expected to announce
soon a roster of new endorsements, new staff people, and a new
press secretary, in addition to a management team, ``a team of
experienced leaders,'' Brazile said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore supporters insist the moves are good ones, and that the
vice president _ who has long cultivated support and contributions
in California _ is in no danger here, even as the campaign
leadership has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Garry South, the Democratic political consultant who shaped the
landslide victory of Gov. Gray Davis, said he is convinced that the
Nashville-California connection has been strengthed, and that Gore
will continue to guard his lead in the polls here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president still has a lead of 21/2 times over Bill
Bradley, who has barely moved in the polls in California,'' he
said. ``There's still a lot of critical mass in California: the
governor, two U.S. senators, the congressional delegations. ...
He's a known commodity here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gale Kaufman, the political consultant for Bradley's state
campaign, said that the former New Jersey senator has ``made it
clear we're going to be competitive in California. And we didn't
make this decision last week. We made it last March and April.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Gore campaign to be sitting in January and not be sure
what their structure is going to be is shocking,'' she said. ``I
like where we're sitting a lot better.''

LIGHTEN UP WITH MONICA AND JENNY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The secret to keeping New Year's resolutions is
to make them reasonable in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   I resolved, for instance, not to obsess over any individual
Beatle, but to remain a generalist.
</P>
<P>
   Any resolution involving doughnuts is doomed to failure. We can
put a man on the moon, but we can't develop a doughnut patch.
Doughnuts are my Monica.
</P>
<P>
   Monica is carving out fame on her own terms these days, making
commercials for a weight-loss system, and if ever there was a
lightweight, it's Monica.
</P>
<P>
   She is now famous enough to be considered a serious candidate
for president. Monica could throw her beret in the ring for the
Reform Party, which is searching for just the right famous doofus
to head the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   One thing Monica has over all the other presidential candidates,
Gore included, is White House experience.
</P>
<P>
   And someday Monica will have her own interns.
</P>
<P>
   YOU THINK IT'S hard to remember to write ``00'' on your checks,
how about remembering that the California Prune Board is now the
California Dried Plum Board?
</P>
<P>
   This means ``prune'' is now an agricultural slur.
</P>
<P>
   COMFORTING WORDS came to Jon Edwards in his final
checking-account statement of the century: ``YEAR 2000 UPDATE: You
can expect the same level of service from Bank of America now and
into the next millennium. The systems and software that support
this account statement have already been made ready for year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the envelope: canceled checks written by the Madison
Marquette Retail Services Inc.
</P>
<P>
   POSSIBLY CONFUSED by the new millennium math: California Gov.
Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Guv Gray proclaimed Dec. 24 of 1999 ``S.S. Leopoldville
Rememberance Day,'' as the 50th anniversary of a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas, on December 24, 1949, the S.S. Leopoldville was
torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat while transporting American
soldiers to the front lines of World War II. ...''
</P>
<P>
   A senseless tragedy, it would seem, since the war ended in '45.
</P>
<P>
   MANY A TEAR has to fall in 49er land. The front office has hard
decisions to make before next season. If they keep Steve Young and
Jerry Rice, the team won't be able to afford uniforms and
footballs.
</P>
<P>
   If Young and Rice stay, Bill Walsh will have to recruit the rest
of the team from the line at the All-U-Can-Eat Buffet. And
sentiment is not Walsh's strong suit, as I was just saying to the
door-to-door encyclopedia salesman, Ronnie Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Young is one of the great quarterbacks in history, and maybe the
most quality guy ever to wear shoulder pads. And Rice is a legend.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a reason John Brodie is no longer tossing swing
passes to Hugh McElhenny.
</P>
<P>
   SHOT DOWN over Tokyo 55 years ago this month, B-29 crewman Ray
(Hap) Halloran spent seven months in a POW camp, where he didn't
need Jenny Craig to help him lose 97 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hap, whose car has a special ``POW'' license plate presented by
the state, came out of a movie theater in Redwood City the other
night and found a note on his windshield.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless you, Sir _ Thank you for serving our country.
Sincerely, Jennifer Madison.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Hap: ``A very special Christmas gift.''

MIRANDA PROTECTS SUSPECTS AND POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c.2000 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its decision in Miranda vs. Arizona (1966), the U.S. Supreme
Court actually adopted the Miranda warning from criminal procedures
already used by the FBI. The high court adopted the warning in
order to safeguard the Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination for those in police custody.
</P>
<P>
   The warning has three essential elements: A person taken into
custody must be advised immediately that he has a right to remain
silent, that anything he says may be used against him in a court of
law and that he has the right to speak to a retained or
court-appointed attorney before submitting to interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   The court in the Miranda decision wrote: ``Over the years the
Federal Bureau of Investigation has compiled an exemplary record of
effective law enforcement while advising any suspect or arrested
person, at the outset of an interview.... A letter received from
the Solicitor General in response to a question from the Bench
makes it clear that the present pattern of warnings and respect for
the rights of the individual followed as a practice by the FBI is
consistent with the procedure which we delineate today.''
</P>
<P>
   In the First Congress, Sen. William Maclay of Pennsylvania spoke
in opposition to a proposed law that would have compelled a person
to be a witness against himself in civil cases: ``extorting
evidence from any person was a species of torture.... The
conscience was to be put on the rack; that forcing oaths or
evidence from men, I consider equally tyrannical as extorting
evidence by torture.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``Origins of the Bill of Rights,'' pre-eminent
constitutional scholar Leonard W. Levy maintains that the right
against self-incrimination is inserted in the Fifth Amendment and
not the Sixth Amendment because the framers of our Constitution did
not want the right to be merely applied to a defendant during a
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixth Amendment spells out the constitutional rights of
defendants in a criminal trial. Most of the clauses of the Fifth
Amendment may be seen as protecting the rights of suspects or those
accused prior to trial. In other words, the right against
self-incrimination can be evoked when a person is still a suspect
and not yet a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court examined the question of whether
confessions were coerced or voluntary long before it threw out the
conviction of a black man who had been repeatedly hanged by his
belt until unconscious then revived and questioned again until he
confessed (Brown vs. Mississippi, 1936).
</P>
<P>
   Though rare, in a few police precincts around the nation,
physical threats and actual violence are still used to obtain
confessions. When those methods are brought to the court's
attention, those convictions are usually overturned.
</P>
<P>
   In a line of cases from the 1940s to the 1960s, the high court
began to recognize that suspects needed to have an attorney present
when they were taken into custody in order to preserve the fairness
of a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Pretrial interrogation is the stage when legal aid and advice
are most critical to a suspect, said the court in its Escobedo vs.
Illinois (1964) decision.
</P>
<P>
   In the Miranda case, the court also recognized that the
interrogation techniques as outlined in police manuals can lead to
menacing psychological stratagems that undermine the right against
self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the Miranda ruling, there were thousands of appeals
regarding whether a confession was voluntary or not. Few reached
the U.S. Supreme Court. Those appeals that did reach the court were
mostly death penalty cases. After the high court mandated the
Miranda warning, fewer appeals have been made based upon
involuntary confessions.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the Miranda warning acts as a watershed in
determining the admission of a confession in a court of law. Was
the suspect read his Miranda rights before he was interrogated? If
not, in most circumstances, any confession would be suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   When it rules in Dickerson vs. United States this term, if the
Supreme Court decides to overturn its Miranda decision in favor of
the less stringent standards regarding the voluntariness of
confessions, which were passed by Congress in 1968, then a great
many more appeals regarding confessions will reach the courts. And,
once again, the high court will hear very few of them.
</P>
<P>
   Some claim that the Miranda decision has hampered police, that
thousands of criminals have been let free and thousands of crimes
go unsolved each year because of the requirement to read suspects
their Miranda rights.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts claim those assertions are phony.
</P>
<P>
   Former New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton, in a
Dec. 12 interview with Michael Kramer of the New York Daily News,
said that Miranda has not impeded police work: ``The falling crime
rates tell you that, if nothing else does.''
</P>
<P>
   Bratton made the argument that Miranda protects law enforcement
officials from the suspicion that they coerced a confession from
someone in their custody. Under Miranda, police have a suspect sign
a paper saying he has been read his rights. Any defendant, who then
claims his confession was coerced, has a harder time proving that
in court.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda strikes a balance in protecting a citizen's right
against self-incrimination and protecting law enforcement officials
from an unfair suspicion that back-room, third-degree techniques
were used to obtain a confession.
</P>
<P>
   We live in a constitutional, democratic republic where even the
police must adhere to constitutional standards. And while the
police solve crimes, they must still protect the civil rights of
suspects. Without the public's trust, law enforcement is hampered.
Miranda has helped establish that trust.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda has worked for more than 30 years _ it would be worse
than foolish to dump it now.

STANLEY Z. KOPLIK, 55; MASS. CHANCELLOR OF HIGHER EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ Higher Education Chancellor Stanley Z. Koplik, who
championed accessible and affordable college education, died Monday
after complications from intestinal surgery for a rare blood
disorder. He was 55.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Koplik, of Beacon Hill, collected baseball memorabilia with
the same quiet passion he devoted to raising standards and lowering
tuition at Massachusetts public colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Well known for his brisk morning walks through the Boston Common
before arriving for work at 7 a.m., Mr. Koplik was a tireless
volunteer to ensure even the poorest children would receive an
opportunity to go to college.
</P>
<P>
   Despite working 12 hours a day, he helped organize his office to
provide tutoring to Boston schoolchildren and sat on the board of
Summer Search, a nonprofit group that teaches city public school
students to be leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly his legacy was his vision to have a system of higher
education that was more affordable and also that raised standards
where they need to be raised,'' said state education commissioner
David P. Driscoll. Mr. Koplik was also a member of the state Board
of Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a guy that didn't seek a lot of attention and really
let others get the limelight,'' Driscoll said. ``Those were a lot
of his strengths. He sat in the background, got the vision and
never looked to get the credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Koplik was appointed chancellor of the state's 15 community
colleges, nine state colleges and five campuses of the University
of Massachusetts in 1993. He received a bachelor's degree from the
State University of New York at New Paltz, a master's degree in
public administration from New York University and a doctorate from
the University of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   He began his teaching career in Kingston, N.Y., and later taught
for three years at the American School in Karachi, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   With 20 years of experience in state government and public
education, Mr. Koplik was executive director and chief financial
officer of the Kansas Board of Regents before coming to
Massachusetts to take over a campus system battered by budget cuts.
Prior to Kansas, he was commissioner of higher education in
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Koplik, who gained national prominence for raising academic
standards and lowering tuition in state colleges, was a finalist
last month for the top job in the State University of New York
system.
</P>
<P>
   When Mr. Koplik arrived in Massachusetts, it was one of the most
expensive public college systems in the country. Under his tenure,
he was able to lower tuition every year for the last five years.
Colleagues say he worked to improve the quality of college
candidates, establishing entrance and exit exams that will begin
this year. He also worked to stop many four-year colleges from
providing students with remedial help _ and had students take such
classes at the community college level.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you call Florida, or California or New York and people want
to know about how do you lower tuition or the redirection of
remedial teaching . . . all these things got done because Stan
Koplik got them done,'' said James F. Carlin, former chairman of
the state Board of Higher Education. ``And the truth is that the
board and I got 90 percent of the credit and Stan got 10. And he
didn't care. His commitment was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   To the point and always direct, Mr. Koplik often served as a
calming rational voice in the often fractious, politicized world of
education. He was, colleagues say, able to negotiate between
college presidents, state political leaders and the board. What's
more, he was able to do so without alienating anyone, colleagues
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He unfailingly stood for high academic standards. He insisted
that the interests of students and parents come first,'' said state
Board of Education chairman James A. Peyser. ``He repeatedly
demonstrated creativity and courage in confronting difficult and
controversial problems. And he never lost his sense of fairness or
his sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   In his private life, Mr. Koplik loved baseball and collected
baseballs signed by the game's greats. He was an avid Red Sox fan,
and attended many games with his friend from Kansas, Gene Budig,
president of the American League. Budig kept Mr. Koplik supplied
with memorabilia and recently gave him an autographed baseball from
last summer's All-Star Game at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Koplik had other passions: fly-fishing and model trains,
said his friend and Board of Higher Education colleague Peter
Nessen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best place for a memorial service would be Fenway Park and
if we could get Ted Williams to fly-cast we would capture the
interests of Stan,'' said Nessen.
</P>
<P>
   As condolences poured in from Governor Paul Cellucci to former
co-workers in Missouri, Mr. Koplik's wife, Kathleen, said Tuesday
she was moved by the depth of emotion friends and colleagues
expressed about the importance of her husband's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``What could be cold policy, there was real feeling and
respect,'' Kathleen Koplik said. ``Sometimes you tend to see your
father, husband, brother, whatever, as sort of a family person.
Today, we've gotten new perspective and I'm feeling so amazed and
gratified.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Mr. Koplik leaves his daughter, Kristen; his
son, Joshua; and a brother, Martin, of New Jersey.

 &HT;    Catastrophe experts to help in bonfire probe
 &HT;    By Laylan Copelin

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The commission investigating the fatal Texas A&AMP;M
University bonfire is turning to experts in catastrophes such as
the World Trade Center bombing in New York City and airliner
crashes to determine why the 59-foot stack of logs collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   It may take several hundred thousand dollars and several months,
according to one estimate, but one of the newly hired consultants
predicted the riddle would be solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident the answer is out there,'' said Tage Carlson,
with Packer Engineering of Illinois. ``I just don't know how long
it will take.''
</P>
<P>
   The stack collapsed Nov. 18, killing 12 and injuring 27, as the
Aggies were preparing for the traditional bonfire before their
football game against the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M officials named Houston construction executive Leo Linbeck
Jr., who in turn named four others, to the special commission to
investigate what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The commission this week heard from three consulting firms that
will do the work.
</P>
<P>
   Fay Engineering of Denver investigated the 1981 skywalk collapse
that killed 114 people at a Hyatt Regency hotel in Kansas City, Mo.
Packer Engineering of Naperville, Ill., helped investigate the 1989
crash of a DC-10 in Iowa and a 1993 collapse of a Chicago post
office.
</P>
<P>
   Kroll Associates is an international company that hires former
intelligence officers and ex-FBI agents, as well as lawyers and
accountants, to conduct intelligence and investigations for large
businesses. The company helped with the investigation of the 1993
World Trade Center bombing and also tracked money missing from
Kuwait after Saddam Hussein was defeated in the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators with Kroll Associates will interview witnesses and
manage the thousands of documents, photos and videos about past
bonfires.
</P>
<P>
   Fay Engineering is to determine how the bonfire design evolved
through the decades. One challenge is that there are no blueprints.
Holding up a 1990 instruction manual, Rex Paulsen of Fay
Engineering complained about the lack of design specifications:
``There is not a single drawing in this document.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Denver firm is concentrating on past bonfire designs,
Packer Engineering will focus on what was built in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about the cause of the collapse has ranged from
construction shortcuts to a lack of supervision of the students
stacking the 7,000-log bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   Two additional companies may be hired to investigate how the
bonfire builders were chosen, trained and supervised and the safety
measures that were used.
</P>
<P>
   Paulsen estimated his company's bill for the investigation would
be about $100,000, and the total bill for the investigation could
be as much as $500,000. Texas A&AMP;M is paying for the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Linbeck said a final budget and schedule are not expected until
the commission's next meeting, Jan. 18, when the rest of the team
is assembled.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M and Linbeck have promised an open investigation. But Linbeck
urged the consultants not to talk to reporters about their work
until a final report is given to the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not going to be permitted to stand over the shoulder
of the researchers,'' Linbeck told reporters after the meeting.

 &HT;    Old salt considers friends, job the spice of life
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The guests at William R. Carver's
birthday party wound their way around displays of caulking, varnish
and anchor lines into the back room of Hopkins Marine Hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Bill is as much a fixture there as the paint counter where he's
been stationed for the past 25 years. He's made a powerful
impression on a lot of people _ not the least, his boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill's amazing,'' says store manager Chris Janes. ``He knows
everything. He keeps track of everything in the store.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill earned his expertise by caring for five boats of his own
(he dearly misses that 35-footer he left behind in Ocean City,
N.J.) and by guiding countless others to safe harbor in 45 years
with the Coast Guard Auxiliary.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for everyone, Carver rarely misses a day's work. ``He
doesn't call in sick,'' Janes says. ``Even if he has a doctor's
appointment, he comes in right after.'' Such dedication may sound
more admirable than remarkable, excethis: This birthday is
his 95th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to stay active,'' he says. ``I keep moving. If you sit
too much, time passes too slowly. I like to work.''
</P>
<P>
   So work he does, every weekday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. He enjoys
the company of his co-workers and customers such as yacht captain
Mitch Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here two or three times a day, and I always look for
Bill,'' Armstrong says. ``He's been to my house. He knows my
children. We talk about boats and I enjoy listening to his
stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Carver has a store of sea tales, and many more. He retired as
superintendent of a Gulf Oil plant in 1968 and moved to West Palm
Beach with his wife, Mary Elizabeth. They met at a barn dance in
1921.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked in and saw her standing under a light in the very the
center of the floor,'' he says. ``I knew God was trying to tell me
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Elizabeth died in 1981. They'd been married 57 years. ``I
still miss her,'' he says. She's the one who nudged Bill toward the
store that has become his second home. He'd taken a post-retirement
job as a bridge tender, but he wound up on the night shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't like being alone at night, so she asked me to look
for a day job,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   So one night on the way to work at the Flagler Memorial Bridge,
he strolled up to the Sixth Street store and asked the manager for
a job. ``I told him about my boats and my experience and he hired
me,'' Bill says.
</P>
<P>
   Bill was 70 years old then. He's the only one from that era
still working in the store. He continues as a matter of love, not
money. ``You don't get rich working five hours a day,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He has no plans to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor says you use it or you lose it,'' Bill says. ``I'm
going to keep using it as long as I can.''

 &HT;    A visit to one of the prettiest spots in Texas
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON POOL, TRAVIS COUNTY, Texas _ Last time I was here, 21
years ago, ,a group of bikers watched as on a dare I jumped off a
45-foot cliff into the deep waters of this natural pool. It was a
dumb stunt that cost me a few weeks of serious pain when the force
of the water wrenched my arm out of its socket. I drove back home
to Nacogdoches the next day with my arm wrapped tight against my
body, shifting my Volkswagen bus with my left hand and steering at
the same time with my knees. Somewhere there's a color slide my
brother shot, who watched aghast as I took the plunge, my short
body outlined against the rock, bushy hair sticking straight up.
Lord, it's a miracle I survived the follies of my youth.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Hamilton Pool was a popular hangout, a collapsed cave
on ranch land about 30 miles west of Austin, the scene of many
parties _ hippies and rednecks swimming in the cold green water,
the area trashy and trampled from overuse and no management.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's one of the prettiest spots in Texas, since Travis
County bought it in 1985 and turned it and the surrounding 200-plus
acres into a preserve. Even in this drought, the vegetation is
lush, rocks below the stream of water falling from the cliffs
covered with moss and delicate plants, cypress trees now losing
their leaves, covering the creek with brown pods, tiny purple
flowers blooming. I can't do justice to this place with words, and
I didn't bother to bring a camera, figuring that would just reduce
what I saw to an overexposed postcard that also wouldn't capture
Hamilton Pool's beauty. Go there and see it for yourself is my best
advice.
</P>
<P>
   Humans have enjoyed the pool for more than 8,000 years,
according to the brochure I picked up. Tonkawa and Lipan Apaches
lived near the pool until run off by white settlers. Morgan C.
Hamilton bought the property in the mid-1860s, and his brother,
Gov. Andrew Jake Hamilton, apparently enjoyed escaping to the
grotto from the rigors of running Texas. For more than 100 years,
the Reimer family owned the land and ran sheep and cattle on it.
The pool was rediscovered and opened to the public. The combination
of people, sheep and cattle was hard on the land. Gone were the
natural prairies the Apaches had enjoyed. Hamilton Pool when I
first visited was interesting, and the water was still cool and
green, but the place had obviously suffered the worse for wear over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the land is making an impressive comeback, its use
rigorously controlled, visitors confined to winding trails, the
cliff closed off to keep fools like me from jumping off. Past the
pool, one can follow a trail along Hamilton Creek for nearly a
mile, where stands of live oaks and junipers mingle with grassland,
all the way down to the Pedernales River, low this fall with little
rain, sandbars popping up across its width.
</P>
<P>
   The bulletin board at the preserve's entrance explains the
history of this place and describes the critters who call it home,
including an impressive array of snakes that thankfully chose to
lay low during my visit. Some type of bird has built mud nests on
the roof of the overhanging cliff. Deer, rabbits, beaver, porcupine
and even mountain lions call this place home, according to what I
read.
</P>
<P>
   On this autumn Sunday morning, I have the place nearly to
myself, though I suspect in the summer the swimming hole is still
quite popular. I spend a time staring up at the cliff, wondering
why I was dumb enough to jump off just because some biker said I
didn't have the guts to do so, and grateful it all turned out OK.
</P>
<P>
   But that's in the past. Mainly what I feel is gratitude that
some folks had the vision and courage to save and restore a place
to which I hope to bring my grandkids someday, to show them a small
part of Texas that looks like it did several hundred years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many places left like Hamilton Pool. I can't think
of a wiser use of public money than to preserve spots like this for
future generations.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton Pool is located about 30 miles west of Austin off U.S.
Hwy. 71. Look for the turnoff just past Bee Cave, and the pool is
about 13 miles down a paved farm road. Call 512-264-2740 for
information.

 &HT;    Y2K is full of beans (and rice)
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ The big Y2K happening came and went and for the
most part, society as we know it didn't suffer any ill effects. For
those of you just now peeking out of your bunkers to see what sort
of destruction was left in the wake of the dreaded tick of the
clock from 1999 to 2000, it must be a mixed bag.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, there was no Armageddon. On the other hand, what to
do with 50-pound sacks of rice and beans, generators, water wells,
coal-oil lamps and enough meals ready to eat to last well into
summer? All those folks who were preaching doom and gloom, are now
just shrugging it off and saying they needed the extra supplies
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   I've yet to run across anyone who has admitted the truth. So for
all you who purchased more rice and beans than you can eat in one
sitting, for those who bought generators, had water wells dug, and
whose meals ready to eat are neither meals nor edible, here is the
truth: You were suckered. You spent money needlessly and you were
made a big fool of.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1998, I wrote a column commenting on the extremes some
people were taking to prepare for Y2K and may have taken a less
than serious approach.
</P>
<P>
   One reader was so offended she wrote a letter taking me to task
for my comments. I saved that letter for just such an occasion:
</P>
<P>
   ``Columns like your recent 'Y2K ookiness' no doubt meant to be
humorous, could be potentially dangerous by encouraging people to
deny a real and possibly devastating problem. Your attempt at humor
won't seem so funny if you are starving, sitting in the dark in a
cesspool of untreated sewage which has backed up into your home.''
</P>
<P>
   Here we are, well into the new year and so far I'm not starving,
in the dark or sitting in a cesspool of untreated sewage. And I'm
also not sitting on 50-pound sacks of rice and beans.
</P>

 &HT;    Better safe than sensible?
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway

<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Just before New Year's I stopped in a hardware
store not far from my house to buy a couple of parts needed to fix
an exercise machine.
</P>
<P>
   When checking out, I asked if the store had been selling stuff
to people preparing for a Y2K disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding?'' the man asked. ``We've sold more stuff than
you could imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently it also was more stuff than he could imagine since he
sold out of many items and had to order more.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently I live around people who put their money where there
fears are. Surely they felt it prudent to purchase items that would
prevent them from suffering in cold, dark homes when the
electricity and natural gas went off on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   People stocked up on extra propane bottles, Sterno, flashlights
and batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Some really concerned people stocked up on guns and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The hardware man said he also sold out of portable electric
generators.
</P>
<P>
   Portable generators. I should have thought of that. It's my
guess that a lot of portable generators were sold to people who had
been trying for years to rationalize buying one. When I happen down
an aisle that has portable generators, I always stop to check out
that latest model.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I didn't believe anything would happen, I could have
used Y2K as an excuse to buy a portable generator.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, I probably would not have bought one before New
Year's Day. I would have realized that I could pick up a never-used
portable generator on sale right after the Y2K bug died straining
to roar.
</P>
<P>
   Someone told me about a man who bought a $20,000 electric
generator. Now that's a serious industrial-strength generator. The
man also purchased a huge storage tank and filled it with fuel for
his new generator. I hope the man has an understanding wife.
</P>
<P>
   The grocery store where I shop had a Y2K run on many items. The
bag boy (bag person or retail shopping assistant) told me he helped
carry a truck load of bottled water to cars and trucks, not to
mention canned goods and cases of beer.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of those portable generators probably were going to be
used to keep the beer cold when the lights went off on New Year's
Day.
</P>
<P>
   If the television stations had big enough electric generators, a
man properly prepared for the Y2K disaster could fire up his
portable generator on New Year's Day, stretch out in his Lazy Boy,
grab a cold beer in one hand and his remote control in the other
hand and be secure in the knowledge that other people were
suffering. It's a survivalist's dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   I'm told that one woman, convinced that Y2K problems would shut
everything down, including grocery stores, bought a six-month
supply of beans and rice that she stored under her bed.
Unfortunately, before New Year's rolled around she discovered that
rats got into the beans and rice and ruined her food supply.
</P>
<P>
   With little time left before New Year's Eve, the woman
supposedly bought another half-year's supply of food. This time she
bought military MREs _ Meals Ready to Eat.
</P>
<P>
   Now when her family inquires about dinner, she can say, ``Meal's
ready to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Another source told me about an older couple who cashed in
$200,000 in certificates of deposit before New Year's Day out of
fear that their money would be lost in the bank. They insisted that
the bank give them only $20 bills.
</P>
<P>
   There's no telling how much money people across America lost in
interest payments by needlessly withdrawing their money from banks.
</P>
<P>
   I'm still not sure what I would do with a portable generator.
But if the Y2K discount is big enough, I'm in the market.

<P>
   Imagine the unwashed folk who lounged around the fire with their
cups of foul ale in January 1000, wondering what the new millennium
might bring.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they hoped for a better way to sharpen knives or soothe
a throbbing tooth.
</P>
<P>
   But computers and genetic engineering? Inconceivable. Equally
futile are most of our own speculations about third-millennium
technology.
</P>
<P>
   At least we can be reasonably certain about predicting what will
occur in the heavens over specific periods.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, events can sometimes take us by surprise. Some comets, for
example, have such incredibly slow orbits _ 5,000 to 100,000 years
_ that every visit close to the sun seems like the first time
around.
</P>
<P>
   But others, like Halley's, follow shorter, more predictable
periods. Its next appearance in 2061 should be a winner _ the
comet's bright, fuzzy head will ie favorably in the northern sky
and its tail may span half the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are plenty of sky wonders on the way that
won't require a 60-year wait.
</P>
<P>
   A midnight lunar eclipse, easily visible throughout North
America on Jan. 20, for example, kicks off the new century in
style.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the rest of my top 10 list of the events for the early
years of the 21st century, astronomical headliners that require
nothing more than the naked eye:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000: &LR;  Jupiter approaches Saturn in the autumn sky. The
eye-catching meeting of these two giant planets happens once every
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2001: &LR;  Those in the upper half of the United States should look
northward for vivid displays of the aurora borealis, a by-product
of a peak in solar storm activity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2003: &LR;  On Aug. 27, Mars will venture closer to Earth than at
any time in the past 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   For six weeks the Red Planet will outshine everything else in
the night sky except for the moon and will be a delight through
backyard telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2004: &LR;  In June, for the first time since 1882, Venus will cross
the face of the sun. With a proper sun-dimming filter, this rare
type of eclipse, known as a transit, can be seen without a
telescope.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2004: &LR;  The first spacecraft to orbit Saturn will arrive at the
ringed planet for a four-year reconnaissance mission.
</P>
<P>
   Cassini is the last of a kind _ heavy, expensive and fully
loaded. Its arrival won't be visible, of course, but you can bet
that glitzy pictures from the billion-dollar mission will show up
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2006: &LR;  The moon's shadow will sweep over Egypt and run through
the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2009: &LR;  The greatest, longest solar eclipse of the 21st century
will cross China and the Pacific Ocean, offering a rare 6.5 minutes
of daytime darkness.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2012: &LR;  Venus will transit the sun again, the last such event of
the century. This time it will be visible from North America.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2017: &LR;  Breaking a 38-year drought, a total eclipse of the sun
will slash the United States from coast to coast, briefly turning
day into night. It will be our first glimpse of totality in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   So, even if we can't all be as prescient as Jules Verne, at
least we can predict SOME of the future.

<P>
   These days, you never really drive alone. Hidden beneath the
glass-and-steel skin of a sleek sedan or a boxy SUV hides a coterie
of computers that offer navigational tips, improved control and the
ability to call for assistance when something goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, that's only the beginning of the end of your
automotive autonomy. Before long, silicon chips will decide how you
should behave on the road, or whether you should be on the road at
all. You'll be behind the wheel, but you won't really be in the
driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   Crash response systems such as General Motors' OnStar hint at
where auto electronics are headed.
</P>
<P>
   OnStar links together a service center, air bags, the
satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS) and wireless
communications.
</P>
<P>
   When a vehicle gets into an accident, the air bag goes off, and
the electronics call a dispatcher. If the occupants are OK, they
can end the drill and drive away. If they're hurt or unable to
respond, the dispatcher notifies the nearest emergency crew using
signals from the GPS unit to guide rescuers.
</P>
<P>
   All well and good, perhaps, but not good enough for Ray
Resendes, program manager of the Department of Transportation's
two-year-old Intelligent Vehicle Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people are killed in auto accidents each
year. And driving isn't getting easier. Roads are becoming
increasingly crowded and drivers more distracted by built-in cell
phones, faxes, TV sets and, coming sooner than you think,
voice-activated PCs with full Web access.
</P>
<P>
   Under these conditions, it is all too easy for drivers to drift
out of their lanes or follow too closely. So one of the Intelligent
Vehicle Initiative's goals is to help bring to market affordable
collision warning systems, using radar or laser-based ranging
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of trucks and buses are already equipped with
primitive versions that warn drivers with beeps or flashing lights
when they approach traffic too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz offers a more sophisticated system called
``proximity controlled cruising'' that kicks in when cruise control
is switched on. It can preempt tailgating by easing off the gas or
applying the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Even more watchful systems are beginning to show up. One
incorporates a pair of motion sensors _ a yaw-rate sensor that
monitors how much the car is diverging from a nice tight turn, and
a lateral-acceleration sensor that monitors the car's sideways
motions. They are linked to the suspension, steering, antilock
braking and traction-control systems.
</P>
<P>
   A computer chews on the data, then determines whether the car is
heading where the driver wants it to go. If not, the computer cuts
back on the gas and activates individual brakes to tame the car's
trajectory.
</P>
<P>
   Limited stability-control systems are already mounted on many
Cadillacs Mercedes-Benzes and Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous researchers, including Jay Jakubczak, manager of Sandia
National Laboratories' Intelligent Micromachine Department, are
working on cheaper versions that could make the systems affordable
on all cars.
</P>
<P>
   Jakubczak sees no reason why computers shouldn't take over more
of the driving: ``If (the computer) says, `Hey, we're about to go
into a spin,' it can send power to different wheels, or brake
wheels, or reduce speed, or even steer to prevent that from
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Resendes looks forward to what he antiseptically calls ``roadway
departure prevention systems,'' embedded electronics that keep a
car on the straight and narrow even when drunk, sleepy, inept or
bored drivers lose track of where they're going.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies are developing video-based systems that scan
road markings and process them through pattern-recognition software
to warn drivers when they're straying.
</P>
<P>
   Although automakers are very reluctant to let computers take
over completely, a prototype auto developed at Carnegie Mellon
University follows lane markers handily without human assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have
identified a way to determine alertness by measuring droopy
eyelids. Vehicles may one day incorporate dashboard cameras to scan
drivers' eyes. Too much sag and the car will rouse the driver awake
with sounds, vibrations or even scents.
</P>
<P>
   As safety-monitoring systems multiply, cars also will become
easier to monitor. That sounds like a good idea to Jakubczak, who
has teen-age drivers in the house. He envisions a vehicle linked by
wireless transmitters to his home computer, allowing him to monitor
the way his children use the family car. In extreme cases, he could
remotely shut the engine down.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies are venturing in this direction. CarMon is a
stand-alone snoop box that attaches to an auto's interior, where
its motion sensors register and store information about
acceleration and deceleration.
</P>
<P>
   Parents or companies can dump that data onto a home computer to
graphically display aggressive, reckless or upright driving.
</P>
<P>
   Surveillance systems raise so many legal, law-enforcement,
insurance and regulatory implications that Resendes cannot imagine
them becoming common. Trucking companies might like to keep tabs on
their drivers but probably wouldn't install such devices for fear
that the police could demand the electronic information after an
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a sensing module in many new General Motors cars 
conducts a crude type of surveillance, recording the speed of a
car, whether the driver has applied the brakes, and whether the
driver was wearing a seat belt immediately before a crash.
</P>
<P>
   An onboard diagnostic computer already knows if your car is
polluting more than it should. That's just a step away from having
it report transgressions to environmental agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some degree, it's like the little black box in airplanes,''
says Allen Lyons, a manager at California's Air Resources Board.
The board is considering requiring next-generation onboard monitors
to transmit emissions data to the Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons says that would be a convenience, because only dirty cars
would be summoned to an emissions inspection center.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons acknowledges the proposal raises Big Brother worries.
Who's to know if the black box isn't relaying other information,
like speed data, that could bring on a different kind of summons?
</P>
<P>
   Lyons suggests that a switch would allow an owner to activate
the transmitter only when it's time to certify a vehicle's
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Such manual controls should help calm fears, but the warm
embrace drivers have given to traction systems and active
suspensions has already let the control cat out of the bag. That
independent, open-road feeling may never be the same.

can end the drill and drive away. If they're hurt or unable to
respond, the dispatcher notifies the nearest emergency crew using
signals from the GPS unit to guide rescuers.
</P>
<P>
   All well and good, perhaps, but not good enough for Ray
Resendes, program manager of the Department of Transportation's
two-year-old Intelligent Vehicle Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people are killed in auto accidents each
year. And driving isn't getting easier. Roads are becoming
increasingly crowded and drivers more distracted by built-in cell
phones, faxes, TV sets and, coming sooner than you think,
voice-activated PCs with full Web access.
</P>
<P>
   Under these conditions, it is all too easy for drivers to drift
out of their lanes or follow too closely. So one of the Intelligent
Vehicle Initiative's goals is to help bring to market affordable
collision warning systems, using radar or laser-based ranging
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of trucks and buses are already equipped with
primitive versions that warn drivers with beeps or flashing lights
when they approach traffic too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz offers a more sophisticated system called
``proximity controlled cruising'' that kicks in when cruise control
is switched on. It can preempt tailgating by easing off the gas or
applying the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Even more watchful systems are beginning to show up. One
incorporates a pair of motion sensors _ a yaw-rate sensor that
monitors how much the car is diverging from a nice tight turn, and
a lateral-acceleration sensor that monitors the car's sideways
motions. They are linked to the suspension, steering, antilock
braking and traction-control systems.
</P>
<P>
   A computer chews on the data, then determines whether the car is
heading where the driver wants it to go. If not, the computer cuts
back on the gas and activates individual brakes to tame the car's
trajectory.
</P>
<P>
   Limited stability-control systems are already mounted on many
Cadillacs Mercedes-Benzes and Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous researchers, including Jay Jakubczak, manager of Sandia
National Laboratories' Intelligent Micromachine Department, are
working on cheaper versions that could make the systems affordable
on all cars.
</P>
<P>
   Jakubczak sees no reason why computers shouldn't take over more
of the driving: ``If (the computer) says, `Hey, we're about to go
into a spin,' it can send power to different wheels, or brake
wheels, or reduce speed, or even steer to prevent that from
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Resendes looks forward to what he antiseptically calls ``roadway
departure prevention systems,'' embedded electronics that keep a
car on the straight and narrow even when drunk, sleepy, inept or
bored drivers lose track of where they're going.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies are developing video-based systems that scan
road markings and process them through pattern-recognition software
to warn drivers when they're straying.
</P>
<P>
   Although automakers are very reluctant to let computers take
over completely, a prototype auto developed at Carnegie Mellon
University follows lane markers handily without human assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have
identified a way to determine alertness by measuring droopy
eyelids. Vehicles may one day incorporate dashboard cameras to scan
drivers' eyes. Too much sag and the car will rouse the driver awake
with sounds, vibrations or even scents.
</P>
<P>
   As safety-monitoring systems multiply, cars also will become
easier to monitor. That sounds like a good idea to Jakubczak, who
has teen-age drivers in the house. He envisions a vehicle linked by
wireless transmitters to his home computer, allowing him to monitor
the way his children use the family car. In extreme cases, he could
remotely shut the engine down.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies are venturing in this direction. CarMon is a
stand-alone snoop box that attaches to an auto's interior, where
its motion sensors register and store information about
acceleration and deceleration.
</P>
<P>
   Parents or companies can dump that data onto a home computer to
graphically display aggressive, reckless or upright driving.
</P>
<P>
   Surveillance systems raise so many legal, law-enforcement,
insurance and regulatory implications that Resendes cannot imagine
them becoming common. Trucking companies might like to keep tabs on
their drivers but probably wouldn't install such devices for fear
that the police could demand the electronic information after an
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a sensing module in many new General Motors cars already
conducts a crude type of surveillance, recording the speed of a
car, whether the driver has applied the brakes, and whether the
driver was wearing a seat belt immediately before a crash.
</P>
<P>
   An onboard diagnostic computer already knows if your car is
polluting more than it should. That's just a step away from having
it report transgressions to environmental agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some degree, it's like the little black box in airplanes,''
says Allen Lyons, a manager at California's Air Resources Board.
The board is considering requiring next-generation onboard monitors
to transmit emissions data to the Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons says that would be a convenience, because only dirty cars
would be summoned to an emissions inspection center.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons acknowledges the proposal raises Big Brother worries.
Who's to know if the black box isn't relaying other information,
like speed data, that could bring on a different kind of summons?
</P>
<P>
   Lyons suggests that a switch would allow an owner to activate
the transmitter only when it's time to certify a vehicle's
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Such manual controls should help calm fears, but the warm
embrace drivers have given to traction systems and active
suspensions has already let the control cat out of the bag. That
independent, open-road feeling may never be the same.

<P>
   Imagine the unwashed folk who lounged around the fire with their
cups of foul ale in January 1000, wondering what the new millennium
might bring.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they hoped for a better way to sharpen knives or soothe
a throbbing tooth.
</P>
<P>
   But computers and genetic engineering? Inconceivable. Equally
futile are most of our own speculations about third-millennium
technology.
</P>
<P>
   At least we can be reasonably certain about predicting what will
occur in the heavens over specific periods.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, events can sometimes take us by surprise. Some comets, for
example, have such incredibly slow orbits _ 5,000 to 100,000 years
_ that every visit close to the sun seems like the first time
around.
</P>
<P>
   But others, like Halley's, follow shorter, more predictable
periods. Its next appearance in 2061 should be a winner _ the
comet's bright, fuzzy head will ie favorably in the northern sky
and its tail may span half the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are plenty of sky wonders on the way that
won't require a 60-year wait.
</P>
<P>
   A midnight lunar eclipse, easily visible throughout North
America on Jan. 20, for example, kicks off the new century in
style.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the rest of my top 10 list of the events for the early
years of the 21st century, astronomical headliners that require
nothing more than the naked eye:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000: &LR;  Jupiter approaches Saturn in the autumn sky. The
eye-catching meeting of these two giant planets happens once every
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2001: &LR;  Those in the upper half of the United States should look
northward for vivid displays of the aurora borealis, a by-product
of a peak in solar storm activity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2003: &LR;  On Aug. 27, Mars will venture closer to Earth than at
any time in the past 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   For six weeks the Red Planet will outshine everything else in
the night sky except for the moon and will be a delight through
backyard telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2004: &LR;  In June, for the first time since 1882, Venus will cross
the face of the sun. With a proper sun-dimming filter, this rare
type of eclipse, known as a transit, can be seen without a
telescope.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2004: &LR;  The first spacecraft to orbit Saturn will arrive at the
ringed planet for a four-year reconnaissance mission.
</P>
<P>
   Cassini is the last of a kind _ heavy, expensive and fully
loaded. Its arrival won't be visible, of course, but you can bet
that glitzy pictures from the billion-dollar mission will show up
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2006: &LR;  The moon's shadow will sweep over Egypt and run through
the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2009: &LR;  The greatest, longest solar eclipse of the 21st century
will cross China and the Pacific Ocean, offering a rare 6.5 minutes
of daytime darkness.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2012: &LR;  Venus will transit the sun again, the last such event of
the century. This time it will be visible from North America.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2017: &LR;  Breaking a 38-year drought, a total eclipse of the sun
will slash the United States from coast to coast, briefly turning
day into night. It will be our first glimpse of totality in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   So, even if we can't all be as prescient as Jules Verne, at
least we can predict SOME of the future.

   These days, you never really drive alone. Hidden beneath the
glass-and-steel skin of a sleek sedan or a boxy SUV hides a coterie
of computers that offer navigational tips, improved control and the
ability to call for assistance when something goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, that's only the beginning of the end of your
automotive autonomy. Before long, silicon chips will decide how you
should behave on the road, or whether you should be on the road at
all. You'll be behind the wheel, but you won't really be in the
driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   Crash response systems such as General Motors' OnStar hint at
where auto electronics are headed.
</P>
<P>
   OnStar links together a service center, air bags, the
satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS) and wireless
communications.

satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS) and wireless
communications.
</P>
<P>
   When a vehicle gets into an accident, the air bag goes off, and
the electronics call a dispatcher. If the occupants are OK, they
can end the drill and drive away. If they're hurt or unable to
respond, the dispatcher notifies the nearest emergency crew using
signals from the GPS unit to guide rescuers.
</P>
<P>
   All well and good, perhaps, but not good enough for Ray
Resendes, program manager of the Department of Transportation's
two-year-old Intelligent Vehicle Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people are killed in auto accidents each
year. And driving isn't getting easier. Roads are becoming
increasingly crowded and drivers more distracted by built-in cell
phones, faxes, TV sets and, coming sooner than you think,
voice-activated PCs with full Web access.
</P>
<P>
   Under these conditions, it is all too easy for drivers to drift
out of their lanes or follow too closely. So one of the Intelligent
Vehicle Initiative's goals is to help bring to market affordable
collision warning systems, using radar or laser-based ranging
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of trucks and buses are already equipped with
primitive versions that warn drivers with beeps or flashing lights
when they approach traffic too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz offers a more sophisticated system called
``proximity controlled cruising'' that kicks in when cruise control
is switched on. It can preempt tailgating by easing off the gas or
applying the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Even more watchful systems are beginning to show up. One
incorporates a pair of motion sensors _ a yaw-rate sensor that
monitors how much the car is diverging from a nice tight turn, and
a lateral-acceleration sensor that monitors the car's sideways
motions. They are linked to the suspension, steering, antilock
braking and traction-control systems.
</P>
<P>
   A computer chews on the data, then determines whether the car is
heading where the driver wants it to go. If not, the computer cuts
back on the gas and activates individual brakes to tame the car's
trajectory.
</P>
<P>
   Limited stability-control systems are already mounted on many
Cadillacs Mercedes-Benzes and Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous researchers, including Jay Jakubczak, manager of Sandia
National Laboratories' Intelligent Micromachine Department, are
working on cheaper versions that could make the systems affordable
on all cars.
</P>
<P>
   Jakubczak sees no reason why computers shouldn't take over more
of the driving: ``If (the computer) says, `Hey, we're about to go
into a spin,' it can send power to different wheels, or brake
wheels, or reduce speed, or even steer to prevent that from
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Resendes looks forward to what he antiseptically calls ``roadway
departure prevention systems,'' embedded electronics that keep a
car on the straight and narrow even when drunk, sleepy, inept or
bored drivers lose track of where they're going.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies are developing video-based systems that scan
road markings and process them through pattern-recognition software
to warn drivers when they're straying.
</P>
<P>
   Although automakers are very reluctant to let computers take
over completely, a prototype auto developed at Carnegie Mellon
University follows lane markers handily without human assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have
identified a way to determine alertness by measuring droopy
eyelids. Vehicles may one day incorporate dashboard cameras to scan
drivers' eyes. Too much sag and the car will rouse the driver awake
with sounds, vibrations or even scents.
</P>
<P>
   As safety-monitoring systems multiply, cars also will become
easier to monitor. That sounds like a good idea to Jakubczak, who
has teen-age drivers in the house. He envisions a vehicle linked by
wireless transmitters to his home computer, allowing him to monitor
the way his children use the family car. In extreme cases, he could
remotely shut the engine down.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies are venturing in this direction. CarMon is a
stand-alone snoop box that attaches to an auto's interior, where
its motion sensors register and store information about
acceleration and deceleration.
</P>
<P>
   Parents or companies can dump that data onto a home computer to
graphically display aggressive, reckless or upright driving.
</P>
<P>
   Surveillance systems raise so many legal, law-enforcement,
insurance and regulatory implications that Resendes cannot imagine
them becoming common. Trucking companies might like to keep tabs on
their drivers but probably wouldn't install such devices for fear
that the police could demand the electronic information after an
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a sensing module in many new General Motors cars already
conducts a crude type of surveillance, recording the speed of a
car, whether the driver has applied the brakes, and whether the
driver was wearing a seat belt immediately before a crash.
</P>
<P>
   An onboard diagnostic computer already knows if your car is
polluting more than it should. That's just a step away from having
it report transgressions to environmental agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some degree, it's like the little black box in airplanes,''
says Allen Lyons, a manager at California's Air Resources Board.
The board is considering requiring next-generation onboard monitors
to transmit emissions data to the Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons says that would be a convenience, because only dirty cars
would be summoned to an emissions inspection center.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons acknowledges the proposal raises Big Brother worries.
Who's to know if the black box isn't relaying other information,
like speed data, that could bring on a different kind of summons?
</P>
<P>
   Lyons suggests that a switch would allow an owner to activate
the transmitter only when it's time to certify a vehicle's
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Such manual controls should help calm fears, but the warm
embrace drivers have given to traction systems and active
suspensions has already let the control cat out of the bag. That
independent, open-road feeling may never be the same.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tobey Maguire, a slight figure in T-shirt and
sweatpants with a dusting of beard on his pale face, pulls out a
plastic box and snaps it open. He's in a coffeehouse on the Sunset
Strip, a bowl of oatmeal in front of him and Baroque music blasting
from a speaker behind, as he studies a multicolored array of
pebble-textured pills so big they look like a display in a
Hollywood Boulevard rock shop.
</P>
<P>
   They're vitamins, and gulping them down on doctor's orders is
the price Maguire is paying for a strep throat _ which in turn may
be the price for working so hard the past couple of years bringing
enigmatic youthful angst to receptive moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   After grabbing the attention of critics as the lonely
prep-schooler in ``The Ice Storm'' and the yearning, TV-besotted
suburban kid in ``Pleasantville,'' Maguire is currently breaking
out as the star of three back-to-back movies.
</P>
<P>
   First there was Ang Lee's bloody epic ``Ride With the Devil,''
in which he appeared as a young Bushwhacker losing his innocence to
the Civil War and his virginity to a widow played by Jewel.
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by Lasse Hallstrom's ``The Cider House
Rules,'' based on John Irving's novel, with Maguire as the naive
orphan hero, Homer.
</P>
<P>
   And he just finished Curtis Hanson's ``Wonder Boys,'' in which
he appears as Michael Douglas' brilliant, suicidal student. The
film is due out early next year year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need a little recovery time to get them out of my system,''
Maguire says about the string of intense movies, in a voice that
still wobbles like a teen-ager's. ``It's like a relationship. It
feels almost weird to work with another director. It feels like
you're betraying the other one.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening to directors talk about Maguire makes working with him
sound just as much like a love affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was strangely exhilarating,'' says Hallstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin Dunne, who directed the actor as a doubt-riddled teen in
the Oscar-nominated 1995 short ``The Duke of Groove,'' mentions
Maguire's soulful gaze. ``Those eyes,'' he says. ``I could tell
there was so much going on behind them. But whenever I would say
that, Tobey would say, `There's nothing going on.'''
</P>
<P>
   Maguire's understated performance in ``The Cider House Rules''
depended so much on those expressive eyes _ and little else _ that
it made the suits a bit nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Hallstrom says he did hear from Miramax _ but wasn't fazed. The
movie ended up getting a 2 1/2-minute standing ovation at the 1999
Venice Film Festival, which gets Maguire damp-eyed remembering.
</P>
<P>
   Considering his beginnings, Maguire's quiet self-confidence is
something of a marvel. Granted, he began acting in commercials and
on television at the age of 13, after his mother, a secretary,
persuaded him to take drama lessons. But his parents had divorced
when he was only 2, and poverty followed, accompanied by a series
of moves through some of L.A.'s drearier suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I grew up on the wrong side of the tracks. I
had food to eat and a roof over my head,'' he says, hesitating, but
adds, ``There was a moment when we were really poor and I spent a
night in a shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   In those days, his circumstances were deeply embarrassing to
him. Now, it is his earlier discomfiture that worries him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who was I embarrassed for? Who cared what they really
thought?'' he wonders out loud. ``Strangers in a grocery store when
the food stamps came out? People in the doctor's office when we
were going to use the Medi-Cal stickers?''
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, though, Maguire had an inexplicable faith in
his ability to make it as an actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was, like, 16, I would turn down stuff that I thought
was really, really cheesy,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   At 24, it's still something he worries about. In a lawsuit that
he and Leonardo DiCaprio settled recently, an independent producer
accused them of trying to squelch distribution of a low-budget
movie they'd made in 1995 because of Maguire's concern for his
image.
</P>
<P>
   He also seems loath to appear to be riding the coattails of
DiCaprio, a longtime friend (and sometime partner in crime during
DiCaprio's rowdier nightlife episodes) who earlier helped him get a
role in ``This Boy's Life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a friend like any other friend, and we see each other,''
Maguire says, shrugging uncomfortably, even though DiCaprio calls
during a photo shoot to discuss plans for his birthday party that
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never went through the cliche of `Now I'm going to get
f---ed up,'' Dunne says of Maguire, pointing to a group of
fast-living young Hollywood actors who didn't finish high school,
don't plan on going to college and sleep in each other's cars and
on floors.
</P>
<P>
   Maguire, too, was a high-school dropout who wasn't planning on
college when Dunne met him. But, Dunne says, ``He's always been
levelheaded. He made a decision that he wasn't going to let dope
and booze be a part of his life,'' he says. ``And it wasn't as if
he had to come out of rehab to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that he doesn't run with the pack _ and in the
process has developed an image a tad more worldly than the
wide-eyed innocents he plays onscreen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can be drastically funny, outspoken and sarcastic,'' says
Hallstrom, who saw that side of him on the ``Cider House'' set.
``And his EQ is high _ his emotional quotient.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think closer to his core is an open heart,'' says Maguire's
``Ride With the Devil'' co-star Jeffrey Wright. ``The reason he can
bring these things out in films is not solely out of role
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Open heart or not, Maguire has coached himself to keep mum about
his love life. What is known is that he has an on-again-off-again
relationship with Quincy Jones's daughter, model Rashida Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I leave those questions well alone,'' he says with a little
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   But total secrecy, not to mention a normal adolescence, is the
price of early fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a strange thing to start your career at 13,'' says
Maguire, who regrets dropping out of school. ``I've definitely had
another form of education. I'm pretty good at figuring stuff out in
my head mathematically, but I don't really know how to write a
letter properly. I can't remember what I learned about the
structure of sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   He curls his long upper lip in his cat-ate-the-canary grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my understanding of mortality and responsibility is
growing.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Linda Wachner has company.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the corporate halls of fashion, retailing and beauty
were dominated by men. But women are hitting the industry's topmost
echelons in greater numbers and Wachner, Warnaco's high-profile
boss and a pioneer in the old boys' club, isn't the only woman
running the show anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Two developments last month presented further evidence that
there's a new breed of executive breaking into the top ranks:
Within days, Andrea Jung was appointed chief executive officer of
Avon and Christina Johnson was named ceo of Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jung stands alone as the only female to be running a
Fortune 500 fashion or beauty company. The three other female ceo's
in the Fortune 500 are Carleton S. Fiorina of Hewlett-Packard, Jill
E. Barad of Mattel and Marion D. Sandler of Golden West Financial.
</P>
<P>
   But in terms of running multimillion- or even
multibillion-dollar corporations, women are well represented. In
addition to Wachner, Jung and Johnson, there's Lillian Vernon,
chairman and ceo of the firm bearing her name; Carolee Friedlander,
ceo of Carolee Designs; Josie Natori, ceo of Natori Co.; Josephine
Chaus, chairwoman of Chaus, Inc.; Jessica McClintock,
owner/designer of Jessica McClintock; Eileen Fisher, owner of the
sportswear firm bearing her name; Carole Hochman, ceo of Carole
Hochman Designs, and Diane Von Furstenberg, who heads her own
ready-to-wear company, DVF Studio.
</P>
<P>
   Also over the past several years, women have gained more ground
and more authority to run fashion and beauty divisions of larger
conglomerates. Companies such as The Gap, The Limited, Dayton
Hudson, Liz Claiborne, Federated and Jones Apparel Group are among
those that have steadily elevated women to top positions. In fact,
female division presidents are plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   There's Jeanne Jackson, president of Banana Republic; Robin
Burns, president of IBI Intimate Beauty Corp.; Grace A. Nichols,
chief executive officer of Victoria's Secret Stores (a division of
Intimate Brands); Beth M. Pritchard, ceo of Bath &AMP; Body Works,
another division of IBI; Patricia DeRosa, president of Ann Taylor;
Marie Holman-Rao, president of Limited Design Services; Janet
Grove, chairman and ceo of the Federated Merchandising Group;
Vanessa Castagna, executive vice president and chief operating
officer of J.C. Penney Stores, merchandising and catalog, and Susan
Kronick, chairman of Burdine's, among others.
</P>
<P>
   On fashion's manufacturing side, there's Denise Seegal,
president of Liz Claiborne Inc.; Jackwyn Nemerov, president of the
Jones Apparel Group; Mindy Grossman, president and ceo of Polo
Jeans; Carol Hochman, chief executive officer of Danskin, and
Christa Michalaros, president of Tommy Hilfiger women's sportswear.
</P>
<P>
   And in the rapidly evolving world of e-commerce, women
executives are sprouting up all over the landscape. Meg Whitman,
chief executive officer of eBay; Candice Carpenter, chairman and
ceo of iVillage Inc., and Nancy Evans, president of iVillage, are
just a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't see any ceilings in the world you and I live
in,'' said Hal Reiter, president and ceo of Herbert Mines
Associates, an executive search firm here. ``No one says to me, `I
want a guy.'' I don't even think it's an issue anymore. Women have
been very successful in fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when we get an assignment for a ceo in the fashion
business, it's completely gender neutral. I always say, `Do you
have a preference?' and they say, `I'd love a woman. It's a
complete demonstration by women that they are as completely capable
as men, if not more,''' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   The accelerated growth of the Internet has created many
opportunities for women, since the rules of the game _ and the
necessary job skills _ haven't been clearly defined yet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the advances, women are still a minority in the
executive suites, and some recruiters say their take-home pay still
lags behind the men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (women's) deals are perhaps not as lucrative since their
negotiating skills are not as inbred and honed as some of their
male counterparts,'' said Terre Simpson, owner of Simpson
Associates, an executive search firm here. She noted that some men,
whose skills might not be as good, are ``terrific negotiators,''
able to carve out larger packages for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But Herbert Mines's Reiter believes that women, at least on the
ceo level, are getting equal pay. ``Look at Linda Wachner,'' he
said, perennially one of the highest paid executives in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is women are being paid as much as men,'' said
Reiter. ``And they don't negotiate themselves. They usually have
their lawyer or headhunter do it.'' Plus, he said, these women
ceo's didn't get to the top posts by being shrinking violets when
it comes to compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard's Fiorina is said to have a total compensation
package worth $5.25 million, and Mattel's Barad's compensation is
$4.75 million. Meanwhile, the Gap's Drexler pulled in $7.8 million
in total compensation. Leonard Lauder's total compensation was $6.6
million, while the Limited's Wexner had a total compensation of
$2.7 million. In 1998, Jung, who was then president and chief
operating officer of Avon, received $5 million, largely reflecting
$3.8 million in restricted stock.
</P>
<P>
   Jung, 41, now runs a $5.2 billion conglomerate. She also serves
on the board of General Electric, the Fragrance Foundation,
Cosmetic Executive Women and Princeton University, of which she's a
graduate. She was named to Fortune's list of ``50 Most Powerful
Women in American Business,'' in both 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Jung is a prime example of a woman who has handily cracked the
top tier and sees herself as a role model for her daughter. In an
interview following her appointment, Jung described being a working
mother as ``tough'' and ``challenging,'' but said she was excited
by setting an example for her 10-year-old daughter and her friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest rounds of applause I got was when I walked
into a birthday party just yesterday and all of her friends thought
it was a great thing that a woman got to the top and they're all 10
years old ... I think there is something in that.''
</P>
<P>
   When Dayton Hudson's Linda Ahlers was interviewed earlier this
year, she said she never found barriers to her advancement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you create your own ceilings,'' said Ahlers.
``Personally, if I started to think there was a glass ceiling,
there would have been one for me. I won't let it exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the 48-year-old chief executive officer and president
of Saks Fifth Avenue here, said, ``I have been very fortunate in my
career. I worked for Philip Miller for 17 years and he's been a
huge mentor in terms of my professional growth. He fostered a
leadership style that's one of equality.'' Johnson noted that women
comprise 75 percent of the Saks Fifth Avenue's staff and 50 percent
of the executive board.
</P>
<P>
   Do women have to work harder than men to get ahead? Johnson
noted that results can be easily measured in fashion retailing, so
``performance is not gender-related ... (but) if anything, I
believe that women, because of the fact they've had a different
equality mechanism in the workplace, have an innate pressure to
perform. They are constantly aware of how they're perceived in the
workplace and have a much stronger need to excel.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngest child in her family, Johnson said she was trained
at an early age to strive for achievement. Johnson majored in
sociology at Loyola University, which, she said, ``helped
tremendously in terms of development of people.'' And while she
described her ascension in retailing ``as a steady climb,'' she
attributed her success to a very diverse career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come up through the merchandising ranks,'' said
Johnson, noting she worked for Marshall Field's stand-alone catalog
and was a general merchandise manager at Saks before handling store
operations. ``The key for any woman in terms of running a company
today is to develop general management skills,'' she noted.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the defining moment was when she realized she had a
shot at the top post, she said: ``After the merger (with Profitt's)
and when Brad Martin became chairman of the company, he elevated me
to vice chairman. At this point I realized there was a significant
opportunity to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the path, management style has a lot to do with the
success of the industry's top female executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think I have a participatory management style,''
said Johnson. ``Am I tough? I've heard that said about me. Maybe. I
firmly believe it's a team that brings an organization to its
highest capability. I very much like to have my management style
reflect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Mines' Reiter said the reason there haven't been more
women in top positions is really based on numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only X amount of women in the business ... Because
there are fewer women to choose from, fewer women move to the
top,'' contended Reiter.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamics differ by industry, however. Reiter said when he
conducts a beauty search, generally 75 percent of the candidates
are women. For a retail fashion position, usually 25 percent are
female candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot more women in cosmetics and beauty than
anywhere else. It's where the inventory is,'' said Reiter. He said
that when he conducted the Ann Taylor (president) search, ``almost
every candidate they saw was a woman.'' They chose Patricia DeRosa,
former executive vice president of Charming Shoppes; before that,
she had been president of GapKids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skills are what's rising to the top, not the gender,''
said Terre Simpson of Simpson Associates. ``I think finally, after
much duress, it's beginning to be a level playing field. Women are
primed now and are moving up above the midmanagement level.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the mind-set changing and acknowledging women's
contributions. Now, they assess a person on their business acumen
and contribution, rather than gender,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hart, partner in the executive search firm Spencer Stuart
and managing director of its North American retail practice,
observed that although fashion and beauty companies have
historically recruited women, women are now rising to the top
across virtually every industry.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that the Internet has created many such
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the advent of the Internet, you can go off the big
corporate tracks and give them (women) the leverage of full
corporate responsibility,'' Hart said. ``What I do think about the
Internet is the rules aren't written yet _ who the right person has
to be and what traditional route you have to come up. It's not just
women, but diversity in the Internet. There are fabulous
opportunities for women. There used to be a premium for gray hair.
Now there's a premium for youth.''
</P>
<P>
   While some women may be attracted to Internet positions, others
are apparently content with more conventional venues. ``The lure of
potential compensation, to be part of something that will hopefully
go public, catches a lot of people's eyes. But some people are very
content in non e-commerce. Those channels won't go away. They have
some amazing business challenges running traditional companies with
traditional channels of distribution,'' said Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Jung and Johnson, she said these women have plenty
of opportunities to run huge management teams and global
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrea (Jung) is someone who is remarkably bright. She is one
of the most outstanding people in leadership. She has a delightful
personality. She's very determined and accomplished with huge
interpersonal skills,'' Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   She said a lot of women are content running important divisions
_ if not exactly the ceo slot. ``There are fabulous women who are
running divisions of companies who will either be picked off and
become a ceo, or it may not be their total driving force. They
might have enough autonomy and are very satisfied,'' said Hart.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that a lot of men find satisfaction in the
decision-making and leadership role, but there are plenty of people
who can do that within the confines of a company. She pointed to
Ann Fudge, president of the Maxwell House and Post divisions of
Kraft Foods, who also sits on three boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're challenged and well respected, and treated well by
your company ... you add it all up in the end. By the time you
reach the top, the pay check is pretty good. Lots of women have
made self-selecting choices. Sometimes they're the candidates for
the ceo jobs, and they're the ones who pass,'' said Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she said, executives need a global perspective and
companies have to provide the experience to round out their skills.
She believes that many of today's female ceo's come from the
marketing ranks. ``Marketing tends to be the function that's king
in consumer companies. Those functions are cluttered with women,''
said Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Melanie Kusin, managing partner of the consumer practice at
Heidrick &AMP; Struggles, an executive search firm here, doesn't
believe that the fashion and beauty industries have lagged behind
other industries in naming female ceo's.
</P>
<P>
   ``In creatively driven businesses such as these, women have been
pulled to them. Any faster-paced businesses have been more
appealing to women,'' said Kusin.
</P>
<P>
   She said Jung's appointment at Avon gives other companies the
confidence that it can happen and that it's not that big a risk.
Like men, Kusin noted, some female ceo's will be successful, and
some won't. ``The issue of gender will become less important. Who
succeeds and who doesn't depends on leadership skills.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Kusin agreed that e-businesses are a natural place
for women to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are geared to run these businesses based on the speed of
change and chaos, so it's common to see women in start-ups, because
of their sheer creativity and the ability to see where it all needs
to go. It plays to women's strong suits.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Linda Wachner has company.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the corporate halls of fashion, retailing and beauty
were dominated by men. But women are hitting the industry's topmost
echelons in greater numbers and Wachner, Warnaco's high-profile
boss and a pioneer in the old boys' club, isn't the only woman
running the show anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Two developments last month presented further evidence that
there's a new breed of executive breaking into the top ranks:
Within days, Andrea Jung was appointed chief executive officer of
Avon and Christina Johnson was named ceo of Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jung stands alone as the only female to be running a
Fortune 500 fashion or beauty company. The three other female ceo's
in the Fortune 500 are Carleton S. Fiorina of Hewlett-Packard, Jill
E. Barad of Mattel and Marion D. Sandler of Golden West Financial.
</P>
<P>
   But in terms of running multimillion- or even
multibillion-dollar corporations, women are well represented. In
addition to Wachner, Jung and Johnson, there's Lillian Vernon,
chairman and ceo of the firm bearing her name; Carolee Friedlander,
ceo of Carolee Designs; Josie Natori, ceo of Natori Co.; Josephine
Chaus, chairwoman of Chaus, Inc.; Jessica McClintock,
owner/designer of Jessica McClintock; Eileen Fisher, owner of the
sportswear firm bearing her name; Carole Hochman, ceo of Carole
Hochman Designs, and Diane Von Furstenberg, who heads her own
ready-to-wear company, DVF Studio.
</P>
<P>
   Also over the past several years, women have gained more ground
and more authority to run fashion and beauty divisions of larger
conglomerates. Companies such as The Gap, The Limited, Dayton
Hudson, Liz Claiborne, Federated and Jones Apparel Group are among
those that have steadily elevated women to top positions. In fact,
female division presidents are plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   There's Jeanne Jackson, president of Banana Republic; Robin
Burns, president of IBI Intimate Beauty Corp.; Grace A. Nichols,
chief executive officer of Victoria's Secret Stores (a division of
Intimate Brands); Beth M. Pritchard, ceo of Bath &AMP; Body Works,
another division of IBI; Patricia DeRosa, president of Ann Taylor;
Marie Holman-Rao, president of Limited Design Services; Janet
Grove, chairman and ceo of the Federated Merchandising Group;
Vanessa Castagna, executive vice president and chief operating
officer of J.C. Penney Stores, merchandising and catalog, and Susan
Kronick, chairman of Burdine's, among others.
</P>
<P>
   On fashion's manufacturing side, there's Denise Seegal,
president of Liz Claiborne Inc.; Jackwyn Nemerov, president of the
Jones Apparel Group; Mindy Grossman, president and ceo of Polo
Jeans; Carol Hochman, chief executive officer of Danskin, and
Christa Michalaros, president of Tommy Hilfiger women's sportswear.
</P>
<P>
   And in the rapidly evolving world of e-commerce, women
executives are sprouting up all over the landscape. Meg Whitman,
chief executive officer of eBay; Candice Carpenter, chairman and
ceo of iVillage Inc., and Nancy Evans, president of iVillage, are
just a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't see any ceilings in the world you and I live
in,'' said Hal Reiter, president and ceo of Herbert Mines
Associates, an executive search firm here. ``No one says to me, `I
want a guy.'' I don't even think it's an issue anymore. Women have
been very successful in fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when we get an assignment for a ceo in the fashion
business, it's completely gender neutral. I always say, `Do you
have a preference?' and they say, `I'd love a woman. It's a
complete demonstration by women that they are as completely capable
as men, if not more,''' he noted.
</P>

recycling program for more than 30 years. Send card fronts only,
with no writing on the reverse, to: St. Jude's Ranch for Children,

</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you explain the difference in the ratings that analysts
at brokerage firms give to stocks, such as ``market perform'' or
``attractive,'' and list them in order, from best to worst?
</P>
<P>
   A: Such ratings are designed to tell investors what the analyst
thinks the stock will do 6 to 12 months in the future. But since
every stock brokerage has its own rating system, there's no
universal list, and no way to rank ratings as you suggest.
</P>
<P>
   There are absolutely only three options available to an investor
with respect to a share of stock: You can buy it, sell it or hold
it. That's why it's always puzzling to see a menu of 8 or 10
ratings, such as ``strong buy'' or the combination of ``short-term
hold'' and ``long-term buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Another point: The investor always should find out if the
analyst making the rating works for a company that underwrote the
stock he or she is rating. If Fly-By-Night Securities analyst
Andrew Smythe comes out with a ``buy'' rating on XYZ Gadgets, it
might make a difference to know that Fly-By-Night makes a market in
that stock or took it public. Has the analyst ever issued a
``sell'' rating, for example?
</P>
<P>
   Several books have information you'll find useful. Jane Bryant
Quinn, for one, updates her money management books every year.
Another good reference, also updated yearly, is ``Dun &AMP; Bradstreet
Guide to Your Invesments (1999 or 2000),'' by Nancy Dunnan.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the classical music played during a Publix
supermarkets commercial over the holidays showing the treetop
angel, little toy soldiers and snowman eating all the food from the
dinner table?
</P>
<P>
   A: Several pieces of music were ``reconfigured'' to create an
original composition, said Tanya Coleman, Publix spokeswoman. At
some point Publix hopes to make the music from its commercials
available to customers, she said, and will advertise that when it
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many Roman Catholics are there in the world? Which
country ranks first in the Catholic percentage of its population?
</P>
<P>
   A: The number is estimated to be about 1 billion, making it the
largest body of Christians in the world, according to World Book
Encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Annuario Pontifico, the Statistical Yearbook of the
Church (published by the Vatican Secretariat of State), and
assorted Catholic Conferences around the world tabulate statistics
on the percentage of the Catholic population of various countries.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Bunson of Our Sunday Visitor's Catholic Almanac listed
these as the world's 25 ``most Catholic'' countries: Italy, 97
percent; Luxembourg, 96; Poland, 95.5; Ireland, 95; Ecuador, 93.8;
El Salvador and Spain, 93.5; Malta and Portugal, 92; Venezuela, 91;
Peru, 90.4; Argentina and Mexico, 90; Colombia, 89.8; Dominican
Republic, 89.3; Nicaragua, Equatorial Guinea and Seychelles, 89;
Bolivia, 88.6; Costa Rica, 88; Paraguay and Haiti, 87; Panama,
86.5; Brazil, 86; and Guatemala, 85.
</P>
<P>
   Bunson emphasized that the rankings would differ if numbers of
people were used instead of percentages of the population. But
those numbers were not available in the statistical yearbook, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The term ``soft money'' is often used to distinguish certain
kinds of political contributions. What is soft money, and is there
``hard money,'' too?
</P>
<P>
   A: Soft money refers to contributions that are not regulated by
federal election laws. Hard money falls under federal regulation;
every hard dollar counts against contribution limits for
individuals and political action committees. In addition,
corporations and labor unions may not give to candidates for
Congress and the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money can be given in unlimited amounts to political
parties. Technically, it is supposed to be used for state and local
political activity, such as voter registration and get-out-the-vote
drives, and for generic TV ads that support party platforms, but
not specific candidates. This exemption from federal regulation was
intended to encourage general party-building activities, and its
supporters refer to it as civic-minded contributions.
</P>
<P>
   But as it has evolved over the years, soft money has become a
gaping loophole that contributors have used to give vast sums to
bolster their influence, or at least access. And the parties have
used soft money to pay their fixed expenses or purchase expensive
computers, freeing up other money for direct support of candidates.
Also, corporations and unions may contribute soft money. Soft money
is especially sought during the general election campaign for
president, since the candidates themselves may only use
government-provided money for their campaigns. Many of the abuses
during the 1996 campaign involved soft money contributions to the
Democratic party.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are events unfolding faster than ever in the 2000
presidential campaign?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. As recently as eight years ago, candidate Bill Clinton
did not jump into the Democratic presidential race until Oct. 3 of
the year before the election. At the same point in 1999, candidate
George W. Bush already had raised $56 million. And perhaps more
telling, five Republican candidates, Dan Quayle and Elizabeth Dole
most prominent among them, already had dropped out, months before a
vote had been cast. In 1991, then-New York Gov. Mario Cuomo waited
until Dec. 20 to decide not to run.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the early emphasis on raising money, the
primaries are taking place earlier than ever. New Hampshire's
first-in-the-nation primary has typically been held late in the
month. It will take place Feb. 1. The Iowa caucuses will be held
Jan. 24. California, which used to hold its primary in June, has
scheduled the vote for March 7, the same day as another
traditionally late primary state, New York. Florida an vote
the following week. By March 21, Democrats will have selected
nearly 60 percent of delegates to their national convention;
Republicans will have chosen 65 percent of their delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When and where will the political parties hold their
nominating conventions in 2000?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Republicans will go first, meeting in Philadelphia from
July 31 to Aug. 3. The Democrats will gather in Los Angeles Aug.
14-17. The Reform Party is planning to meet in Long Beach, Calif.,
August 1013. But party factions are fighting over what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are the Republicans in any danger of losing their majority in
the House or Senate?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most political analysts believe control of the House is up
for grabs, while the Senate is more likely to remain in Republican
hands. The House is currently made up of 222 Republicans, 212
Democrats and one independent who usually votes with the Democrats.
A gain of five seats for the Democrats would give them a majority
for the first time since 1995. Democrats are especially hopeful
because 19 House Republicans and only five Democrats are giving up
their seats next year. The most competitive races are scattered
across the country, but both parties are making special efforts in
California, Florida, Illinois and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Republicans control 55 seats to 45 for the
Democrats. Democrats are looking to pick up seats in Delaware,
Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island
and Tennessee. Republicans, however, like their chances in Nevada,
New York and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   If the parties emerge from the election with 50 seats each, the
Senate would belong to the winner of the presidency. The vice
president is the Senate's presiding officer and casts his vote only
to break ties.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The presidential candidate with the most votes on Election
Day is the next president, right?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not necessarily. Men who have lost the popular vote have
served as president because they won a majority of the votes in the
Electoral College. When you cast a vote for president, you are
technically voting for a set of presidential electors. If your
candidate wins the popular vote in your state, the electors you
have voted for then cast their votes in the Electoral College.
There are 538 electoral votes, meaning it takes 270 to win. Each
state has electoral votes equal to its representation in the
Congress. Georgia, for example, has 13 votes (11 House members plus
two senators). The District of Columbia also has three votes.
</P>
<P>
   Some states have laws that bind the electors to vote for the
winning candidate in their states. Those laws have never been
tested, but for all practical purposes, the electors are generally
leading party officials and activists and would be unlikely to vote
against the candidate of their party. Still, it has happened. In
1968, a North Carolina elector voted for independent candidate
George Wallace even though Richard Nixon won a plurality of the
vote in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Many political scientists believe the Electoral College is an
outmoded body that is left over from the days when the ruling elite
feared that the masses might make an unpalatable choice. The
Electoral College was the product of a compromise between those
framers of the Constitution who favored direct election of the
president by the people and those who wanted the Congress to choose
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who assigns names to hurricanes? Why aren't there more
``international'' names?
</P>
<P>
   A: Names are selected from library sources and are agreed upon
by nations involved in international meetings of the World
Meteorological Organization. Many storm names do, in fact, have an
``international flavor,'' because hurricanes affect, and are
tracked by, nations other than the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic storms have a rotating six-year list of names. Some
samples of those that can be considered ``international'': (1999)
Jose, Philippe; (2000) Alberto, Ernesto, Rafael; (2001) Humberto,
Lorenzo, Pablo; (2002) Cristobal, Marco, Omar, Paloma; (2003)
Henri, Isabel; (2004) Tomas.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In addition to working to resolve conflicts and monitor
elections around the world, former President Jimmy Carter works to
increase crop yields and improve nutrition for farmers in poor
countries. As part of these efforts, Carter often talks about QPM.
What is it, and what are its benefits?
</P>
<P>
   A: QPM stands for quality protein maize. According to the Carter
Center in Atlanta, this strain of maize has several benefits _
including resistance to viruses and superior nutritional quality.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the AJC in September, Carter described the
seed, and his program to distribute it, this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``Corn is the primary food for poor people, by far. All the corn
that you have ever eaten, or that has ever been eaten in Georgia,
is food-deficient. There are 10 amino acids that every animal has
to have, including catfish and hogs and people. Two of them, lysine
and tryptophan, don't exist in corn. In an experimentation in
Mexico, they developed a corn that has all the amino acids. We call
it Quality Protein Maize. It's a complete food. And we introduced
it in Ghana, and now more than a third of the total corn in Ghana
is Quality Protein Maize, which we call QPM.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also been introduced now in South Africa, Brazil,
northern China, and we're trying to get it into North Korea. So
this is a genetically improved corn whose yield is as high as the
traditional corns. It's not a hybrid, it's self-pollinated so that
the seed can be planted year after year after year; you don't have
to buy new seed.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: News stories in often refer to CARE USA, the international
relief and development organization, as being based in Atlanta. How
long has the organization been based here, and where were its
headquarters before that?
</P>
<P>
   A: CARE USA, which was originally founded to distribute food to
Europe after World War II, but which is now active all over the
world, has had its headquarters in Atlanta for six years.
</P>
<P>
   After 48 years in New York City, 40 of them in the former Kips
Bay Brewery at 660 First Ave., CARE relocated to Atlanta on Sept.
1, 1993. The Woodruff Foundation and the City of Atlanta sponsored
the move to 151 Ellis St. N.E., which was formerly occupied on the
first floor by Ichiban's Steak House. The remaining four floors
were used as rented office space.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In 1997, Atlanta media magnate Ted Turner promised to give
away $100 million a year for 10 years to United Nations projects.
How much money has he donated so far, and for what is most of the
money being used?
</P>
<P>
   A: To date, the U.N. Foundation _ the organization Turner set up
to dole out the money, and of which he is chairman _ has approved
grants totaling nearly $189 million. The largest portion of the
money, 44 percent, or $83.6 million, has gone to programs designed
to improve the health of children. Another 23 percent, $43.1
million, has be granted to U.N. programs dealing with population
control and women's issues. About 22 percent, $40.1 million, has
gone for environmental protection. And 11 percent has been given to
programs that deal with peace, security, and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The next round of grants will be approved in March.

   Q: For those of us who didn't save the information previously
published in Q&AMP;A, can you reprint the address where we can send
Christmas cards for recycling? It's a charity in which children
convert them into new cards for resale.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's St. Jude's Ranch for Children, which has operated its
recycling program for more than 30 years. Send card fronts only,

   Q: Can you explain the difference in the ratings that analysts
at brokerage firms give to stocks, such as ``market perform'' or
``attractive,'' and list them in order, from best to worst?
</P>
<P>
   A: Such ratings are designed to tell investors what the analyst
thinks the stock will do 6 to 12 months in the future. But since
every stock brokerage has its own rating system, there's no
universal list, and no way to rank ratings as you suggest.
</P>
<P>
   There are absolutely only three options available to an investor
with respect to a share of stock: You can buy it, sell it or hold
it. That's why it's always puzzling to see a menu of 8 or 10
ratings, such as ``strong buy'' or the combination of ``short-term
hold'' and ``long-term buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Another point: The investor always should find out if the
analyst making the rating works for a company that underwrote the
stock he or she is rating. If Fly-By-Night Securities analyst
Andrew Smythe comes out with a ``buy'' rating on XYZ Gadgets, it
might make a difference to know that Fly-By-Night makes a market in
that stock or took it public. Has the analyst ever issued a
``sell'' rating, for example?

   Q: What was the classical music played during a Publix
supermarkets commercial over the holidays showing the treetop
angel, little toy soldiers and snowman eating all the food from the
dinner table?
</P>

to improve the health of children. Another 23 percent, $43.1
million, has be granted to U.N. programs dealing with population
control and women's issues. About 22 percent, $40.1 million, has
gone for environmental protection. And 11 percent has been given to
programs that deal with peace, security, and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The next round of grants will be approved in March.

 &HT;    Ask a dietitian: Is soy milk light on nutrition?
 &HT;    By Karen Collins, M.S., R.D.
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Soy milk is often available in ``regular'' and ``light''
versions. Is light the more nutritious choice?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not necessarily. Regular soy milk usually contains 5 grams of
fat in an 8-ounce serving. That's equal to the total fat content of
reduced-fat (2 percent) cow's milk. The calories are similar, too.
With cow's milk, however, almost 3 grams of that fat is saturated
fat, which raises blood cholesterol and possibly the risk of some
cancers. The same amount of soy milk contains only 1 gram of
saturated fat.
</P>
<P>
   Lighter versions of soy milk contain about 50 or 60 fewer
calories than regular soy milk. Lower-fat versions, however,
contain only half the amount of the phytochemicals called
isoflavones. Scientists believe these substances are responsible
for some of soy's apparent health-promoting effects.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does the caffeine content of soft drinks compare to that
of coffee and tea?
</P>
<P>
   A: An 8-ounce cup of coffee can contain from 80 to 250
milligrams of caffeine, depending on the brand and how it is
brewed. The same portion of hot brewed tea usually contains about
50 mg.
</P>
<P>
   Caffeine content of soft drinks varies widely: ginger ale and
tonic, most orange and other fruit flavors, and most root beer--
contain none. Individual brands may differ, however. Sunkist orange
soda contains 40 mg in a 12-ounce can, and Barq's regular root beer
contains 23.
</P>
<P>
   Most cola and pepper-type drinks, whether sugar-sweetened or
diet, contain 35 to 45 mg of caffeine. Soft drinks that add even
higher levels of caffeine may include from 55 to more than 70 mg in
a 12-ounce can.
</P>
<P>
   A modest amount of caffeine should not be a problem for most
people, at least if consumed in the first half of the day. Research
is suggesting, however, that our health may benefit in several ways
if we keep total caffeine consumption from all sources within
moderate bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How important is it to eat seafood regularly?
</P>
<P>
   A: Current recommendations to lower risk of cancer and heart
disease include limiting consumption of red meat. Seafood can serve
as a healthful meat replacement, and may offer additional benefits
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Seafood contains a special type of fat _ called omega-3 fatty
acids _ which might help prevent heart disease by making blood less
likely to clot and block blood vessels. Some studies suggest that
omega-3 fatty acids may also offer some protection against cancers
of the breast, colon, prostate and ovaries by suppressing cancer
cell growth and metabolism or by working through the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   If borne out by research, these effects would add to the already
considerable benefits of a balanced, mostly plant-based diet that
is low in saturated fat. Most experts say that eating seafood once
or twice a week may be enough to provide protection against heart
disease and cancer.
</P>

   Ask-a-Dietitian questions were answered by Karen Collins, M.S.,
R.D. of the American Institute for Cancer Research.

 &HT;    Tips to steaming
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You probably have one of those cheap little collapsible
steamers, which are OK for vegetables but not much else.
</P>
<P>
   To really get into steaming, you need a full-sized steamer. You
can go to the store and buy either one of the Asian bamboo steamers
or more contemporary stainless steel or electric steamers.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can jury-rig one using the equipment you have on hand.
</P>
<P>
   You need a large pan to hold water and something to elevate a
plate of food above the simmering water. To boil the water, use a
wok or a large saucepan or Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid. If
you are steaming in the oven, a roasting pan with a rack can serve
as the base.
</P>
<P>
   A medium-sized colander can be placed in the saucepan. Just
place the plate of food into the colander once the water is
boiling. Helpful hint: Place a long, 2-inch wide band of
triple-folded aluminum foil in the colander before adding the
plate. Leave ends hanging out. It's a useful tool to help lift the
plate from the steaming pot. Always cover to steam.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find a colander that fits, place three empty tuna
cans (with ends removed) or custard cups in the large pan. Rest the
plate of food on them. Make sure there is some space between the
plate and the sides of the base pot, so that steam can rise.
Warning: Removing the plate can be tricky when the water is boiling
and the steam is hot.
</P>
<P>
   The plate, by the way, can be as simple as a pie pan, or the
slatted compartment in a bamboo steamer.
</P>
<P>
   In the oven, use a roasting pan partially filled with water.
Bring to a boil and place a rack on top and add the plate of food.
Cover fully with aluminum foil and steam.

 &HT;    Getting steamed: Rich foods of holidays vaporize beneath desire
for a lighter touch
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It happens predictably this time of year. The
body turns leaden, as though the center of gravity had shifted
south.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the rich food has no appeal. A simple perfectly
ripened pear, tasting clean and oozing juice, has more appeal than
a chocolate torte.
</P>
<P>
   Cookbooks titled ``Butter'' ``Sugar'' ``Flour'' ``Eggs'' (and
that one is near the top of the pile by the desk) get shoved to the
side.
</P>
<P>
   Another one on steam cooking catches my eye. Cooking in the
vapor of a pot of boiling water is inherently low in fat _ though
not necessarily so. Thai-style steamed foods may be bathed in
high-fat coconut milk, and French steamed beans may be smothered in
butter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a purity to steamed food, maybe because
initially it is stripped to basics.
</P>
<P>
   Steaming is as familiar to us as steamed broccoli and steamed
mussels. For many home cooks, the technique stops there. But
cooking in moist heat can perform minor miracles.
</P>
<P>
   But for Americans who are used to their food fried, grilled,
seared and crisped, steaming food takes some getting used to.
Because no browning can occur when cooking with steam, a chicken
breast remains as anemically white as cauliflower.
</P>
<P>
   And steam is no match for fat as a flavor carrier, so
accommodations may be made, usually in the form of a marinade. Bold
seasonings are a must.
</P>
<P>
   For guidance, it's natural to turn to Asian cuisines from
countries where the technique of steaming is centuries old. Another
book provides inspiration. ``A Spoonful of Ginger'' by Nina Simonds
(Knopf, $30) is subtitled ``Irresistible, Health-Giving Recipes
From Asian Kitchens,'' and steamed foods have a place here.
</P>
<P>
   Readers can choose to explore Simonds' holistic philosophy that
views food not as the enemy but as a ``nurturing, benevolent friend
that maintains and restores health.'' Others can just take the
recipes straight to the kitchen and enjoy the food. That they have
specific healing properties is just a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Steamed shrimp is a classic, but in this version ginger, soy and
sesame oil bump up the flavor. The original recipe called for
butterflying the shrimp and leaving the shells on. The shells help
retain the moisture and flavor, but this version is more
diner-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   STEAMED GINGER SHRIMP
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   Marinade:
</P>
<P>
   3 1/2 tablespoons rice wine or sake
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely minced fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons minced green onions, white part only
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   Shrimp:
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds large shrimp, shelled and deveined
</P>
<P>
   5 or 6 blanched cabbage leaves
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons minced cilantro
</P>
<P>
   Combine marinade ingredients in a bowl. Add the shrimp and toss
to coat. Cover and refrigerate. Marinate for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Line a steamer tray or pie plate with blanched cabbage leaves.
Arrange shrimp on top, letting marinade ingredients cling to them.
</P>
<P>
   Bring water in a large pot to a boil. Place steamer tray over
the water and steam for 3 to 5 minutes, depending on size. While
shrimp cook, heat the broth and cilantro in a small saucepan until
boiling. Pour the hot broth over the shrimp. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to use Asian-style sesame oil, which is toasted and
quite dark. The sesame oil usually sold in health food stores is
not toasted and is rather flavorless.
</P>
<P>
   To blanch the leaves, drop in boiling water for about 10
seconds, then refresh in cold water. Set aside on paper towels.

   This low-fat steamed salmon is positively succulent, and the
Asian sauce spooned over the top adds guilt-free flavor.
</P>
<P>
   If you're steaming food for as many as six people, space is an
issue. It's easy to do in the oven using a roasting pan. But if you
cut the recipe to serve two or four, just steam the salmon on the
stove.
</P>
<P>
   STEAMED SALMON WITH ASIAN SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   Fish:
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch green onions
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons thinly shredded fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   6 salmon fillets, about 6 ounces each
</P>
<P>
   Sauce:
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   3 1/2 tablespoons Chinese black vinegar or Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   Trim the green onions and cut into thin slices on the diagonal.
Combine with the shredded ginger. Arrange on a heatproof dish and
place the salmon on top.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the ingredients for the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Pour several inches of boiling
water into a roasting pan. Arrange a rack on top and place the
heatproof dish of salmon on it. Cover tightly with aluminum foil
and steam for about 8 minutes. Cooking time depends on the
thickness of the fillet.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange salmon on individual plates, spooning a little of the
ginger scallion mixture over. Dribble a little of the sauce over
the top.

</P>
<P>
   ORANGE-GINGER MARINATED WHITEFISH
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   4 whitefish fillets, skinned, about 6 ounces each
</P>
<P>
   juice and zest of 1/2 medium orange
</P>
<P>
   1/2 inch piece of fresh ginger, peeled and grated

   2 garlic cloves, crushed
</P>
<P>
   4 scallions, shredded

<P>
   4 tablespoons dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoons minced fresh chives
</P>
<P>
   Rinse the fish under running water and pat dry. Place in a
shallow glass dish such as a pie plate. Mix half the orange juice
and zest, all of the ginger, garlic and scallions and half of the
orange segments in the dish. Cover and marinate for 1 hour, turning
occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the fish, orange and scallions from the dish, reserving
the marinade. Place in a wax paper-lined steamer tray. Cover with a
tight-fitting lid and steam for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the reserved marinade into a small saucepan with the remain
orange juice and zest and the wine. Bring to a boil and boil
rapidly for 2 to 3 minutes to reduce. Remove from the heat. Stir in
the butter to give a glossy sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the fish with the sauce and garnish with the chives and
orange segments.

 &HT;    Persolan chefs: Leave the cooking to them
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Sure, we all know that Oprah's had a personal
chef. But you don't have to be a celeb to hire someone to cook for
you. An increasing number of real people, like you and me, are
seeking out personal chefs as mealtime solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Marcy Garriott did it because of time. The filmmaker was
finishing up a documentary and knew she was not going to have time
to even think about food. ``It seemed like a great solution, and it
has worked out perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   James and Erika Talbott did it to eat more healthfully. The
techies, who are also weight lifters, found a personal chef after
consulting with a dietitian. Not only are they eating better, they
have found their food costs are less than their previous habit of
eating out all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the personal chefs these busy people are using come to
their homes on the average of once every couple of weeks, bringing
all the groceries, pots and pans, spices. They spend a day cooking
and stocking the freezer with about five to 10 meals for two, then
clean up their mess and leave reheating directions behind.
</P>
<P>
   The clients say that the food _ 20 entrees and sides _ usually
lasts a couple of weeks and fills up a freezer. But there is still
room for half a gallon of Blue Bell. And ice.
</P>
<P>
   The chefs cook to their clients' specs after extensive
discussion or after the clients fill out a questionnaire. The
customized menus may be anything from low-fat to vegetarian,
high-protein to comfort foods, for those with allergies or for
those with exotic tastes. They can even include family recipes. The
selections can range from meatloaf to mahi mahi with mango salsa to
Moroccan chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from Louisiana. I asked her (Linda Stanton of Dinner by
Design) to cook hot-water cornbread. She researched that and did,''
says Keith Caskey, a student and part owner of a gas company. ``She
also cooks things I haven't had before. I'm pretty adventurous.
Sometimes she just surprises me.
</P>
<P>
   ``She prepares all this food. Most is not cooked quite through
so it does not taste like it's been in the freezer. She's very
organized. She has plastic sleeves for a binder on how to reheat
the foods.''
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker Garriott, who hired personal chef Betty Pritchard of
The Kitchen Pass to save time, has been pleased at the wider
variety of food she is eating now. Healthier, too, she adds.
</P>
<P>
   There are other side benefits. The clients tell of how the chefs
have b-- ought thermometers to check the temperature of their
freezers, how they might pick up a bottle of wine or box of cereal
at the grocery store for them, how they leave little surprises for
the kids. Such culinary pampering in an impersonal world makes for
a warm homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there are approximately 3,000 registered personal
chefs and countless independent ones.
</P>
<P>
   The local chefs' backgrounds are as varied as the city's
population. Betty Pritchard, who has lived in Singapore for the
past five years, says, ``I just love to cook. I have taken cooking
classes everywhere.'' Michael Costilla of Epicurean Delights, a
1998 graduate of the Texas Culinary Academy in Austin, works nights
as the executive chef at Wildfire in Georgetown. Bob McLucas of
Dinner Is Served was an Austin machinist for 20 years before he saw
his job opportunities diminishing and turned his cooking hobby into
a career. After Habeeb Rhymaun of Chef du Jour experienced
stress-related health problems in the technology industry, he and
his wife expanded a small catering business into his current
profession.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking skills obviously are required to be a personal chef, but
they can be self-taught or professionally acquired. No specific
training or certificate is necessary, although chefs who join one
of the national associations get educational materials geared
toward the job.
</P>
<P>
   Personal chefs don't have to have any specific food handler's
permits or certificates. ``We do not regulate them in any way
although we recommend that they get food manager's certification as
the training is important to their work, `` says Bob Flocke,
spokesman for the Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Rhymaun of Chef du Jour considered the training important and
opted to go to the food handler's school. ``I'm certified by the
state through 2002,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   What the personal chefs cannot do is cook in their own homes and
deliver the food to clients. That practice violates health codes.
The chefs must cook either in the client's kitchen or a commercial
kitchen, like Stanton, who uses a church kitchen for meal prep.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to regular bimonthly meal plans, the chefs offer
gift certificate dinners for new parents, recovering patients, or
others who need an occasional helping hand in the kitchen. ``My
wife and I are expecting a baby in June. It would be nice if we had
a personal chef for a while,'' Costilla quips.
</P>
<P>
   The chefs stress that their services are not cheaper than
cooking at home. Rates and plans vary, but average $10-15 a meal.
Groceries may or may not be extra. Clients say portions are often
large enough for leftovers for lunch. But still it is not budget
dining. Financially, it is an alternative to eating out.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Chef Costilla's fee is $275 (grocery cost
included) for 20 meals, or two weeks' worth of food for two people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to sell the time it saves,'' says Costilla. ``It saves
you the grocery shopping, the prepping, making the meals and
cleanup. I figure that is five to 10 hours a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Wagnon is a mother and Web designer; her husband is a
software consultant. In their pre-chef days, when they attempted to
cook their own dinners, they would eat too late and stay up too
late. ``Now from walking through the door to having silverware and
food on the table takes only half an hour. Now we sit down to
dinner more times together.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they've even bought a dining table for their fast
sit-down weeknight dinners of home-cooked food prepared personally
for them.Kitty Crider writes for the Austin American-Statesman,

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ I arrive today with big news: It's a new year.
</P>
<P>
   I was alerted to this phenomenon over the weekend in an Internet

</P>

   The consensus: No way, Fannie Mae.
</P>

   At any rate, this being a new year, another ``national
championship'' football game couldn't be very far behind. They
played it Tuesday night in a city below sea level (not Atlantis) in
a game sponsored by a cellular telephone maker. What better sponsor
in this new and exciting _ and what I like to call _ ``information
era?''
</P>
<P>
   A team from the Atlantic Coast Conference played a team from the
Big East Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is a time when I wish my column had a laugh track.
</P>
<P>
   The ACC and Big East are two conferences where practice starts
every fall with the coach holding up a long, brown, cylindrical
object and telling the lads, ``This is a football.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one of the players in the back always said, ``Hey, coach,
don't go so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but I like that joke, no matter how many times I've used
it.
</P>
<P>
   This in no way diminishes the relative merits of the Florida
State Five-Fingered Discounters or the Virginia Tech Fighting
Gobblers (Official motto: ``Turkeys have feelings, too.''). They
are fine football machines.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, 130 years after the first intercollegiate football
game _ Rutgers 6, Princeton 4 in the Ted and John's Blacksmith Shop
Jersey-Swamp Bowl Game _ the system for declaring a champion is
still horribly flawed. For the record, Rutgers was declared the
1869 ``national champion'' by a panel that included Bob Hope, Dick
Clark and Strom Thurmond.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, the champion has been voted on by various
groups of men, whose biases at least added some humor to the
exercise. Lately, the dinosaurs who run the game have added
computers to the mix, even more humorous since as we all know,
computers only do what Bill Gates programs them to do.
</P>
<P>
   The current system, called the BCS (Bummer Cockeyed System), is
a marriage between the polls and the computers and at the end of
the season spits out two teams, who are blessed with NCAA holy
water and sent out to play for the greater glory of the scam.
</P>
<P>
   Only Alan Greenspan, the prince of double-talk, could explain
why college football's Division I-A still doesn't have a legitimate
playoff system.
</P>
<P>
   I know you've heard this so many times your ears are bleeding,
but I must repeat it here if only for the pure foolery of it: In
all of the NCAA's officially sanctioned sports, major college
football is the only one without a playoff to determine its
champion.
</P>
<P>
   The university presidents claim a national championship in I-A
football would take too much time away from classes, but their
hypocrisy is exposed by the fact the other three football divisions
have playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves us at the end of another season with a ``national
championship'' game that has no teeth as long as teams like
Wisconsin and Nebraska _ let alone Marshall _ are eliminated on the
whim of a Bummer Cockeyed System.
</P>
<P>
   So I ask the powers, as I do every new year: Establish a true
playoff. Join us here in _ as I like to prematurely call it _ the
21st Century.

   AMAZING-BILL _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The guests at William R.
Carver's birthday party wound their way around displays of
caulking, varnish and anchor lines into the back room of Hopkins
Marine Hardware. Bill is as much a fixture there as the paint
counter where he's been stationed for the past 25 years. He's made
a powerful impression on a lot of people _ not the least, his boss.
Luckily for everyone, Carver rarely misses a day's work. ``He
doesn't call in sick,'' Janes says. ``Even if he has a doctor's
appointment, he comes in right after.'' Such dedication may sound
more admirable than remarkable, except for this: This birthday is
his 95th. (Kalajian, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

chocolate torte. A cookbook about steam cooking catches my eye.

Elementary School, two young boys circle and spar: A quick shoulder
jab to the nose. Then, a headlock like the one the Undertaker did a
few nights before on a pro wrestling television show. It looks
dangerous, and some school officials say it is. Determined to stop
violent behavior sparked by the pro wrestling craze, educators
across the state are trying to find a way to keep the pile drivers
and the flying body slams out of schools. At Prescott Elementary
School in Norwood, they forbid pupils from copying the wrestling
moves on school grounds. (New York Times News Service) WITH PHOTOS.

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ LUFKIN, Texas _ My wife and I stayed home New
Year's Eve, watching on TV the celebrations around the world. By
the time we went to bed, midnight in Texas thereabouts, I was
deeply regretful that we had not gone somewhere and done something
extra special. Then the phone rang. My daughter Kate was on the

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Just before New Year's I stopped
in a hardware store not far from my house to buy a couple of parts

the store had been selling stuff to people preparing for a Y2K
disaster. ``Are you kidding?'' the man asked. ``We've sold more

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ HAMILTON POOL, TRAVIS COUNTY, Texas _ Hamilton
Pool was a popular hangout, a collapsed cave on ranch land about 30
miles west of Austin, the scene of many parties _ hippies and
rednecks swimming in the cold green water, the area trashy and
trampled from overuse and no management. Now it's one of the
prettiest spots in Texas, since Travis County bought it in 1985 and
turned it and the surrounding 200-plus acres into a preserve.

   WRESTLING-SCHOOLS _ In the asphalt schoolyard of Lucy Stone
Elementary School, two young boys circle and spar: A quick shoulder
jab to the nose. Then, a headlock like the one the Undertaker did a
few nights before on a pro wrestling television show. It looks
dangerous, and some school officials say it is. Determined to stop
violent behavior sparked by the pro wrestling craze, educators
across the state are trying to find a way to keep the pile drivers
and the flying body slams out of schools. At Prescott Elementary
School in Norwood, they forbid pupils from copying the wrestling
moves on school grounds. (New York Times News Service) WITH PHOTOS.

Enthusiasts wait for tide of online banking 
By Mark Clothier  
c. 2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Despite all the talk about online banking and using
the Internet to manage money and pay bills, not everyone is sure
people actually want to do it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Jagdish Sheth doesn't think most people do. Sheth is a marketing
professor who studies social change at Emory University's Goizueta
School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts think this will be the year the market for
Internet banking takes off.
</P>
<P>
   Alpharetta, Ga.-based Net.Bank plans to spend $10 million _ $3
million more than last year _ to get more customers.
</P>
<P>
   And Steve Franco, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray,
thinks the stocks of companies such as Atlanta-based S1, which
helps banks offer their services online, and CheckFree, a Norcross,
Ga., firm that processes electronic transactions, will benefit.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheth thinks most people will be reluctant to change, and
that mass adoption of online banking and bill-paying will come
slowly.
</P>
<P>
   He's found that if people are comfortable with the way they do
things, and there is risk associated with a new way, they will
stick to the old way. They will change their habits if they are
unhappy with the traditional method and there is not much risk to
the new one.
</P>
<P>
   Applied to online banking and bill-paying, that means most
people are more comfortable with pen and paper checks and
brick-and-mortar bank branches than they are with the Internet,
Sheth said. The average banking customer will have to be dragged
clicking and scrolling into the digital age, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For it to work, you need universal presence of PCs in
families,'' Sheth said. ``There is much more opportunity in the
business-to-business market. Converting small business and
household consumers will be harder. ... It's the easiest way, but
not everyone does it. Not everyone feels comfortable. Not everyone
owns a PC. The more you move into the mass market, the more
hesitation and obstacles will be present.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheth knows some consumers already are open to the idea of
managing their money online. His 32 year-old son works long, odd
hours and wants to be able to bank when he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The professional class likes managing their money,'' he said.
``They are technology-enabled, and they like it. They don't like
going to the bank. They don't like to mix with the masses. They
want to be able to bank when they want. They will adopt it
immediately. The masses, however, the people in small towns, the
people with a high school education or less, are about 70 percent
of the population. They are the backbone of the U.S., and they are
very comfortable going to the bank, meeting with the teller. They
will be last. They will be the most resistant and only will change
if they are forced to.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheth compares banking to the telephone. A generation of
Americans had operators dial their calls. Now all calls are
automated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do-it-yourself banking is inevitable,'' he said. ``But it
won't happen next year.''
</P>
<P>
   D.R. Grimes, Net.Bank's chief executive, thinks the demand is
there. He saw his company's accounts grow from 17,400 last January
to 66,000 this week. Grimes said he thinks that in 10 years, online
banking will be as popular as automated teller machines.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Net.Bank ran print ads, bought radio time and placed
ads on Web sites. A certain type of person responded and enrolled:
married people between the ages of 40 and 45 with a yearly income
greater than $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Net.Bank plans to sell more services _ credit cards,
home equity loans _ to existing customers. Net.Bank also hopes to
reach out to more types of people: college students, military
personnel and Americans living overseas.
</P>
<P>
   It also plans to deepen relationships with certain places, such
as the Microsoft Network's MoneyCentral Web site. Grimes said the
company's ads work best in places where people research money and
investment issues.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Bancorp's Franco thought the end of 1999 _ when Y2K bug
worries subsided _ was when the industry would take off, and he was
not alone. Now he thinks that prediction was about six months
early.
</P>
<P>
   Franco thinks consumers, not corporations, will be the first to
adopt the practice in a big way. He expects there to be between 40
million and 50 million people banking and paying their bills online
by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 25 million regular users of the Internet checking
stock quotes, tracking portfolios and getting financial
information,'' he said. ``That is a ripe customer segment to target
those services to. If you are sophisticated enough to set up a
portfolio on Yahoo, you can manage your money online.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Gary Zeidenstein and Amine Bitar made
``Triangles and Tribulations,'' they encountered the usual brick
walls met by first-time independent filmmakers. They tried in vain
for a year to interest Hollywood studios in the 84-minute film,
about a man who sacrifices career and family in pursuit of his
dream to play the triangle in an orchestra. They tried entering it
in film festivals, but there was so much competition that they were
often rejected.
</P>
<P>
   So Zeidenstein and Bitar set up a Web site to publicize their
film and show it online. They also opened the site to other
filmmakers and were besieged with submissions. ``It just started to
snowball,'' said Zeidenstein, 34.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Always Independent Films (www.alwaysif.com) offers over
375 movies and trailers. It is one of at least two dozen sites
showing films as filmmakers flock to what could be a new means of
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Some independent filmmakers hope the Web will let them bypass
Hollywood and reach viewers directly. Or they hope to use the Web
to drum up huge publicity, as seen with ``The Blair Witch
Project,'' a low-budget amateur film that became a blockbuster in
movie theaters after generating a buzz with a clever and alluring
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Most independent filmmakers will never duplicate the success of
``Blair Witch,'' and there are drawbacks to distributing movies on
the Web, like particularly poor image quality and long transmission
times.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some experts predict the Internet will have a profound
effect on the movie business, especially when combined with new
digital video technology in which movies are shot on digital tape
instead of film and edited on personal computers. Together, digital
production and Internet distribution promise a sharp reduction in
the cost of making and distributing their product, allowing for an
explosion in filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you lower the bar, more voices can be heard and be
profitable,'' said Ray Price, president of American Zoetrope, the
studio owned by Francis Ford Coppola.
</P>
<P>
   Such a popularization has already happened in music, with garage
bands now distributing their music directly over the Web by using
the MP3 protocol. ``The whole indie film world is the next MP3
opportunity,'' said Joseph A. Cantwell, executive vice president
for new media at Bravo Networks, which runs the Independent Film
Channel on cable television and is developing a Web site to show
and sell films online.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet could also provide a market for short films, which
now have few outlets. Short films are more suitable for the Web
than full-length features because it take hours to download a long
film using a conventional personal computer modem. And many people
won't want to watch a full two-hour movie at a desktop PC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans don't know what to do with short films,'' said
William Azaroff, 29, whose first short film can be seen at
Atomfilms.com, which specializes in short films. ``Hopefully, the
Web will bring them back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is not yet a good place to see a movie. In addition
to long download times, the picture is often blurry and appears in
a little box on the computer screen. And the movie sometimes
pauses, waiting for more of the signal to arrive. Such problems,
however, should diminish as more people get high-speed access.
</P>
<P>
   There is also little or no money to be made by showing movies on
the Internet. Most Web sites do not pay filmmakers for their movies
because many are happy just to get the exposure. And most sites do
not charge viewers to see the movies, hoping instead to support
themselves with advertising. Some of the sites plan pay-per-view
services or offer videocassettes for sale. But it is far from
certain that any of the movie sites will be self-supporting.
</P>
<P>
   One site that does charge viewers, Sightsound.com, allows people
to view a film for a day or a few days for a price similar to those
at a video store. Its most popular title, ``The Perfect 10 Model of
the Year'' video, is rented about 60 times a month, fewer than a
hit movie at a single Blockbuster outlet. In April the site offered
the movie ``Pi,'' which had been in theaters, and fewer than 200
people viewed it.
</P>
<P>
   One way around the technical limits of the Internet is to use it
to sell videocassettes. Sam Sokolow and Rob Lobl, fledgling
filmmakers in New York, have sold more than 800 copies of their
first film, ``The Definite Maybe'' on Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   It cost them about $2,000 to have the cassettes and cover art
made and to set up a Web site for their film with a link to Amazon.
The tape sells for $14.95, and they keep about $5 after expenses,
or a total so far of over $4,000. This has not gone very far toward
recovering the $100,000 it cost to make the movie. But Sokolow said
the exposure helped them land another job directing a sitcom for a
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sidestepping the whole movie business,'' Sokolow said.
``I don't need Hollywood anymore to have 35 million people take a
look.''
</P>
<P>
   For most budding filmmakers, having the film appear on the Web
is not an end in itself, merely a stepping stone to the more
established entertainment world.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day they'd like to be seen on a TV screen or
even better in a theater,'' said Mika Salmi, president of
AtomFilms, which is based in Seattle and receives 50 to 100 films a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Lincoln, a 23-year-old from Tulsa, Okla., parlayed his
exposure on the Web into a job making music videos. ``There's just
a lot of people watching the progress of films on there,'' he said.
``It's just a real kind of digital democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln made two films, ``Honeypot'' and ``Xavier,'' that are
among the most widely watched on Ifilm.com, a site in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   While most of its films can be viewed by the public, Ifilm also
set up a separate site, Ifilmpro.com, that can be seen only by
movie industry professionals and is a conduit for filmmakers who
are trying to shop their films around.
</P>
<P>
   The first film put on that site, ``Sunday's Game,'' is a
nine-minute dark comedy about elderly women who gather on a Sunday
and play Russian roulette. David Garrett, a writer and producer of
the film, said he and his partner, Jason Ward, had received many
inquiries since the film appeared and had closed a deal to produce
a pilot for Fox TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think the Internet exposure definitely increased our
visibility and got people talking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the odds are very long. Ifilm can point to only a handful
of success stories among the 1,000 films it shows. Always
Independent Films says that three films on its site have attracted
distributors, including Zeidenstein's ``Triangles and
Tribulations.'' It was licensed by a company that will try to place
it in video stores.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the very advantage of the Web _ its low
barrier to entry _ is also a disadvantage because so many films are
being shown there that it is hard for one to rise above the crowd.
And having a film freely available on the Web can discourage a
profit-minded distributor from picking it up. Then there is the
image quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want people's first exposure to it, if we think we
can make a sale, to be on the Web,'' said Azaroff, commenting on
the picture quality. He said he put ``Checkmating,'' his short film
from 1996 about a woman who sizes up potential boyfriends while
playing chess with them, on the Web because it was made mainly as a
calling card and had little chance of commercial success.
</P>
<P>
   Meher Gourjian said that it is mainly children who contact him
after seeing previews of his short film ``Plug'' on the Web. The
inquiries he has received from movie industry executives resulted
from festival screenings or his videocassette mailings.
</P>
<P>
   Making oneself heard on the Web can require aggressive
marketing. Two first-time filmmakers, Terry Keefe and Michael
Wechsler of Los Angeles, not only put trailers of their ``Slaves of
Hollywood'' on some movie Web sites but they also sent out hundreds
of e-mail messages with links to those sites.
</P>
<P>
   Keefe also used the Web site of the Chicago Sun Times to send an
e-mail to the critic Roger Ebert, who told him to send along the
film. ``I would never have gotten Roger Ebert any other way, and he
answered my e-mail in an hour,'' Keefe, 29, said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ebert has not reviewed the film, which is about the
abuses endured by Hollywood production assistants. And it was a
conventional test screening that got Filmopolis, a small
distributor, to agree to try to place the movie in theaters. It ran
for a week this fall in a single theater in Santa Monica, Calif.,
and might run for a weekend at a theater in New York in January.
</P>
<P>
   To get people to the theater, Keefe and Wechsler relied not on
the Net but on a more old-fashioned medium: flyers they posted
around town.

IN COMPUTER SECURITY BUSINESS, A GOOD OFFENSE IS OFTEN THE BEST 
DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PETER WAYNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Members of the computer security industry _ the folks who keep
credit card numbers safe from prying eyes on the Internet, among
other things _ can be a contentious bunch. Competition, after all,
often consists of trying to break the other guy's code-scrambling
technology in order to sell a fix or alternative product.
</P>
<P>
   But even by those standards, the industry is girding for an
especially nasty fight when the annual RSA conference takes place
early this month.
</P>
<P>
   RSA, the public key encryption algorithm named for Ronald
Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, who invented it in 1978, is
the foundation on which much of the security protecting consumers
and merchants on the World Wide Web has been built.
</P>
<P>
   Those systems are under constant assault by security experts,
competitors and hackers alike.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, several widely used encryption technologies,
including one used to scramble cell-phone conversations, have been
cracked or at least seriously threatened _ all by security experts
in the name of protecting data.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more interesting recent attacks is one created by
nCipher, a small British company that makes special hardware it
says can encrypt information faster and more securely than a
typical computer can. One of its scientists, Nicko van Someren,
recently demonstrated a simple program that can extract the secret
keys locked in a Web server used to process credit card
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the first practical demonstrations of a theoretical
approach to code breaking that van Someren developed about 18
months ago with Shamir, the Israeli cryptography expert who is the
``S'' in RSA.
</P>
<P>
   The attack is cause for concern because someone with a company's
secret keys _ the digital codes that unscramble data _ can use the
information to masquerade as that company and to steal credit card
numbers and other financial data.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the merchants running the servers are the targets, the
customers are the victims,'' says Alex van Someren, Nicko's brother
and the chief executive of nCipher. ``If the Web servers are
compromised, ultimately the financially sensitive information
that's going to be lost belongs to a customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the nCipher attack could hurt small merchants the most
because as a matter of economy, they often share Web servers, the
big computers that operate Web pages, with other merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, many experts assumed that the casual barriers
separating various companies' Web sites on the same server were
more than adequate. This attack, however, circumvents those
barriers by loading a special version of a program that merchants
on the same Web server typically share. Known as a CGI, for
``Common Gateway Interface,'' this program's job is to record the
details of a transaction and send back customized messages to
consumers thanking them for their orders.
</P>
<P>
   Van Someren demonstrated that a CGI could be written in such a
way that it evades the thin walls of security that separate
companies on the same server and identifies secret keys. The attack
works against most operating systems that power Web servers,
including the Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT and Windows 2000 and Sun
Microsystems' Solaris.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more novel elements of the attack is the fact that it
works blindly. While the CGI can slip around the barriers and read
data stored in the server's memory, it receives no clues as to what
the data means.
</P>
<P>
   So how does it find the secret keys hidden among all the other
scrambled data? Paradoxically, by spotting the very randomness that
makes data-scrambling secure in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Van Someren and Shamir found that the keys are substantially
more random than most other data. Alphanumeric text _ the letters
and numerals consumers give to Web sites, for instance _ is
generally repetitious and rife with patterns. And since text is
typically represented by numbers between 32 and 127, Someren's
program scans the server's memory looking for data that include all
possible numbers with no concentration of any particular value.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, nCipher makes a product that defends against
attacks, so it is in the company's best interest to warn online
merchants about the malicious CGI. it created. NCipher also
published details of the program, making it easier for hackers to
duplicate _ thus making e-commerce sites more vulnerable to attack
and more likely to buy nCipher's product.
</P>
<P>
   While this kind of activity might be deemed unethical in many
other lines of work, it's considered fair game in the security
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it blackmail?'' said Alex van Someren. ``The key issue here
is we have to break the systems here to make them stronger. You
need to understand how people break in to keep them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he argued, keeping the company's knowledge about the
attack a secret might have been even more unethical. Publishing a
general warning, he noted, at least made it possible for Web
masters to defend their sites.
</P>
<P>
   He added that online merchants were free to adopt any number of
defenses, including solutions from nCipher's rivals _ though he
insisted that nCipher's specialized hardware, especially when
running the latest version of its software, offered the fastest,
most reliable way for Web sites to protect their secret keys.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, nCipher is not the only company that makes
specialized hardware for encrypting and decrypting credit card
numbers and other sensitive information. IBM and other companies
specializing in electronic commerce offer competing products and
are constantly engaged in researching the technology.
</P>
<P>
   And in general, security hardware that is separate from the
server computer offers an advantage because it removes the keys
from the scrambled data, making them unavailable to hackers who
find a way around a server's security systems.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Neumann, a computer security researcher at SRI
International in Menlo Park, Calif., says that such hardware is a
wise investment because Microsoft and other makers of operating
systems have done little to plug security holes in their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew how to solve many of these problems in the 1960s,''
Neumann said, ``but we've lost all of that in the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hettinga, chief executive of Internet Bearer Underwriting
Corp., which employs several kinds of cryptography to protect
Internet transactions, said the best solution might be a sort of
cyberspace isolationism. Computer systems are becoming so cheap, he
said, that most companies should be able to avoid sharing a server.
</P>
<P>
   The CGI attack, Hettinga said, proves that these days, ``sharing
a digital commerce server is like sharing someone's toothbrush.''

NEW TOOLS FOR SNIFFING OUT TAX CHEATS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Been cutting corners on your income tax return? Claiming more in
charitable deductions than you gave away? Understating income from
your business?
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of the decade, it will probably be much tougher to
shortchange Uncle Sam _ or state tax agencies, for that matter _
than it is today.
</P>
<P>
   At present, a big decline in audits and other enforcement
efforts by the Internal Revenue Service, which has suffered from
budget cuts and is under orders from Congress to focus on helping
taxpayers instead of finding tax cheats, has encouraged many people
to play fast and loose with their income tax returns, according to
tax professionals and IRS workers.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation could change significantly, thanks to new
technology being designed for the IRS to improve service to
taxpayers. It can also be used to track known tax cheats and to
identify patterns of cheating and fraud. Some states have already
acquired a version of the technology and used it with promising
results.
</P>
<P>
   The technology, being developed for the IRS by Computer Sciences
Corp. of El Segundo, Calif., will be able to feed data from every
entry on every tax return, personal or corporate, through filters
to identify patterns of taxpayer conduct. Those taxpayers whose
returns suggest that they are highly likely to owe more taxes could
then quickly be sorted out and their tax returns audited.
</P>
<P>
   That is not, however, where IRS officials want to focus public
attention. The IRS commissioner, Charles Rossotti, wants to
emphasize improved service to what he calls the IRS customers, and
new technology is the key to that goal. Rossotti says that by
focusing on helping people who want to comply, the IRS can bring in
much more money than by focusing on willful tax avoidance and
evasion.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Cosgrave, the IRS chief information officer, said, ``In our
effort to run the IRS more like a business, we are trying to bring
in a lot of commercial practices'' that are intended to raise more
revenue through making compliance easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thrust of computer modernization is to help us
provide better service,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cosgrave acknowledged that the data-mining technology eventually
would allow the IRS to find both outright frauds and small-scale
cheating. In its current customer-friendly mode, the IRS does not
like to call taxpayers cheats when they cut a few corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call that stuff `math errors,''' Cosgrave said, but of
course when the IRS finds them, it then corrects the ``errors'' and
bills the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The database technology that the IRS will install to track tax
returns will be similar in many ways to the databases used by
American Express, Citibank and other big credit issuers to decide
which charges to approve and which advertisements to slip in the
mail with monthly bills. Identifying the behavior patterns of
customers is one of the most valuable features of these databases.
</P>
<P>
   In two years or so, the IRS hopes to start building twin
databases on each segment of taxpayers, such as salaried workers,
small businesses and large corporations. In each segment, one
database will be designed to take in revenue rapidly and issue
refunds, while the second will compile and store data that can be
mined for information by auditors and by customer-service agents
helping people at walk-in centers.
</P>
<P>
   With quick and easy access to data about individual taxpayers,
both auditors and tax collectors will be able to identify targets
better and spend less time on clerical chores, Cosgrave said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Kansas Revenue Department has already installed a modern
computer system based on this type of technology that allows it to
look up information on individual taxpayers quickly, often
resolving such problems as a lost check by issuing a new one in
less than a minute.
</P>
<P>
   But in a few years, once all the kinks are worked out, the
system will also be used to look for patterns of cheating, said Pat
Compton, a management analyst with the Kansas Revenue Department.
</P>
<P>
   For example, by analyzing sales-tax reports from convenience
stores, the state could identify enterprises that appeared most
likely to be shutting off their cash registers and not paying taxes
on every sale.
</P>
<P>
   And in about two years, Mrs. Compton said, the state will be
able to resume intense efforts to identify inflated claims for
Kansas' property-tax rebate. ``We have cut back on the scrutiny
because of trying to get the new system up and running smoothly,
but that is an area where people try to claim the maximum $600 even
if they are entitled to less,'' she said, ``and with our new
systems we will be able to identify those people much more
easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Howard, vice president of data warehousing at Oracle
Corp., a California software company that sells large database
systems, said that by mining its database, a tax authority could
find patterns that were not intuitive or obvious.
</P>
<P>
   He said behaviors that tax authorities traditionally associated
with noncompliance might turn out, on analysis of the details in
millions of tax returns, to be much less significant than other
unseen factors.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of the kind of unexpected results that data-mining
produces, he cited the experience of a telecommunications company
that he declined to identify. The company wanted to stem the loss
of customers to competitors and, by mining its database, discovered
that people who bought its voice-mail service rarely defected, a
linkage no one had previously noticed. He said the company then
decided to give away the voice-mail service to retain customers.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Sparrow, a Harvard University expert on fraud who is an
IRS consultant, has written extensively about how government
agencies tend to identify a fraud and then focus increasing
resources on it, even as the crooks move on to new frauds.
</P>
<P>
   He has urged the IRS to design its database to facilitate hunts
for ``dynamic fraud,'' in which the theft technique changes
rapidly, but the IRS has made little use of his services, he has
said, since Rossotti was appointed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   How a database is designed can limit its use as a
fraud-detection tool, several database experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Cosgrave said that ``absolutely the way you design your database
up front has a lot to do with'' its utility as a fraud-detection
tool. He said that the creation of the twin databases would go a
long way to making the planned new systems useful for fraud
detection.
</P>
<P>
   He said detailed decisions at the IRS about how much the new
technology would be focused on fraud detection vs. customer service
were still six to 18 months away.

Y2K DOOMSAYER: A LITTLE SHEEPISH, BUT NO REGRETS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAOS, N.M. _ In the beige adobe house nestled against the
snow-dusted Sangre de Cristo mountains, the lights are on, the
phones have dial tones, the computer is online, and Edward Yourdon
is reaching into a stack of cardboard boxes to hand a visitor a
free copy of ``Time Bomb 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Best wishes, Ed Yourdon 1/1/2000,'' he inscribes in the
flyleaf of a 630-page tome that sold 250,000 copies over the last
two years. But the back cover conjures up a darkly different New
Year's Day: ``Saturday, January 1, 2000: Suddenly, nothing works.
Not your phones, not the cash machine, not even your fancy new
VCR.''
</P>
<P>
   Yourdon, one of the nation's leading Y2K Cassandras, looks a bit
sheepish, and admits: ``I guess the book's sales prospects are
about zero now.''
</P>
<P>
   For over a decade, Yourdon, a computer programmer and consultant
with a gift for communicating, has warned the world of widespread
chaos when computer odometers rolled over to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, he staggered out of bed just before 5 a.m.,
expecting to watch a wave of televised failures roll around the
planet. His younger son, David, a family prankster, was up before
him. ``My son said, `New Zealand has disappeared _ they have gone
dark,''' he recalled. ``I said, `Oh no, really?'''
</P>
<P>
   But the breakdowns that were forecast never came.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got to Indonesia, to China, all across Asia without
any reports of problems _ that was surprising,'' said the MIT
graduate, who has lectured around the globe about the need to
reprogram computers before the rollover date. Referring to the
unbroken supply of electric power worldwide, he added: ``By God,
they did do a good job fixing things up.''
</P>
<P>
   But Yourdon, a bulky man in blue jeans and wire rim glasses,
warned that it is far too early to say that the world's
computer-dependent societies are out of the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The smoothness following the arrival of the New Year, he said,
is due partly to intensive work in vital areas like power
generation, air traffic control and missile stewardship. In
addition, he said, many systems, like ports, pipelines and
refineries, were simply turned off, or run manually over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is going to be another opportunity for bugs Monday
morning _ everyone is going to come in to their office, and turn on
their PCs,'' the 55-year-old computer programmer said. ``It is
possible that bugs will manifest themselves in coming days and
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   While many large companies may have invested in clearing up
their Year 2000 defects, he warned that less work has been done by
smaller companies, which often use older software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surveys show that 30 to 50 percent of small businesses have
done nothing,'' he said. Problems might not appear until later in
the week, or later in the month, when companies try to print
invoices or print payroll checks.
</P>
<P>
   Even among larger companies, the impact of the problems may
never be known, he said, because ``the normal instinct of any
company is to fix it, not to broadcast it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last year, Y2K has become like a sexually transmitted
disease _ no one wants to admit they have it,'' he continued from
his office overlooking a horse pasture here. ``Programmers have
come under heavy legal pressure: `Don't you dare talk about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed the string of companies' ``Y2K compliance'' reports
of recent months as ``letting high school seniors grade all their
exams,'' adding, ``It was very difficult to get independent
verification of what had happened.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hours after the date rollover, Yourdon was so fearful of
computer viruses that he logged onto the Internet through a backup
computer. Now, back online with his MacIntosh G3 Powerbook, he said
that his e-mail has been running ``roughly 50-50, between `thanks'
and `I hate you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Yourdon, who was the star of a 50-minute video,
``Ed Yourdon's Year 2000 Home Preparation Guide,'' said he has few
regrets about raising the Y2K alarm, prodding companies,
individuals and government agencies to make repairs to avoid future
breakdowns, or about urging people to prepare for shortages that
have not occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father has diabetes,'' he said, as a wood fire cracked in a
corner fireplace. ``If he doesn't get insulin he dies in three
days. Now, the government says, `Don't stockpile medicines.' Well,
that's fine for them to say, but for me the stakes are pretty
high.''
</P>
<P>
   He bought his house here two years ago, partly out of Y2K
concerns, and has been dividing his time between Taos and a New
York apartment. With stocks of tuna fish and rice stored in his
sunny kitchen here, he said he saw his home preparedness as an
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my case, rather than getting a generator, and then feeling
foolish when nothing happened, I put in solar and wind power,'' he
said on a house tour of a system that has cut his power bills in
half. ``Rather than getting thousands of gallons of water at the
grocery store, I got a well.''
</P>
<P>
   But he admits _ and a visit to his Web site (www.yourdon.com)
confirms _ that some resentment zings around the Internet this
weekend. Showing the yards of entries in the Time Bomb 2000
discussion group on Saturday, he said, ``There is a lot of that
today: `Boy do I feel stupid, I wish I never listened to you guys,
does anyone want to buy tuna fish?'''
</P>
<P>
   Time will tell, he counseled, about the value of his prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either there will be a lot of Y2K problems, and I will make a
tremendous living as an expert witness in the next year or two,''
Yourdon said. ``Or, if it turns out, a month from now, that there
never were any serious problems, I may have to eat my words,
publicly and with great embarrassment.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Much of the e-commerce industry wants a new tax loophole: an
exemption from taxes on goods and services sold over the Internet
and on fees paid for access to the Internet. At stake in this
debate is not just money, but political power.
</P>
<P>
   For businesses that sell only in cyberspace, a tax-free Internet
would be a bonanza, offsetting the costs of shipping goods. But
under existing rules, companies that sell both in stores and on the
Web _ so-called clicks-and-mortar enterprises _ must collect sales
taxes on their Internet sales, putting them at a significant
competitive disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Sales taxes are the single largest source of revenue for state
and local governments, raising $189 billion in 1998. For states
like Texas and Tennessee, which have no personal income tax, sales
taxes are critical to paying for police, fire, schools and other
government services. E-commerce grew fourfold this past holiday
season, compared with a year earlier, and as it expands the loss of
sales tax receipts could create serious budget problems for many
states.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a tax-free Internet has opened a debate that has
been confined so far to warring factions of conservative
Republicans. One faction includes Gov. James S. Gilmore III of
Virginia, chairman of the Advisory Commission on Electronic
Commerce, created by Congress to study Internet taxation. Gilmore
wants to make up for potential lost sales tax revenues by having
Washington redistribute some of its revenues to the states in the
form of grants.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. William J. Janklow of South Dakota, another
conservative Republican with a long history as a tax cutter, says
that such a move would simply increase power in Washington while
undermining the state-and-local principles that helped his party
gain control of Congress in the 1994 elections.

   Co.'s Secrecy Inspires Guessing
</P>
<P>
   Several times in each of the last few decades, Silicon Valley
has been home to a truly big gamble. In 1984, the Apple Macintosh
transformed the computer industry, but other high-stakes wagers
like the Amiga or Go Corp. have fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most of the valley's big gambles have failed for
setting goals that proved far too ambitious. In the early 1980s
there was Trilogy, a premature effort to build an ultrafast
mainframe computer. In the early 1990s, Microunity caught the
valley's imagination with a microprocessor intended to be the
standard for interactive cable systems, which failed to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   In today's valley, bored with me-too Internet start-ups, much of
the buzz is about Transmeta, a microprocessor design company in
Sunnyvale, Calif. Transmeta has so far managed to keep its product,
scheduled to be introduced on Jan. 19, a secret.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, has touched off wide-ranging speculation. The
company is said to have close ties to IBM, and Microsoft's
co-founder, Paul Allen, is apparently an investor. Linus Torvalds,
designer of the Linux operating system, is working at Transmeta,
and though he says Linux has little to do with his Transmeta job,
his presence has caused a great deal of beard-scratching.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent patents suggest the company has found a way both
to simplify processor circuitry and to accelerate the running of
instructions on other chips, like Intel's.
</P>
<P>
   But Transmeta's founder, David Ditzel, recently warned reporters
not to place too much stock in the patents. Instead, he has hinted
at development of a er microprocessor _ the computer
industry's new Holy Grail. Portable wireless computers are widely
believed to be the wave of the future and a chip that consumes less
power will obviously have a significant advantage.

   Music Industry Faces A Digital Reckoning
</P>
<P>
   For the players in the digital music industry, this year may
feel like a marathon poker game. The growing consumer interest in
downloading and listening to music online is good news for the
various types of companies that already have seats at the table.
But all will face decisions on which hands to play and which to
fold.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, like MP3.com and Garageband.com, are betting
that they can give music away for free, in the MP3 technical
format, and survive on Web-based advertising. Others, like Virgin
Jamcast and Yahoo Digital, intend to charge consumers who want to
download and store songs; but the success of that model will depend
on how consumer friendly and copyright secure each of a handful of
competing downloading technologies turns out to be.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, record companies like Seagram's Universal Music Group
and EMI Records are gambling that their deliberate pace of putting
music online _ a tentative approach meant to protect their
intellectual property _ will not erode their influence over the
music business. They must also decide how much promotional material
to give away without raising expectations that music will be free.
</P>
<P>
   Offline, consumer electronics makers, including Sony Electronics
and Creative Labs, are betting on a new generation of digital
portable devices similar to the Diamond Multimedia Rio 500. But
questions persist: at what price and in what form will most
consumers find digital music players an attractive alternative to
the Sony Walkman or Discman? And will lingering copyright questions
and the high cost of flash-memory cards for storing portable music
inhibit the market's growth?
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, traditional bricks-and-mortar music retailers,
including Wherehouse Records, are hoping they can compete
effectively against online music sellers by adding their own
Internet offerings.
</P>
<P>
   With a generation of college-age listeners flocking online _ and
their younger siblings certain to follow _ this game entails high
risks, but potentially high rewards. For the rest of us, the
competitive cacophony should make for lively listening.

   True Believers Push Satellite Telephones
</P>
<P>
   The satellite telephone business has two strikes against it, but
that has not stopped some entrepreneurs and investors from betting
that the next multibillion-dollar swing for the fences will indeed
produce a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Now at bat: Globalstar Telecommunications, which is controlled
by Loral Space and Communications. Globalstar is just starting to
introduce its service _ a $3.3 billion system of 48 satellites
designed to provide telephone calls nearly anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Iridium LLC, which has been offering a similar
service, failed to attract nearly as many customers as it needed
and was plunged into bankruptcy, forcing its main backer, Motorola
, to write off $2.3 billion. Two weeks later, ICO Global
Communications, another contender, which had not yet launched its
satellites, filed for bankruptcy protection after failing to raise
additional money from investors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such setbacks, Globalstar's stock surged to a 52-week
high last month. Many investors appear to be betting that Iridium
failed because of its own design and marketing mistakes rather than
a fundamental lack of demand for satellite telephones. Globalstar's
chance of success should be evident in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest personal bet on satellite telephones is being
made by Craig O. McCaw, the billionaire cellular telephone pioneer.
In November, McCaw agreed to raise $1.2 billion to bring ICO out of
bankruptcy. He is also reported to be looking at investing in or
buying Iridium. And if those are not enough billion-dollar bets to
sate his gambling appetite, he still has Teledesic, a proposed $10
billion system to provide Internet service using 288 satellites,
starting around 2004.

   One Step Forward, One Back For Internet Names Panel
</P>
<P>
   In a world of jealous nation-states and cutthroat geopolitics,
the odds of transforming the Internet into a self-governing
institution might seem long. But that is the bet the Clinton
administration placed in creating the Internet Corp. for Assigned
Names and Numbers, and 2000 will likely determine the future of
Internet self-governance.
</P>
<P>
   Most of 1999 was rocky for Icann, the nonprofit group picked by
the Commerce Department at the end of 1998 to assume administration
of the Internet's addressing system. It cleared a major hurdle in
November, when Network Solutions, the company that had been granted
a government-blessed monopoly in the lucrative business of
registering dot-com names, finally agreed to open the market to
competition and to recognize Icann's authority.
</P>
<P>
   But within days, it suffered a major setback when Congress
usurped Icann's first attempt at policy making _ the creat
international rules for settling disputes involving
``cybersquatters.'' These are speculators who register domain names
using established trademarks, then attempt to force the trademark
owners to pay large sums for rights to the domain names.
</P>
<P>
   Big corporate trademark holders persuaded Congress to give them
stronger protections, and while the White House said the bill would
interfere with Icann's international authority, it was enacted as a
last-minute attachment to the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   So as 2000 unfolds, Icann and its interim president, Mike
Roberts, find themselves struggling to win recognition of Icann's
authority not just from governments around the world but from the
government that created it.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, Icann must form a membership that gives more than
big business a voice in its policy making and find an efficient way
to finance itself.
</P>

   `E-Conversion' Paying Early Dividends at Oracle
</P>
<P>
   In June, Lawrence J. Ellison, the chairman of Oracle Corp.,
announced that the company would reinvent itself as an e-business _
a company that uses the power of the Internet in every aspect of
its operations. He set a goal of reducing annual costs by $1
billion in 12 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, many analysts brushed off the announcement as more
hyperbole from a chief executive known for the same. But as the
months passed, it became clear that Ellison was putting his money
where his mouth is _ and reaping some early returns on the
investment. In the quarter ended Nov. 30, Oracle exceeded Wall
Street's earnings estimates, in large part because of a 5.5 percent
gain in profit margin that the company attributed to cost-cutting.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we think we can continue as we convert to an
e-business,'' Jeff Henley, Oracle's chief financial officer, said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the savings are obvious. Oracle will convert 60
nation-specific corporate data systems scattered around the globe
to one system, to be housed at the company headquarters and
accessible via the World Wide Web. The company estimates $200
million a year in savings from that move alone. Executives say they
can trim the $500 million annual travel bill by 10 percent just by
using a Web-based application from eTravel, a company Oracle
acquired last year for $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger shifts will take longer and represent greater gambles _
but they could also pay even bigger returns. For example, Oracle
recently announced plans to sell its software over the Web at
standardized prices. That will, for the first time, make its
products accessible to small businesses, a market the company has
long overlooked.

   A Merger Sets Off An Information Rush
</P>
<P>
   The merger last year of Doubleclick and Abacus Direct was the
first official marriage of companies that gathered information
about people's activities online and offline. Doubleclick, which
serves advertisements on thousands of Internet sites and monitors
users' activities on those sites, could suddenly combine that
information with catalog purchases tracked by Abacus.
</P>
<P>
   Previously Doubleclick had ignored the personal identity of Web
surfers, but by using information about users' offline purchases,
it can charge higher ad rates. Since the merger was announced in
June, Internet advertising companies have forged ahead with efforts
to identify people on Web sites, find out more about their offline
lives, and show them ads that match that information.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates denounce the practice, saying that it gives
companies too much information about individuals. They point to the
laundry list of information that offline companies gather _
including data on hobbies, home values and stock portfolios, to
name a few _ and note that Internet companies will be siftingh that data even as they watch users surf the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The ad networks insist that such practices benefit Internet
users by giving them more relevant advertisements. Besides, they
say, users can, with a few clicks of a mouse, choose not to have
personal information gathered about them. But privacy advocates
argue that users should not have to lift a finger to protect
themselves against what they regard as intrusive behavior, and 2000
could be the year that the administration and Congress push
legislation to address those concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doubleclick had a good profiling model, which they used to
deliver targeted messages for advertisers and still protect the
user's privacy,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the
Electronic Privacy Information Center. ``But once they crossed the
line with Abacus and said, `Here are where the big bucks are,' they
also took a big gamble, because that's where the big privacy battle
is. And when the clock ticks on industry self-regulation, they may
have a very big problem on their hands.''

Dentist's tool attacks bad breath at source 
By James Cummings  
c. 2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ According to dentist Clifford Yudelman, 90
percent of bad breath originates in the crevices at the back of the
tongue, not in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Yudelman says he invented the Breath-So-Fresh Tongue
Cleaner, a device that uses a scraping tool and gel to clean debris
from the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tongue cleaners have been around since 100 A.D. and were
common until the turn of the century,'' Yudelman said. ``People are
just starting to rediscover the benefits of cleaning the back of
the tongue.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Price, D.M.D., a spokesman for the American Dental
Association, agreed that cleaning the tongue is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad breath is caused by anaerobic bacteria that settle on the
tongue,'' Price said. ``Living at the back of the tongue where they
can be coated by post-nasal drip is like a trip to Club Med for
anaerobic bacteria. Scraping the tongue exposes them to air and
kills them.''
</P>
<P>
   Price said any device that allows the user to scrape the back of
the tongue without causing too much of a gagging reflex is helpful.
He said a toothbrush works for some people, but because a
toothbrush sits up high on the tongue it causes some people to gag.
</P>
<P>
   The Breath-So-Fresh is shaped like a miniature tennis racket
frame. To use it, you place some of the breath gel that comes with
the product into the frame and pull the cleaner gently forward from
the back of the tongue to the front.
</P>
<P>
   The product sells for about $5 and should be available at Target
stores.

Web a resource for home theater 
By Bill Husted  
c. 2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There is more than one way to be a couch potato, eyes
glued to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   With a good home theater system, you'll have another way _
besides the computer and Internet _ to avoid moving more than your
eyeballs for hours at a time. The Web can help you get started if
you would like to assemble or improve a home theater system.
</P>
<P>
   A good starting point is a page called Audio Ideas Guide: Audio
and Home Theater Links at www.audioideas.on.ca/links
</P>
<P>
   .html. This is a page filled with links to literally dozens of
sites on the Internet that offer advice on setting up a home
theater as well as sites that sell equipment and DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of a page like this _ whether you are researching
home theaters or beekeeping _ is that you are able to keep most of
your useful links in one easily accessible place, rather than
accumulating your own list of bookmarks. Since the links are
organized by topic, you can hop right over to the area that
interests you most _ whether you're looking for tips on the actual
assembly of a home theater or on buying the latest movie on DVD.
</P>
<P>
   In almost every field there is a site that is a ``must stop''
whether you are a beginner or a longtime enthusiast. When it comes
to home theater and audio, AudioVideoNews at www
</P>
<P>
   .audiovideonews.com/ stands out. The key word here is news.
You'll find out the latest developments in equipment and also
gossip and news about what movies you can expect to see on DVD.
When visited in late December, the site was reporting that
``although George Lucas' much-ballyhooed `Episode I: The Phantom
Menace' will find its way to video through VHS on April 4, 2000,
there will be no DVD release.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the stories on this site have been reported
elsewhere (the ``Star Wars'' story was broken by The Hollywood
Reporter, for instance), it's a great place for people who don't
read a dozen trade magazines to keep up with what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   The next site, Best Home Theater at www.besthometheater
</P>
<P>
   .com/, takes a little explaining.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find equipment here _ arranged in groups of receivers,
TVs, amplifiers, accessories and speakers, and several other
categories. Click on a group title, and you'll be taken to a
listing of various products in that category complete with selling
price. Click on the specific product (let's say it's the Klipsch
Synergy System 6 speaker), and you'll be able to read the
specifications and copy extolling the virtues of the product.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy products here, but that's not the virtue of the
site. Instead, think of it as a way to quickly compare several
different speaker systems or receivers. Any enthusiast, whether a
grower of roses, a lover of high-fidelity equipment or a
woodworker, spends hours dreaming and shopping using a catalog.
Think of this site as a way to pre-shop, to compare systems
side-by-side and then make your own decision and buy the products
where you get the best deal.
</P>
<P>
   Our final stop is an e-zine, a magazine that appears only
online. This one is called SoundStage and is located at www
</P>
<P>
   .sstage.com/. This is a highly professional magazine that holds
up nicely against the audio and home theater magazines you'll find
at the newsstand. The content and presentation is top-notch. But
there is a major difference that makes this a magazine you'll want
to read. It's free.

WHAT'S HOT AND WHAT'S NOT WITH GENERATIONS X AND WHY? 
</HEADLINE>
  By JANE RINZLER BUCKINGHAM  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What are some of the hippest brands of jeans these days? If
you're thinking of obscure names and high price tags, think again.
Think Levi's. Yes, Levi's. And Sergio Valente.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest of the big brands are back, it seems. And
not just in the world of jeans. So before you clean out your closet
for the new year, take a look at this list of fashion brands that
have rececome cool again among the trendy.
 &UR; NIKE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like any crush, our love affair with Nike had to end. It seemed
that no matter how much we paid for the shoes, no matter how
well-coordinated our outfits, we were never quite the performance
athletes Nike wanted us to be. We grew tired of ``just doing it.''
We needed a rest.
</P>
<P>
   Nike's popularity was initially eroded by small skate-shoe
brands such as Airwalks and Vans. Then Adidas' stripes began
appearing everywhere. Even New Balance and Saucony had their
moments in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Yet just as mainstream Americans seemed about to banish the
``N'' word from their vocabulary, trendsetters _ those hip,
forward-thinking individuals who often set the pace for others _
began returning to the brand.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback is due, in part, to better products. The past two
seasons, Nike has featured shoes with an innovative look and feel.
And though the customized ID shoes may not be flying out of the
Internet site, shoppers appreciate that Nike is finally offering
shoes that work for us, not them.
</P>
<P>
   Nike's refound popularity is also due to the fact that many
people want to forgive Nike. They like Nike; they just didn't like
Nike liking itself so much. So once Nike stopped lecturing and
appeared vulnerable, trendsetters were willing to slip on a pair
again.
 &UR; LEVI'S &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Levi's could do no right. Their product was
staid, their ads inconsistent and often bizarre. And they somehow
managed to miss completely the fact that wide jeans and hip-hop
clothing were the biggest things to hit teens since rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   But while everyone was rushing out to buy Tommy, Abercrombie,
Polo, Earl and Juicy, the Levi's elves were hard at work. They
began to build on the brand's popularity abroad, marketing their
best products in Europe and importing their European advertising
success, ``Flat Eric,'' to the States.
</P>
<P>
   Soon trendsetters across America began clamoring for the Levi's
Equipment for Legs line: high-tech, all-weather pants that allow
the wearer to do a lot _ and look cool doing it.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of leather jeans spruced up Levi's image, and
the company's fashion line is finally fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   But be careful what you buy, because when you ask trendsetters
what they think of the Levi's brand, they are quick to challenge:
``Do you mean the new Levi's or the old?'' And when they say
``old,'' they mean last year.
 &UR; MARITHE &AMP; FRANCOIS GIRBAUD and SERGIO VALENTE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These two brands, which seemed to have been sentenced to life in
fad prison, have suddenly been paroled.
</P>
<P>
   Marithe &AMP; Francois Girbaud is back for good behavior. The brand
has reinvented itself; today it features stylish little nylon
jackets and utility skirts similar to those from other hip labels
such as 555 Soul. Now known only as ``Girbaud,'' the clothing line
is hot among trendy teens who may not even be aware of its '80s
incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Valente, on the other hand, is back for time served. In
the '80s, the classic sexpot line of jeans was known for its tight
look and steerhead logo.
</P>
<P>
   Today's tight Sergios remind us of all that we miss from the
fun-filled '80s.
 &UR; SWATCH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Tag Heuer, Spoon and a series of other watch brands are
dazzling consumers with more features than an iMac, the simple
Swatch _ the poor-man's Rolex of the '80s _ has quietly been
rediscovered.
</P>
<P>
   They won't display your blood type or help you access the Web,
but these watches are definitely fun. The designs have gotten
cooler, and the price makes them almost disposable.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where individualism is everything, Swatch offers a
watch for your every mood, outfit or hairstyle.
 &UR; LOUIS VUITTON &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the tourist-packed shops, you might have thought this
uberbrand never left. But in recent years fashionable folk have
been plunking down their dollars at Prada, Gucci and Fendi. Now
their eyes (and wallets) are opening again for Louis Vuitton.
</P>
<P>
   The ``LV'' monogram is once more a coveted status symbol,
appearing on pastel-pink totes, space-agey silver bags and even the
traditional brown-initial bags.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying a Louis Vuitton says: ``I have money, and I don't mind
spending it.'' In an economy this good, even trendsetters are
looking for the old signs of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it didn't hurt that the company hired a hip designer
and decided to sponsor the underground magazine Visionaire (wrapped
in an ``LV'' monogrammed envelope).

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Daddy loved technology, but Net was too much 
By Frances Katz  
c. 2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``I tried to use that Internet thing,'' my father
would say. ``But I kept hearing this buzz-buzz-buzz noise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's called a busy signal, Daddy,'' I'd say. ``You hear it
all the time when you use the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but why do I get it when I use the Internet thing?''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to explain, but in the end I just gave up. I
surrendered. I bailed out on trying to teach my father about the
wonders of the Internet. Our little ``tech support'' sessions would
have made a MindSpring service rep cringe. I was impatient, cranky
and maybe just a tad condescending.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean you can't see the `You've got mail' thing?''
I'd shout. ``It looks like a mailbox, Dad!''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty million people have no trouble at all finding that
mailbox, but not my dad. He could have found it, but I think he had
absolutely no interest in the wonders of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   My dad's lack of interest in the Web was odd, because he always
took such interest in the ever-changing world around him.
</P>
<P>
   I also want to say that he was definitely not a technophobe. He
couldn't get through a day without entering something into his
electronic organizer. He once cooked an entire Thanksgiving dinner
in the microwave _ including the turkey _ and everything was
delicious.
</P>
<P>
   We were the classic early adopters. My parents had a
remote-control TV when they got married in the early '60s. My dad
was a big fan of the 20th century and every time-saving gizmo the
century had to offer, from electric garage door openers to cordless
phones and VCRs. No matter what it was, if you could plug it in, we
had one.
</P>
<P>
   My father, who died in October, was a 20th century man. The
Internet, I think, is really a 21st century utility. It wasn't
until the very end of the century that the Internet caught on big
with ordinary people, who would use it to buy presents, invest in
the stock market, read the newspaper or check the weather.
</P>
<P>
   My dad preferred the cable version of the Weather Channel. If he
wanted a book, he would go out and buy one (or better yet, ask me
if I could get it for him _ from my computer). I think he thought
the idea of buying a screwdriver or a bottle of wine from a PC
rather ridiculous when you could just hop into the car and go get
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is about saving time, about getting things done
faster and quicker. My best friend Janet, who has an incredibly
demanding television job, talks about ``multitasking'' when she
describes juggling work and family responsibilities. Another friend
spent Christmas week sending electronic greeting cards during her
lunch hour. She didn't have the time to sit and write out Christmas
cards like my mother did 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   I can still see my mom with her well-worn address book,
carefully turning pages, checking off names and crafting personal
notes to her family and friends. I desperately want to be like her,
but I just don't have the time. It's so much easier to send e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   My father and I had many things in common. We both loved
baseball, old movies, Groucho Marx and Janis Joplin. There wasn't
much of a generation gap between us. The only thing that separated
us was the Web. I loved it, while he couldn't care less.
</P>
<P>
   I used to tell my dad that one day, like it or not, he was going
to have to learn how to click the mouse on that little blue
mailbox. I promised I would personally drag him kicking and
screaming into the next century. He'd humor me. He'd say he'd try,
if he didn't keep getting that buzz-buzz-buzz noise whenever he
tried to sign on.
</P>
<P>
   I miss my father, but as I head off into a new century without
him, I'm starting to think he knew where that mailbox was all
along.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe my dad knew that Web mastery wasn't something he was going
to need. He knew there was lots of information online, and maybe he
was happy knowing his daughter would be happy to find it for him.
</P>
<P>
   He was fine with passing the technology torch to the next
generation. And Daddy, wherever you are, I want you to know that
whatever newfangled gizmos come along in this century, if you can
plug it in or log on to it, my family is definitely going to have
one.
</P>
<P>
   Better still, we'll probably order it over that Internet thing.

Spell Catcher 8 a universal standout 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Imagine if you could have one dictionary, spell
checker and thesaurus that worked in every program, whether
QuarkXPress or Microsoft Outlook.
</P>
<P>
   That's the idea behind Casady &AMP; Greene's Spell Catcher 8. It's a
systemwide utility that consolidates most text-editing features
into one place, one interface.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most programs today, whether Microsoft Word or
Netscape Navigator, have some text-editing features, such as
spell-checking.
</P>
<P>
   But Spell Catcher trumps them all on two counts: Its
dictionaries and thesauruses are bigger than those of other
programs, and it lets you keep one list of expandable glossary
terms rather than many.
</P>
<P>
   With Spell Catcher, you no longer have to type a new expandable
glossary term into each dictionary on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a quick look at each of Spell Catcher's main
features. The first thing you'll notice is that Spell Catcher
automatically inserts itself into every program after installation.
It appears as a green check mark in the menu bar. You can turn
Spell Catcher off for any program through its preference dialogue
box, easily available from the menu bar.
</P>
<P>
   Spell Catcher watches as you work. It knows lots of words,
recognizing 1,166 common misspellings, which the program corrects
as you type.
</P>
<P>
   For misspellings it doesn't recognize, Spell Catcher will either
flash or beep, depending on your preference.
</P>
<P>
   When beeped, you just pull down the Spell Catcher menu under the
green check mark. You can do it via the mouse or through a key
command, which you can set. In fact, you can assign key commands to
almost any feature in Spell Catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Spell Catcher presents a dialogue box that lists suggested
spellings. You can pick one, choose to add the word to Spell
Catcher's dictionary or hear the word pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   You can do much more than check spelling with Spell Catcher. It
includes a dictionary with 102,000 definitions. To look up a
definition, highlight the word and then choose the ``look up''
command from the dialogue box.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Word, of course, doesn't include a dictionary. The
only Mac word processor that does is Nisus Writer, and that
dictionary is not as extensive as Spell Catcher's.
</P>
<P>
   Spell Catcher also includes a thesaurus with 550,000 entries.
</P>
<P>
   One of Spell Catcher's most powerful features is its glossary.
Type in an abbreviation for a word, phrase or passage, and it will
expand as you write it in any program.
</P>
<P>
   Other text-editing features include sentence capitalization,
adding smart quotes and eliminating extra tabs and other spaces.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite extra feature is the ability to convert text grabbed
from Web pages into formatted paragraphs in a word processor.
</P>
<P>
   If Spell Catcher has any weakness it is this: The program comes
without a detailed bound manual, a shortcoming unfortunately common
to most software today.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Spell Catcher will not work with older Mac
operating systems. You need at least OS 8.1 and 2 megabytes of
available system memory, or RAM.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find Spell Catcher online or in most computer stores that
sell Macs. The program retails for about $50 in a box and costs $10
less if you download it. An upgrade from an earlier version costs
$20.
</P>
<P>
   Casady &AMP; Greene keeps the latest versions and free demos of
Spell Catcher at its site, which you'll find at www.spellcatcher
</P>
<P>
   .com/8/default.html.

A simple pager shouldn't cause this much anxiety 
By Omar L. Gallaga  
c. 2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Giving the false impression that your table will
come up any faster than if they just called your name out, this
week's annoying gadget is the restaurant ``your table is ready when
your pocket starts vibrating'' pager. Our least favorite are the
pagers tacked onto huge hunks of plastic, bringing the eloquence of
the gas station restroom key to our fine-dining experience.
</P>
<P>
   While this high-tech innovation in restauranteering is a boon to
busy hosts, restaurant pagers are just more likely to produce
anxiety than patience among diners. How many times have you been
waiting on a restaurant page with a large group? Invariably, people
will ask ``have they paged us yet?'' ``Is it vibrating?'' ``How do
we know if they paged us?'' ``Did we miss the page?'' ``Are the
lights supposed to flash?'' ``What if the pager batteries are
dead?''
</P>
<P>
   Causing more pain than it's worth, the restaurant pager is the
least appetizing technology of late.

   What are some of the hippest brands of jeans these days? If
you're thinking of obscure names and high price tags, think again.
Think Levi's. Yes, Levi's. And Sergio .
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest of the big brands are back, it seems. And
not just in the world of jeans. So before you clean out your closet
for the new year, take a look at this list of fashion brands that
have recently become cool again among the trendy.
 &UR; NIKE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like any crush, our love affair with Nike had to end. It seemed
that no matter how much we paid for the shoes, no matter how
well-coordinated our outfits, we were never quite the performance
athletes Nike wanted us to be. We grew tired of ``just doing it.''
We needed a rest.
</P>
<P>
   Nike's popularity was initially eroded by small skate-shoe
brands such as Airwalks and Vans. Then Adidas' stripes began
appearing everywhere. Even New Balance and Saucony had their
moments in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Yet just as mainstream Americans seemed about to banish the
``N'' word from their vocabulary, trendsetters _ those hip,
forward-thinking individuals who often set the pace for others _
bturning to the brand.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback is due, in part, to better products. The past two
seasons, Nike has featured shoes with an innovative look and feel.
And though the customized ID shoes may not be flying out of the
Internet site, shoppers appreciate that Nike is finally offering
shoes that work for us, not them.
</P>
<P>
   Nike's refound popularity is also due to the fact that many
people want to forgive Nike. They like Nike; they just didn't like
Nike liking itself so much. So once Nike stopped lecturing and
appeared vulnerable, trendsetters were willing to slip on a pair
again.
 &UR; LEVI'S &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Levi's could do no right. Their product was
staid, their ads inconsistent and often bizarre. And they somehow
managed to miss completely the fact that wide jeans and hip-hop
clothing were the biggest things to hit teens since rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   But while everyone was rushing out to buy Tommy, Abercrombie,
Polo, Earl and Juicy, the Levi's elves were hard at work. They
began to build on the brand's popularity abroad, marketing their
best products in Europe and importing their European advertising
success, ``Flat Eric,'' to the States.
</P>
<P>
   Soon trendsetters across America began clamoring for the Levi's
Equipment for Legs line: high-tech, all-weather pants that allow
the wearer to do a lot _ and look cool doing it.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of leather jeans spruced up Levi's image, and
the company's fashion line is finally fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   But be careful what you buy, because when you ask trendsetters
what they think of the Levi's brand, they are quick to challenge:
``Do you mean the new Levi's or the old?'' And when they say
``old,'' they mean last year.
 &UR; MARITHE &AMP; FRANCOIS GIRBAUD and SERGIO VALENTE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These two brands, which seemed to have been sentenced to life in
fad prison, have suddenly been paroled.
</P>
<P>
   Marithe &AMP; Francois Girbback for good behavior. The brand
has reinvented itself; today it features stylish little nylon
jackets and utility skirts similar to those from other hip labels
such as 555 Soul. Now known only as ``Girbaud,'' the clothing line
is hot among trendy teens who may not even be aware of its '80s
incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Valente, on the other hand, is back for time served. In
the '80s, the classic sexpot line of jeans was known for its tight
look and steerhead logo.
</P>
<P>
   Today's tight Sergios remind us of all that we miss from the
fun-filled '80s.
 &UR; SWATCH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Tag Heuer, Spoon and a series of other watch brands are
dazzling consumers with more features than an iMac, the simple
Swatch _ the poor-man's Rolex of the '80s _ has quietly been
rediscovered.
</P>
<P>
   They won't display your blood type or help you access the Web,
but these watches are definitely fun. The designs have gotten
cooler, and the price makes them almost disposable.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where individualism is everything, Swatch offers a
watch for your every mood, outfit or hairstyle.
 &UR; LOUIS VUITTON &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the tourist-packed shops, you might have thought this
uberbrand never left. But in recent years fashionable folk have
been plunking down their dollars at Prada, Gucci and Fendi. Now
their eyes (and wallets) are opening again for Louis Vuitton.
</P>
<P>
   The ``LV'' monogram is once more a coveted status symbol,
appearing on pastel-pink totes, space-agey silver bags and even the
traditional brown-initial bags.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying a Louis Vuitton says: ``I have money, and I don't mind
spending it.'' In an economy this good, even trendsetters are
looking for the old signs of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it didn't hurt that the company hired a hip designer
and decided to sponsor the underground magazine Visionaire (wrapped
in an ``LV'' monogrammed envelope).

It's time for the tardy to shop 
By Mark Clothier  
c. 2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Are you famous for being a belated gift-giver? The
holidays are over. But, assuming you're not reading this amid the
post-apocalyptic ruins of your living room, there is still time to
shop. Blame the late package on all the people who bought their
stuff from Web sites and clogged the system.
</P>
<P>
   One Web site scours the Internet for places that sell odd and
interesting stuff and links you to them. The site, www
</P>
<P>
   .giftcrap.com, even divides the gifts into categories, to make
the shopping easier.
</P>
<P>
   For those with a glutton on their list, try forkchops, ``the
Swiss army knife of flatware.'' The chops are available at
www.forkchops.com. The combination knife, fork and chopsticks sell
for $3.95 a pair.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can offer one share of Ben &AMP; Jerry's stock, a chance to
own a piece of the company that brings so much joy to so many.
Shares of that company and others are available at www
</P>
<P>
   .oneshare.com.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the ultimate gift for gluttons is the picture
cookie. The cookie is edible, assuming you consider shortbread
edible, and comes with a picture of yourself right in the frosting.
A box of 18 sells for about $34. Picture cookies are available at
www.pix.com.
</P>
<P>
   FUNDS FOR BLACK STUDENTS
</P>
<P>
   Are you a black student interested in attending a historically
black college and think you might qualify for a scholarship?
</P>
<P>
   One Web site, www.am-blk-coll.com, America's Black Collegians,
hopes to be the middleman between scholarship money and aspiring
students.
</P>
<P>
   The site is part of the America's Black Collegians program.
Originally the group tried to raise money to offer scholarships for
the estimated 300,000 students at 115 black colleges and
universities. In 1998, the plan was broadened to include any black
student interested in pursuing a college education.
</P>
<P>
   The scholarships are funded by fees generated by the sale of
products and services provided by the group's marketing partners.
For example, fees from the Black Colleges Visa card are allocated
to the scholarship fund. Similar programs include business credit
cards, communications, Internet sales, travel, insurance and
long-distance telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to is tap into some of the estimated $500 billion spent
each year by black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   MAKING PETAT HOME
</P>
<P>
   Cats and dogs pretty much dominate whatever home they occupy.
Rugs are playing fields, televisions become grooming pedestals and
furniture becomes hairy.
</P>
<P>
   So why not buy your pet its own furniture? One Web site, www
</P>
<P>
   .beastlyfurnishings.com, offers a wide selection of furniture
for cats and dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Dog couches, chaise lounges and daybeds don't come cheap. A sofa
runs between $350 and $475, depending on the size. The couches come
with a slipcover, cushion and two accent pillows.
</P>
<P>
   The Omaha, Neb.-based company will also do custom work.
</P>
<P>
   HIBERNATION ON CAMERA
</P>
<P>
   First came the Panda Cam. Now there's the Bear Cam.
</P>
<P>
   An article on the PC World Web site, www.pcworld.com, tells of
an infrared camera focused on a bear sleeping in a cave. The images
will be broadcast on www.discovery.com. The purpose, according to
the article, is to shed light on the mystery of bear hibernation.
Bears, theoretically, spend the winter sacked out in caves.
</P>
<P>
   The camera will sit in a plastic tube and record the cave
goings-on of a female black bear in Minnesota named Whiteheart.
Part of the footage will be used in a documentary on bear
hibernation that will air in January 2001 on the Animal Planet
cable television channel. The images will be updated on the Web
site until the bear wakes up in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery.com is home to other cams, including Puppy Cam, Kitty
Cam, Bird Feeder Cam, Shark Cam, Sun Cam, Loch Ness Cam and Las
Vegas Wedding Cam.

Global Internet centers highlighted 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Internet is more than a phenomenon of Silicon
Valley. It is creating new winners worldwide. Read about the new
centers of the Internet economy in the January issue of Business
2.0. The magazine names among those centers Finland, home of Nokia.
And what about Ireland, which has become Europe's hottest site for
the headquarters of new tech companies? Another surprise on the
list is Iceland, which has the highest Internet penetration in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro Interactive has started a new line of kids software
called Clue Jr. SpyGlass Mysteries. Based loosely on the board game
``Clue,'' the first game in the series features a search for a
stolen artifact in a museum. Players use a special spyglass to
examine five different wings of the museum. The game, designed for
ages 5 and up, retails for about $30. It is available only for PCs
with Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more popular shoot-'em-up games is Microprose's
MechWarrior series. The company has released an expansion pack
called ``Pirate's Moon.'' It includes 20 new missions, six new
BattleMechs and five new weapons. Players need MechWarrior 3 to
make use of ``Pirate's Moon.'' The expansion pack is for players
ages 15 and older. It retails for about $30 and is available only
for PCs with Windows 95 and higher.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   Holocaust Survivors is a history site that presents this
terrible event through words and pictures. You can read the stories
of survivors, hear those stories spoken and see pictures of the
people telling the stories. There's also a photo gallery of the
camps and their locales. This is a disturbing and moving site but
one not to be missed by those interested in the Holocaust. You'll
find the site at www.holocaustsurvivors.org/.

Thinking small: Programs to tackle narrow missions 
By Jack Warner  
c. 2000 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Let us today consider small things, little programs
aimed at solving specific problems.
</P>
<P>
   First comes Aladdin System's DragStrip, another in that long and
noble line of attempts to build the better mousetrap for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   DragStrip really does nothing for you that you can't already do
with a couple of extra mouse clicks. But it's a neat little
program, and I imagine a lot of users will like it.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the idea is to let you call up other applications or
documents without leaving the application or document you are in.
It saves a couple of clicks. The tradeoff is having this little
strip of iconated (if I may coin a nasty little word) buttons
hanging about on your screen.
</P>
<P>
   You can accomplish the same thing by clicking on the little
desktop icon to the right of the start button to jump out of the
current application and go to the desktop, if the program you wish
to open is on the desktop. If it's not, then there's always the
Start button, followed by the Programs button.
</P>
<P>
   I've put my Internet connection, my mail program, my browser,
Windows Explorer, Word, WordPad and the little calendar that comes
with DragStrip on my applications bar. On the Documents bar I put a
project I'm working on. There's also a folders bar, but I can't
imagine what I'd want to put there.
</P>
<P>
   You can put frequently visited Web pages on DragStrip, and if
you have your Internet connection established it will summon your
browser and take you there forthwith.
</P>
<P>
   DragStrip won me over with the inclusion of the calendar. It's
just a calendar; you can't keep track of appointments with it. But
a calendar is essential.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going to use it, at least for a while. The only question is
whether its presence will become annoying while I'm working on a
full-screen document. There's not much point in using DragStrip
unless it's kept in the ``always on top'' mode.
</P>
<P>
   But for $20, it's hard to go wrong. For more information, go to
www
</P>
<P>
   .aladdinsys.com.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator, published by a firm with the hectic name of
WinWhatWhere, is a rather sinister piece of work that nonetheless
might be of interest to parents who want to monitor their
children's computing activities. It would be of even more interest
to employers who want to spy on their workers, I suppose, but I'd
rather not think about that.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator, once installed and set up, can be made pretty much
invisible. I think someone with good computer skills who suspected
it was there could find it, but children probably wouldn't suspect
it.
</P>
<P>
   It monitors activity in programs you choose, including Internet
browsers and mail readers. You can see what Web sites and
newsgroups are being visited, although unless keyboard activity is
involved, you won't be able to tell what exactly went on there.
</P>
<P>
   There is even an option to send a ``stealth message,'' invisible
to anyone using the computer, to any selected e-mail address at
specified times reporting usage, which is displayed in a
spreadsheet.
</P>
<P>
   It does not appear to monitor the activity of programs running
in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator, which might more accurately have been named Big
Brother, can be installed across a network as well as on a single
machine. More information is available at www.winwhatwhere.com.

E-COMMERCE REPORT: MANUFACTURERS GRAPPLE WITH ONLINE SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as Amazon.com has, for better or worse, led millions of
would-be entrepreneurs toward the e-commerce promised land, so too
has the success of Dell Computer Corp. led countless manufacturers
to believe that their future success rides on the ability to sell
directly to consumers over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits are manifest: tighter control of inventory, better
information about customers and, most of all, a simpler
distribution system with no retailers or distributors to inflate
the price of the product.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers who have ventured onto the Web have found it can
be an inhospitable place, however _ and not just because e-commerce
sites are such cash-hungry ventures. More to the point,
manufacturers have discovered that unless they can convince their
retail partners and distributors they are not out to steal sales
from them, bad things can happen to the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional retailers and distributors are not above reminding
their suppliers that they can choose not to carry their products,
for instance, or can relegate their products to the bottom shelf,
and thereby eliminate the riches manufacturers hope to gain from
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The industry term for this issue is ``channel conflict,'' and as
is the case with many conundrums caused by the Internet, there are
few clear answers to the questions raised. Yet the issue will arise
with greater frequency and is certain to affect the future of Web
retailing.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent report by Mainspring Inc., a consulting
firm in Cambridge, Mass., several issues determine the success of
direct sales by manufacturers on the Web. First, they must have a
product that lends itself to Internet selling. Custom items like
wedding dresses, for example, would not make good Web products,
while jeans would. Second, they must consider whether they could
fulfill orders efficiently on their own. In this respect,
refrigerators would not be a likely candidate, while small
appliances might work.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Chu, a Mainspring analyst, says that once a manufacturer
has determined it can sell products online at a profit, it must
consider whether its brick-and-mortar distributors are strong
enough to retaliate. If a manufacturer dominates a market, he says,
retailers will be much less likely to object, because they need to
carry its products to survive. Likewise, if the industry as a whole
is moving toward a direct-selling approach _ as happened in the PC
industry _ retailers will have no choice but to go along.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the answers to these questions, Chu says,
manufacturers can choose one of three options _ start an e-commerce
site while appeasing distributors, avoid selling on the Web
altogether or sell on the Web with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Nike is one recent example of a manufacturer selling with
impunity, although it has made some tacit concessions to resellers.
``We're in what's best described as a period of detente with
retailers,'' said Vada Manager, a Nike spokesman. ``Of course, when
a manufacturer as large as Nike with as much market share sells
online, retailers will react with some uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   To mollify retailers, Manager said, Nike sent a letter before
and immediately after the company began selling products on its Web
site last February, explaining how the site would not undermine
their efforts. Among other things, the company stressed that
Nike.com never sells at prices lower than retail, and that it would
promote a ``store locator'' function on the site, allowing users to
find retailers in their area.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, the company has ``been able to navigate
the shark-infested waters of channel conflict'' by being extra kind
to its largest resellers, like Venator Group, which owns Foot
Locker, Champs Sports and a number of other sporting goods chains.
Nike allowed Venator to sell the Air2 Max shoe exclusively last
year in its retail stores and online _ ``which probably netted them
$200 million in revenue,'' Manager said.
</P>
<P>
   More concrete examples are evident in Compaq Computer Corp.'s
appeasement of distributors and retailers since it began selling
computers online about five years ago. According to Mainspring,
Compaq experienced a 12 percent drop in commercial PC revenues in
recent years as a result of retailiation from resellers who
objected to the manufacturer's online selling.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, however, Compaq has gone to great lengths to
bring its resellers back into the fold by committing more resources
to the sales and advertising efforts of companies that sell Compaq
products to business customers. At the same time, it has begun a
program whereby retailers like Radio Shack earn an undisclosed fee
for every Compaq computer bought from one of the 9,000 Compaq
Internet kiosks the company has placed in stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always marvel at the fact that their notebook computers
can do what a mainframe did 10 years ago,'' said Jim Finlaw, a
Compaq spokesman. ``But people don't look at the evolution of how
this stuff is sold, too. The channel will evolve. It's in constant
motion.''
</P>
<P>
   While some manufacturers have established an Internet presence,
far more have avoided the direct-selling model altogether. In some
cases, however, companies are actually doing both. Procter &AMP;
Gamble, for one, has opted not to sell its vast lineup of beauty
care products online but has instead created an entirely new brand
of personalized beauty products, Reflect.com, to sell on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was P &AMP; G's genius to remove the barrier of channel
conflict by forming a new brand,'' said Andrew Swinand, director of
marketing for Reflect, which was formed in September and is
majority-owned by Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts often say the direct-sales model benefits consumers
primarily by allowing manufacturers to offer lower prices _ an
argument Swinand disputes. ``That ends up hurting brand equity,''
he said, because consumers may then associate the brand with
lower-priced, lower-quality companies.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Orlowski, vice president of information systems with the
National Association of Manufacturers, says: ``There's a lot more
talk about how e-commerce is good for manufacturers than there is
proof that it's good for every industry. It's a real tough sell in
general, because no one wants to add staff or re-engineer their
business processes without a guarantee there'll be revenue there to
support it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People forget that Dell was built to work this way from the
start, because they were selling direct,'' Orlowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Such caveats aside, Anne Standley, who prepared a recent report
on channel conflict for Mindspring, said consumers can still expect
manufacturers to get online and at least prepare to sell. ``A lot
of e-commerce is trial and error,'' Ms. Standley said. ``If
manufacturers don't face the high risk of alienating retailers, at
least they should get online to get that process going sooner, so
they'll be ready to take advantage of technology that's not
available now.''

DIGITAL COMMERCE: THE GLOBAL AUTOMATON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a year of big gambles, the biggest of all may be the wager
that our exalted Internet, held together with baling wire and
chewing gum in every conceivable way _ legally, structurally,
economically _ is going to be able to withstand the coming heavy
weather of a truly global, unregulated economy.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps the question is whether we will be able to withstand
a global, unregulated Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, here at ground zero _ in the United States,
capital of global capitalism _ stock market experts are beginning
to acknowledge what some of us have suspected for a long time:
Technology stocks, in particular, are being kept aloft on their own
hot air.
</P>
<P>
   People buy them because they are performing better than regular
stocks; they are performing better than regular stocks because
people keep buying them.
</P>
<P>
   And the mystery surrounding Internet stock valuations _ what are
the criteria? _ may have been solved last week by Michael
Mauboussin, the chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse First
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The more popular the World Wide Web site, he declared, the
higher its ``ranking,'' the more the company is worth.
</P>
<P>
   Just like high school: Web sites with the highest valuations are
like football captains or cheerleaders, whose top-of-the-chart
popularity ratings give them far greater currency in the social
order than, for example, the shy, geeky nerds who may excel in art
or science.
</P>
<P>
   Upon these things our new economy is built.
</P>
<P>
   Now take this relatively microcosmic situation _ that the
Internet stock market in the United States is a popularity contest,
based on consumer moods and filled with millions of networked
investors bluffing the financial markets like a poker game _ and
consider what the ripple effect might be on an expanding global
economy.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, some big thinkers _ most notably, Manuel Castells,
author in 1998 of ``The Information Age: Economy, Society and
Culture'' _ start to get a little skittish about our big Internet
gamble. In an essay titled, ``Information Technology and Global
Capitalism,'' Castells presents a chilling argument.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the globalization of largely unregulated and
increasingly fluid financial markets, he says, ``we may have
created an automaton.'' By that, he means ``an electronic-based
system of financial transactions which overwhelms controls and
regulations by governments, international institutions and private
financial firms, as well as individual investors, consumers and
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Castells' essay is included in a book to be published in London
early this year called ``On the Edge: Essays on a Runaway World,''
edited by Anthony Giddens, the director of the London School of
Economics, and Will Hutton, the editor of The Observer in London.
</P>
<P>
   Castells does not mean the term ``automaton'' literally. There
are as yet few instances of financial transactions fully automated
beyond the bounds of human intervention _ particularly after
computer programs helped induce the stock market crash of October
1987 and the Securities and Exchange Commission began setting some
limits on program trading.
</P>
<P>
   But he cites a trend toward the computerization of trading
systems: Nasdaq in the United States; Eurex in the German bond
market; M, the French futures exchange; the London International
Financial Futures Exchange, and private trading networks like
Instinet, owned by Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   Castells argues that these increasingly interconnected
electronic networks, combined with domestic deregulation, the
liberal flow of financial transactions across national borders and
a constant, international flow of market-related news and
information over the Internet, make the ``nightmare'' of watching
machines take control seem ``on the edge of becoming reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of networked computers with minds of their own is not
new. But the computers envisioned in science fiction may belong to
Mensa, the social network for those with the highest IQs; the
network of Castells' nightmare is a dumb brute, knee-jerking to
information turbulences that are amplified by inputs from millions
of individual investors, creating ever-greater complexity and
volatility.
</P>
<P>
   The automaton is only the first problem that Castells cites for
the future of today's go-go Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   Although American industry has managed to gut its labor
movement, he says, Europe and Japan are less thrilled about the
potential for ``productivity'' technology that first takes away
jobs, then dismantles government supports.
</P>
<P>
   Whether we like it or not, he continues, if they believe that
network technology will do either of these things, ``there will be
a backlash of social struggles, and political reactions, that will
simply block reform and innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   And because the United States is now interdependent on global
economic performance, such a backlash ``will ultimately exhaust the
growth capacity of the U.S. economy,'' he warns.
</P>
<P>
   Castells' belief, which is bound to be deeply unpopular in the
United States, is that healthy global capitalism requires global
financial regulations. Further, he argues that those regulations
must take into account not only technological productivity and
growth spurred by capital investment but also ``socio-institutional
engineering'' that respects, values and includes people and
cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually no one in the U.S. government, and certainly no one
who is rolling in Internet clover, wants to touch this issue. Why
would they? The United States is far and away the world leader in
the information industries. And access to more and more global
markets _ in part by dismantling regulations and government
controls _ has been one of the hallmarks of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   We ignore such issues at our own peril, Castells says. The
fragility of global capitalism is such that a new round of
instability, ``perhaps induced by the collapse of Internet stocks,
or by a sudden panic around electronic trading networks,'' he
writes, could trigger a stampede toward the exits.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, ``there could be governments or significant
segments of society opting out of global capitalism,'' he suggests
_ ``not necessarily to build an alternative system, but just to
recover some degree of control over their lives and values.''

NOTEBOOK COMPUTERS FIT INTO TIGHT BUDGETS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Notebook computers once were used only by corporate
types who'd fallen into favor with the hardware gods at the office,
or who checked out a battered model from the departmental pool.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past few years, computer makers have realized that
there's more to portable life than just customers at the Fortune
1000. They've discovered that your Uncle Barry, with his
on-the-side phone-card business, needs a notebook to keep track of
his sales while on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those sales are still piddling, so Uncle Barry can't
afford much, but he still needs a decent machine that can run
office applications in a frisky manner. And because it may be his
only machine, it may need to have some consumer features, too.
</P>
<P>
   Computer manufacturers feel Uncle Barry's pain and, sensing a
market opportunity, have churned out models such as the three
below:
</P>
<P>
   ThinkPad 1480 _ $2,300, IBM
</P>
<P>
   This is a member of IBM's iSeries line, sold primarily at
retail, but also online. IBM aims this portable at small- and
home-business users, as well as consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The 1480 comes with a 466-megahertz Intel Celeron processor, 64
megabytes of memory, a 6.4-gigabyte hard drive, a 4X DVD-ROM drive,
a 14.1-inch active matrix display, a built-in 56K fax modem, a
built-in floppy drive and all the usual ports and slots. That
includes an S-video connection, so you can play DVD movies on a TV.
</P>
<P>
   While the model I had came in basic black, looking very much
like most other ThinkPads, it is available in seven different
colored covers. Open it up, and you'll see yet another departure
from IBM's basic black color scheme _ a festive set of Internet and
program-launching buttons.
</P>
<P>
   This notebook was a great performer, launching programs quickly
and playing most games smoothly. The screen was crisp and clear and
very bright, looking best in its native 1,024-by-768 resolution. It
played DVDs particularly well and has external controls so you can
listen to music CDs without turning the computer on.
</P>
<P>
   ThinkPads all come with IBM's familiar TrackPoint pointing
device, which looks like an eraser jammed between the G and H keys.
While I like this device, others find it hard to get used to. And
it's fairly easy to hit the nub accidentally, which sends your
cursor careening into the paragraphs above.
</P>
<P>
   Battery life was excellent; I got well over three hours of power
on a charge.
</P>
<P>
   IBM cuts costs by not even pretending to make this machine a
lightweight. It's quite wide, which makes room for a 15-inch screen
available in other models. I had a hard time jamming it into my
notebook carrying case.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the plastics used on it are fairly cheap as well. A
switch for the nightlight _ which illuminates the keyboard in the
dark _ popped off, as did a latch for securing the battery.
</P>
<P>
   Prosignia 150 _ $2,200, Compaq Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Prosignia brand is the one Compaq sells online and through
its DirectPlus mail-order operation, but it's very similar in
design and features to some of its Presario notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   The 150 uses a 475-MHz Advanced Micro Devices K6-2 chip, 64 MB
of memory, a 6.4-GB hard drive, a DVD-ROM drive (though the model I
tried had a 24X CD-ROM instead), a built-in 56K fax modem, a
built-in floppy drive, a 14.1-inch active matrix screen and the
usual set of ports.
</P>
<P>
   The Prosignia line uses a touchpad as a cursor, and I really
like Compaq's implementation, which is very responsive. However, I
found myself brushing it with the base of my thumb while typing,
which again hurled the cursor northward.
</P>
<P>
   The 150 also has a set of Internet buttons on it, as well as
external CD controls.
</P>
<P>
   It, too, was a snappy performer _ the K6-2 chip ran everything
that was thrown at it. Battery power was adequate, lasting just to
the three-hour mark. The screen was gorgeous, though not quite as
bright as the IBM.
</P>
<P>
   And like the ThinkPad, don't plan on nimbly dashing through
airports with this one, either. It's quite heavy, though not as
wide as the IBM model.
</P>
<P>
   Inspiron 3700 _ $2,400, Dell Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Dell also has discovered the joy of color, though the Inspiron
3700 only gives you two choices for an accent color that graces the
inside of the machine _ dark blue or hunter green. I had a blue
model, which my oldest daughter succinctly described by saying,
``Uh, Daddy, that's really ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Underneath its skin, though, the 3700 has a 466-MHz Celeron
chip, 64 MB of memory, a 6-GB hard drive, a 6X DVD-ROM drive, a
modular floppy drive, a 14.1-inch active matrix screen and the
usual ports.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it does not come with a built-in modem. Instead,
Dell includes a 56K PC-card modem. It also comes with a DVD
controller in the form of a PC card, so once you pop both of these
into the two PC-card slots, you're full up.
</P>
<P>
   Also note that, of the three machines, it does not accommodate
both a floppy and the CD or DVD drive at the same time, unless you
use an optional external adapter for the floppy. Otherwise, you
have to swap between the two drives.
</P>
<P>
   It comes with a touchpad controller, which I found was not quite
as responsive as the Compaq's. On the other hand, it also didn't
have the jumping cursor problem.
</P>
<P>
   While the screen had a crisp look, it was the darkest of the
three. In bright light, such as a shaded outdoor area, it was
almost unviewable.
</P>
<P>
   It also had the least amount of battery life, giving me only
about two hours of juice between charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Inspiron 3700, like its competitors here, is a heavy, bulky
machine. I look forward to the day when machines in this class
don't double as weightlifting devices.

A FAULTY CENSOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though I'm no fan of the deceased rap musician Biggie Smalls,
I'd never recoil in horror at the very sight of him. But my
computer does. One glimpse of the man, and the system locks up.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing happens with my childhood role models, the Three
Stooges. If I seek out Internet images of their old movie posters,
my PC throws a fit. The machine has even developed an allergy to
the work of Michelangelo.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I can't display pictures of naked women on
this computer, either. And that's what really matters, right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, if you think so, just shell out $29.95 for Eyeguard, a
flawed but fascinating piece of British software that takes this
Internet porn-filtering thing a wee bit further.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of looking for known smut sites, or even scanning for
dirty words, Eyeguard tracks the images that appear on your
monitosoftware tries _ not always successfully _ to figure
out whether these are porn pictures. And if they are, Eyeguard
protects your mind from corruption by blanking out the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success on hitting pornography, on our tests, is more than
98 or 99 percent,'' says Jonathan Scott, technical director at
Eye-T Technology Ltd., which developed Eyeguard. I believe him. The
trouble is that Eyeguard only attains this high batting average by
weeding out a variety of harmless stuff.
</P>
<P>
   It's the classic problem with all Internet filters: the curse of
the ``false positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Early word-scanning programs would reject Web sites that used
the word ``breast'' because the software wasn't smart enough to
notice that the next word was ``cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   The word-sniffers are much smarter now, but still far from
infallible, a fact often touted by libertarian types who oppose all
efforts to tidy up the Web.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not a libertarian. I loathe Web porn and welcome efforts to
shield our kids from the filth. So I'm inclined to look kindly on
Eyeguard. Then there's my love for clever technologies. And for all
its failings, Eyeguard is about as impressive a program as I've
seen in 1999. Just think what this program must do.
</P>
<P>
   A stream of compressed-image data, mixed with text and sounds
and who-knows-what-else, comes flooding into your computer.
Eyeguard must wait until the video data are dumped into the
computer's video display system, which has its own separate
processor and memory bank. Eyeguard scans the contents of the video
memory, in search of image pixels that appear to be human skin. It
must decode the pattern of these pixels to decide how much skin is
showing, and then it must decide at what point the image crosses
the line from PG-13 to XXX.It's a miracle it works at all.
</P>
<P>
   Right out of the box, it locked me out of the official
``Baywatch'' Web site, which ought to be renamed Silicone Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Eyeguard is tunable, so you can make it less sensitive. The
higher the setting, the more skin you're allowed to see. Eyeguard
starts at a stingy 20 percent, far too strict for ``Baywatch.'' But
jump it up to 50 percent, and say hello to Pamela Anderson. And at
this looser setting, the software still thwarted my fumbling,
shamefaced efforts to visit some true smut sites.
</P>
<P>
   Even at 50 percent, though, I found myself locked out of some
harmless Web pages. Biggie Smalls's picture was on a page at the
CNN news site, describing the dead musician's new album. Smalls is
shown fully clothed, but there must be something about his face.
Oh, well. I never much cared for him, either.
</P>
<P>
   But what's wrong with the Three Stooges? Curly occasionally wore
drag, but he never did a nude scene. As for Michelangelo, maybe
it's a testament to his genius that one of his statues of a
reclining nude seemed disgracefully lifelike to Eyeguard.
</P>
<P>
   Scott admits the software isn't perfect, but says it's mainly a
deterrent. When a child looks at a forbidden image, Eyeguard saves
a copy in a special file, so Mom and Dad will find out. The same
feature is built into the $299 version for corporate networks.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the product's most powerful feature is a sheet of bright
yellow warning stickers to be glued to computers. Scott said one
company stopped using Eyeguard after two weeks; workers cleaned up
their acts once they realized the firm had an automatic porn
detector.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Eyeguard is also a rap-star detector, a
Renaissance-art detector, even a stooge detector. It's too prudish
even for my tastes. Nice try, though.

BITTER DEBATE ON PRIVACY DIVIDES TWO EXPERTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Questions about the data collection practices of
a subsidiary of Amazon, the Internet's largest retailer, have
erupted in a confrontation between a respected computer security
expert and a renowned Internet pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   The security expert is Richard M. Smith, who has recently
dedicated much of his professional life to uncovering privacy
issues arising from software flaws and e-commerce schemes.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet pioneer is Brewster Kahle, founder of Alexa
Internet, the San Francisco-based Amazon subsidiary that developed
the data-collection software in question. The software is being
tested for use with Amazon's forthcoming zBubbles
comparison-shopping service.
</P>
<P>
   The software, which is currently available only in a trial
version and only on the Alexa Web site, monitors which sites a
consumer visits, looks for patterns shared by many individual
shoppers and then aggregates information about the collective
navigation of Web users. It is designed to continually learn about
shopping behavior and improve the quality of information it makes
available to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Smith filed a formal complaint with the Federal
Trade Commission in which he said his examination of the behavior
of the Alexa software had revealed that it was capable of gathering
far more personal data about consumers than Amazon tells customers
it is collecting.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who earlier this year drew widespread attention to the
privacy practices of a number of large Internet companies including
Microsoft Corp. and RealNetworks, said he discovered that both
Alexa programs occasionally pass on personal information including
names, postal addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses. They
also gather information about the things people are searching for
and pass all this data to network server computers operated by
Alexa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the transmission of this personal data is a
breach of the zBubbles License and Usage Agreement,'' Smith
asserted in a letter to Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chairman. ``In
addition, the software may also violate a number of federal laws
including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Wednesday, Kahle defended the Alexa
technology, saying that while some information was unavoidably
collected from Web surfers, the important point was that the
information was not stored permanently and was not used to connect
Web behavior to a person's identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard that we're attempting to uphold,'' Kahle said,
``is that if a government agency were to come and subpoena us and
ask, `Where was an individual going on the Web before he bombed the
federal building?' we'd be able to say, `We don't know.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the confrontation is an Internet privacy issue
that is currently being bitterly disputed in Washington: whether
the good intentions of a corporation are sufficient to protect
individual privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is important about what Richard's identified here,'' said
James X. Dempsey, staff counsel for the Center for Democracy and
Technology, a Washington based lobbying group, is how easily Web
sites can collect pieces of data that ``come to include information
that most people would consider personal.''
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation is extraordinary because it positions two well
regarded technologists on opposite sides of a complex debate.
Kahle, who had previously designed information retrieval software
at Thinking Machines Inc., and WAIS Inc., two companies he helped
found, started Alexa Internet in 1996. Since the company was
acquired by Amazon earlier this year, Alexa has focused on
developing the retail giant's zBubbles service.
</P>
<P>
   The Alexa technology attempts to offer online shoppers improved
guidance on how to retrieve information about goods and services.
It does this by studying the paths followed by many Web surfers so
that individual consumers can benefit from an aggregation of
shopping experiences.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the company states on its Web site that it
does not link individual identity to Web activity. Smith asserts
that this discrepancy intentionally misleads customers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kahle said the behavior of his software reflected his own
struggle for more than a decade over the potential privacy issues
raised by information retrieval technology. During the 1980s while
at Thinking Machines, a Cambridge, Mass.-based maker of
supercomputers, Kahle said, he was already developing information
retrieval technology used commercially by Dow Jones.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, he said, the challenge was making sure that
employees did not misappropriate information about what Dow Jones
customers were searching for. In 1992, Kahle wrote a paper titled
``Ethics of Digital Librarianship,'' which dealt with the
responsibility of librarians to keep personal information private
in the computer era.
</P>
<P>
   Foreshadowing the very criticism he is now facing, Kahle wrote,
``At this point this is not a problem since few servers are of a
personal nature yet, but as the system grows to include
entertainment, employment, health and other servers, it is easy to
imagine the types of information that will be accessible through
operating such a server.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith argues that despite policy statements published on both
the Amazon and Alexa Web sites, most users are not fully aware of
the nature of the information that is being sent to the Alexa Web
servers.
</P>
<P>
   That is because Web sites are increasingly becoming massive
databases that gather personal data in order to personalize content
or advertising to individual consumers. A byproduct of that trend
is that universal resource locators, or URLs, as the addresses of
Web pages are known, increasingly contain personal information that
sites have gathered. All of this information gets collected,
intentionally or not, by simply monitoring the URLs of pages
consumers visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems is that all of this stuff is very
slippery,'' Smith said. ``I respect Brewster's ethics, but what
happens if he leaves? There are no legal protections on the Web.''

   SACAGAWEA-DOLLAR (Washington) _ Now that you have survived the
Y2K bug, get ready for another turkey: the new Sacagawea dollar
coin. Feminists have had complete control over its design. The U.S.
Mint wants to market it like a Beannie Baby. And the vending
machine industry hopes to use it to kill the paper dollar we know
and love. By GARY GRIFFITH.
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Well, that's the way to start the
first week of the millennium. I took Monday off to get a smog
check. Not just to get a smog check, of course. I also had to get a
reality check after working New Year's and renewing my faith in the
human race. What a grand weekend it was, with all those Y2K buggers
proven wrong. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   EURO-DOLLAR (Washington)_One year ago, 11 Europeans
combined in a monetary union to create a single currency. The
economic goal of this unprecedented joint-currency, known as the
``Euro,`` was as ambitious as the international politics that
spawned it: a currency that would not only deliver greater
prosperity but potentially rival the dollar. As the Euro's
year-long depreciation _ punctuated twice recently with its fall
below parity with the dollar _ should remind us, economic
fundamentals still determine economic growth. By J.T. YOUNG.

   SIERRA-SNOW (San Francisco) _ The California Department of Water

BRAZIL.
</P>
<P>
   HEROIN-SKIN (San Francisco _ The growing and costly epidemic of
skin abscesses plaguing injection drug addicts in San Francisco has
prompted

<P>
   efforts to combat the problem. The drug-related skin infections
have placed a tremendous burden on emergency rooms and filled
hospital beds. By RACHEL GORDON.
</P>
<P>
   NO-POKEMON (San Antonio) _ Some school administrators mobilized
for a post-Christmas invasion of the popular Pokemon toys, banning
the products in the classroom. The precautions were prompted in
part by recent incidents involving the Hasbro toy, including one in
Philadelphia where four middle school students were arrested for
attacking other students to steal Pokemon cards. By IHOSVANI

<P>
   FBN-NINERS (Santa Clara, Calif.) _ The quarterback still talked
as if the 49ers' ability to return to prominence hinged on only a
simple
</P>
<P>
   attitude adjustment. That's the message Steve Young left as he
headed into an offseason filled with questions about his future and
that of
</P>
<P>
   his beloved team. Young missed 13 games this season as a result
of a concussion, and from the sidelines he witnessed a 49ers team
that had lost the edge that once made them great, their ``craving''
for a championship, as Young put it. By JEFFRI CHAHIDA.

<P>
   FBN-RATTO-COLUMN (Oakland, Calif.) _ Over the last several

   SANTANA (San Francisco) _ Carlos Santana was always a believer
in miracles. But even he might be having a hard time believing this
one. Just a year ago, more than three decades into his career, the
guitar master seemed to be sliding into ``remember-when'' status in
which you get your star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and are
inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, all the
while struggling to remain relevant. But instead of going gently
into that good night, the 52-year-old rock legend became 1999's
musical comeback story of the year. By JANE GANAHL.

&HT;     SAN ANTONIO SCHOOLS SAY `NO' TO POKEMON 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By IHOSVANI RODRIGUEZ  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ School administrators mobilized for a
post-Christmas invasion of the popular Pokemon cards, games and
figures by banning the products in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The precautions were prompted in part by thefts and fights in
other areas.
</P>
<P>
   According to the market-research company NPD Group Inc.,
Hasbro's Pokemon products accounted for nine of the 20 best-selling
toys during the recent holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still going to stick to our `no (Pokemon) allowed in
school' policy,'' said John Hines, assistant principal at Oak Grove
Elementary in San Antonio. ``We don't even allow them on buses.''
</P>
<P>
   Hines said administrators had not become Grinches. They have
valid concerns. Pokemon has triggered a number of episodes in the
United States and Canada:
</P>
<P>
   _ In Philadelphia four middle school students were arrested for
attacking other students to steal Pokemon cards.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 14-year-old student in Quebec was stabbed during a fight
over the cards.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 9-year-old boy in Connecticut hid inside a store after it
closed to get his hands on Pokemon cards, the authorities said,
only to call for help because he could not get out.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 14-year-old boy in South Carolina was accused of smashing a
store window to steal $250 worth of the cards _ ignoring thousands
of dollars worth of rare coins.
</P>
<P>
   Even adults are committing Pokemon-related violence. A North
Carolina man was charged with punching a Burger King cashier after
he did not get a Pokemon toy with his meal.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and principals in San Antonio have not reported any
problems involving Pokemon products. But Woodlawn Elementary
Principal Richard Tobin sent a memo to parents reiterating the ban
on toys, notably Pokemon cards, at the school.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said he wants to avoid children stealing the cards from
each other, or older children taking advantage of the younger ones
by trading unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   With some Pokemon cards valued at as much as $200, schools may
find themselves in quite a predicament, Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking expensive toys here,'' Tobin said. ``It's not
like they're stolen stickers or candy. If one of these big-price
items gets stolen, then you're getting into an issue of who is
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Students seem to be getting the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a kid who had all his cards taken by the teacher, and
he never saw them again,'' said Luis Ordonez, a fifth-grader at
Montgomery Drive Elementary who was walking out of a game store
with a fresh stack of new cards last week. ``Taking them to school
is dumb.''

   ROSA PARKS: AMERICA'S NO. 1 HEROINE OF SOCIAL STRUGGLES OF 20TH
CENTURY _ ``Since its earliest days as a nation, America has been
blessed with true heroes and heroines, which has caused me to
reject the temptation to join in naming the single `greatest man or
woman of the century,''' writes columnist Vernon Jarrett. ``But
based on my 50 years in journalism and several decades of trying to
become an unbiased student of American history, I can't resist this
nomination of Rosa Parks as `The No. I Heroine of My 20th
Century.'' In this commentary, Jarrett recounts Parks' achievements
and milestones and the effects they had on the civil-rights
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER CENSUS COUNTDOWN? _ The League of United Latin American
Citizens and other organizations hope to educate Hispanics on the
importance of an accurate population tally. In this commentary from
Hispanic Business magazine, Derek Reveron writes about the
importance of being counted. ``The federal government uses census
figures to determine where and how to apportion funds among county
and local jurisdictions. The feds also employ the figures to form
domestic policy and monitor civil rights laws. State and local
governments use the census numbers in redistricting,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   NATIVE-AMERICANS HOPE FOR A NEW WORLD OF ENLIGHTENMENT _ A
brilliant light reportedly shone on a recent September night in
Navajo country. Some native people believe the unexplained glow
represents a time shift more significant than the dawn of the new
millennium. Chippewa writer Elisabeth Dietz, co-author of a book on
Native-American prophecies called ``Now Is the Hour'' (Blue
Dolphin, 1988), said she believes the light marks an emergence into
another age, as foretold by her native elders. Columnist Karen
Lincoln Michel writes about what Dietz describes as a ``spiritual
rebirth'' for all people, not just Native-Americans. ``We're
entering a new world of enlightenment,'' Dietz says. ``We've just
come through a time where we've forgotten how to treat Mother Earth
and each other. Now we have to let go of the aggression toward the
Earth and learn to live in harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   EQUAL MARRIAGE RIGHTS FOR GAYS LIKE US _ The Vermont Supreme
Court, with its recent same-sex marriage decision, has given the
gay community a rare opportunity _ the chance to ``persuade
lawmakers to provide the full badge of citizenship by recognizing
the freedom to marry,'' writes Columnist Chuck Colbert, who is
spending the holidays in Arizona, with his domestic partner's
family. Over time, Colbert and his partner have experienced full
acceptance and inclusion within the extended family circle. ``We
realize,'' he writes, ``that people of goodwill need a reasonable
period of time to get comfortable with the m-word's applying to
lesbian and gay couples. But personal discomfort should not hold
back the Vermont legislature from doing the right thing: legalize
same sex marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   FREEDOM AND HONOR IN THE WHITE HOUSE _ The drama of 10-year-old
Elian Gonzales who survived five days in Atlantic waters after his
refugee raft sunk, killing his mother, continues with Cuba's Fidel
Castro demanding his return and the Clinton administration's
wavering between justice and Castro. Should the mother's wishes be
honored even though she drowned in her failed effort to bring the
child to freedom? Or, should the White House bend to pressure from
Cuba? ``The boy should stay here, as the mother wished for
citizenship,'' writes columnist Raoul Lowery Contreras.

honored even though she drowned in her failed effort to bring the
child to freedom? Or, should the White House bend to pressure from
Cuba? ``The boy should stay here, as the mother wished for
citizenship,'' writes ct Raoul Lowery Contreras.

   ROSA PARKS: AMERICA'S NO. 1 HEROINE OF SOCIAL STRUGGLES OF 20TH
CENTURY _ ``Since its earliest days as a nation, America has been
blessed with true heroes and heroines, which has caused me to
reject the temptation to join in naming the single `greatest man or
woman of the century,''' writes columnist Vernon Jarrett. ``But
based on my 50 years in journalism and several decades of trying to
become an unbiased student of American history, I can't resist this
nomination of Rosa Parks as `The No. I Heroine of My 20th
Century.'' In this commentary, Jarrett recounts Parks' achievements
and milestones and the effects they had on the civil-rights
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER CENSUS COUNTDOWN? _ The League of United Latin American
Citizens and other organizations hope to educate Hispanics on the
importance of an accurate population tally. In this commentary from
Hispanic Business magazine, Derek Reveron writes about the
importance of being counted. ``The federal government uses census
figures to determine where and how to apportion funds among county
and local jurisdictions. The feds also employ the figures to form
domestic policy and monitor civil rights laws. State and local
governments use the census numbers in redistricting,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   NATIVE-AMERICANS HOPE FOR A NEW WORLD OF ENLIGHTENMENT _ A
brilliant light reportedly shone on a recent September night in
Navajo country. Some native people believe the unexplained glow
represents a time shift more significant than the dawn of the new
millennium. Chippewa writer Elisabeth Dietz, co-author of a book on
Native-American prophecies called ``Now Is the Hour'' (Blue
Dolphin, 1988), said she believes the light marks an emergence into
another age, as foretold by her native elders. Columnist Karen
Lincoln Michel writes about what Dietz describes as a ``spiritual
rebirth'' for all people, not just Native-Americans. ``We're
entering a new world of enlightenment,'' Dietz says. ``We've just
come through a time where we've forgotten how to treat Mother Earth
and each other. Now we have to let go of the aggression toward the
Earth and learn to live in harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   EQUAL MARRIAGE RIGHTS FOR GAYS LIKE US _ The Vermont Supreme
Court, with its recent same-sex marriage decision, has given the
gay community a rare opportunity _ the chance to ``persuade
lawmakers to provide the full badge of citizenship by recognizing
the freedom to marry,'' writes Columnist Chuck Colbert, who is
spending the holidays in Arizona, with his domestic partner's
family. Over time, Colbert and his partner have experienced full
acceptance and inclusion within the extended family circle. ``We
realize,'' he writes, ``that people of goodwill need a reasonable
period of time to get comfortable with the m-word's applying to
lesbian and gay couples. But personal discomfort should not hold
back the Vermont legislature from doing the right thing: legalize
same sex marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   FREEDOM AND HONOR IN THE WHITE HOUSE _ The drama of 10-year-old
Elian Gonzales who survived five days in Atlantic waters after his
refugee raft sunk, killing his mother, continues with Cuba's Fidel
Castro demanding his return and the Clinton administration's
wavering between justice and Castro. Should the mother's wishes be
honored even though she drowned in her failed effort to bring the
child to freedom? Or, should the White House bend to pressure from
Cuba? ``The boy should stay here, as the mother wished for
citizenship,'' writes columnist Raoul Lowery Contreras.

 &HT;    By Rachel Sauer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALISADE, Colo. _ You have to push hard on the front door
because it's an old door and an old building, one of those old
buildings with quirks and smooth-edged bricks and walls that talk.
</P>
<P>
   At Slice O' Life Bakery in Palisade the walls say mmmmm ...
</P>
<P>
   It's a toasty warm and stuffed full of cinnamon rolls kind of
mmmmm ... because when you push open the door and walk in, the
smells _ bread, cinnamon, cookies _ hug you and kiss your cheek.
</P>
<P>
   And then you'll see Mary Lincoln, her comfortable clothes
covered by a white apron and hair tied back in a scarf, moving
around the open kitchen at the back of the bakery adding eggs to a
bowl of sweet roll dough or washing a pan or inspecting a berry pie
as it comes out of the enormous rotating oven.
</P>
<P>
   Slice O' Life is her place, has been since 1980, and even in a
town where anything less than five generations is considered a
newcomer, Slice O' Life has become as associated with Palisade as
peaches and the town grouch. And like those other institutions,
Slice O' Life is constant when the rest of the town is growing and
changing in unpredictable bursts.
</P>
<P>
   Mary, her husband, Tim, and their kids moved to Palisade from
Alma in 1976. She'd come to the valley to visit friends ``and it's
gorgeous here, especially in fall,'' she said. ``And then there
were all these fruits and vegetables. I was overwhelmed. I was
sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Because she'd studied dietetics in college, and because she
always knew she'd make a living doing something with food, she
began supplementing the cooking and experimenting with recipes she
did for her family with cooking for her friends. By 1980 she had a
commercial baking license and contracts with a few area businesses
and individuals, but decided to take a leap of faith and open her
own bakery.
</P>
<P>
   She got the store at 105 W. Third St. and a retail baking
license, and outfitted the kitchen with equipment she still uses.
She had no idea what she was doing, but probably wouldn't have
started the bakery if she had.
</P>
<P>
   Those first few years were an experiment and the bakery was a
work in progress. Most days she went in at 4 a.m. and, using her
own recipes, started baking _ breads, cookies, pies, everything but
doughnuts. They were exciting, nervous times. Once she accidentally
gave a customer a cup of maple syrup instead of a cup of her coffee
made from cold water extract because she was so excited about
selling something she made from her recipe.
</P>
<P>
   She made, and still makes, baked goods with whole products
because she thinks they're better and people appreciate things that
aren't pre-packaged and shot through with preservatives and ready
straight from the freezer with all the taste of a gum wrapper. She
uses Palisade fruit and local honey and continually lets her
recipes evolve.
</P>
<P>
   After Mary started the bakery, the town filled in around her and
supported Slice O' Life. Mary hired others to help her out and
tried new recipes. Even during the energy industry bust, when many
Palisade businesses closed and the town's population noticeably
shrank, people still came in ``because people have a dollar or two
to spend on something from the bakery, where they might not buy a
new car or a new house.''
</P>
<P>
   Her children helped out after school and brought their friends,
and Slice O' Life developed its reputation as a place where
teen-agers are welcome because Mary thinks they're great. It's a
place where anyone is welcome, for that matter. When her older sons
were teen-agers and into skateboarding, they called themselves Team
Fruitcake and put fruitcake labels on their skateboards. Mary got
puzzled mothers coming to her saying their kids wanted Fruitcake
labels for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Anna Lincoln, the oldest of the Lincoln kids, bakes,
while son Curt runs the fruitcake operation this year. Son Sam
helps out with cookies and pies, and son Matt does the grocery
shopping because he's best at it. Tim runs his cabinet business
behind the bakery and does the cooking at home.
</P>
<P>
   Slice O' Life has received national and international attention
for its goods _ it's mentioned in a Fodor's travel guide. The
bakery sends its famous fruitcakes to customers overseas and
shipped some of its peach bread across China for a team of
mountaineers climbing Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the attention and adulation of Slice O' Life
devotees, the bakery is constant: Mary, and whoever happens to be
helping in the kitchen, will be baking for individual and
commercial customers, trying new recipes and greeting friends and
new faces who come into the mellow store with wood floors worn from
wear and a glass display case filled with temptation.
</P>
<P>
   The bakery is like an old friend in the middle of a Palisade
block, watching the town as it has grown and changed from one
farmer with ideas about orchards.
</P>
<P>
   The first settler in the area was John P. Harlow, who in 1881
settled two miles east of Palisade on Rapid Creek. He planted the
first peach orchard in the valley and, because of its success, more
settlers came to the area to plant orchards in Vineland, the area
east of the Colorado, on East Orchard Mesa and around what now is
an expanding town.
</P>
<P>
   The town, originally called Palisades, was named for the
Bookcliff palisades guarding the town on the north. The local
school graduated its first class in 1900 and voted to incorporate
in 1903.
</P>
<P>
   The basis for the town's economy always has been, and largely
remains, agriculture _ farmers growing peaches, pears, apples,
cherries, apricots and grapes built canals to reclaim the fertile
land from the desert and brought attention and money to the area,
creating such a boom that in the first decade of this century 1
acre of land sold from between $1,000 and $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants, teachers, railroad workers and others moved to
Palisade during the first half of the century, when the predominant
peach industry routinely grossed millions of dollars. Between 1942
and 1950, growers shipped at least 1 million bushels of peaches per
season.
</P>
<P>
   Some freezes during the 1940s sent fruit production into a
decline in the 1950s, and the fruit yield hasn't again been as high
as it was during the first  the century, but Palisade is
still known for its fruit. It's a town that looks positively lush
from the interstate, a town filled with people who remember when
and are friendly enough to tell you about it, a town that loves its
high school teams and values tradition and hard work and has the
only insectary in the state. But people want to know about those
peaches.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s vineyards began appearing more regularly on the
patchwork of fields and orchards across the east Grand Valley
floor, and now Palisade is becoming well-known for its wineries and
wines as it is for the orchards.
</P>
<P>
   That has brought the town attention. Currently, the population
is about 2,100 and growing, and the town council is looking at
having to improve the infrastructure and wrangle with heavy
land-use issues. People don't want Palisade to change but know it's
going to: Original Victorian homes now share the block with houses
and streets that weren't there last year. People moving in from
California or Denver or any of a hundred other places talk about
the charm of the town, even as they long for the conveniences of a
city.
</P>
<P>
   Palisade is changing, and yet there are the constants: the Peach
Festival parade with the elected town grouch on a float; people
like Gordon the barber and Mrs. Crane at the elementary school and
Bud over at the dry cleaners and Mike who'll fix you up with
insurance; and the Slice O' Life bakery.
</P>
<P>
   Mary has no plans to leave or retire. She and those who work at
Slice O' Life ride the changes with the town _ the busy summer
months, the people who come and go, the new ideas _ from the shop
with the door that sticks, that glows with comfort and hospitality
and those smells that tell you to come on in.

   Mary Lincoln takes a break with a cup of hot tea in the kitchen
of her Slice O' Life Bakery in Palisade. Lincoln and her family
started the business in 1980 after moving to Palisade, seen at far
right, because ``it's gorgeous here, especially in fall,'' Lincoln
said. ``And then there were all these fruits and vegetables. I was
overwhelmed. I was sold.''

&HT;     THE EURO'S ECONOMICS LESSON 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By J.T. YOUNG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One year ago, 11 European nations combined in a
monetary union to create a single currency. The economic goal of
this unprecedented joint-currency, known as the ``euro,`` was as
ambitious as the international politics that spawned it: a currency
that would not only deliver greater prosperity but potentially
rival the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   As the euro's year-long depreciation _ punctuated twice recently
with its fall below parity with the dollar _ should remind us,
economic fundamentals still determine economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 Maastricht Treaty mapped out the monetary union. It
would link the participating nations' central banks into al
structure in which each nation had a voice in determining monetary
policy. In order to participate,
</P>
<P>
   each nation had to control inflation, limit its budget deficit
and national debt and agree to fix exchange rates to that of other
participating nations for at
</P>
<P>
   least two years.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the 15 members of the European Union (Austria,
Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain _ dubbing themselves ``Euroland``)
joined. On Jan. 1, 1999 the euro was officially born.
</P>
<P>
   With a single currency, ``Euroland`` could expect to realize
real economies by reducing the transaction costs of changing
between a multiplicity of currencies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the group's ground rules for participation also
promised reduced currency volatility and limited intrusion by the
respective governments.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Euroland also hoped to attract increased capital simply
by having a broadly used, strong currency that would become a
desirable currency to hold.
</P>
<P>
   The implicit thought was that the euro could rival the dollar
and appreciate against it.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of 1999, these hopes were humbled. The euro
topped in value at about $1.18 last January and then depreciated _
twice falling below dollar parity by year's end _ by roughly 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   That such depreciation has occurred is not all that surprising
when one looks behind the Euroland label. Yes, the 11 Eurolanders
have auspicious potential. Their combined populations represent 290
million well-educated members of the industrialized world (the
United States has 270 million) and economically they amount to just
under 75 percent of U.S. GDP ($6.5 trillion versus $8.6 trillion
for the United States in 1998).
</P>
<P>
   However, the members and the organization have serious problems
as well. First, while the euro may be a single currency, Euroland
has no central government. Enforcement is bound to be a problem.
What happens if members retreat from the initial economic
standards? Several had to make onerous efforts just to meet
standards that were not all that rigorous in the first place (a
national deficit of 3 percent of GDP was permitted, equal to a
$280-billion U.S. budget deficit). They have been able to meet them
in large part because their economies recently have been prosperous
relative to European standards.
</P>
<P>
   What happens in less sanguine circumstances?
</P>
<P>
   Such questions raise fundamental economic and governmental
questions. While the United States faces serious decisions in
adjusting its entitlement programs to an increasingly graying
population, these pale in comparison to Europe's far richer
programs, which must be financed by far smaller and less dynamic
economies. In a comparison to the previous year, Euroland's economy
grew 2.6 percent, 1.9 percent, 1.6 percent, and 1.6 percent from
the third quarter of 1998 through the second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, the U.S. economy grew 3.5 percent, 4.3 percent, 4
percent, and 3.9 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Euroland's unemployment fell below 10 percent for
the first time since December 1992. The U.S. rate is 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   These statistics belie vastly differing economic potentials due
to the impositions of their respective governments. A good estimate
of these potentials is provided by the conservative Heritage
Foundation. Its latest Index of Economic Freedom rates nations on a
host of economic factors _ trade policies, government's fiscal
burden, regulation, foreign investment, banking systems, inflation,
etc. In short, the index serves as a useful prosperity predictor.
</P>
<P>
   According to Heritage's latest estimates, the United States
ranks fourth on the economic freedom index. In comparison, the
average Euroland placement would be
</P>
<P>
   21st.
</P>
<P>
   And even this does not tell the whole story. Because Germany and
France are below this average and make up over half the GDP, a
weighted average would
</P>
<P>
   actually place Euroland 28th on the economic freedom index.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it is not just the chain that is weak, it is the links
themselves. Merely combining them together can only produce so much
of an economic boost.
</P>
<P>
   The more important ones must be made in the fundamental workings
of their economies. And what is most important in determining this
is not what governments do, but in what they refrain from doing.

 &HT;    RUSSIAN LAWMAKERS SET PRESIDENTIAL RACE, PUTIN AS FRONTRUNNER
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's parliament on Wednesday set the date of early
presidential elections on March 26, but many politicians and
analysts aren't expecting much of a race, calling Acting President
Vladimir Putin the clear frontrunner.
</P>
<P>
   A tough-talking former spy with a black-belt in judo, Putin
grabbed the national spotlight IN September after Yeltsin named him
his preferred successor and parliament approved him as Russia's
fifth prime minister in 17 months. Putin, 47, became sole leader of
the country after Boris Yeltsin resigned unexpectedly as president
on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Since early autumn, when he was a virtual unknown, Putin's
approval rating has jumped from almost nothing to 80 percent,
making him the most popular politician in Russia thanks to his
decision to wage war against Islamic separatist rebels in the
southern republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Kremlin officials appear smug with their boss's chances to stay
at the helm. When asked by journalists whether Putin would win, the
presidential deputy head of staff Igor Shabdurasulov said: ``This
is very close to the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, only three other politicians have thrown their hats in
the ring for the presidential race, Gregory Yavlinsky, who heads
the small, pro-reform party Yabloko in the State Duma, or lower
house of parliament; Yevgeny Primakov, a former prime minister
under Yeltsin, whose political bloc also holds seats in the Duma;
and Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the flamboyant nationalist politician.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party, which won the largest number of seats in
the December Duma elections, is expected to name its candidate for
the elections either Thursday or Friday, party leader Gennady
Zyuganov told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the All Russia political party, which ran an
anti-Kremlin campaign in the Duma elections, threw its support
Wednesday behind Putin's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is indicative of which way the wind is blowing,'' said
Nickolai Petrov, a political analyst at the Moscow Carnegie Center
think tank. ``It's Putin's election to lose. The establishment
wants him to win, and he has the tools to do it. No other
presidential hopeful has his resources.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Yeltsin's resignation is expected to boost Putin's
chances in two ways.
</P>
<P>
   First, presidential elections were originally to be held in the
summer, but under the Constitution, when a president resigns,
elections must be held within three months. The shorter time period
_ voted on by the Federation Council, or upper house of parliament
_ makes it unlikely that the tide of the war could turn against the
Russian army, and in turn, have public opinion turn against Putin,
said Moscow political analyst Andrei Piontkovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Government-run media is credited with helping Putin's meteoric
approval ratings. Slavish coverage has been given to the
tough-talking leader's speeches in which he liberally sprinkles the
message of a strong and influential Russia, while little coverage
has been devoted to showing body bags of Russian soldiers killed in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the time-frame throws potential competitors off balance.
Campaign coffers of other leading Russian politicians are nearly
dry, after the six-month parliamentary campaign that ended with
general elections on December 19.

&HT;     FASHION FORECAST FOR SPRING: SPLASHES OF COLOR, SEX APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After nearly two seasons of either haute bohemia
or architectural clothes so plain and linear you could write a
master's thesis on them, spring is flinging the doors open to
riotous color, a plethora of prints (dots and snakeskin), a whole
lot of leg (minis are back with a vengeance), logo-mania (thank
you, very much, John Galliano for Dior-ing the world), and some of
the frilliest clothes since the fall of the French monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Designers are still mining the past for ideas, but updating them
enough that, had you kept your '60s mini skirts, they still
wouldn't look right next to Dolce &AMP; Gabbana's glorified ``belts''
that pass for minis this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Logo-maniacs: The return of designer logos is another kind of
romance with the past. But this time, Chanel and Dior and Louis
Vuitton have not merely marked a piece of leather goods, luggage or
a T-shirt. Designer Karl Lagerfeld used Chanel's Double-Cs in
all-over patterns, as have Galliano with Dior's signature initials
and Marc Jacobs with Louis Vuitton's distinctive ``LV.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruffles are not ridges to designers who have opted for
ultra-femininity in sheer, flowy dresses. Anna Sui went for ruffles
and lace, big time, as did Oscar de la Renta for the French couture
house Balmain. More accessible are Alberta Ferretti's diaphanous
sheers, decorated with a smattering of beads and ending in flippy
little ruffled skirts and close-fitting, belly-button-baring tops.
Even the most avant-garde of the designers, Rei B Kawakubo for
Comme des Garcons, ruffled up modified tutu-skirts for a
surprisingly feminine take on spring. The frill is certainly not
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Snakes alive! Python is a definite trend, both in real skins
(Alber Elbaz's fabulous python trench for Yves Saint Laurent Rive
Gauche or Tom Ford for Gucci's skinny snakeskin hip-riders) and as
a pattern (Ford's like-real silk python print shirts). If you don't
crave the slithery slink for whole articles of clothing, look for
in a rainbow of colors as accessory pieces, particularly
shoes and handbags.
</P>
<P>
   Denim dazzlers: Never has denim made such a big fashion
statement. Not even in the '60s when you couldn't tell the boys
from the girls (at least from the back) has the navy fabric been
used with such abandon, formed into sexy-fitting skirts (Chloe) or
tuff-girl biker jackets (John Galliano for Christian Dior) or even
day dresses (Oscar de la Renta). There are the usual pieces _
jeanswear and short-shorts _ but what's so special about this denim
is finding it with couture labels like Chanel and Dior.
</P>
<P>
   Baring arms: Lots and lots of skin is certainly in for spring,
especially at Donna Karan, where color reigns in very sexy
mousseline dresses with halter necks or spaghetti-strap, deep
decolletage, hankie-hemmed confections in the most delightful
brush-stroke prints. Karan has given up her funereal blacks for a
rainbow of vivid colors _ coral reds, marine blues and aquas.
Delightful as a flower mart.
</P>
<P>
   And, through the print, a hint of bare, tanned, sun-caressed
skin, while deep slits show off long, bare legs.
</P>
<P>
   Dots nice: Talk about your iconographic patterns. There is
nothing sweeter or crisper than black coin-dots on white or vice
versa. Look for them at Geoffrey Beene, Prada, Ferre (on swimwear)
and from America's classicist, Ralph Lauren, who even polka-dotted
his leathers.
</P>
<P>
   Daytime sparkle, hinted at for the past few years, has finally
come into its own with the collections of Alberta Ferretti, Jil
Sander and Sonia Rykiel, who have put beads and studs and other
light-catching gizmos on their day-time jackets and dresses.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one unifying factor in spring, it is a new kind of
femininity _ where edges are blurred, fabrics are lightened up and
sheered, and sex is definitely what they're selling.

is that it's a relatively simple recipe to make at home.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wilser and his partner, Robert Merryman, have created the top
home-cooking spot in San Francisco at Ella's. They serve excellent
dinners, but the place has become known for breakfast. On weekends
the line begins to form a half-hour before the doors open.
</P>
<P>
   The interior, too, is a cut above the coffee shop/cafe mold. The
terra cotta walls are set off by impressive flower arrangements at
the counter in front of the open kitchen. Large draped windows
overlook the corner of Presidio and California, making a bright and
airy impression. At night, it takes on a cozy glow from candles on
each table.

 &UR; _ Molasses.  &LR; Much of the seductive flavor in the sauce comes from

PECAN STICKY BUNS
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   Dough
</P>
<P>
   4 cups bread flour
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 scant tablespoon (1 envelope) active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   11/4 cups warm milk
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   Syrup
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons (3/4 cup) unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup water
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons light molasses
</P>
<P>
   Sticky Buns
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon grated orange zest
</P>
<P>
   1 cup pecan halves
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the dough: &LR;  Place the flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in
a mixing bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook. Add
the milk, egg and butter. Mix for 7 minutes on low speed until a
soft, sticky dough forms. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set
aside in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in volume, about 30
to 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the syrup: &LR;  In a small saucepan, combine the brown
sugar, butter, water and molasses. Bring to a boil, stirring
constantly. Cook to 242 degrees on a candy thermometer, about 8 to
10 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool slightly.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the sticky buns: &LR;  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Pour
a little of the melted butter into a 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Use a
brush to grease the bottom and sides well.
</P>
<P>
   On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into an 8 x 14-inch
rectangle.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the remaining melted butter onto the dough and use a brush
to butter the dough completely. Combine the sugar and cinnamon.
Sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar and orange zest evenly over the dough.
</P>
<P>
   Pour half of the syrup into the prepared pan. Pour the other
half of the syrup over the dough. Sprinkle half of the pecans over
the dough and the other half in the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at one long side, roll the dough to form a log. Cut the
roll into 6 equal pieces. Place pieces, cut-side down, in the
baking dish. Let stand for 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Bake the buns until they are evenly browned and seem firm in the
center, about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the baking pan upside-down onto a sheet pan. Let the buns
stand 1 minute. Remove baking pan.

EDITORS NOTE: Here's a plan for getting quick meals on the table in
a hurry. Now &AMP; Later is a recipe cooked on the weekend in batches _
enough to serve 12 _ and functions as dinner on the night it's
prepared; freeze the rest for two future meals. The 30-Minute

 WORKING COOK: Germany Inspires Meals of Sausage and Sauerkraut   By Tara Duggan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  With all the shopping and planning that
accompanied the holidays, it's hard to find the time to plan a meal
at home. Here are some recipes to help you through the post-holiday
letdown.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Sausage with Sauteed Apples is a surprisingly light meal
that satisfies cool-weather cravings for Germanic-style food. The
chicken apple sausage has less fat than pork varieties, and
sage-flavored sauteed apples and sauerkraut make great
accompaniments. If you just have to have potatoes with your
sausage, try boiled baby Yukon golds with a little butter and
parsley.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-Minute Main Dish is a pasta with roasted portobello
mushrooms dressed with walnut pesto. To focus on the nuts' flavor,
the walnuts are toasted before being ground. Parsley replaces the
traditional basil, and there is no garlic. Instead, slivers of
garlic are roasted with the mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe calls for only a half-bunch of parsley for four
servings. While you're making a mess of the food processor,
consider making twice as much pesto so you can have extra for
later. You can thin it out with more lemon juice and use it as a
sauce for fish, or put it on a pizza with sauteed shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   The Potato and Swiss Chard Gratin is adapted from a recipe in
``Bistro Cooking,'' by Patricia Wells (Workman Publishing Company,
1989). Gratins often are served as side dishes, but this one is a
meal in itself. Swiss chard provides an interesting flavor and
added nutritional value. The dish also makes a great vegetarian
option without the ham; just increase the amount of chard as noted.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe has a fair amount of cheese and butter, even for 12
servings. After all, this is French cooking. But feel free to
reduce the amount of cheese to your liking, as the gratin is quite
rich.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FAST &AMP; FRESH: dinner in about 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   SAUSAGES WITH SAUTEED APPLES
</P>
<P>
   If you're not a fan of sauerkraut, serve the sausages and apples
with boiled new potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   6 precooked chicken-apple sausages
</P>
<P>
   3 Fuji apples
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground sage
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons water
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons gin
</P>
<P>
   2 cups drained sauerkraut
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Add the sausages and
cook for 4 minutes, until heated through.
</P>
<P>
   While the sausages are cooking, peel, quarter, core and thinly
slice the apples.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-low
heat. Add the sage and saute until fragrant. Add the apple slices
and allow them to brown slightly. Season lightly with salt. Stir in
the water, cover and cook until tender, about 3 minutes, stirring
occasionally. Remove the apples from the skillet and set aside on a
warm plate.
</P>
<P>
   Add the gin to the skillet and increase heat to high to cook off
the alcohol, about 1 minute. Add the sauerkraut, stir to combine,
and cook until heated through.
</P>
<P>
   For each serving, arrange 11/2 sausages on a bed of sauteed
apples. Spoon the sauerkraut to one side.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

   1/2 bunch parsley
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup grated Parmesan + Parmesan for garnish
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Begin heating a large pot of salted
water for the pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Place the mushrooms gill-side up in a baking pan lined with foil
or parchment. Slip the garlic slivers into the gills. Drizzle with
the oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast until soft and
juicy, 10 to 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the pesto:  &LR; While the mushrooms are roasting, place the
walnuts in a baking pan and toast in the oven for 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Chop off and discard the thick parsley stems and roughly chop
the leaves and tender stems.
</P>
<P>
   Begin cooking the pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Place the walnuts in a food processor and process until finely
ground. Add the parsley and salt; pulse until the parsley is evenly
pureed. Add 1/4 cup Parmesan and the lemon juice; pulse to combine.
Then, with the motor running, slowly add the oil.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the mushrooms from the oven carefully so they do not lose
their juice, then squeeze them gently over a bowl. Slice the
mushrooms in half, then into 1/4-inch-wide strips.
</P>
<P>
   Add the mushrooms and mushroom juices to the penne. Stir in the
pesto.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with a grating of Parmesan.

   POTATO &AMP; SWISS CHARD GRATIN
</P>
<P>
   To make this dish without meat, increase the amount of chard to

cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   4 bunches green Swiss chard, washed

   6 cups grated Gruyere cheese
</P>
<P>
   Grated nutmeg to taste
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>

   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Coat 2 large casserole dishes with
2 tablespoons of the butter.
</P>
<P>
   Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
</P>
<P>
   Remove stems from the chard (may be used for another recipe).
Slice leaves into strips. Blanch in the boiling water for 5
minutes. Drain and let cool. Using your hands, squeeze the leaves
as dry as possible. Season with salt and pepper; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange one quarter of the potatoes in a layer in each
casserole. Place one quarter of the greens on top, then a quarter
of the ham and a quarter of the cheese. Season the top with a pinch
of nutmeg, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Repeat layering. Dot
the top with the remaining butter.

<P>
   Bake for 50 minutes, until golden. Let sit 10 minutes before
serving.

 COOK'S BOOKS: Intricate Details May Deter Some From
Keller's  Cookbook   By Lynne Bennett  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Feeding your soul through your eyes takes on
additional meaning when feasting on the sumptuous photography in
Thomas Keller's ``The French Laundry Cookbook.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you are an ambitious cook, you can also satisfy your palate
and achieve a sense of accomplishment by completing any of the
recipes in this book. It is, at the very least, a conversation
piece and a book that can easily grace any coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   The world-renowned French Laundry restaurant in Napa Valley has
been the creative ground for Keller since 1994. Much more than a
listing of ingredients and procedure, this book provides a
philosophy and perspective on food from one of the most respected
American-born chefs. Keller also explains the cooking techniques
and intricate details of his recipes that will make each one
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Besides engrossing explanations, stories and 200 color
photographs, 150 recipes are included that represent exactly what
is executed at the restaurant. Many of the recipes are
``sub-recipes'' _ several of which are often used to create a
single course presentation. And herein lies the question: Will you
take the time to make all the components so the course is as close
to the French Laundry as possible?
</P>
<P>
   One recipe, Keller's version of Caesar salad, requires five
components _ dressing, custards, croutlsamic glaze, and
Parmesan crisps. But none of the components by themselves are
technically difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are easier recipes in the book, but the
majority of dishes with outstanding presentations will take some
time. As the chef states, ``Cooking is not about convenience and it
is not about shortcuts. The recipes in this book are about wanting
to take the time to do something that I think is priceless.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle Food staff enjoyed the Parmigiano-Reggiano
Custards with Romaine Lettuce, Anchovy Dressing, and Parmesan
Crisps (his version of Caesar salad). The savory, silky custard
contrasted nicely with the garlicky dressing and crunch of a
Parmesan crisp that echoed the flavor of the custard. The recipe is
for 12 servings, but be aware that these are tasting-sized
portions. The approach mirrors the French Laundry dining
experience, which centers on many small, refined, intensely focused
courses.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Sea Bass With Sweet Parsnips, Spinach and
Saffron-Vanilla Sauce also was a hit. The recipe combines a lot of
flavors that marry well. The sweet smoothness of the parsnips and
intensely flavored butter sauce made from a mussel-stock reduction
set off the crispy skin and sweet flesh of the fish. However, it
was difficult locating the black sea bass (see sidebar on finding
fish). An effort to include some substitutions would have made this
recipe less troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   Other recipes in ``The French Laundry Cookbook'' also feature
hard-to-locate ingredients or ingredients that are more expensive
than the average household uses on a daily basis, such as lobster
and foie gras.
</P>
<P>
   But to recreate the special French Laundry experience at home,
it is well worth the effort.

 &UR; Where to Find Seafood &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Seafood continues to soar in popularity, but it is often
difficult to locate the exact type many recipes specify. Calls to a
dozen seafood retailers and markets with seafood departments in an
effort to locate black sea bass and red mullet for two recipes from
the ``The French Laundry Cookbook'' were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Then a friend suggested calling The Fresh Fish Company, a San
Francisco fish and seafood wholesaler. They had both fresh black
sea bass and red mullet available fresh. Tim Ports, owner and
manager, also suggested substitutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any true snapper _  &LR; not &LR;  rock cod, rockfish, or Chilean sea
bass _ would be a good substitute for black sea bass,'' Ports
explained. ``Small farm-raised striped bass would also work, but a
wild striped bass will be larger than the farm-raised if fillet
size is an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the more unusual red mullet, Ports recommends Tai
snapper (which confusingly is not a true snapper, either) or any
other pink or red bream.
</P>
<P>
   The Fresh Fish Company sells primarily to the Bay Area's finest
restaurants. However, if your local fish market doesn't have what
you are looking for, ask the manager to call the wholesaler. The
Fresh Fish Company will usually be able to send out what you need
and will occasionally sell retail to help people out, like an ``at
wit's end'' Chronicle recipe tester.

CAESAR SALAD WITH PARMIGIANO-REGGIANO CUSTARDS
</P>
<P>
   From ``The French Laundry Cookbook,'' by Thomas Keller.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 cups balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Anchovy Dressing
</P>
<P>
   11/2 tablespoons chopped garlic
</P>
<P>
   11/2 tablespoons chopped shallots
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 salt-packed anchovy fillets, deboned, soaked in milk to cover
for for 30 minutes, drained, and patted dry
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg yolk
</P>
<P>
   1 cup extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup canola oil
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   Custards
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   31/2 ounces Parmigiano-Reggiano, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs + 1 large egg yolk
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt, freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   To finish
</P>
<P>
   3 cups chiffonade of inner romaine lettuce leaves
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (from a moist piece of
cheese) for Parmesan Crisps
</P>
<P>
   12 croutons (from a baguette), about 1/4-inch thick
</P>
<P>
   Parmigiano-Reggiano shavings for garnish (made with a vegetable
peeler)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For the Balsamic Glaze:  &LR; Heat the vinegar in a heavy saucepan
over medium heat until steam rises from the liquid. Place the
saucepan over a heat diffuser and let the liquid reduce very slowly
(it shouldn't simmer) for 2 to 3 hours, until it has reduced and
thickened into a syrupy glaze. There should be approximately 1/2
cup of balsamic glaze. Keep the glaze in a squeeze bottle at room
temperature for garnishing plates; if the glaze is too thick, warm
the bottle in hot water to soften the glaze.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For the Dressing: &LR;  Puree the garlic, shallots, vinegar,
mustard, lemon juice, and anchovies in a blender until smooth.
Transfer to a mixer with a paddle attachment and beat in the egg
yolk. With the machine running, slowly drizzle in the oils. Season
with white pepper. Cover and refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 3 cups, which is more than you need for this recipe. Store
the extra in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For the Custards: &LR;  Place the cream, milk and
Parmigiano-Reggiano in a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Turn off
the heat, cover, and let the flavors infuse for 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk the eggs and yolk together in a medium bowl. Reheat the
cream mixture until it is hot. While whisking, gradually strain the
cream and milk onto the eggs to temper them. Season with salt and
white pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Ladle 2 tablespoons of the custard mixture into each of 12 1-to
2-ounce aluminum foil baking molds, timbale molds or other small
molds. Place the molds in a roasting pan and add hot water to come
about halfway up the sides of the molds. If you are using foil cups
and they float, place a baking sheet or pan over them to hold them
down. Cover the roasting pan with aluminum foil and bake for 30
minutes, or until the custards are just set; the edges should look
set, but the very centers may not be. Remove the molds from the
water bath and refrigerate the custards for at least 2 hours and up
to 2 days.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For the Parmesan Crisps: &LR;  Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Sprinkle
about Sprinkle about 2 teaspoons of the cheese in one corner of a
nonstick baking sheet. Use your fingers to spread cheese into a
2-inch circle (or diameter of the molds). Repeat with the remaining
cheese; you should have about 12 rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they are golden brown. Use a
small spatula to transfer them to paper towels. They will still be
soft when they are removed but will stiffen as they cool. Store
crisps in an airtight container for up to 2 days.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To Complete: &LR;  Toss the romaine with the grated
Parmigiano-Reggiano and just enough dressing to lightly coat the
lettuce. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Place a spoonful of dressing onto each plate. Run a small paring
knife around the edge of each custard, dip the molds briefly in hot
water, and unmold each custard onto a crouton. Center one crouton
in each pool of dressing. Lay a Parmesan crisp over each custard
and top with a stack of salad. Place shavings of cheese over the
romaine and garnish with a ring or small pool of Balsamic Glaze.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 12 appetizer servings.

 AT THE SOURCE: Marin Farmer Tends Sweet Winter Squash   By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 BOLINAS, Calif. _  One of the upbeat messages in that most upbeat
of musicals, ``Oklahoma!,'' is that the farmer and the cowman can
be friends.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Martinelli, a Marin rancher committed to sustainable
agriculture and organic farming, has a similarly optimistic message
about what many perceive as adversarial opposites. He thinks
traditional agricultural interests and environmentalists can be
friends, working together toward changes in land use that benefit
both interests.
</P>
<P>
   Martinelli's family has been farming just north of Bolinas since
the 1930s. He didn't plan to follow in his father's and
grandfather's footsteps, but rather studied English and history at
the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   The pull of the land, however, won out over academia. Not long
after graduation, Martinelli, now 36, was back in West Marin,
tilling the soil and preaching the creed of the new environmentally
sensitive farmer. He had a mentor of impeccable credentials: For
nine years, he worked for Warren Weber, whose Star Route Farm,
launched in the early '70s, was a trailblazer for a revitalized
organic movement.
</P>
<P>
   Martinelli, assisted by siblings and cousins, grows a variety of
cool-werops _ potatoes, beets, carrots, lettuces (``no
tomatoes or corn here,'' he jokes), garlic, chard, kale and winter
squash _ on his family's 20 acres.
</P>
<P>
   The squash are particularly dear to his heart. They thrive in
the smket where his land is located _ it's a little more
protected than most of the surrounding land and therefore just a
smidgen warmer. The squash are also what he calls ``a low-life
support crop'' _ from planting until harvest, they need little
care. They don't attract insects nor do they require much water.
</P>
<P>
   Butternut and delicata are the most popular varieties _
Martinelli says it's partly because of their sweetness and partly
because they are manageable in size. Both those qualities appeal to
his customers who come to the Martinelli booth at the Saturday
farmers' market at Pt. Reyes Station and the Wednesday market in
Fairfax. He also has a stand at Tomales Bay that's open Wednesdays
through Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   The large _ in some instances, humongous _ squash he grows are
generally headed for the kitchens of his restaurant clients, who
include Manka's in Inverness, Insalata's in San Anselmo, and Chez
Panisse and Cafe Rouge in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant chefs love to deal with these big boys _ kabocha,
turban and banana, and the giant, curved Tahitian squash that
resembles a butternut squash on growth hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Martinelli intends to plant more varieties in the future,
although he has already come at least half-circle. Historically,
the ranch, established in the 1870s, was first a dairy and apple
farm. His family started out raising beef cattle on the land, and
then he turned it into a vegetable farm.
</P>
<P>
   He now feels that mixed use _ cattle and vegetables _ is
probably the most ecologically sound, allowing for on-site
recycling of just about all the byproducts of farming.
</P>
<P>
   Martinelli's political fervor has not abated as his views have
evolved. He lobbies government to provide incentives to family
farms so a healthy farm belt can survive around towns and cities.
And he is dedicated to guiding consumers back to the once prevalent
belief that fresh food, lovingly grown in close proximity to its
markets, delivers optimal taste and nutrition.

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Soy Cheese Tries Hard but Isn't the Real Thing   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Soy is the buzzword for health in 2000, so expect
an array of soy-based products to hit grocery store shelves this
year.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cheesemakers have already gotten into the act, with refrigerator
cases full of soy-based cheeses aimed at vegans and
health-conscious diners alike.
</P>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted eight brands of soy mozzarellas. Most are
sold in large pieces; one brand is sold in individually-wrapped
slices. Prices range from $3.49 for an 11-ounce piece to $3.99 for
an eight-ounce piece.
</P>
<P>
   As far as flavor and texture, the panel preferred one brand by
far over the others. Many of them bear little resemblance to dairy
cheese and have dry, powdery textures.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lite &AMP; Less &LR;  (six-ounce packindividually wrapped slices,
$2.59 at Whole Foods) was the overwhelming favoriteists
agreed that it looks and tastes the most like dairy cheese. Two
tasters thought it would melt particularly well; another said he
would probably like it on a sandwich. Three would buy it; two
might.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; Soysation &LR;  (11 ounces, $3.49 at Rainbow
Grocery in San Francise panelist described the texture as
being ``close to mozzarella'' but others found it dry. Overall, the
panel thought the flavor was mild and bland but ``not as
offensive'' as some of the other cheeses. One would buy it; four
might buy it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Veggie Chunk &LR;  (nine ounces, $3.29 at Mollie Stone's) took third
place. Panelists found the product tasted overly salty, but one
believed it would probably work well in a casserole. Two said it
had only a faint cheese flavor. Three might buy it; two would not.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were divided on  &UR; Soy Kass &LR;  (12 ounces, $4.79-$5.59 at
many supermarkets). Three thought they could eat it if they were on
a nondairy diet, and one of them liked the firm texture and mild
cheese flavor. But the remaining two tasters thought it had a
gelatinous, spongy texture and chemical flavor. Three might buy it;
two would not.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth place went to  &UR; Nu Tofu &LR;  (eight ounces, $2.99 at Rainbow
Grocery). One panelist liked the texture, but described the finish
as ``slightly metallic.'' Others thought this cheese was rubbery
and had an unappealing sour flavor. One might buy it; four would
not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Tofu Rella, Wildwood and Soy Mage but they
ranked too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Donna Katzl,
chef-owner, Cafe For All Seasons, San Francisco; Roland Passot,
chef-owner of La Folie in San Francisco and left Bank in Larkspur
and Menlo Park; Kim Severson, Chronicle staff writer; and Kirk
Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati, San Francisco. All products are

EDITORS NOTE: Each week, wine editor Gerald Boyd discusses a
variety of wine topics. 
 WINE POTPOURRI: Lesser-Known Varietals Take Their Stand Among 
 Grapes  By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; The old adage, ``What goes around comes around,''
applies to just about everything in life, including wine. Take the
popular interest today in California wines made from Rhone and
Italian grape varieties. Even though, at times, it seems few wines
have escaped the Chardonnay-Cabernet onslaught, some lesser-known
varieties have survived while others disappeared.
<P>
   Mataro, a husky red grape fashionable about 40 years ago in
Southern California vineyards, eventually died from lack of
interest. A few years ago, a vintner group known as the Rhone
Rangers, discovered that Mataro was, in fact, Mourvedre, a red
variety commonly thought to be native to southern France. However,
recent research has shown that Mourvedre is likely from Spain,
where it is known as Monastrell.
</P>
<P>
   Winemakers in southern France use Mourvedre mostly as a blending
grape with Syrah and Grenache, but now varietal Mourvedres are
appearing from Provence and the Rhone Valley. In California,
Mourvedre is also enjoying modest success as a varietal wine,
while, to my knowledge, only Ridge Vineyards has made a Mataro.
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday, Mataro shared the spotlight with a few other red
grapes that have since fallen out of favor. Alicante Bouschet, an
inky-colored French variety used in blends, enjoyed moderate
popularity in California by those who liked their reds dense,
tannic and muscular.
</P>
<P>
   Charbono, thought to be related to the Italian Dolcetto, is
another red that can be thick as a brick. Little is grown today in
California, but Charbono once had its following and own promotional
group called The Charbono Society. The handful of members tried to
persuade wine drinkers to get behind Charbono, but it was a futile
effort. However, the society helped to pioneer the establishment of
industry groups that promote a single grape variety.
</P>
<P>
   Another curiosity is why so many Rhone varieties are thriving in
California while Italian varieties haven't generated much interest.
Vineyard acreancreasing in California for Rhone reds such as
Syrah, Mourvedre, Grenache and even a little Cinsault, but except
for Sangiovese and Barbera, plantings are scant for other Italian
red grapes, even the noble Nebbiolo.
</P>
<P>
   The Rhone white grapes Viognier, Marsanne and Rousanne are
attracting a lot of attention, although there are signs that
Viognier, an expensive and often boring white wine, has had its 15
minutes of fame. Still, the performance of Rhone whites in
California puts Italian white grapes, even Trebbiano, to shame.
</P>
<P>
   So, why do some varieties carry on, while others fade from the
market? The short answer is that American wine drinkers stay with
what they know best. Americans got used to the taste of wines made
from French grapes like Cabernet Sauvignon and an Italian
Sangiovese or Nebbiolo tastes different. Pluian wines don't
have the same reputation here _ at least on the popular level _ as
French wines have.
</P>
<P>
   I can only hope that the people who champion little-known wines
don't give up.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Any Other Name &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Petite Sirah is one of those varieties that has been around for
decades, but its origin has been a mystery. At first, Petite Sirah
was thought to be Durif, an obscure Rhone red wine grape. Then, it
wasn't. Now, recognizing recent research, the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, is allowing the Wine Institute to prepare a
petition recommending that Durif be made synonymous with Petite
Sirah. Glad we finally got that settled. Now, what's that you say
about the origin of Zinfandel?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wine Q &AMP; A &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ Troy Sells, via e-mail, wants to know the worth of two wines
in his collection: Grace Family Vineyard 1989 Cabernet Sauvignon
and Fonseca 1964 Guimaraens Vintage Port.
</P>
<P>
   The Grace Family wine is made in such small quantities and is in
such high demand that it rarely reaches commercial channels so
there isn't an established value. I suggest calling the winery at
(707) 963-0808; ask for Harriet.
</P>
<P>
   As for the 1964 vintage port, it was generally not a declared
vintage in the Port region and was rated ``good'' overall. However,
some were very good and your port might still be drinkable. One
caution: the Guimaraens (the winemaker's name) is the second wine
of Fonseca, so in theory, it may not be at the same level as the
regular Fonseca Vintage Port.
</P>
<P>
   Also via e-mail, Olivia Eielson complains of lack of coverage of
organic wines in Potpourri. However, I wrote about biodynamic
grapes and wine last fall (October 20, 1999), and plan to do more
on organic grape farming and wines this year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Y-Tokay &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Now that the 2000 scare is over, I can tell you my secret for
getting past the Y2K hubbub. I drank some of Clos Du Bois 1999
California Y-Tokay and it made me compliant. For nine bucks,
Y-Tokay is a sweet way to ease into the new century. Clos du Bois
made only a small amount of this fun wine, so if you want to be
wine compliant, check your local wine shop now.

 BAY AREA CLASSICS : Moss Beach Distillery Lives up to its Ghostly 
 Reputation   By Sean Forsha  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 MOSS BEACH, Calif. _  If you leave the Moss Beach Distillery
looking like you've seen a ghost _ well, you just may have.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Blue Lady, it's said, haunts the restaurant and bar perched
among the coastal cypress trees north of Half Moon Bay, the victim
of a notorious love affair from the restaurant's early high-rolling
days.
</P>
<P>
   Moss Beach Distillery is the current and most recent incarnation
of Frank's Roadhouse, opened as a Prohibition speakeasy in 1927.
Owner Frank Torres took advantage of the discreet coves and dense
fog of Moss Beach to ship in illegal Canadian whisky, much of which
made its way to the Roadhouse bar. He managed to avoid the
authorities and used his society connections to host legendary
parties. Being of Portuguese descent, his parties were often
Brazilian-style soirees, dancing girls and all.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bill Gillespie, the restaurant's marketing
consultant, Frank's became the getaway spot for the San Francisco
and Hollywood elite, one of whom was the socialite later known as
the Blue Lady. The parties at Frank's may be long over but the Blue
Lady refuses to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that the Blue Lady, a young married woman in the
midst of an adulterous and torrid love affair with Frank's piano
player, died in a car accident on her way to meet her lover. The
spirit of another of the piano player's lovers, who threw herself
off a cliff and drowned, also roams the premises, covered in
seaweed.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Lady appears now and then to guests and employees
alike, some claim. ``She's a friendly ghost, kind of a practical
joker,'' Gillespie says.
</P>
<P>
   Most reports have her pinching necks, tapping shoulders and
whispering names. Gillespie says the staff has become so
comfortable with her presence they don't even notice it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   However, there have been more dramatic instances. Current owner
John Barbour, a Blue Lady skeptic at first, began to accept a
ghostly presence when a recent day's sales receipts were computer
dated 1927, the year Frank's opened.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Moss Beach Distillery is much more than a sideshow for
ghost hunters. It has other historic renown. Infamous comedian
Fatty Arbuckle frequented Frank's, as did ``Maltese Falcon'' author
Dashiel Hammett _ who, Gillespie says may have used Frank's as the
setting for one of his stories.
</P>
<P>
   The Distillery was renovated three years ago, but the front
remains the same as the original Roadhouse. The two spacious dining
rooms have been dressed up to recall the earlier tenants, with
stained glass windows depicting the era's joyous revelers.
</P>
<P>
   The Distillery's menu ranges from seafood to steaks to pasta,
and includes a fixed-price Sunday champagne brunch. From every seat
in the house, diners can peer through large rounded windows at
panoramas of the rugged coastline and the boiling ocean below.
</P>
<P>
   A roomy patio is perfect for watching the packs of playful seals
and the occasional migrating humpback whale. Blankets are provided
when the fog rolls in. But you're on your own when the Blue Lady
drifts through.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Moss Beach Distillery, Beach Way and Ocean Boulevard, Moss &LR; 
 &LR; Beach; (650) 728-5595. Open Monday-Saturday, noon-8:30 p.m.; &LR;

way to cook many of our favorite foods. 
 BEST WAY: Home-Brewed Coffee   By Nicholas Bundy 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; From the popping and tumbling of whole beans in
the roaster to the enticing fragrance of the grounds as they brew,
coffee made at specialty cafes is hard to beat.
<P>
   But short of having a roaster in the garage, how can you brew
the best coffee at home? What's the best proportion of ground
coffee to water to get the best cup? And what's the best way to
store those beans before brewing?
</P>
<P>
   To find out, we used a Braun FlavorSelect drip coffeemaker
(suggested retail price, $80) with a gold-screen filter _ rated the
best coffeemaker in the November 1999 issue of Consumer Reports _
and Peet's Costa Rica coffee beans.
</P>
<P>
   Our first objective was to decide on the best ratio of coffee to
water for a balanced, full-flavored cup. Food Department staffers
tasted four cups, each brewed at a different strength. Peet's
recommends 2 level tablespoons of ground coffee for each 6 ounces
of water. We felt this might be strong, so we also tested 1/2
tablespoon, 1 tablespoon and 11/2 tablespoons to 6 ounces, as well
as the recommended 2 tablespoons.
</P>
<P>
   Peet's was right. Two tablespoons was the winner, yielding a
rich cup of coffee with no bitter aftertaste. A few tasters who
admittedly prefer weaker coffee enjoyed the 11/2-tablespoon cup.
</P>
<P>
   Once we got the best measurement, we moved on to the best way to
store the beans _ preground in the freezer, whole in the freezer
(both for a month), ground at room temperature and whole at room
temperature (both also for a month). We then compared them against
freshly purchased beans, both preground and whole. In each case, we
brewed the coffee with 2 tablespoons to 6 ounces of water.
</P>
<P>
   The results demonstrated the wide array of coffee-drinking
tastes. Those who felt the room-temperature grounds and beans had
lost their full-bodied flavor were opposed by tasters who felt the
freezer rendered the coffee stale or flat. Either way, the
consensus was that old coffee is bad coffee.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE BEST WAY
</P>
<P>
   The best way to ensure rich, fresh-tasting coffee is to buy
whole beans frequently and grind them just before brewing. Store a
week's worth of beans in an airtight container in a cool, dark
place. Brew the coffee in a ratio of 2 level tablespoons of ground
coffee to 6 ounces of cold water.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; AN ALTERNATIVE
</P>
<P>
   For the times you have to store coffee for more than about a
week, keep it in an airtight container either at room temperature
(away from light) or in the freezer _ but make sure the beans are
whole. Stored ground beans rated the lowest in our test.

 Simple and Soothing: Winter comfort at its coziest comes
from  easy, down-home fare   By Karola Saekel 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; All that vintage Champagne with osetra caviar, all
that seared foie gras with Sauternes, the truffled mashed potatoes
and the triple chocolate souffle _ enough already!
<P>
   That was last week, last year. This is now, January 2000, and we
are eager to put away the super-rich, spicy, exotic foods, along
with tuxes and the impossible high-heeled party shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Did anyone mention slippers and a cozy robe? Or well-washed,
soft sweats? We are ready for them _ and the foods that go along
with them. The term comfort food has become a cliche, but the fact
is that on these winter nights we crave dishes that are comfortistorative and often tinged with nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   We asked some Bay Area cookbook authors what might be simmering
on their stoves these long, dark nights. Many chose dishes that
include cheese, and many chose foods that were Italian in origin.
But above all, the authors waxed poetic about the joys of simple
foods that warm the soul as much as the body.
</P>
<P>
   For James McNair, who is working on his third book about pizza,
a hearty Italian soup embodies winter sustenance.
</P>
<P>
   abaccia &LR; , a thick bread/onion soup, ``has been one of my
favorite winter dishes ever since I first encountered it in
Florence, where it has been served since the Middle Ages,'' he
says. Like many soups, it tastes better when made a day ahead and
reheated.
</P>
<P>
   For Michele Anna Jordan, nothing beats polenta. She recalls
being in Portland eight years ago on her first book tour. The city
was blanketed in snow, but instead of snuggling in her bed at the
Heathman Hotel on an early morning, she was getting dressed for a
television appearance, and was amazed to find polenta with
Gorgonzola and olive oil on her room service menu. It arrived, she
says, ``all proper room service _ steaming hot under a silver
cover, and with a pot of Earl Grey by the side,'' and put her in a
comfortable frame of mind for the high-pressure hours ahead. To
this day, she says, ``This savory polenta dish is comforting; it
comes to the table _ or bed, depending on your inclination _ in a
halo of enticing aromas.''
</P>
<P>
   Cinnamon toast, Jordan's other prescription for comfort, harks
back to childhood. In her favorite version, toasted sourdough
French bread is slathered with salted butter and drenched in
cinnamon sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Childhood memories also propel vegetarian author/television
cooking show host Mollie Katzen's approach. ``When I was a child,
one of my favorite comfort foods was a dish my mother called
noodles and cheese,'' she recalls. ``Although it was just some
plain pasta mixed with cottage cheese and a little sour cream, it
had a magical, calming effect on me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make a slightly more adult version now, a little fancier,
but equally comforting. And it can be eaten in a bowl with a spoon
while you're wearing your pajamas, which is my definition of
comfort food.''
</P>
<P>
   What's even more comforting is the fact that this dish takes at
most 15 minutes to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Field, award-winning author on Italian culture and
cuisine, gravitates to an Italian rice dish for a comfortable and
gentle meal. It's not a risotto that requires long stirring and
undivided attention, but a simple preparation an Italian  &LR; nonna &LR; 
might fix for her grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Peninsula author Jeannette Ferrary puts potatoes high on her
list of foods that nourish the inner person when the world seems
like a cold place. The potato's potential as comfort food is so
great, it , too, can be served cold. As proof she offers a potato
salad of Yukon Gold and sweet potatoes with cheese that can be
eaten slightly warm or straight from the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   John Philip Carroll, who developed the recipes for many
Williams-Sonoma cookbooks as well as for ``California the
Beautiful,'' seeks cold-night comfort in a dish from his California
coastal heritage, a smothered chicken of delicious simplicity,
while Peggy Knickerbocker finds restorative power in a winter fruit
compote.
</P>
<P>
   She demurs that her recipe really isn't a recipe, just a
guideline, and practical, too, ``if people have a lot of those
Christmas gift boxes of pears around and all that dried fruit in a
basket.'' Combine them in a winter compote and store it in the
refrigerator for breakfast or a quick dessert.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can put almost anything in it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   What about that tinned fruit cake your boss gave you for the
12th Christmas in a row? Maybe _ but the result might be a little
discomforting.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MICHELE ANNA JORDAN'S SOFT POLENTA WITH WALNUTS
</P>
<P>
   Jordan says to be sure to use fresh polenta. Polenta that has
been stored at room temperature for a while can become rancid.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   6 cups water
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 cup coarse-grind polenta, such as Golden Pheasant or Guisto's
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces dry Monterey jack or Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste (optional)
</P>
<P>
   3 to 4 ounces Gorgonzola
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces walnut halves or pieces, lightly toasted
</P>
<P>
   Best-quality extra virgin olive oil (see Note)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Bring 3 cups of water to a rolling boil in a heavy pot; have the
remaining water simmering in another saucepan. Add the 2 teaspoons
of salt to the boiling water and stir rapidly with a whisk,
stirring in the same circular direction to create a vortex. Pour
the polenta into the vortex in a thin, steady stream, stirring
continuously to prevent lumps. Continue to stir after all the
polenta has been added; lower the heat so that the mixture simmers
slowly.
</P>
<P>
   When the polenta begins to thicken, trade the whisk for a
long-handled wooden spoon. Add 1 cup of the simmering water and
continue to stir until the grains of polenta are tender and the
mixture pulls away from the sides of the pot. Add more simmering
water as needed for the proper consistency; the polenta should be
soft and creamy but not soupy. (Most types of polenta will take 20
to 30 minutes, but a few types may take as long as 60 minutes.)
</P>
<P>
   Add the butter and the grated dry Monterey jack cheese and stir
thoroughly. If the polenta seems a little stiff, add 1/2 cup
boiling water and simmer 5 minutes more.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the polenta from the heat, add several turns of black
pepper, taste, and season with salt if necessary. Ladle into warm
soup bowls, top each portion with some of the Gorgonzola, drizzle
with olive oil, scatter walnuts on top, and serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 3 to 4.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note: &LR;  If availlable, use Olio Nuevo, the just-pressed olive
oil from the new harvest, in this case, December 1999. It is
robustly flavored and a little hot on the palate, ideal with the
creamy polenta. Otherwise, use any boldly flavored olive oil.

   Carabaccia means ``a combination of simple things.'' McNair
suggests using onions that look especially dry because they will
caramelize best.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>

   2 teaspoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 bottle (750 ml) dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   1 cup water
</P>
<P>
   3 cups homemade meat or chicken stock or canned reduced-sodium
broth
</P>
<P>
   1 cinnamon stick
</P>
<P>
   4 cups torn or cut stale Italian or French bread (about 5
ounces)
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (about 3
ounces)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Combine the oil and butter in a heavy stock pot and place over
medium heat until the butter is melted. Add the onions and toss
well to coat with the oil and butter. Cover, reduce the heat to
medium-low an stirring occasionally, until the onions just
begin to color, about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Uncover the onions, increase the heat to medium, sprinkle with
the sugar and a little salt and cook, stirring frequently, until
the onions are richly browned and caramelized, 20 minutes or
longer, depending upon the moisture content of the onions.
</P>
<P>
   Add the wine, water, stock or broth and cinnamon stick. Stir
well and bring to a boil. Cover tightly, reduce the heat and simmer
gently, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Add the bread to the simmering soup and continue cooking until
the bread disintegrates, 30 to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally to
prevent the soup from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Add water
as needed if the soup gets too thick.
</P>
<P>
   Discard the cinnamon stick. Using a wire whisk, whip the soup
until the bread is well incorporated. Season to taste with salt and
pepper. Ladle the hot soup into warmed bowls and sprinkle each
serving with a portion of the cheese.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early days of this millennium, the economy is expected to
pass a milestone: The current expansion will become the longest
span of uninterrupted growth in American history.
</P>
<P>
   If the economy sails into February, as it no doubt will, the
boom that began in March 1991 will be 107 months old, surpassing
what has been the longest period of growth on record, roughly 1961
through 1969, during the Vietnam War years.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back at the 1990s expansion, economists marvel at its
vigor and longevity. Some say that the nation's longest boom
started in 1982, with only a brief interruption for the Gulf War
recession of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, economists are fully confident about the coming
year. Barring unforeseen shocks, the economy's good fortune ected to continue through 2000, though many economists see
growth slowing to about 3.5 percent after three straight years of
expanding by at least 4 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fee optimistic. I think we're in excellent shape,''
said Janet Yellen, former chairwoman of President Clinton's Council
of Economic Advisers. ``One thing economists have figured out,''
she added, ``is that expansions don't die of old age.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe asked economists at the height of the
profession _ presidential advisers, Nobel laureates, and Wall
Street wizards _ to explain why the expansion has lasted so long
and whether it can possibly go on for much longer.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons they gave for this remarkable period of prosperity
ran the gamut, from traditional discussions of fiscal and monetary
policy to techno-speak about a New Economy for a new millennium.
All seemed to agree a good dose of luck was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Their answers also revealed a tug of war between old and new. Is
the traditional business cycle dead or merely dormant? Is inflation
a thing of the past or a sleeping lion that will awaken? Has the
United States entered a golden era of technology and globalization
or a dangerous period of out-of-control growth?
</P>
<P>
   Most economists fall back on a traditional explanation for the
expansion's longevity: The skillful guiding of monetary policy by
the Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
   During 13 years under chairman Alan Greenspan, the Fed averted
potential catastrophes by reducing interest rates, first in
response to the 1987 stock market crash and again in 1998 after the
near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, a New York
investment firm that bet billions on securities, using money lent
by major financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Solow, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1987,
said the Fewess goes beyond these widely publicized moves to
a more subtle skill: the exercise of restraint.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has at times taken Draconian steps to cool the economy
by driving up interest rates. Greenspan's predecessor, Paul
Volcker, broke the back of double-digit inflation with large
increases in interest rates, a move that triggered the deep 1981-82
recession.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fed under Greenspan has taken a more low-key approach,
said Solow, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts In
of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Fed's quarter-point rate increases last year _
three in all _ ``don't amount to very much.'' Fed members have, in
effect said, `` `Why don't we keep our eyes open and let it happen,
and if we get some inflation we'll act then.' '' Solow said.
``That's the way they've done it, and it has paid off handsomely.''
</P>
<P>
   Fears persist that the current spell of tame inflation _ prices
rose 2.6 percent last year _ has to end and that inflation will
heat up, forcing the Fed to raise rates much higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can conjure up a situation where inflation does start
creeping up, the Fed tightens up more than it has been, and the
economy falls into a mild recession,'' said Murray Weidenbaum, the
first chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the
Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   As long as inflation remains subdued, the expansion could, in
theory, continue for years, economists said. But myriad forces at
work in the economy threaten to end this long period of low
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, two factors which have contributed to low
inflation have run their course. Falling oil prices contained
inflation in the late stages of this expansion. So did weak Asian
currencies, which drove down the cost of US imports and forced
American companies to lower domestic prices to compete. In 1999,
both trends were reversed as oil prices rose substantially and
foreign currencies recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Wages are also a major component of inflation. With many
industries experiencing an acute shortage of workers and with
unemployment at a 30-year low of 4.1 percent nationwide, Greenspan
has warned repeatedly that a tight labor market may begin to push
up wages and, in turn, prices. But wages have not risen at the pace
many economists had expected.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery of why there is little wage-fueled inflation is at
the center of a debate about how long the Great Boom of the '90s
can go on.
</P>
<P>
   The radical view on Wall Street, taken by Edward Yardeni, a
prominent economist in the New York office of Germany's Deutsche
Bank Securities, is that the United States has entered a golden era
in which inflation is no longer a serious threat.
</P>
<P>
   In the Old Economy, business cycles reigned. Economic booms led
to inflation, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates
and causing a slowdown or recession. In Yardeni's New Economy,
inflation remains subdued, allowing growth to continue
uninterrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni's argument, boiled down, is that the nation is enjoyi fruits of a technological revolution in which corporations have
invested record amounts in new production processes, equipment, and
computers. Increased global competition has pushed companies to
make these investments, which doubled from 1991 to nearly $1.2
trillion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Investment has, in turn, had a tremendous influence on the
economy by driving up workers' output, lowering business' costs,
and bringing lasting improvements in inflation. When productivity
increases, businesses do not have to pay workers higher wages and
do not need to raise the selling prices of their goods.
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni said this New Economy emerged after the Cold War. War,
he said, creates ``trade barriers'' between enemies and hampers
trade between friendly countries. ``Peace creates business
opportunities. The resulting competition forces everybody to cut
their costs, to increase their productivity and to innovate.''
</P>
<P>
   Many academic economists scoff at the idea of a New Economy. But
there is growing consensus the nation is undergoing fundamental
shifts that economists do not yet fully understand.
</P>
<P>
   A recent spurt in the productivity of American workers hasa factor that has kept wages from accelerating, economists said.
Some argue that if productivity gains continue, wages _ and
inflation _ could remain in check.
</P>
<P>
   Yearly increases in productivity languished at about 1 percent
during the 1970s and 1980s. But in the past three years,
productivity gains have surged to about 2.5 percent. In the third
quarter last year, productivity rose at an astonishing 4.9 percent
annualized rate.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists are debating whether big productivity gains are
permanent, as New Economy converts maintain, or only temporary, as
they have been in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of unraveling the mysteries of productivity in
the current expansion is that productivity trends have not followed
historic patterns, said Ricardo Caballero, who joined MIT as an
economics professor in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, productivity rises during expansions _ but in this
expansion, the gains came later than usual. And as expansions
mature, productivity falls as employers are forced to hire less
skilled workers from a shrinking pool of labor. But in the late
stages of this expansion, ``We haven't seen declining
productivity,'' Caballero said.
</P>
<P>
   If they continue, productivity gains could continue to be a
powerful force holding inflation down, perhaps for years. ``There
is a lot of wishful thinking'' this might be the case, Caballero
said. ``It's an interesting hypothesis, but we just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   MIT's Solow also acknowledged the impact of technology on the
economy. ``It's possible that we're beginning to see the
productivity payoff from information technology. I am not ready to
jump to that conclusion yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all economists attribute the low inflation to more
productive workers. Traditionalists point to another long-term
trend in the labor force to explain why wages, and inflation, have
not accelerated: a decline of US workers' power.
</P>
<P>
   MIT's Paul Samuelson, a recipient of the Nobel Prize in 1970,
credited the current boom to Greenspan _ for ``opportunistic''
handling of monetary policy _ and to President Clinton _ for
``doing the right thing'' by resisting tax cuts that might have
overheated the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``biggest heroes'' in a 1990s expansion that has created
20 million new jobs ``have been the American workers,'' Samuelson
said.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, when unemployment is low, workers have more power to
demand pay increases, because employers know it is difficult to
replace them. But global competition has brought fundamental shifts
in labor-management relationships that undermined workers' power.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``good old days, the Fortune 500 corporations had, in my
judgment, a degree of oligopoly power they were forced to with the union movement,'' Samuelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, ``in any drawn out union-management battle, if labor wins
that means they're speeding up their own demise because the action
moves elsewhere,'' to another part of the United States or to
another country where costs are lower. ``It's a cowed labor
force,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Economists of all political persuasions seem to agree the
economy has undergone structural changes. But Republican and
Democratic economists sharply disagree about which policies
fostered this period of strong growth.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Lindsey, consultant to GOP presidential candidate
George W. Bush, dates the beginning of the current boom to 1982,
when Reagan-era reductions in capital gains and other taxes, as
well as deregulation, unleashed growth.

   Yellen said Clinton's administration encouraged greater
investment in technology by turning a $290 billion federal budget
deficit into a $100 billion-plus surplus. One theory holds that if
the government runs big deficits, heavy borrowing by the US
Treasury Department ``crowds out'' private investment.
</P>
<P>
   The improvement in the government's checkbook has freed the
private sector to borrow and invest, said Yellen, a professor at
the University of California at Berkeley. The investment produced a
payoff ``that was a long time in coming.''
</P>
<P>
   As the nation enters a new century and an election year, there
is special interest in whether the economy will run aground.

   ``The answer,'' Lindsey said, ``is `I don't know.' because we're
still flying at 37,000 feet.''

FROM RUSSIA _ WITH GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. _ When Shea Ralph was a sophomore at the
University of Connecticut two years ago, and freshman Svetlana
Abrosimova had just arrived from Russia, Ralph turned to her new
teammate and asked what time it was.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at her watch, and carefully translating the numbers,
Abrosimova answered, ``Two seven.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph still cracks up when she tells that story, and
acknowledges that she used to make fun of Abrosimova's English.
</P>
<P>
   But she never made fun of her playing. Not then, not now.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph, from Fayetteville, N.C., had never played against anyone
from Europe, let alone Russia, and she certainly couldn't imagine
anyone wanting to come to Connecticut from a place he
alphabet makes no sense to Americans and the culture is so
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I was surprised that someone would come that far to
play,'' said Ralph. ``I figured they must be pretty good and have
high ambition. And I was right; she was always out on the court,
practicing shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in St. Petersburg in 1980 _ when the city was known as
Leningrad _ Abrosimova lettered in basketball and swimming in high
school, an all-star team to the Russian Championship from 1994-96,
and was named Most Valuable Player of the European Championships in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian-born, American-based AAU coach spotted her and alerted
Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma, who sent assistant Chris Dailey to
see her play in a Junior World Championship game in 1997. Later
that summer, Abrosimova was on her way to Storrs.
</P>
<P>
   Abrosimova had been to the United States four years ago, when
her high school team played in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'd never been here, I didn't know exactly what was going
on,'' said Abrosimova, who had studied English in school but mostly
kept quiet out of shyness and fear of saying the wrong thing.
</P>
<P>
   And the American campus was the least of her confusion. She just
didn't get it when her teammates were buzzing about the game
against Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got here, everybody was talking about, `Oh, we play
Tennessee in a couple weeks!' and I'm, like, what's Tennessee all
about? I had no idea what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't know about the ``three Meeks'' (Chamique Holdsclaw,
Tamika Catchings, and Semeka Randall), she didn't know about coach
Pat Summitt's four national championships _ including the one the
year before Abrosimova arrived in the United States _ and she
certainly didn't know about the Lady Vols' relentless ``Rocky Top''
fight song.
</P>
<P>
   Now she knows. Her first two seasons, Abrosimova scored 14 and
11 points, respectively, as the Huskies lost twice to Tennessee,
which won a national championship in Abrosimova's freshman season
for a ``three-peat.''
</P>
<P>
   So Abrosimova will be out for revenge Saturday when the two
teams meet in Knoxville, Tenn. UConn is ranked No. 1 with a 10-0
record, while Tennessee (9-1) is No. 2. Neither team made it to the
Final Four last year.e ``Meeks'' are down to two _ Holdsclaw
graduted and now plays in the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Halting English and all, the 6-foot-2-inch Abrosimova made an
impact almost as soon as she joined the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   Her freshman year, she saw action in all 37 games, starting the
season as a reserve, then becoming a starter by midseason. She
finished as the team's second-leading scorer (behind senior Nykesha
Sales), averaging 14.5 points per game. She was also the team's
leading rebounder (6.4), and became UConn's all-time leading
freshman scorer with 538 points.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Abrosimova became the first sophomore in league
history to be named Big East Preseason Player of the Year and Big
East Player of the Year. She also became the first UConn sophomore
to reach 1,000 points.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any flaw to be found in Abrosimova's game, it was
in the number of turnovers she committed _ 158 as a freshman, and
132 last year.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that despite her hot shooting hand, Auriemma would
often yank his star from games and give her a dressing down on the
bench, one that would sometimes continue on to the postgame press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   A point in fact was last January's 116-71 blowout win over West
Virginia, when Abrosimova was the game's high scorer with 23 points
after going 0 for 2 from the field and sinking just one free throw
in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   And Auriemma let her have it.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the game, he was screaming at me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the coach was unapologetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if Svet's mad at me, you've got to be mad at
somebody to play this game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, he said, things have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Abrosimova is as intense as she ever was _ evidenced by the
broken nose she suffered in November when diving for a loose ball _
but had committed just 33 turnovers entering Tuesday night's game
against Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always had the intensity, and she always showed it,''
Auriemma said. ``What she didn't show was any intelligence as a
player, at crucial times. Intensity and intelligence are two
different things. I could be very intense and go head first. But
then when I get hit in the face by Joe Louis, that's not real
smart, is it?''
</P>
<P>
   Abrosimova is now the team's second-leading scorer, averaging 14
points per game, is leading in rebounds with a 7.6 average, and has
33 steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever coached anybody who can do as many
things as she can on a basketball court,'' said Auriemma, in his
15th season at UConn.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Abrosimova has not forsaken her Russian roots by any means, and
in the summer plays on the National Team that won a silver medal in
the World Championship in 1998. She competed in the European
championships last summer.
</P>
<P>
   It is, after all, where she learned to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   She'd practice shooting on a basket her mother, Ludmilla, had
put up in the hallway of their apartment building, and she'd watch
the once-a-week NBA game on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``But usually it was bedtime, like 12 or 1 a.m., so I used to
stay up late to watch it,'' Abrosimova said..
</P>
<P>
   Her mother would read books about the game, because she didn't
know much about basketball but had an idea that's where her
daughter was destined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really popular in Russia, and she told me mostly
about NBA players from the '60s and '70s,'' ova said.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents have never seen their daughter play at UConn, but
will travel to the United States next year to celebrate Senior Day
with her.
</P>
<P>
   And they'll no doubt see the sign that fans carry to games at
Gampel Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Written in Cyrillic, it epitomizes how the fans feel about their
international treasure. It reads: Cvetlana, mbl bce liudum bam.
Translated, it means: ``Svetlana, we all love you.''

MCCAIN PRESSED FCC IN CASE INVOLVING MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Days before Senator John McCain joined hands with Senator Bill
Bradley last month to decry the noxious influence of special
interest campaign donors, McCain pressured the Federal
Communications Commission to vote on an issue that cleared the way
for a major contributor to his presidential campaign to buy a
Pittsburgh television station.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, in his bluntly worded Dec. 10 letter to the FCC, did not
urge a vote favoring the contributor, Paxson Communications. But he
acted at the request of the company's lobbyist, during a period
when he used Paxson's corporate jet four times to travel to
campaign events _ where he almost always attacks monied special
interests.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's intervention in the case drew a speedy, scolding
response from William E. Kennard, the FCC chairman, who deemed the
Senator's letter ``highly unusual'' and suggested it was
inappropriate. The House Commerce Committee, which McCain heads,
oversees the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   Angela J. Campbell, the attorney who represents opponents of the
sale to Paxson, went much further, asserting in an interview
Tuesday that McCain's action was improper, unethical, violated FCC
rules barring such contacts on pending FCC matters, and appeared
designed to assist a major contributor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator McCain said, `Do it by December 15 or explain why,'
and the commission jumped to it and did it that very day. The
senator's intent was for the FCC to grant the'' transfer of the TV
license, said Campbell, a Georgetown University law professor.
McCain's intercession, she added, ``may well have tipped the
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the senator, noting that McCain often sees the
FCC deliberative process as molasses-like, said there was no
connection between Paxson's political support for McCain _ $20,000
in two concentrated doses from Paxson and its law firm _ and his
intercession with the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's close ties to Paxson were abundantly clear on the
key dates surrounding the FCC decision. The day before he sent the
Dec. 10 letter, McCain used Paxson's jet for a trip from New York
to Florida. The day after the letter, he took the company jet from
Florida to Washington. The campaign reimbursed the company at
first-class airfare rates _ well below the actual cost of the
charters.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe was told about McCain's intercession on the Paxson
case in the course of preparing an article about a stinging rebuke
McCain sent to Kennard of the FCC last May 12, accusing the FCC of
bias toward SBC Communications and Ameritech, two regional Bell
operating companies that were seeking to merge.
</P>
<P>
   The night before McCain sent that letter, SBC's Washington
lobbyist held a fund-raising dinner for McCain that raised close to
$20,000 for his campaign. On March 30, Ameritech's chairman
cohosted another fund-raiser at which McCain raised $88,000. In
addition, the two companies also funneled $10,000 to McCain's
campaign from their political action committee. McCain was
unavailable for comment on the Paxson issue. But in an interview
last week about the SBC/Ameritech merger, McCain said he took no
action because of the donations. ``Never, under any circumstance,
was there ever a quid pro quo,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking generally, however, McCain said, ``People give money to
buy access. We're all tainted by this system.'' From time to time,
he said, he has agreed to meet with major donors. ``They have
access, and therefore they hluence. It corrupts the system.
And I'm a victim of it too,'' said McCain, who was ensnared but
later cleared in the so-called Keating Five scandal nearly a decade
ago. He was one of five senators who interceded with federal
banking regulators on behalf of Charles Keating, whose name became
synonymous with the savings and loan scandal that cost taxpayers
billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   To cleanse the system, McCain advocates a ban on so-called soft
money, unlimited donations that can be made to the political
parties for party-building activities but that are often funneled
to campaigns. The senator is opposed to any limit on so-called hard
money, the $1,000-and-under individual contributions that are often
``bundled.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a paradox that underlies McCain's quest for the
presidency: As he savages special interests from almost every
podium, those interests, ever pragmatic, have lavished attention
and donations on the powerful chairman of a committee that has vast
reach over the rapidly evolving and often regulated commercial
marketplace. If anything, many of the special interests are
underwriting McCain's campaign for president _ and his rhetorical
war against them.
</P>
<P>
   But for campaign audiences who come away believing McCain has
constructed a wall to keep influential donors at bay, the Paxson
and Baby Bell incidents suggest that McCain remains vulnerable to
special interests he says have corrupted Washington.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's insistent urging that the FCC vote on the Pittsburgh
issue had the effect _ if not the intent _ of benefiting Paxson, a
West Palm Beach, Fla., network of 73 family-oriented stations and
the nation's largest owner of independent television stations.
Through the end of September, Paxson's top officers and their
family members _ and even the personal assistant to the wife of the
company's founder, Lowell W. Paxson _ contributed $12,000 to
McCain. In 1998, Paxson officials gave $9,000 to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   And in July, as Paxson lobbyists were asking members of Congress
to exert pressure on the FCC, 13 members of Paxson's law firm, Dow,
Lohnes &AMP; Albertson, contributed more than $8,000 to McCain on a
single day, according to campaign finance records.
</P>
<P>
   B. Dwight Perry, the law firm's managing partner, said Tuesday
that the firm's same-day donations had nothing to do with its work
for Paxson, though he refused to say how or why the contributions
were made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to tell you why,'' Perry said. ``People made
them because they wanted to contribute to John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We often make contributions to officials who are sympathetic
to us,'' Perry said. Such a practice, he added, ``is not uncommon,
for God's sake.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Udell, a Paxson spokeswoman, also said that contributions
by company officials and their family members were unrelated to the
Pittsburgh issue.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Dan Schnur, the campaign's communications director,
said Tuesday that there was no connection between the donations and
McCain's two letters seeking an FCC vote on the Pittsburgh issue.
Schnur acknowledged that Paxson's lobbyists asked McCain aides for
a letter supporting the sale, but that McCain only asked the FCC
take a vote. Several other members of Congress, most from
Pennsylvania, wrote the FCC urging approval of the transaction. But
as far as the FCC is concerned, McCain is the most influential
member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime between McCain's first letter on Nov. 17 and his more
insistent letter on Dec. 10, Paxson made its four-engine jet
available to ferry McCain and his entourage from New Hampshire to
Washington on Dec. 3, a day after McCain declared in a New
Hampshire appearance: ``It is very clear to all the lobbyists and
the special influence people that run Washington now that if John
McCain is president of the United States, things are going to be a
lot different.''
</P>
<P>
   Schnur said the campaign followed federal rules on each of the
four occasions Paxson's jet was used, reimbursing the company for
first-class airfare for everyone aboard.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is among many federal officeholders who fly on corporate
jets for a fraction of the actual cost, a legally permissible
perquisite that is widely viewed as a backdoor way for corporations
to help politicians they favor.
</P>
<P>
   For example, first-class airfare from Manchester to Washington
is $406 one-way. Though Schnur did not have the reimbursement
figures available, the fare suggests that McCain's Dec. 3 entourage
of 10 would have paid Paxson about $4,000 for the flight. To
charter a jet of that size would have cost close to $10,000,
according to estimates by charter experts.

 &HT;    
 By STEPHEN L. COHEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The advertising message in a national magazine was enticing to
millions of women suffering the ravages of cellulite: take
Cellasene, ``a safe, natural, clinically-studied herbal
supplement'' and watch the cellulite melt away.
 &HT;    The ad promised women that they would ``look terrific'' -- with
healthier, smoother, firmer legs -- and went on to cite the
extensive media coverage of the product, as if the coverage itself
lent credibility to the claims.
 &HT;    ``You've seen it on Dateline, the Today Show and CNBC,'' the ad
proclaimed, boldly enlisting a sizable portion of the NBC
television network in its campaign.
 &HT;    It was an audacious marketing strategy, and the aggressive
tactics apparently worked. In Australia, desperate shoppers
practically rioted in order to get their hands on the product. In
Canada, the Cellasene distributor was quickly swamped with requests
for the herbal remedy. And when it arrived in the United States in
March, women lined up to join the frenzy. In a matter of months,
the product has generated U.S. sales of more than $5 million.
 &HT;    But is Cellasene really the miracle cure women having been
seeking for decades? Critics in the medical community have strongly
attacked the herbal supplement, pointing out that no published
research supports the extraordinary claims of the product
manufacturer. Though the ad campaign urges consumers to ``accept
only the clinically-researched formula'' of Cellasene, the research
has little credibility in scientific circles because it consists of
just three small studies -- none of which were published in a
peer-reviewed journal, or anywhere else for that matter.
 &HT;    The small size of the studies, which only examined 75 patients,
raises further questions regarding the product's efficacy. Medestea
Internazionale, the Italian manufacturer of Cellasene, claims that
it works by increasing the blood supply to the dimpled skin of the
thighs and buttocks seen with cellulite. But according to the
Laboratory of Human Behavior and Metabolism at Rockefeller
University, which has studied cellulite physiology, ``there is no
evidence of any primary role for blood flow'' in the development of
the condition.
 &HT;    Safety concerns have arisen as well. Cellasene, for example,
contains more than four times the U.S. Recommended Dietary
Allowance of iodine, a potent stimulant of the thyroid gland.
Excessive thyroid activity has been associated with multiple
complications, including tremors, weight loss, insomnia and
menstrual irregularity.
 &HT;    Despite the unproven benefits and potential for harm, Medestea
has successfully attracted many customers with the promise of a
cure for cellulite. The company claims that about 90 percent of
patients taking the product had reduced cellulite after eight
weeks. Of course, given the small sample of patients studie
represents only 54 people. But for women who have tried everything
to rid themselves of the unsightly lumps and bumps of cellulite,
Cellasene is like the Holy Grail.
 &HT;    For medical critics of the product, that is precisely the
problem: if herbal manufacturers are able to make dramatic,
unsubstantiated claims with impunity, they have enormous power to
generate consumer demand for their products -- without having to
worry about mundane details like safety or efficacy.
 &HT;    Rexall Sundown, the U.S. distributor of Cellasene, has already
been accused of impropriety regarding another product called Osteo
Bi-Flex. In June, the company agreed to alter the marketing of the
product after the Arthritis Foundation complained that it was
engaged in deceptive advertising. The foundation charged that the
ads misled consumers by creating the impression that it had
endorsed the unproven dietary supplement.
 &HT;    The problem of deceptive advertising may only get worse as the
use of herbal remedies grows in America. According to the
University of Washington Health Sciences Center, more than a third
of the population now relies on herbs to treat everything from
depression to migraines to AIDS. In 1997, the American Botanical
Council estimates that Americans spent about $4 billion on herbal
medicines.
 &HT;    Much of the growth of herbal medicine -- and herbal marketing --
can be traced to the passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and
Education Act in 1994. In passing this legislation, Congress paved
the way for herbal companies to peddle their products with little
oversight, and without any need to substantiate their claims,
however outlandish. Though companies are supposed to have data on
hand to support their claims, they do not need government approval
before marketing a product.
 &HT;    This has led to a curious paradox, in which many food
ingredients are closely regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, but food supplements -- like herbal remedies,
botanical extracts and amino acids -- are not. Unlike other new
food ingredients, for example, dietary supplements are no longer
subject to safety evaluations before being marketed.
 &HT;    Besides freeing manufacturers from any obligation to document
the safety or efficacy of their products, the 1994 legislation also
freed them from any responsibility to report adverse effects. This
has meant that no system exists to track potentially
life-threatening side effects of herbal medicines.
 &HT;    According to a recent report in the Archives of Family Medicine,
this could have serious ramifications. The report cites numerous
commonly-used herbs with potential toxic effects, including
Belladonna (which can cause respiratory depression) and Pokeroot
(which may be fatal in children).
 &HT;    It also notes that 25 percent of traditional drugs -- which are
regulated by the FDA -- have botanical origins, such as aspirin
from willow bark and tamoxifen from the Pacific yew tree. This
blurs the line between herbs and traditional drugs, further
weakening the case for making a legislative distinction between the
two kinds of remedies.
 &HT;    For now, the dietary supplement legislation leaves American
consumers subject to potentially misleading claims, worthless
remedies or dangerous adverse effects. The growing use of herbs has
significant economic implications as well. In the absence of
controlled clinical trials, herbal remedies may be usurping
billions of dollars that could be put to much better use in other
ways.

evidence of any primary role for blood flow'' in the development of
the condition.
 &HT;    Safety concerns have arisen as well. Cellasene, for example,
contains more than four times the U.S. Recommended Dietary
Allowance of iodine, a potent stimulant of the thyroid gland.
Excessive thyroid activity has been associated with multiple
complications, including tremors, weight loss, insomnia and
menstrual irregularity.
 &HT;    Despite the unproven benefits and potential for harm, Medestea
has successfully attracted many customers with the promise of a
cure for cellulite. The company claims that about 90 percent of
patients taking the product had reduced cellulite after eight
weeks. Of course, given the small sample of patients studied, that
represents only 54 people. But for women who have tried everything
to rid themselves of the unsightly lumps and bumps of cellulite,
Cellasene is like the Holy Grail.
 &HT;    For medical critics of the product, that is precisely the
problem: if herbal manufacturers are able to make dramatic,
unsubstantiated claims with impunity, they have enormous power to
generate consumer demand for their products -- without having to
worry about mundane details like safety or efficacy.
 &HT;    Rexall Sundown, the U.S. distributor of Cellasene, has already
been accused of impropriety regarding another product called Osteo
Bi-Flex. In June, the company agreed to alter the marketing of the
product after the Arthritis Foundation complained that it was
engaged in deceptive advertising. The foundation charged that the
ads misled consumers by creating the impression that it had
endorsed the unproven dietary supplement.
 &HT;    The problem of deceptive advertising may only get worse as the
use of herbal remedies grows in America. According to the
University of Washington Health Sciences Center, more than a third
of the population now relies on herbs to treat everything from
depression to migraines to AIDS. In 1997, the American Botanical
Council estimates that Americans spent about $4 billion on herbal
medicines.
 &HT;    Much of the growth of herbal medicine -- and herbal marketing --
can be traced to the passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and
Education Act in 1994. In passing this legislation, Congress paved
the way for herbal companies to peddle their products with little
oversight, and without any need to substantiate their claims,
however outlandish. Though companies are supposed to have data on
hand to support their claims, they do not need government approval
before marketing a product.
 &HT;    This has led to a curious paradox, in which many food
ingredients are closely regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, but food supplements -- like herbal remedies,
botanical extracts and amino acids -- are not. Unlike other new
food ingredients, for example, dietary supplements are no longer
subject to safety evaluations before being marketed.
 &HT;    Besides freeing manufacturers from any obligation to document
the safety or efficacy of their products, the 1994 legislation also
freed them from any responsibility to report adverse effects. This
has meant that no system exists to track potentially
life-threatening side effects of herbal medicines.
 &HT;    According to a recent report in the Archives of Family Medicine,
this could have serious ramifications. The report cites numerous
commonly-used herbs with potential toxic effects, including
Belladonna (which can cause respiratory depression) and Pokeroot
(which may be fatal in children).
 &HT;    It also notes that 25 percent of traditional drugs -- which are
regulated by the FDA -- have botanical origins, such as aspirin
from willow bark and tamoxifen from the Pacific yew tree. This
blurs the line between herbs and traditional drugs, further
weakening the case for making a legislative distinction between the
two kinds of remedies.
 &HT;    For now, the dietary supplement legislation leaves American
consumers subject to potentially misleading claims, worthless
remedies or dangerous adverse effects. The growing use of herbs has
significant economic implications as well. In the absence of
controlled clinical trials, herbal remedies may be usurping
billions of dollars that could be put to much better use in other
ways.

RIGHT LOSES MIGHT IN THIS GOP RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In this, the 36th contest for the Republican
Party's presidential nomination, one historic trend is clear.
Antigovernment zealots are losing control of the GOP because of the
common determination of George W. Bush and John McCain. Both
candidates are inclusive, committed to winning, and not easily
bullied by the mullahs of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   This year, roles are reversed in the party's oldest and angriest
feud over regional rivalries and class warfare. Since 1912,
self-made men from small towns beyond the Alleghenies, calling
themselves ``true conservatives,'' have reviled high-born
patriarchs of ``The Eastern Establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   In this city's Cow Palace in 1964, Barry Goldwater of Arizona
won the nomination, defeating Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller of New
York and William Warren Scranton of Pennsylvania, avenging the
right. (Goldwater was born into a department store fortune himself,
but in this argument, geography trumps trust funds.)
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, the radical right has a new hero. Like Richard Nixon
and Ronald Reagan, he's from a small town, but it's a rich New
Jersey suburb. Malcolm Steven Forbes Jr. inherited a publishing
fortune, but is finding it harder to inherit the Goldwater-Reagan
mantle.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has been endorsed by Lyn Nofziger, Bruce Herschenson,
Paul Weyrich, and Richard Viguerie, all active during the rise of
the right in the 1970s. ``The difference between George W. Bush and
Steve Forbes is the difference between an Elvis impersonator and
the real Elvis,'' Viguerie said.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush, the former president, once used a Texas epithet to
describe Viguerie: ``All hat and no cattle.'' This has been more
evident since the no-compromise right decided to scorn elective
politics. Its heroes are exemplars of preemptive term limits.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the Republican field has never been elected to public
office. Forbes, Gary Bauer, and Alan Keyes are serenely innocent of
record or resume. Their kamikaze flight plan has few historical
precedents. Goldwater served on the Phoenix City Council before
going to the US Senate. Reagan was twice elected governor of
California.
</P>
<P>
   In 1912, when the more liberal Theodore Roosevelt of New York
quarreled with William Howard Taft and abandoned the GOP, Taft's
fellow conservatives sought revenge. In 1948, Taft's son, Robert,
lost the nomination to Thomas E. Dewey. In 1952, a Taft delegate,
Everett Dirksen of Pekin, Ill., pointed at Dewey, saying ``We
followed you before, Tom, and you took us down the path to
defeat.'' But Dewey's candidate, Dwight Eisenhower, won.
</P>
<P>
   From the Cow Palace in 1964 to the high school stage of Nashua,
N.H., in 1980, the wait was long. But Gerry Carmen, who called
George Bush ``a bluestocking Republican,'' trapped Bush into a
debate with Reagan. A Manchester tire merchant, Carmen mobilized
the self-made men of the Merrimack Valley to aid Reagan's triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Resentment bubbled and boiled into the Reagan era. In 1984,
Elliot Lee Richardson, twice elected to statewide office and the
only man in history to hold four Cabinet posts, ran for the
Republican nomination for US senator from Massachusetts. He lost by
almost 25 points to Ray Shamie, a self-made millionaire who had
never held public office.
</P>
<P>
   Both men died last year and Senator John F. Kerry, who defeated
Shamie by 10 points, called him ``a thoroughly decent and honest
person.'' He was, but so was Richardson, who died one day before
2000, a year that may vindicate public service as an honored
tradition in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan, in many speeches, said, ``Government is the
problem.'' George W. Bush's standard speech says ``Government
should do a few things and do them well.'' That is a major
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan can take credit for the prosperity of the 1980s and
1990s, which has washed away the anger that fueled right-wing
resentment. Why fret about old money, when new money, even
self-made trust funds, can be made?

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    As we head uncertainly into the new millennium, some momentous
changes are afoot in the field of behavioral research. They are
revolutionizing our conception of ourselves as the smartest species
on the planet.
 &HT;    It's not that we've suddenly been dethroned as king of the
cerebral hill, but rather that we've gained a better understanding
of ourselves as thoughtful, sentient beings.
 &HT;    Over the past decade, neuroscientists have gained extraordinary
new insight into human behavior, using new technologies to probe
deeper into the most mysterious black box of all -- the source of
all personal consciousness -- the human brain.
 &HT;    Like explorers in search of a strange new world, researchers are
combing the depths of what may be the final frontier of scientific
discovery: the human mind. And they are revealing secrets that have
aroused our curiosity since the dawn of man.
 &HT;    These new discoveries could have significant implications for
the human species, in that they offer us the potential to affect
not only our destiny but also our very nature as a species. If we
are someday able to alter the way the mind works -- the way we
think -- it could lead to unprecedented changes in how we define
ourselves as human beings, and unprecedented ethical choices for
society.
 &HT;    Such choices could force us to make some harrowing decisions.
Who, for example, should be subject to behavioral modification if
we have the power to mold human behavior? Could people be modified
against their will? What kinds of behavior would be considered
``normal''? And who will govern this process?
 &HT;    Just 20 years ago, such quandaries would have been unthinkable.
Indeed, for most of the 20th century -- a time of unparalleled
scientific achievement -- the brain has remained as impenetrable as
ever. So like our ancestors through the ages, we have continued to
wonder about what it means to be human: to think, to observe, to
feel.
 &HT;    What makes us so exquisitely sensitive to the touch of a loved
one, or so enraptured at the prospect of a new birth? How can we be
so loyal to our closest friends, yet so indifferent to the
suffering of strangers in far-off places? Just what is it that
makes a human being tick?
 &HT;    Of course, there's no simple answer, but new scientific
breakthroughs have reinforced the notion of a biological model of
human behavior. For the first time, we've been able to correlate
specific types of behavior with specific parts of the brain,
linking those regions with readily identifiable thought processes.
On the basis of these early findings, it appears that physical
pathways in the brain may dictate much, if not all, of human
behavior.
 &HT;    It's an intuitively appealing theory, and it's consistent with
recent research. For example, a 1997 Harvard study has shown a
positive correlation between regional blood flow to certain parts
of the brain and the level of anxiety experienced by various
individuals.
 &HT;    Using positron emission tomography (PET) to provide images of
brain activity, researchers provoked anxiety symptomsgroup of
patients suffering from conditions like posttraumatic stress
disorder and then watched for increased neural activity in specific
locations. They found that increased activity in specific regions
of the brain correlated not only with the presence of anxiety but
also with the degree of anxiety reported by individuals in the
study.
 &HT;    In another PET study at the University of Texas, scientists
provoked emotions of sadness in healthy volunteers and then looked
for changes in regional blood flow that would indicate shifts in
brain metabolism. They found increased metabolism in the ``limbic''
region of the brain and decreased metabolism in the ``neocortical''
region.
 &HT;    Intriguingly, when they looked at another group of patients who
were recovering from chronic depression, the reverse pattern --
involving the same regions -- was seen: the neocortical region
increased its metabolism while the limbic area had diminished
activity. Reciprocal changes in mood were thus accompanied by
parallel changes in brain metabolism.
 &HT;    Correlations between brain activity and overt behaviors have
also been shown in patients undergoing neurosurgery. A 1999 report
in the Journal of Neurosurgery recounted how a group of patients
experienced notable cognitive, mood and personality changes
following surgery for Parkinson's disease. Postoperatively, one
individual actually lost his aggressiveness and drive -- traits
that had previously defined his relationships with family and
business associates.
 &HT;    All these findings support the notion that human behavior is
ultimately the product of physical processes in the brain. If this
is true, it has enormous implications for mankind in the next
millennium. Imagine a world in which doctors are able to manipulate
human behavior the way we manipulate broken bones today.
 &HT;    The possibilities are enthralling. And chilling. Physicians
might perform surgical procedures on prisoners to reduce aggression
or violent tendencies. Exasperated parents might ask for a cerebral
transplant to cure their hyperactive child. And surgical implants
might alter everything from native intelligence to sexual
orientation.
 &HT;    More insidious interventions might arise as well. Psychiatric
patients might suffer from treatments that remove parts of their
individuality as well as their affliction. Government leaders might
use behavioral modification to pacify a restless populace, or to
subdue political opponents. Political prisoners might be subjected
to a new kind of abuse: the alteration of their personalities,
rather than their bodies, beyond recognition.
 &HT;    It's not as farfetched as it seems. In fact, we already
manipulate human behavior today: antidepressants, for instance,
elevate patients' moods to the point where they can make it through
the day without contemplating suicide. Compulsive behaviors like
hand-washing can be substantially reduced with the help of drugs
that affect serotonin levels in the brain.
 &HT;    It's only a matter of time before this type of intervention
becomes more sophisticated, and potentially more dangerous. While
behavioral interventions have the potential to alleviate much
suffering, such awesome power cannot be taken lightly.
 &HT;    What ethical choices will we make when we have the ability to
profoundly alter not only the heart but also the soul of man? How
far will we go in altering the ``natural'' tendencies of human
beings? What impact will this eventually have on the evolution of
our species?
 &HT;    These questions will have to be addressed in the future, when
partial (or total) brain replacement becomes as routine as hip
replacement today. As with all revolutionary scientific advances,
we will need to exercise great care before redefining human nature.
After all, we've come a long way in two million years, and in many
ways our nature remains as inscrutable as ever.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pete Hamill is one of those grand crusty
newspapermen, the cursing, smoking, (formerly) hard-drinking kind
of guy who was known to pal around with Sinatra, date Jackie O.,
and churn out the sharpest columns about politics and the most
wistful essays on the New York of old.
</P>
<P>
   So when you run across a coffee-table book that he's written
about Diego Rivera, the great Mexican painter and muralist, you
might assume it's another case of a bigtime journalist on a
busman's holiday, like George Will waxing on about baseball or Tom
Brokaw misting over the WWII generation.
</P>
<P>
   But you shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   It is not well known, except to those who read ``A Drinking
Life,'' his moving memoir of a few years back, but Hamill once
aspired to be a painter. He went to Mexico in 1956, on the GI Bill,
to study art. And he has kept going back there, off and on, often
for months at a time, ever since.
</P>
<P>
   His first trip, when he was 21, set Hamill on his course in
life. ``I went to Mexico,'' he recalls, ``because of its painters _
Orozco, Siqueiros _ but when I saw their art up close, it
intimidated me. I said, `How am I ever going to do this?' So I
began to work more on the writing part of whatever talent I had. I
wrote the first pieces I ever got paid for down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera's work, as it happens, didn't impress him at the time.
``I thought his murals were unreal,'' he says, ``almost like
political cartoons.''
</P>
<P>
   Not until 1986, at a huge exhibition mounted in Mexico City to
celebrate the 100th anniversary of Rivera's birth, did Hamill, by
then past 50, get the magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't read Henry James when you're 21, and I think the
same goes for Rivera,'' reflects Hamill, who's now 64. ``Diego was
painting not Mexico as it was but Mexico as he wanted it to be. He
was trying to create a national consciousness in a country that
didn't have one.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was interesting at the time of that exhibition,'' he goes
on, ``was you could look at an artist whose two engines were dead.
What drove Diego were Bolshevik idealism _ the Russian revolution _
and the Mexican revolution. By 1986, both were dead; the one ended
up with mounds of corpses, the other with mounds of corruption. So
you could look at the works in a different light, for their sense
of regret, their passion for all these things he wanted for the
future that didn't happen _ and, even more, for their formal
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm for, above all, art,'' Hamill states. ``I think art is
more important than politics. Politicians come and go; the art's
there forever, if it's any good. I don't think of myself as a great
writer or a great artist. I just think it's such a privilege to be
able to embrace great art, to engage it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason Hamill wrote the book _ titled, plainly, ``Diego
Rivera'' and handsomely published by Harry N. Abrams Inc. _ was to
sort through his own age-old affair with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico has had this almost central position in my imagination
since I was 21, but I'd never really written about it,'' he says.
``I thought this was a way I could deal with that, with some of the
gifts Mexico has given me.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important of these gifts, he says, was the lesson of
``how to see clearly from the margin _ which is what the Irish did
with the English in creating all that great literature, what the
great Latin American novelists do with the US. Mexico gave me that
sort of perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   If that was his main lesson, it must have only helped him
articulate a view of life that was driven into him from his first
breath.
</P>
<P>
   Hamill was born in 1935 to Irish-immigrant parents, in a
working-class section of Brooklyn, dominated at the time by
factories, dockyards, and a main street _ 7th Avenue _ where bars
dotted every corner and the urbanity of Manhattan seemed much more
than a bridge-crossing away.
</P>
<P>
   All of Hamill's writing has been shaped by this awareness of
being an outsider, almost a foreigner in his own land _ not in any
alienated sense, but just the opposite, with a wonder, which has
kept even his hardest-boiled political screeds from turning
cynical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this sounds corny,'' he says, ``but my mother and
father came here to be free. It was true of all the Italians and
Jews who came here, too. They didn't want pogroms, they didn't want
some king telling them what to do. That accounts for a lot of the
`New York attitude' that drives some people crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a hopeful take, much more so than the conventional
wisdom's, on the new waves of immigrants pouring into New York
today: ``I go to an all-night Korean grocery near my apartment, and
this Mexican from Pueblo works there. I talk to him a lot. Turns
out, he lives in Brooklyn, six blocks from where I grew up. He
knows his job isn't the best in the world, but his kids will do
better. Immigrants bring an optimism to this city. They don't come
here depressed. They come here because they believe in the day
after tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamill dropped out of high school, like most of the kids he knew
growing up. He took somge art courses, in Mexico City and
later back in Manhattan, but never finished them, either.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, while working at an advertising agency, he read a book
by Jimmy Wechsler, the editor of the New York Post, then a great
liberal newspaper and Hamill's favorite. He sent Wechsler a long
letter, challenging some of his comments about journalism and
complaining that newsrooms seemed to have no place for
working-class stiffs like himself, people who may not have gone to
Harvard or Columbia but knew about the streets and the world.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, Wechsler wrote back, inviting him to apply for a
job. The tryout went well, and so on June 1, 1960, Hamill became a
newspaperman _ working in the same building, now a residence hotel,
where he keeps an office today.
</P>
<P>
   The Post in those days was an unusual environment by any
standard, and one of its leading characters was Murray Kempton, a
thin pipe-smoking gentleman who could talk about union leaders and
Pericles in the same sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reading Kempton was like having Henry James covering a murder
or covering a dockworkers' strike,'' Hamill says, still in awe.
(Kempton, an idol to manters in this city, died three years
ago, at the age of 79, and wrote three columns a week for Newsday
almost till the end.) ``So I got the idea that there was more than
one way to do this work.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Post was an afternoon paper also meant he
worked nights. ``It made for terrible marriages and a lot of free
time,'' Hamill says. ``There were times you could just read, or
write something beyond what you did for the paper. I've always been
able to do journalism and fiction, or more extended work, at the
same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Hamill has written for all three of New York's
surviving tabloids, the Post, the Daily News, and Newsday, as well
as, at various times, Esquire, The Village Voice, and New York
magazine. He also was briefly the editor in chief of the Post, for
five weeks in 1993, and the Daily News, for eight months in 1997,
in both cases during unusual crises of management.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the newspaper game altogether now (``I miss the
camaraderie''), Hamill is writing a novel, his ninth, something
about New York, though he won't say what. He has a deal with The
New Yorker to write occasional pieces on pretty much whatever he
wants. He and his wife, the Japanese journalist Fukiko Aoki, spend
about a third of their time in Cuernavaca, an hour outside Mexico
City and the place Malcolm Lowry wrote about in ``Under the
Volcano.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I go there just to write,'' Hamill says. ``It's a good place
to get away from the bombardment of information you get here.''
</P>
<P>
   He still paints occasionally, too, portraits of Mexico mainly,
but only for himself. ``You gotta have something you don't sell to
anybody,'' he says.

so loyal to our closest friends, yet so indifferent to the
suffering of strangers in far-off places? Just what is it that
makes a human being tick?
 &HT;    Of course, there's no simple answer, but new scientific
breakthroughs have reinforced the notion of a biological model of
human behavior. For the first time, we've been able to correlate
specific types of behavior with specific parts of the brain,
linking those regions with readily identifiable thought processes.
On the basis of these early findings, it appears that physical
pathways in the brain may dictate much, if not all, of human
behavior.
 &HT;    It's an intuitively appealing theory, and it's consistent with
recent research. For example, a 1997 Harvard study has shown a
positive correlation beegional blood flow to certain parts
of the brain and the level of anxiety experienced by various
individuals.
 &HT;    Using positron emission tomography (PET) to provide images of
brain activity, researchers provoked anxiety symptoms in a group of
patients suffering from conditions like posttraumatic stress
disorder and then watched for increased neural activity in specific
locations. They found that increased activity in specific regions
of the brain correlated not only with the presence of anxiety but
also with the degree of anxiety reported by individuals in the
study.
 &HT;    In another PET study at the University of Texas, scientists
provoked emotions of sadness in healthy volunteers and then looked
for changes in regional blood flow that would indicate shifts in
brain metabolism. They found increased metabolism in the ``limbic''
region of the brain and decreased metabolism in the ``neocortical''
region.
 &HT;    Intriguingly, when they looked at another group of patients who
were recovering from chronic depression, the reverse pattern --
involving the same regions -- was seen: the neocortical region
increased its metabolism while the limbic area had diminished
activity. Reciprocal changes in mood were thus accompanied by
parallel changes in brain metabolism.
 &HT;    Correlations between brain activity and overt behaviors have
also been shown in patients undergoing neurosurgery. A 1999 report
in the Journal of Neurosurgery recounted how a group of patients
experienced notable cognitive, mood and personality changes
following surgery for Parkinson's disease. Postoperatively, one
individual actually lost his aggressiveness and drive -- traits
that had previously defined his relationships with family and
business associates.
 &HT;    All these findings support the notion that human behavior is
ultimately the product of physical processes in the brain. If this
is true, it has enormous implications for mankind in the next
millennium. Imagine a world in which doctors are able to manipulate
human behavior the way we manipulate broken bones today.
 &HT;    The possibilities are enthralling. And chilling. Physicians
might perform surgical procedures on prisoners to reduce aggression
or violent tendencies. Exasperated parents might ask for a cerebral
transplant to cure their hyperactive child. And surgical implants
might alter everything from native intelligence to sexual
orientation.
 &HT;    More insidious interventions might arise as well. Psychiatric
patients might suffer from treatments that remove parts of their
individuality as well as their affliction. Government leaders might
use behavioral modification to pacify a restless populace, or to
subdue political opponents. Political prisoners might be subjected
to a new kind of abuse: the alteration of their personalities,
rather than their bodies, beyond recognition.
 &HT;    It's not as farfetched as it seems. In fact, we already
manipulate human behavior today: antidepressants, for instance,
elevate patients' moods to the point where they can make it through
the day without contemplating suicide. Compulsive behaviors like
hand-washing can be substantially reduced with the help of drugs
that affect serotonin levels in the brain.
 &HT;    It's only a matter of time before this type of intervention
becomes more sophisticated, and potentially more dangerous. While
behavioral interventions have the potential to alleviate much
suffering, such awesome power cannot be taken lightly.
 &HT;    What ethical choices will we make when we have the ability to
profoundly alter not only the heart but also the soul of man? How
far will we go in altering the ``natural'' tendencies of human
beings? What impact will this eventually have on the evolution of
our species?
 &HT;    These questions will have to be addressed in the future, when
partial (or total) brain replacement becomes as routine as hip
replacement today. As with all revolutionary scientific advances,
we will need to exercise great care before redefining human nature.
After all, we've come a long way in two million years, and in many
ways our nature remains as inscrutable as ever.

THEY'RE DOING IT WITH MIRRORS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   There has been a lot of talk lately about the man in the glass.
Tuesday Bill Parcells and Bill Belichick looked in that glass and
saw the same person staring back.
</P>
<P>
   New York Jets president Steve Gutman and Patriots owner Robert
Kraft had the same experience when they looked in the mirrors on
their office walls. They did not see themselves. They saw each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, it was Belichick playing the stooge for
Parcells, with Gutman at his side, during the dog-and-pony show in
which Gutman claimed Belichick was the Jets' new coach and Parcells
was a ``consultant.'' In fact, it was all a charade designed to
spring Parcells from the contract that bound him to Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, as Gutman did Tuesday, stood up and called the contract
binding and said Parcells would coach in New England or nowhere. It
was Gutman saying the same about Belichick after he stunned the
Jets by resigning one day after they had named him Parcells's
successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's chaos here,'' said a Jets insider, and the look on
Gutman's face did not argue against that statement. It was the same
way in Foxborough in 1997 when Kraft held the Jets' feet to the
fire and forced NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue to broker a deal
that netted the Patriots four draft choices in exchange for
releasing Parcells from his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Now we face a role reversal, because the Patriots had asked for
permission to talk with Belichick about their head coaching and
general manager vacancy and were denied. Before the Patriots could
react, Parcells had stepped down and Belichick had been elevated.
Only problem was, Belichick did what Gutman couldn't do Tuesday. He
saw his situation for what it was and quit.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled for months about living his life in limbo, Belichick
stunned not only the Jets but the New York media when he resigned.
He quit not because he has a back channel deal with the Patriots to
replace Pete Carroll, although he very well may have. He quit
because he has eyes in his head.
</P>
<P>
   What those eyes saw was how his position as head coach of the
Cleveland Browns eroded after Art Modell decided midway through the
1995 season to move the team to Baltimore. Unwilling to bring an
unpopular coach to a new venue, he let Belichick go even though
he'd taken the 3-13 team he inherited in 1990 to an 11-5 record and
a playoff appearance in 1994. He was 3-1 in 1995 when Modell made
his decision, and in the turmoil that followed, his team lost seven
of its last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick talked of that Tuesday. What he did not talk about _
but was equally affected by _ was what he had seen go on in New
England with Parcells, whose power was unimpeachable when he was
hired by James B. Orthwein but slowly eroded after a new owner
moved in.
</P>
<P>
   The deal Parcells had with Orthwein was no longer in effect. He
had the job but not all the power. Belichick feared the same fate
because of the uncertainty of the Jets' ownership and the fact that
the contract he holds is with a dead man (Leon Hess) rather than
with the man who will buy the team from John Hess, the late owner's
son.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Parcells is on record saying he doesn't know how long
he'll stay and has made clear he will not suffer a fool if such a
man buys the team. Gutman could be fired at any time because he's
as necessary to the Jets as a sofa. What Belichick saw in all that
was a contract not worth the paper it's written on when a new
organization is formed and a better deal in New England.
</P>
<P>
   There will be much posturing the next few days, but the fact is
Belichick is Kraft's top choice to replace Carroll and Belichick
has asked for an expedited parole hearing with Tagliabue within the
next 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft's minions have been instructed to say he won't go to the
mattress for Belichick. They have been told to whisper that this is
between Belichick and the Jets. But one of them said: ``If he
became a free man, would he work for the Patriots? I think so. If
it was all clear with Belichick, it definitely would happen, but
the league has said no one can even talk to him. It would have to
happen expeditiously.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick's representatives will argue that he has a contract
that is unenforceable because it is with a dead man who can offer
him no protection from someone like Charles Dolan, the Cablevision
king.
</P>
<P>
   Gutman, playing the role of Kraft circa 1997, will counter that
a contract is a contract.
</P>
<P>
   Head coaches in the NFL almost never quit without having another
job to go to. They may be forced out, as Marty Schottenheimer was a
year ago. They may be fired, as Carroll was. They may retire, as
Parcells did, and take another job in the organization. But they
don't walk away without a place to land.
</P>
<P>
   That's why when Bill Belichick looked in the mirror Tuesday, the
man staring back was Bill Parcells, and that made the rest of what
he did easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't thought about the future,'' Belichick insisted. ``Up
until 2 p.m., I hadn't written down what's on this piece of paper.
I feel good about what I'm doing. It's not about the future or some
ruling. I feel I'm making a decision based on a circumstance as it
is right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement I made was with Mr. Hess, Bill Parcells, and Mr.
Gutman. That situation has changed dramatically. The head coach of
the Jets will not be talking to John Hess. He may not be talking to
Steve Gutman, to Bill Parcells. That's just the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells should understand that because the man in the
glass looking back at him was his protege, Bill Belichick.

TO MANY OF JAPAN'S YOUTHS, WORK CAN WAIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHARON MOSHAVI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Sporting long, flashy sideburns and a T-shirt that reads
``Sorry Mum and Dad,'' Masato Nagata is the first to admit he's on
his way to becoming a ``free-ta. ''
</P>
<P>
   Literally ``free person,'' a free-ta is the Japanese version of
a slacker _ and an increasingly common word used to describe
Japanese youths.
</P>
<P>
   Nagata expects to graduate from his university in March but
hasn't begun looking for a job, something Japanese students
traditionally wrap up by the end of their junior year. He has no
idea what he wants to do, although he certainly knows what he
doesn't want: a job at a large corporation, like the auto parts
manufacturer where his father works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go to work every day and wear a blue suit. It's not
for me,'' said Nagata, 22. He plans to keep his part-time job as a
truck driver's assistant until he can think of something better to
do.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Nagata exemplifies a new era in Japan that is
witnessing the fall of the ``salaryman'' and the rise of the
slacker. Increasingly, many youths see work as the enemy and are
opting out. Few want to mimic the lives of their fathers, toiling
for decades at the same job at the same company.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude is being fueled by the decay of Japan's economic
safety net. Good jobs are scarce, and the guarantee of lifetime
employment, or shushinkoyo, is disappearing, as corporations are
forced to face hard realities. In the past few weeks, Nissan, Japan
Airlines, and telephone giant NTT have all announced layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the point, Japanese youths are asking, of dedicating
their lives to drudgery if they aren't rewarded with security?
</P>
<P>
   Yasushi Okayama, a junior at Tokyo's prestigious Waseda
University, is one of a dozen students sitting at computers
provided at the college's career library. But instead of checking
job postings on the Web, Okayama, like most of the others, is
e-mailing his friends.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't given his career much thought, he said, beyond the
desire for ``an easy job that will provide me enough money to
sustain myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many Japanese youths still seek secure jobs with
corporate giants, but more than one-fifth of Japanese, many of them
under 30, hold part-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Applications for government jobs, long considered prestigious,
are falling dramatically. Normally, these applications rise during
hard times, since other jobs are harder to find.
</P>
<P>
   Young Japanese don't seem too worried. ``It's the teachers and
parents who are worried,'' said Yuko Ookubo, executive researcher
at Recruit Co. Ltd., a leading career center.
</P>
<P>
   Older Japanese do not hide their dissatisfaction with the
younger generation. The media are filled with countless stories
about how spoiled youths are: loud and abrasive on the subways,
responsible for rising crime. What the youths call individualism is
just selfishness, older Japanese say.
</P>
<P>
   Today's youths, for the most part, have experienced nothing but
the good life. Despite the current economic downturn, their parents
still have plenty of disposable income, which their children spend
on Louis Vuitton bags, dye jobs, and platform shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with their American or European counterparts, Japanese
youths are less ambitious, concedes Hidehiko Sekizawa, executive
director of the Hakuhodo Institute of Living and Life, which
conducts surveys of Japanese daily life.
</P>
<P>
   But Sekizawa does not think the whole generation should be
written off. Its members are simply searching for a better balance
between leisure and work, and a job that is fun, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to think enjoyment was connected to the company,
but now today's youth try to find happiness and enjoyment by
themselves,'' Sekizawa said.
</P>
<P>
   And once the young find careers that interest them, Sekizawa
predicts, they will work very hard. He said the Internet and the
rising interest in Japanese popular culture _ witness Pokemon _
will open a window of opportunity for young people looking for work
that excites them.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who follow a more conventional career path seem to
have a different outlook than the previous generation. Toshio Sato,
a confident Waseda University senior who worked hard to land a job
with a radio network, said that if he doesn't like his work, he'll
leave after a few years. ``I'd like security, but my happiness is
more important,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the rising demand for personal satisfaction at work
is going to be tough for many companies to accommodate. Japanese
corporations are group-oriented, with hierarchical structures.
</P>
<P>
   A Waseda business professor, Shunji Kobayashi, predicted, ``A
clash of attitudes is just beginning.''

&HT;     ANOTHER POLITICALLY CORRECT DOLLAR 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GARY GRIFFITH  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now that you have survived the Y2K bug, get ready
for another turkey: the new Sacagawea dollar coin. Feminists have
had complete control over its design. The U.S. Mint wants to market
it like a Beanie Baby. And the vending machine industry hopes to
use it to kill the paper dollar we know and love.
</P>
<P>
   You haven't held this coin in your hand yet. But if you want
one, don't go to the bank. Go to the grocery. It is going to be
distributed first in cereal boxes. This is not a joke. In a
marketing agreement with General Mills, the new dollar coin will be
packed in every 2000th box of Cheerios before it is available
anywhere else. Yikes!
</P>
<P>
   From the Mint's point of view, this is not just a coin, but a
commercial product to be launched. The new dollar had its own float
in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and there will be another
deal with an as-yet-unnamed ``household-name retailer`` who will
also get the dollar coin before Federal Reserve banks do.
McDonald's? Burger King? Ann Taylor?
</P>
<P>
   Our last dollar coin, you may remember, featured a portrait of
Susan B. Anthony, the suffragette and temperance fanatic. It became
the Edsel of world coinage. For those conspiracy theorists who
believe it failed because men refused to, the Sacagawea will
offer no relief. No coin could possibly have a more politically
correct design.
</P>
<P>
   ``No men need apply`` was the theme of the drawing-board phase.
The specifications, set in 1997 by then-Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin, stated that ``the obverse design be of one or more women.``
A racially, ethnically, and sexually correct advisory committee was
appointed, and picked Sacagawea, the young Shoshone woman who
guided and translated for Lewis and Clark on their western
explorations between 1804 and 1806.
</P>
<P>
   Trust me, this was not a committee that was going to pick Ayn
Rand or Florence Harding. The runners-up were Eleanor Roosevelt and
Rosa Parks. The designer chosen (a coincidence perhaps) happened to
be a woman: Glenna Goodacre. One of her previous commissions was
the Vietnam Women's Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Sacagawea's name does not actually appear on the coin, nor does
that of her infant son, Baptiste, whom she shown carrying. Mint
director Philip Diehl has described the young Indian guide as ``a
working mother.``
</P>
<P>
   An American eagle was included in the specs as the subject for
the reverse. Its sex was not mandated, but somehow I don't think it
is a male.
</P>
<P>
   First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton (you are surprised, right?)
unveiled the design, stating, ``How fitting that the first U.S.
coin of the new millennium should carry the image of the
Native-American woman whose courage and quiet dignity provides such
a powerful link to our past.``
</P>
<P>
   When the last U.S. dollar coin of the old millennium, the Susan
B. Anthony, was launched in 1979, the Treasury Department wanted to
use it to replace the dollar bill, which has a lifespan of only 14
months. A total of 847.5 million SBAs had been produced by 1980,
when the Mint finally admitted that the coin was a turkey. No one
used it. In 1981, another 9.7 million were minted with 1981 dates
for numismatic sets intended for sale to coin collectors.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the SBAs simply sat in sacks in warehouses. Any other
retailer would have moved them out by marking them down. I would
have bought a sack or two myself if they had been reduced to 79
cents. But after 20 years, the Treasury Department has finally
unloaded them on transit systems (New York's MTA uses 60 million a
year now) and the U.S. Postal Service (which uses them for change
in its stamp-vending machines).
</P>
<P>
   Another theory on why the SBA failed had nothing to do with the
crusty portrait of Ms. Anthony, but with the fact that it was too
easily confused with a quarter. The size was not much different,
and the edge was ``reeded`` or grooved like the quarter. The Mint
is an adherent of this theory and believes that the Sacagawea will
be accepted the way the SBA was not. ``We fixed what was wrong with
the Susan B. Anthony dollar,`` says director Diehl. ``It's
absolutely clear that what was wrong with it was product
differentiation.``
</P>
<P>
   The Sacagawea coin will be golden in color, although it will not
actually contain any gold. It will be an alloy of manganese, brass,
and copper. And the edge will be smooth. It will also have a raised
rim. This will give it what the Mint calls ``tactile clues`` that
will make it easy to distinguish by feel.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that it will have egg on its face if the Sacagawea is a
bust, the Mint has scaled down the initial production to 100
million for 2000. That compares to 400 million per year for the
SBA.
</P>
<P>
   Subways systems will eat half the production, and coin
collectors will absorb another 10 million. To move the rest, there
will be a publicity and advertising campaign, and of course,
merchandizing. ``We're really introducing it the way a corporation
would introduce a new commercial product,`` says Michael White, a
spokesman for the Mint. Don't be surprised if the Mint announces in
midyear that the coin was such a big success that it has to make
more.
</P>
<P>
   The Mint is not telling us, however, that this dollar coin will
replace the dollar bill, and points out that there are 5 billion $1
bills in circulation. Diehl calls the coin ``a drop in the bucket``
by comparison. But others want the coin to take the bill's place.
</P>
<P>
   The vending machine industry, which has lobbied hard for a
working dollar coin, says it is ``bouncing off the walls with
happiness`` over the fact that the Sacagawea will have the same
``electromagnetic signature`` as the SBA. Machines will not be able
to tell the difference.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers of those machines have another theory of why
the Susan B. Anthony failed. There was already a dollar bill that
did the same thing. They compare it to VHS and Beta. Only one
format will survive. They would like to see the government
eliminate the paper dollar completely. Many other countries _ like
Canada and France _ simply had their central banks decree it.
</P>
<P>
   But under the U.S. Constitution, Congress controls coinage, and
Congress never likes to do anything unpopular. Remember that
America doesn't use the metric system either. Congress fears the
``squeal factor`` that other governments have bravely endured when
they eliminated their low-value bank notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``No pain, no gain,`` says James Benfield, a lobbyist with The
Coin Coalition, which represents the makers of subway turnstiles,
coin-operated washing machines, and arcade games. ``We had wanted
Congress to be overt and say we won't print any more dollar bills
after such and such a date.`` But Congress wouldn't do that.
</P>
<P>
   The vending lobbyists, however, have been successful in killing
the redesign of the $1 bill. The $100, the $50, and the $20 have
been reworked by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to make them
harder to counterfeit and easier to recognize. The $10 and the $5
will follow shortly. But the $1 will not. Current law initiated by
the vending interests prohibits its redesign before Sept. 30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Benfield and his supporters want to see the $1 bill stay the
same and then fade away quickly as the Sacagawea becomes the coin
of the realm.
</P>
<P>
   Will it happen? I'm not so sure. For one thing, I never bet on
Congress to do the brave thing. For another, the Sacagawea is the
same size and shape as the Susan B. It's just a different color.
And although we men shouldn't hate it, it's going to be a hard coin
to love. The whole thing reminds me of what happened when the 1958
Edsel bombed. Ford took a hard look at the situation, then changed
the grill and taillights on the 1959 model.

   Reality bites.
</P>
<P>
   All those stocks that practically made people gasp by the way
they soared in 1999 took a header in similarly dramatic fashion
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Take a peek at the top of the local scorecard: CMGI Inc. of
Andover, down 32 11/16 to 293 3/4. Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc.
of Cambridge, Mass., off 22 5/16 to 117 5/8. Another Cambridge
entry, Sapient Inc., gave up 22 11/16 to 110 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   The IPO gold dust twins of 1999, Sycamore Networks Inc. of
Chelmsford, Mass. and Cambridge-based Akamai Technologies Inc.,
took it on the chin too. Akamai sank 21 1/4 to 300 and Sycamore
slumped 14 7/8 to 296 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   There were others, lots of them, tumbling as the broader stock
market suffered through a particularly bad day.
</P>
<P>
   Money managers pointed to the virtual certainty of higher
interest rates ahead as the wet blanket that finally caught up to
stocks. Other factors, like tax-related selling, may have played a
more minor role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the equity markets finally woke up to rates,'' said
Barry Evans of John Hancock Funds in Boston. Bond markets realized
awhile ago that the Federal Reserve was sure to increase short-term
rates, starting next month.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks had to catch on eventually. All those earnings forecasts,
flung far into the future, eventually feel the pinch of higher
rates.
</P>
<P>
   The market jolt Tuesday might have been soothed by that
consensus opinion, unpleasant medicine swallowed and accepted.
</P>
<P>
   The worry: conventional wisdom became practically irrelevant as
stocks rocketed in the last months of 1999, so how can you grab
onto it with much confidence now? Stock markets that seem detached
from historical influences are giddy on the way up, but scary when
they head the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be a rough patch for awhile,'' said Brian
Stack of MFS Investment Management in Boston. Besides the interest
rate picture, he said, people are looking back at the recent past
in disbelief. ``You've got this feeling gnawing at people that
things don't go up that fast,'' Stack said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that will still turn out to be a positive influence.
Remember just how much most of Tuesday's worst stock market
casualties had risen over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sure CMGI took a big haircut Tuesday, but it still only amounted
to about 10 percent of the company's value. The stock was up more
than 900 percent in 1999 and it gained nearly 50 points per share
on Monday. Incredibly, CMGI stock was still higher than its 1999
closing price, as of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Biogen Inc. sank 14 15/16 to 73 1/16 Tuesday, but it remained
ahead by more than 80 percent over the last year. Art Technology
Group Inc. of Cambridge sank 16 9/16 to 107 7/8, a grim setback
that still left the e-commerce company with a stock value about
nine times higher than its intial public offering price of six
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most stocks suffered through a bad day, but the very deep cuts
were reserved for a relatively few local companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Bloomberg Massachusetts index, heavy on small technology
stocks, fell 5.07 percent. Nearly three of every four members in
the 333-stock index declined but only 22 of them lost more than 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The very worst of the group, Parametric Technology Corp. of
Waltham, Mass., sank 20.4 percent by picking a bad day to warn it
would not meet fourth-quarter financial forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the rest, about half are coming off years in which they at
least doubled in stock value. In many cases, appreciation was much
greater still.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts was home to more than its share of big stock
market winners in 1999. For the moment at least, the backlash feels
outsized as well.
</P>
<P>
   The days and even weeks ahead may be rocky, but there are a few
regular boosts that stocks are likely to receive in the months
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Cash flows, from retirement plan contributions and other
sources, generally increase in the next three months. The money has
to go somewhere (don't be suprised to hear growth mutual fund
managers start talking like value managers buying bargains).
</P>
<P>
   Another factor: the enormous resilience individual investors
have displayed over and over, seeing most declines as buying
opportunities. It has happened so many times that no money manager
will discount its impact.

APPLE FAITHFUL AWAIT NEWEST PLANS FOR GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Now what?
</P>
<P>
   As Apple Computer Inc. enters the its second phase of its
corporate reconstruction, thousands of Macintosh disciples will
gather here at MacWorld to hear how Apple plans to build upon its
recent successes and break out of its mold as a niche playhe
$185 billion worldwide personal computer market.
</P>
<P>
   To lay out the blueprint, Apple is calling upon its icon and
high priest, Steve Jobs, founder and interim chief executive of the
Cupertino, Calif., computer maker. Jobs, who has a reputation as an
impresario bar none, will no doubt whip up the crowd into a frenzy,
as he has at the last five Macworld conventions.
</P>
<P>
   And there will be much for Macintosh fans to cheer. The company
that lost more than $1 billion in 1997, is now comfortably
profitable, earning $601 million in 1999, thanks in part to robust
sales of its iMac, a series of hyperdesigned personal computers
that have become fashion statements as well as machines.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the iMac has helped revive Apple from its near
death experience, the market is looking to see what will fuel the
next phase of the company's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big story is what can Apple do for me next?'' said Tim
Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a consulting firm in
Silicon Valley. ``What else does Apple really have?''
</P>
<P>
   At Macworld, there will be constant reminders that Apple still
operates at the margins of an industry dominated by computers that
run on Windows, a rival operating system controlled by Microsoft
Corp. Apple's share of the worldwide computer market continues to
slip. In 1999, Macintoshes represented just 3.25 percent of desktop
computer shipments in the United States, down from nearly 12
percent in 1994, estimates International Data Corp. in Framingham.
And while major rivals have plunged into the Internet realm in one
way or another, Apple has yet to articulate an Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   While Apple officials aren't saying how the company plans to
survive the new century (the firm has a policy of not discussing
projects in the works), many computer industry analysts say Apple
needs to flesh out several key issues at Macworld to demonstrate
its ability to maintain momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost. is a plan to better incorporate the Internet software
and connections into its product offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to do more work on their Web strategy,'' said
Schelley &UR;  &LR; Olhava, an anaylst with IDC. ``If you look at where
everything is going, it's the Internet. It's why people are out
buying computers. Gateway, Micron, Dell all have some sort of
Internet presence. Apple needs to be in on that.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of guesses as to what would constitute an
Internet strategy, from Apple-branded Internet connection services
to software that can be ``rented'' over the Web. Apple isn't new to
the online world, notes Louis Mazzuchelli, senior vice president of
Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York. He says that Apple in the
mid-1990s operated eWorld, an early online community.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; At Macworld, Apple devotees will also be waiting to hear more
about a new Macintosh operating system, which is widely expected to
be released sometime this year and may even be announced at this
week's trade show. MacWorld. Dubbed ``OS X,'' (denoting the number
10) the much anticipated new operating system is supposed to be
more reliable than OS 9, the current operating system. By sealing
off separate software programs, OS X allows one program to crash
without harming other programs that happen to be running on the
computer at the time. In addition, OS X is expected to allow a
number of people to simultaneously use the same operating system as
a way of sharing the resources of a single computer, a capability
known as multitasking
</P>
<P>
   ``OS X will be important for Apple in the short term, because
they can get quick revenue from users who are upgrading to the new
operating system,'' said Bajarin.
</P>
<P>
   Another key to Apple's future is in the market for small,
portable devices used to link to the Internet. These so-called
``Internet appliances,'' which include handheld organizers, cell
phones, and other devices, are projected to outsell personal
computers by three-to-one in 2001, according to Bajarin. ``The
Internet changes everytnd while PCs aren't going away, the
activity is going to be around Internet devices as opposed to
PCs,'' Bajarin said.
</P>
<P>
   Apple, of course, has said nothing about plans to introduce any
handheld devices.
</P>
<P>
   Another Apple product to watch, analysts say, is QuickTime,
multimedia ``streaming'' software that allows Internet users to
play videos and sound. QuickTime, however, is a bit player in the
market currently dominated by RealPlayer, a product made by
RealNetworks Inc. in Seattle. Apple also competes with Microsoft,
which makes MediaPlayer.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are the core issues surrounding Macintosh
hardware and whether Apple can continue to make them better,
sleeker, speedier, and to deliver them fast enough into the hands
of consumers. Production glitches last year meant that Mac buyers
sometimes had to wait weeks for their machines to arrive. And while
iMacs continue to have a distinctive look, other computer makers
are catching on and releasing curvy look-a-likes in novelty colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple was the first to identify that industrial design is a
differentiator,'' said Rob Enderle, an analyst with Giga
Information Group in Santa Clara, Calif. ``The problem is that the
rest of the industry has also figured that out. So Apple is facing
rather substantial competition with regards to the physical
appearance of their boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   With greater competition over the physical appearance of
computers, analysts say what's inside the candy-colored exterior
will matter even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a Faberge egg: beautiful on the outside but hollow
on the inside,'' said Roger Kay, research manager at IDC. ``It
works as long as you keep pulling better designs out of the hat.
But where is the sustainable business model? There is obviously
skepticism about their ability to produce that. Nevertheless, they
keep defying gravity, and that's what people are hoping to see'' at
MacWorld.

ABROAD, IT'S AN ECONOMIC REBOUND, NOT MELTDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If there were a Doomsday Clock for the world
economy, its hands would be slipping backward these days, to
signify steady steps away from disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Only two years ago, even the most optimistic forecasters were
forced to consider the prospect of a global economic meltdown. The
fast-growing nations of Southeast Asia had tumbled into a deep and
unexpected recession. Mighty Japan watched helplessly as its
economy, the world's second-largest, also slid into a downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Instability spread to Latin America and to Russia, where fears
arose that the economic problems could lead to political chaos in
one of the world's nuclear powers. When Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI
assessed the odds of a global recession late in 1998, it pegged the
chances at a worrisome 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the forecasting firm has scaled back that possiblity to
15 percent, which it says is not much of a chance at all. The
world's economic prospects are brightening considerably, a trend
that is expected to last through the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asia seems to be in a signficant rebound,'' as are most
developing nations, said Nariman Behravesh, chief international
economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, in Lexington, Mass. Europe will
also have a strong year, he predicted, and even Russia seems to
have put the worst behind it.
</P>
<P>
   This is mixed news for Americans. Currency collapses in Asia and
elsewhere allowed US consumers to buy more foreign goods with fewer
dollars. Moreover, the Asian downturn cut the world's appetite for
products and commodities.
</P>
<P>
   The result was low prices and low interest rates in the United
States, creating the perfect environment for the U.S. economy to
boom without sparking inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, consumers throughout the world are regaining their taste
for goods, which is prompting prices to rise. If they increase too
quickly, though, the Federal Reserve, a sworn enemy of inflation,
might move to slow the US economy by raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   US consumers may cringe at higher-priced goods and commodities _
oil, for example, has doubled recently to $24 a barrel _ but they
may also breathe easier knowing that the money could help stabilize
Russia, which relies heavily on commodity exports. Higher commodity
prices would also give new cash to a variety of other exporting
nations, which might then turn around and buy more from American
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In banks and on stock markets, the crisis in developing nations
that began in July 1997 has been over for nearly a year. The
Russian stock market, for example, jumped 85 percent in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   The improved financial sector is boosting the so-called ``real
economy,'' the world of worker paychecks and food prices. In South
Korea, for example, companies now have the cash to rehire workers
they had laid off, and the country is once again the star of the
developing world, growing at an annual pace of 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   How did Asia turn itself around? Though the factors differ in
each nation, economists say that governments stimulated economic
activity by generally cutting interest rates, lowering taxes, and
boosting spending.
</P>
<P>
   To varying degrees, they also stopped guiding bank loans to
favored industries. That practice of ``crony capitalism'' left
banks overextended and artificially propped up money-losing
businesses. Now, some weak banks have been forced to close or to
recognize the bad loans on their books.
</P>
<P>
   In Thailand, half of all bank loans are considered bad, or
nonperforming, but that is down from 75 percent a few years ago,
Behravesh said.
</P>
<P>
   And in a move considered unthinkable only two years ago, South
Korea, in essence, is allowing its second-largest conglomerate to
fail. Debt-ridden Daewoo Group is not being bailed out; instead,
creditors are forcing it to restructure.
</P>
<P>
   The US Federal Reserve was also helpful to developing nations.
It cut interest rates in late 1998, which made credit cheaper and
prompted investors to take more risks overseas. Another factor was
the rollicking US economy, full of consumers buying goods from
nations that needed money.
</P>
<P>
   In these solutions are a host of questions. Can the US economy
continue to spark growth abroad? Will developing nations hew to
their promised reforms, or will they allow banks to borrow wantonly
again from the West and lend freely to weak corporations?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not out of the woods yet,'' said economist Rick Egelton
of Bank of Montreal. ``Backsliding on these reforms could take
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Another major force in the world economy, Europe, entered 1999
with a new currency and high hopes for a return to speedy growth.
The euro has flagged recently, but Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI says
Western Europe will grow 2.5 percent this year, up from 1.7 percent
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, which has reported alternating quarters of growth and
recession, will grow by less than 1 percent this coming year,
Egelton said.
</P>
<P>
   The improvements do not mean all is well in the world. At one
point, the crisis helped plunge a quarter of the world's population
into recession, sparking new unemployment and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people at the low end of the income scale have not seen
their incomes rise to the pre-crisis levels, and that will take
another four or five years,'' Behravesh said. ``But the good news
is, they're on their way. This is not Asia's lost decade.''

RIVALS EXCEED SPENDING CAPS, BUSH CAMP SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Suddenly, the Bush n has gotten very
interested in federal campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Although Texas Governor George W. Bush is not taking federal
matching funds _ having raised more money than any presidential
candidate in history, he does not need to _ his campaign is
distributing detailed charts with line-by-line descriptions of
spending by rival campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   What they want the voters of New Hampshire to believe is that
John McCain, who has made campaign finance reform the centerpiece
of his campaign, is breaking state spending caps and federal
election law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law says, `If you accept federal matching funds, you
accept state caps,'' a senior Bush adviser said. ``How can the guy
who's a big advocate of campaign finance reform be breaking the
law?''
</P>
<P>
   And both McCain and Bill Bradley, another zealous advocate of
campaign reform, are giving the distinct appearance of bursting
through the $661,000 limit in New Hampshire. And Bradley, according
to figures provided by Bush officials, also looks as if he has
cracked the cap in Iowa, which is set at $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that appearances can be deceiving given the
byzantine rules that govern the caps, full of loopholes and
deductions and open to gimmicks that allow campaigns to spread the
actual spending in New Hampshire to other accounts. And McCain and
Bradley officials loudly protest the notion that they are doing
anything other than following the letter and the spirit of the law
laid out by the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, for example, the campaigns can write off their
television advertising in New Hampshire to fund-raising costs, a
separate category, if the commercials ask for contributions. Also,
advertising costs for WMUR-TV, the main New Hampshire television
station, can be partially written off as costs incurred to reach
voters in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are creative and I think they push the
envelope,'' said Kathy Sullivan, New Hampshire's Democratic
chairwoman. ``You end up at a point where these guys have to go
through awful contortions.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, then-candidate Ronald Reagan and his campaign entourage
used to sleep in hotels just south of the border in Massachusetts.
That way, the cost of hotel rooms would not be charged against the
New Hampshire spending cap.
</P>
<P>
   Today, hotel costs in New Hampshire no longer apply to the state
spending limit. After every presidential election, the FEC has
triake it easier for candidates to compete in New Hampshire
and Iowa with fewer mathematical gymnastics, according to
specialists in election law. FEC officials would like to eliminate
the caps altogether, but Congress has repeatedly ignored the
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the spending caps were created as part of the 1974
Watergate reforms to prevent people from buying elections by
swooping into a small state and dumping vast amounts of money,
according to Jan Baran, a Republican election lawyer in Washington
who served as President George Bush's general counsel in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   While campaigns can get around the caps, Baran said, it is still
possible to break the law. ``If people haven't planned properly or
are spending a huge amount of money on last minute ad buys, they
could bust it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   FEC auditors usually do not examine a campaign's books until
after a candidate drops out or wins the nomination. That means that
candidates can flout the law, win the nomination, and pay no
meaningful penalty other than a fine.
</P>
<P>
   That galls Bush officials, who fuming while watching McCain and
Bradley shake hands on national television over their shared
contempt for special interests contaminating the campaign finance
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're shaking hands, saying we must elevate the system, and
they're the two guys busting the current law,'' one senior Bush
adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures provided by the Bush campaign, McCain has
spent $1,006,067 in New Hampshire. Reducing costs to take
Massachusetts television viewers into account, the Bush campaign
contends that McCain has spent $555,921 to date, without factoring
in any of his on-the-ground expenses. McCain has spent little money
in Iowa, refusing to compete there.
</P>
<P>
   McCain officials hotly reject the Bush figut refused to
provide their own, saying they did not want the Bush campaign to
know how much money they have left to spend on the New Hampshire
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one set of rules and we're following them,'' said John
Weaver, McCain's national political director. ``The Bush campaign
is confusing having a message with cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said that by the time the New Hampshire primary has ended
on Feb. 1, the Bush campaign will have outspent McCain by four or
five to one. Already, he said, Bush has outspent McCain by more
than two to one. But because Bush is not taking federal matching
funds, he need not abide by state spending limits. Bush officials
declined to say how much money their campaign has spent so far in
New Hampshire, nor how much they intend to spend total.
</P>
<P>
   Media buyers have also estimated that Bradley has spent a total
of $3.56 million in Iowa, New Hampshire and Massachusetts, compared
to $2.17 million for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Like McCain's aides, the Bradley camp refuted any suggestion
that their candidate is doing anything other than scrupulously
abiding by the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, of course not,'' said Eric Hauser, Bradley's spokesman,
when asked if Bradley had broken any caps. ``We have not and aren't
going to. It's just not true.''

 UNDATED: ... charter experts.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though McCain's committee has oversight of the FCC, there is no
evidence that his May criticism affected the FCC's decision to
allow the mammoth SBC merger. Two weeks later, however, McCain
filed legislation to strip the agency of its say in
telecommunications mergers.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Pittsburgh issue, officials familiar with the
decision said McCain's involvement was more problematic.
</P>
<P>
   The swing vote in the 3-2 decision was cast by Susan Ness, one
of three Democrats on the five-member FCC, who joined the two
Republicans in approving the sale. President Clinton last July
nominated Neff for a second five-year term, but her confirmation is
up to McCain's committee. The committee has yet to schedule a
hearing on her nomination. Ness declined requests for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, which the FCC wrestled with for nearly three years,
was one of its most complex involving a license transfer. WQED, the
Pittsburg public broadcasting outlet, wanted to sell the license
for its sister station, WQEX, to Cornerstone TeleVision, a
religious broadcaster that owns Channel 40 in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerstone, in turn, would sell its license to Paxson, with
Cornerstone and WQED splitting the $35 million Paxson had agreed to
pay. Pittsburgh has been the only one of the top 20 television
markets without a Paxson station.
</P>
<P>
   While the FCC has never turned down a local market license
transfer, the Pittsburgh case was almost without precedent: It
involved passing a noncommercial license held by a public
television station to a commercial operator. In Pittsburgh, there
was substantial local opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, McCain noted in his Dec. 10 letter that
the commission had apparently ignored his Nov. 17 request that the
FCC vote on the transfer on Dec. asked that each of the five
members ``advise me, in writing, no later than close of business on
Tuesday, Dec. 14, 1999, whether you have already acted upon these
applications. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``If your answer to the latter question is no, please state
further whether you will, or will not, be prepared to act on these
applications at the open meeting on Dec. 15. If your answer to both
of the preceding questions is no, please explain why,'' McCain
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   As he had in his earlier letter, McCain emphasized he was not
suggesting how the commission vote, only that it vote. But within
the agency, according to sources, his letters were widely
interpreted to favor the complicated transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard, the chairman, objected. In his Dec. 14 reply to McCain,
he wrote, ``I must respectfully note that it is highly unusual for
the commissioners to be asked to publicly announce their voting
status on a matter that is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned,'' Kennard continued, ``that inquiries
concerning the individual deliberations of each commissioner could
have procedural and substantive impacts on the Commission's
deliberations and, thus, on the due process rights of the
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Gloria Tristani, who joined Kennard in refusing to
vote for the transfer, wrote to McCain, saying she would not answer
his query ``in o preserve the integrity of our processes.''
</P>
<P>
   Schnur, McCain's spokesman, said the senator's involvement was
benign. ``What you have here is a case where a senator with a
history of writing the FCC when they don't act quickly writes the
FCC to ask that it act quickly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schnur added: ``It gets down to appearances, and there's nothing
beyond the appearances.'' He said he doubts that many voters would
be troubled by McCain's use of the Paxson jet even as he was urging
action, at its lobbyists' request, on a matter involving the
company.
</P>
<P>
   To others, including some who sympathize with McCain's crusade
for reform, McCain has placed himself in an awkward position.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Makinson, the executive director of the Center for
Responsive Politics, which tracks political contributions, said
candidates like McCain who support reforms are likely to falter for
want of campaign funds unless they tap into the system.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the SBC/Ameritech donations, Makinson said: ``It's
very difficult for a candidate like McCain to maintain his
political independence when he is taking such large contributions
from special interests. He's hoisted by his own petard: He cannot
say the money influences everyone else, but it doesn't influence
me.''

AS TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION CHURNS, CHANGE HITS WORKPLACES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The 21st century is upon us, and the Information Age has
arrived, linking workers by fax, e-mail and telephone.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, even more sophisticated communications technology
and computer software will propel us further down the path of a
revolution dominated by the control and dissemination of
information in a global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   How will these changes affect our work and our families? There
is no shortage of predictions.
</P>
<P>
   One workplace specialist envisions microchips under the skin
encoded with a job applicant's work history, making the standard
screening as easy as walking through a metal detector. Another
believes that leading US firms will more aggressively involve
themselves in local schools in order to mold future employees.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The End of Work,'' author Jeremy Rifkin predicts a steady
and inevitable decline of traditional manufacturing jobs, leading
to a lack of work for many Americans and a two-tiered society. At
the top would be information specialists, teachers, medical
experts, and financial gurus. Near the bottom would be a growing
army of cashiers, security guards, child care workers, and home
health aides locked in low-wage jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, several experts discussed the workplace of the
21st century. Here is what they said:
</P>
<P>
   --John A. Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray &AMP;
Christmas Inc., an outplacement firm:
</P>
<P>
   ``Driven by employee demand for more flexible scheduling,
telecommuting will be the predominant workplace trend in the new
millennium. Increased telecommuting will benefit employees desiring
more balance between work and family, and will pay big dividends
for employers in terms of improved productivity because
telecommuters, on average, work more hours at home than their
counterparts at the office each week. At the same time, employees
will become more isolated. Digital communication will replace
face-to-face exchanges. Companies will address the problem with
counseling, or by bringing workers together in social settings.''
</P>
<P>
   --David A. Thomas, Harvard Business School professor and author
of ``Breaking Through: The Making of Minority Executives in
Corporate America'':
</P>
<P>
   ``The managers who ultimately win in the competitive arena will
be those who can make effective decisions faster and in a
participatory way. These are people who will understand the need to
bring together a diverse group of workers who represent different
ways of reaching consumers. This will be important in the United
States and abroad. Global diversity will become a larger issue as
the acquisition of US firms by foreign companies continues. We will
see many more people of color in executive-level positions at large
US corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   --Ellen Galinsky, author of ``Ask the Children: What America's
Children Really Think About Working Parents'':
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to see a seven-day a week, 24-hour global
economy, which means jobs will be more demanding. We can expect to
see workplaces where there are no longer career ladders, but career
lattices in which people move across the lattice rather than up a
ladder. We will see an end to the notion of patriarchal management.
No longer will the worker be an individual cog in the machine.
Instead, he or she will be part of teams that form and are
continually reformed. This will require risk-taking, and the
ability to analyze and synthesize material from different sources
and different places.''
</P>
<P>
   --James Jennings, political science professor, Monroe Trotter
Institute, University of Massachusetts:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing now and will continue to see many people working
two or more jobs to support their families. As a result, work may
mean, for an increasingly large part of the population, multiple
part-time or a series of temporary jobs. We will still have vast
numbers of impoverished people working at low-wage, full- or
part-time service sector jobs who are unable to climb out of
poverty. More mergers, more corporate acquisitions and layoffs will
mean that some middle-class people will be competing with the poor
for those part-time and temporary jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   --Joan Wallace-Benjamin, president of the Urban League of
Eastern Massachusetts:
</P>
<P>
   ``As technological advancements continue, employers will be
increasing training in an effort to keep up with new business
innovations. Many of these firms will rely on community-based
organizations, located in employees' neighborhoods, to provide
ongoing training. Distance learning will escalate. A worker will be
able to go to a neighborhood center to take an English course or
mathematics course taught by a professor at Boston University, for
example. Housing projects, public schools _ any place with the
hardware and software _ will be able to access education. The
bigger issue will be whether the capital will be available to
promote this type of learning among the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   --Wendy Everett, director, Institute for the Future, Palo Alto,
Calif.:
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace of our society and, certainly, the pace and pressures
of work have speeded things up. The drawback is increased stress
and depression. We also are seeing more sedentary behavior now, and
that will increase. People are spending approximately 1 1/2 hours
more a day seated at computers than they did a decade ago. Add to
that the four hours a day people spend watching TV, plus video
games, and you're up to a lot of time involving no physicial
activity. This will be a major health concern.''
</P>
<P>
   --Francine M. Deutsch, author of ``Halving It All: How Equally
Shared Parenting Works'':
</P>
<P>
   ``We will see both men and women pressing employers to make
changes, such as fewer hours, more flexible hours, less overtime.
More people, both married and single, will question the trade-off
between time and money and whether it is worth it. We are now
seeing, in political debates, talk of national health care and
public child care for children under school age. These issues will
continue and intensify. People will demand that public policy
reflect those concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   --David J. Dell, director of research, The Conference Board:
</P>
<P>
   ``The number one emerging concern is the fact that older workers
are now finding it more attractive to leave the workplace than to
stay. Their leaving will result in a serious loss of intellectual
capital. What do you do when you have talented workers in a large
company whose salaries may have been in the $70,000 range, but
whose stock options, benefits and pensions would allow them to
retire in the million-dollar range? For people like that, there is
no longer a real incentive to continue working. It is more
economically attractive to leave the workplace. Finding ways to
hold on to these people will be an issue for companies in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   --Jared Bernstein, Economic Policy Institute, Washington:
</P>
<P>
   ``All the job growth will be in services because of a long-term
net loss of manufacturing which will accelerate as the trade
imbalance gets bigger. Just since March 1998, we have lost more
than 500,000 manufacturing jobs, primarily because of the Asian
crisis and its lasting impact. That will continue. In terms of
public policy, the big question will be, `What can we do to make
sure people at the bottom, in those growing, low-paying service
sector jobs, get a better dwo answers come to mind. First,
make sure the minimum wage keeps pace with inflation. Second, make
sure the unemployment rate stays as low as it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   --John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO:
</P>
<P>
   ``As the world economy moves more toward globalization, more
unions will be uniting in cooperative efforts to meet the
challenges created by economic and social changes. We will see
multiunion campaigns. They will not be going to the bargaining
table or organizing alone . . . Nationally, there will be a surge,
an increase in union organizing, particularly among new immigrants,
medical and health care professionals, and high-tech workers.''

HARVARD WINDFALL HAS NO NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ In Harvard's race to raise $2.1 billion
before the millennium, as money-raisers lured the wealthy with
promises of immortality in having their names inscribed across the
campus, some donors either got left out or didn't care enough to
tell university officials their name.
</P>
<P>
   More than $5 million in stocks have mysteriously accumulated in
an account at the university's Alumni Affairs and Development
Office, officials confirmed Tuesday, with no information about the
donor or the goal of the donation.
</P>
<P>
   The securities, however, didn't start out as anonymous gifts.
They're accounting flubs in Harvard's increasingly complex and
successful money-raising campaign, which since 1994 took in more
than $2.3 billion and pushed the university's endowment above $14
billion.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons Harvard officials can't readily explain, an
increasing number of stock presents to the university have landed
in Alumni office accounts with only the name of the brokerage firm
that wired the shares.
</P>
<P>
   Such obscure donations have long been sent to Harvard. But
officials say, they have never exceeded more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   With unidentifiable stock donations now reaching five times more
than the typical rate, the university is seeking a remedy. But
tracing back the source of the mysterious shares is not an easy
task, especially for a decentralized institution where 10
independent-minded schools often compete aggressively against one
another for donations.
</P>
<P>
   The university recently circulated a memo to department
directors, urging them to alert potential donors to identify
themselves and where they want to direct their gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a quirk in the system in how transfers are made,''
said Andy Tiedemann, spokesman for the Alumni Affairs and
Development Office. ``It becomes a long and tedious research
problem that requires a lot of detective wo
</P>
<P>
   Last year, about 30 percent of nearly 93,000 university donors
gave gifts of stock, an increasingly popular form of charity as
wealthy patrons seek to write off profits from the market's boom.
But directing a broker to transfer a stock is not as simple as
writing a check--and sometimes the middleman makes a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, more than 200 donors giving stocks have failed to
identify themselves or their cause. That has left university
officials in a bit of a lurch.
</P>
<P>
   Before converting the stock into cash, development officials
spend time they could be seeking new donors trying to track down
the unidentified donors. After an unspecified period, when the
university gives up searching, the money is deposited into an
unrestricted university account, which Harvard's President Neil
Rudenstine controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a problem because some schools don't give their donors
complete directions,'' said a business school official, who asked
not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, however, is one
school that clearly spells out how donors should avoid accidental
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   On its Web site, potential securities donors are given a phone
number and told to alert university officials before making an
electronic transfer. Afterward, they are told to follow up with a
letter listing the date of the transfer, the amount and where the
money is to go.
</P>
<P>
   University officials say despite the glut of nameless donors,
they are making progress identifying them. Since October, Tiedemann
said, the university has identified donors for $2 million of the
unidentified $5 million in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But as the market continues to surge and potential patrons look
for writeoffs, department heads such as Harvard's Arnold Arboretum
director, Robert Cook, believes the number of unidentified donors
may only increase as much of the university's money-raising efforts
go online.
</P>
<P>
   University officials are putting the finishing touches on a
system that will allow Web users to deposit money as easily as
pointing and clicking, much the way people buy compact disks or
computers on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In an irreverent letter apprising his donors to the pitfalls of
forgetting to tell the university their name or what they want
their money used for, Cook said they should remember the real
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that one of you out there probably
electronically transferred a big gift of securities--unloading some
excess Amazon or Yahoo before the coming crash. And you forgot to
let us know about it,'' he wrote in December. ``I hate to see money
earning interest in the wrong account across the river.''

CAPE COD MAY GET FIRST FEDERALLY FUNDED FARM FOR HOMELESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDITH GAINES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUZZARDS BAY, Mass. _ At her home on the Upper Cape, Livia Munck
Davis points proudly to a large framed photograph of Moltrop, a
farm in central Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   There was the sturdy manor house where she grew up, the
carefully manicured fields where she picked strawberries, the barn
where she kept chickens. There, too, were the cheerful,
white-washed buildings where the unusual staff stayed.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1912, Moltrop has been one of Denmark's most
remarkable social experiments. Launched on the then-radical idea
that to help those in need you have to demand a lot from them, it
is run almost entirely by former convicts and other homeless men.
</P>
<P>
   Now Davis is importing the idea to Cape Cod, planning to put the
area's homeless to work cultivating crops and sharing chores,
instead of shuffling from shelter to shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The project will be the nation's first federally funded farm for
the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyannis-based Housing Assistance Corp., where Davis works,
has garnered a $250,000 grant from the US Department of Housing and
Urban Development to buy land for the farm and is now looking for a
site in Barnstable County.
</P>
<P>
   The HUD grant will not pay all the bills. Housing Assistance
Corp. officials hope donations of land, money, architectural design
and construction services, among other things, will help it
materialize.
</P>
<P>
   On the Cape, homeless people exist almost out of sight to
tourists and even residents. The homeless huddleunder overturats in Provincetown or camp along the canal. The Cape's only
shelter can accommodate 50 people a night, roughly a third of those
who need a bed.
</P>
<P>
   The farm initially will house about 30 single homeless men and
women, who must agree to work at least 35 hours a week there or at
neighboring businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the soil conditions, Davis said, they could grow
cranberries, asparagus, pumpkins, or corn; make jams or soap;
repair and refinish furniture; or even operate a hayride.
</P>
<P>
   Rules will be strictly enforced: No drugs or alcohol. Those who
do not have a high school diploma must try to get one. All are
required to pay about 25 percent of their income toward rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The residents will be the staff,'' she said. ``We want them to
feel pride of ownership in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Each resident will be given a private room with shared dining
and bathroom facilities and must commit to teaching the skills they
learn to at least one new arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Other rules will be decided by the homeless themselves, who also
will help build the facilities and landscape the site.
</P>
<P>
   The farm will target the chronically homeless, the 20 percent of
the homeless population who return again and again to shelters,
using up most of the available resources. According to Housing
Assistance Corp. data, about a third of the chronically homeless
are mentally ill, two-thirds are addicted to alcohol or drugs, and
nearly 50 percent have criminal records.
</P>
<P>
   They need more than ad hoc shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said she believes the farm will offer a stable place where
they can build skills and regain self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   What's missing from current systems of caring for the homeless,
she said, ``is something that gives them a sense of belonging to a
community, a place where they feel trusted to take responsibility,
a place where they can contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   What the homeless need is a home. Davis said most shelters for
homeless individuals are nothing of the kind.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the homeless enter shelters late in the day, spend the
night in dormitory-style bunks, and early the next morning, are
told to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell them when to sleep, shower, you name it. They don't
have to do anything but be reasonably well-behaved. We don't even
let them wash their own dishes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We mean well,'' she continued, ``but we just add to their
dependence. We become wardens.''
</P>
<P>
   HUD spokeswoman Sandy Abadinsky said the project was one of 297
selected from 423 grant applications nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for innovation, creativity, good use of
resources, ability to fill local needs, and a comprehensive plan to
provide a continuum of care in the area,'' Abadinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   First priority for vacancies on the farm will be given to people
in Barnstable County. So far, community leaders have supported the
concept, and several local businesses are backing the plan and have
agreed to employ farm residents in ``learning laboratories'' to
prepare them for regular jobs.
</P>
<P>
   For Davis, who came to the United States from Denmark in 1981,
the farm provides a way to continue her family's tradition of
creative social welfare. It also revives the thinking of
African-American leader Booker T. Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In 1899, Washington toured Europe, lecturing about the
rehabilitation of former slaves. Johannes Munck, Davis's
great-grandfather, attended one of his talks and was moved.
</P>
<P>
   A prison minister, Munck was struck by similarities between
slaves, former convicts, and homeless people. All lacked
self-esteem and control over their lives. Often cut off from their
families, many had never experienced a well-functioning home.
</P>
<P>
   Munck resolved to create one in Moltrop. A farm, he believed,
would provide a therapeutic environment.
</P>
<P>
   Today Moltrop accommodates 100 men on 300 acres in Jutland,
Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   Now Livia Munck Davis eagerly awaits creation of the Cape Cod
farm, where she hopes to live, along with her husband and two
children.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Cullman, 46, a South Dennis native who has been homeless
for nearly five years, said he is excited by the prospect of living
there.
</P>
<P>
   Existing homeless shelters are too much like warehouses, he
said. ``They provide a place to get in out of the elements, that's
all. You spend so much time worrying about where you'll find a bed
the next night that you can't focus on how to improve your life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm looking forward to having a place to call home,'' said
Cullman, who has been staying in transitional housing. ``And maybe
even a sense of family. Most guys on the street have lost that.
This is a chance for a new start.''

AFTER A RED-HOT YEAR, TECHNOLOGY ECONOMY NOT DONE YET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; What do you do for an encore when you've already turned the
world upside down practically overnight?
</P>
<P>
   That is the question to be asked about the technology economy
and technology stocks as the new year dawns. You would probably
have to go back to the time of the transcontinental railroad and
the telegraph to find a parallel to the revolution the Internet
wrought in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   New companies sprang up and instantly seemed to dominate the
landscape, while older established companies wondered if time had
passed them by. Incredible new fortunes were made. Stock prices
rose to dizzying heights almost without interruption.
</P>
<P>
   Can it possibly continue?
</P>
<P>
   On the economic front, the consensus answer from a variety of
economists and money managers is yes. ``Technology is not just a
sector anymore; it's a theme for the whole country,'' says Fred
Kobrick of Kobrick Capital, a Boston money management firm.
</P>
<P>
   Kobrick is only one of many people who are convinced the new
economy is for real and that technology spending will continue to
increase at an impressive clip. Technology investment is credited
with boosting American productivity, keeping inflation in check and
prolonging the expansion that may soon become the longest in
history.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas at the beginning of 1999, one could still talk about the
Internet as if it were happening on the fringes of the business
world, by the end of the year it had moved into the mainstream. In
November, both General Motors and Ford said they were planning to
put their purchasing operations on line. Such decisions convinced
forecasters that electronic commerce could grow to a $1 trillion
business within two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   And the action won't just be taking place in America. The rest
of the world will have to make major technology investments this
year if it expects to keep pace with the United States. Much of
that spending will find its way to American technology companies,
which in many cases are world leaders in their field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outlook for technology companies is very bright,'' says
Mark Zandi, chief economist at RFA Dismal Sciences, a Pennsylvania
forecasting firm. But Zandi adds a few words of caution. He points
out that with the Y2K computer problem out of the way, some
companies may not need to spend as much on technology as they did
in 1999. He notes further that as the world economy improves,
prices for items like semiconductors and computers could firm up a
bit, which might depress spending.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The technology heavy Nasdaq kept setting records in 1999, ending
the year up 85.59 percent, outperforming the 19.53 percent rise in
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index. ``We have a bubble in technology
stock prices,'' says Zandi. ``At some point it will deflate and we
will see less capital flowing into technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Zandi is hardly the only forecaster who is willing to call the
run-up in tech stocks a bubble. Last fall, the top executives at
Red Herring, a magazine that tracks the high-tech community, came
out with a book called ``The Internet Bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   In case their point isn't obvious from the title, listen to
their conclusion. ``Our advice to Internet investors is simple: If
you hold any of these stocks, it's time to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors' logic is pretty basic. They assume that to justify
their current sky-high valuations, the average publicly traded
Internet company will have to increase its revenues at roughly an
80 percent annual pace for the next five years. That's a pretty
high hurdle, especially when you consider that companies like
Microsoft and Dell didn't grow that fast in their first five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think we have an irrational market,'' says Anthony
Perkins, one of the book's authors. ``The insiders at these
companies are shaking their heads and laughing about what is going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins suggests that if history is a guide, only a small
percentage of today's tech companies will survive. Others will be
bought out; still others will fail altogether. As that process
works itself out, ``eventually we will see more rational
valuations,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas O'Neill couldn't agree more. The chief investment officer
at FleetBoston says there has to be a day of reckoning coming for
the tech stocks. A handful of strong companies with solid
franchises may hold up, says O'Neill. And the prospects for the
rest? ``There will be some massive shakeouts,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to argue that there aren't some glaring examples of
speculative excess in the tech sector. How, for instance, does one
explain what happened to VA Linux the day it held its initial
public offering in December?
</P>
<P>
   The company makes computers that run on Linux, an operating
system that is challenging Microsoft Windows. A number of companies
already sell Linux computers. None sell very many. VA Linux had
sales of $17 million in its most recent fiscal year. It is unclear
if Linux will become a major threat to Microsoft or just an
interesting dead end.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the end of the first day of trading, VA Linux had a
market value of $10 billion. ``I think we have a Linux bubble,''
quips Anthony Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Hickman says there are now some Internet companies that
trade not on huge multiples of earnings, but huge multiples of
sales. ``Nothing should trade at 100 times sales,'' says Hickman, a
money manager with Jurika &AMP; Voyles in Oakland, Calif. ``That just
seems way out there. I would not be playing things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hickman is not universally down on the technology sector. He
points out that not all tech companies participated in the 1999
rally. Many software companies trailed the pack last year. So did
some of the service and consulting firms that didn't manage to jump
fast enough onto the e-bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   If the basic fundamentals of technology hold up, says Hickman,
2000 might be a time when some of the tech laggards get to play
catch-up.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Kobrick too is on the lookout for bargains in the
technology sector. ``Technology will become increasingly
important,'' he says. ``Therefore it behooves us to find stocks
that are not overvalued.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobrick concedes that many of the Internet companies will
disappear. So how does one figure out which ones will thrive? He
has a system he calls the ``five m's.'' The five things he looks
for are: management, model (business model), market share, mass
(critical mass) and momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Using that system, Kobrick had considerable success in 1999. His
biggest holding, Andover-based CMGI, was up more than 900 percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Joseph, who follows the technology industry for State Street
Research, remains bullish on the stocks for the long haul. But in
the near term, his crystal ball is cloudy. Expectations worry him.
At today's lofty levels, many technology stocks are already
anticipating an awful lot of good news. If earnings and growth are
merely good, but not great in 2000, will the stocks be able to hold
their ground? ``That is tough to predict,'' he ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a few things could cause a tech correction in 2000. A few
more interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve could do the trick.
So could disappointing earnings from one of the technology leaders
such as Microsoft or Cisco. Likewise, some sign that retail
Internet sales are not growing as quickly as predicted could be
disastrous for companies in that arena .
</P>
<P>
   But if 1999 taught us anything, it may be this: When it comes to
predicting the future, it pays to be humble. How many people knew
that the Internet would explode last year or that the Nasdaq index
would climb 85.59 percent, much of it in the last few months of the
year?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any illusions about our ability to project short
term moves in the market,'' says Joseph of State Street Research.
</P>
<P>
   That goes for the rest of us too.

&HT;     HOW TO DRIVE SOMEONE CRAZY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ That's theway to start the first week of the
millennium. I took Monday off to get a smog check.
</P>
<P>
   Not just to get a smog check, of course. I also had to get a
reality check after working New Year's and renewing my faith in the
human race. What a grand weekend it was, with all those Y2K buggers
proven wrong.
</P>
<P>
   That meant, though, that I had to face the Department of Motor
Vehicles, whose computers I wish had imploded. Getting a smog check
doesn't take all day, but you have to set aside a chunk of one to
get it done. Then you have to make a copy of your proof of
insurance and send it off to Sacramento with a big fat check.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, here's what they've done in Sacramento. The
Legislature passed a new law for 2000 offering a pilot program of
low-cost insurance for uninsured drivers in San Francisco and Los
Angeles. This immediately raised four questions:
</P>
<P>
   One: How have these drivers been getting registered if they
didn't have insurance before? For several years I've had to mail in
proof of insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Two: If they haven't been registered at all, why haven't they
been punished after they have accidents and the cops ask for their
registrations? The least the authorities should do is force them to
register their junkers and make them get smog checks.
</P>
<P>
   Three: Does anyone ever get hit by a driver who is insured?
</P>
<P>
   Four: Why should people who have been driving around with no
insurance suddenly be rewarded with low insurance rates?
</P>
<P>
   Not to be too selfish about it, but it would make more sense to
offer $400 insurance to a guy like me, who has never caused an
accident but has been hit several times by uninsured drivers and
lost a lot of money every time.
</P>
<P>
   There's a philosophical reason the state of California has let
drivers get away without having insurance. Requiring insurance
discriminates against the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The uninsured, though, are indiscriminate in who they hit with
their cars. Therefore they hit a lot of poor people, and the ones
with insurance lose their deductibles and get stuck with higher
rates. What kind of economic justice is that?
</P>
<P>
   I bring this all up, not because I object to poor people with
good driving records getting a break in basic insurance. They'll be
able to drive to work, and if they hit anybody, that person won't
be up the creek.
</P>
<P>
   But what makes anybody think irresponsible drivers are going to
bother filling out all the forms and spend $400 when they can keep
driving around, registered or otherwise, and save all that money?
</P>
<P>
   You can make a big purchase with 400 bucks _ like a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Now many Democrats in Sacramento (with the notable exception of
centrist Gov. Gray Davis) want to create the equivalent of a DMV
for guns, complete with registration and licensing tests _
everything cars have but muzzle-emission tests.
</P>
<P>
   What makes them think a DWV (Department of Weapons and Violence)
is going to work any better than the DMV?
</P>
<P>
   This is California and people feel they have a right to keep on
driving until someone slaps them in jail or compresses their car
into a 3-foot cube of junk.
</P>
<P>
   The people who have guns feel even stronger about their pieces
of metal. This raises four more questions.
</P>
<P>
   One: How many gun owners are voluntarily going to register their
guns and face constant re-registration and fee increases, which
will surely follow tobacco taxes into the stratosphere?
</P>
<P>
   Two: If the owner of a handgun doesn't register the weapon, how
many cops want to go bang on that person's door knowing there's a
gun on the other side?
</P>
<P>
   Three: Consider the number of unregistered and uninsured drivers
causing auto accidents. Many of the mass shootings of the last few
years were done with illegally procured guns, so what makes us
think illegal guns won't still be killing people?
</P>
<P>
   Four: What makes us think a registered gun doesn't kill or maim
too?
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the millennium, conservatives and liberals
alike are itching to solve the state's problems. Actually, they're
itching to solve one of the state's problems _ how to spend that
huge $85 billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, I don't think creating a Department of Weapons
and Violence is going to make the already declining homicide rate
decline faster.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a gun owner, do you really want to register your
weapon and every year have to go stand in a long line with a bunch
of frustrated gun nuts? Do you even want to live within a bullet's
range of a line like that?
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like guns, will it make you feel any safer if, as
one proposal has it, gun owners take competency tests in such
skills as clearing jammed weapons? Frankly, I'd prefer that those
guns stay jammed.
</P>
<P>
   If people really want to get guns off the streets, it makes more
sense to find and arrest people carrying guns on the street. That's
what some Eastern cities have done by means of skilled police work.
</P>
<P>
   In California, though, we haven't even been able to get
uninsured drivers off the streets, and they're easy to find.
</P>
<P>
   Just look for an accident, and there always seems to be one
there.
</P>

INDIVIDUALS' IMPACT ON MARKETS APT TO GROW WITH INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1990s gave rise to a new species: Homo investorus, the
individual investor.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of a century that more often than not deemed
investing too dangerous or too complex for the masses, legions of
Americans evolved into mutual fund shareholders, stockpickers, and
self-avowed market gurus.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early 1990s, there was still a sense that investing was
for other people,'' said professor Meir Statman, who studies
finance at Santa Clara University in California. ``Then people
stopped fearing stocks, stopped seeing them as a wild investment.
Now, people are comfortable with it in the same way they're
comfortable with computers.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new millennium, individual investors will be an even
greater force in the stock and other markets, as people seek more
direct control over their financial futures, both through advisers
and through self-directed money management.
</P>
<P>
   Several developments brought investing to the masses and left
individuals in charge of their own finances as never before. Mutual
funds, defined contribution retirement plans, or 401(k)s, and stock
trading on the Internet took off _ all fueled by a raging bull
market.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the common investor had wide-ranging consequences.
</P>
<P>
   It reshaped the financial services industry into a
money-spinning machine in which Main Street is now as influential
as Wall Street. It helped to create what is arguably the largest
and most prosperous middle class in history. It even bolstered the
world's dominant economic system.
</P>
<P>
   ``When more people have direct ownership in the capitalist
system, it creates greater support for it,'' said professor Samuel
Hayes, a financial historian at Harvard Business School, describing
the effects of the growth of stock ownership in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   It can be difficult to separate cause and effect when looking at
the rise of the common investor. Did investors spur the growth of
the mutual fund industry, or vice versa?
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that the fund industry took off in the '90s,
providing a cheap, easy way to own a piece of a professionally
managed portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the 1990s, barely one in four US housholds owned
mutual funds. Now, it's one in two. Propelled by a strong market
and a flood of new cash, the industry grew sixfold, to $6.2
trillion in assets. The number of funds more than doubled, to over
7,300. Including different classes of fund shares, there are now
more funds than Wall Street-listed companies.
</P>
<P>
   A strong stock market and the euphoria it spawned created an
unprecedented ease about owning equities. Many Americans, still
mindful of the Depression, avoided stocks during the bull market
years of the 1950s and early 1960s. Inflation-fearing consumers in
the 1980s preferred bond funds, but they made a critical switch to
equities in 1993 as stocks took off. Now, 85 percent of all funds
sold hold stocks exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the Internet in the second half of the 90s brought
an ease and speed to personal money management, spawning on-line
brokerages that let people take financial matters into their own
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the growth of the 401(k) retirement plan made
investors masters of their own fates. The 401(k), which requires
participants to make regular contributions and to decide themselves
where to invest, will continue gaining in popularity at the expense
of the old-fashioned fixed payout at retirement.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier era, star portfolio managers, junk-bond traders,
leveraged-buyout specialists, and corporate raiders were the faces
of modern investing. Now, in the new democracy of investors,
brokerages and mutual fund companies use ordinary mortals, not Wall
Street professionals, as pitchmen.
</P>
<P>
   On the cultural side, the rise of the common investor made
Internet stocks and initial public offerings, not domestic politics
and world affairs, the stuff of cocktail-party chatter. It spawned
scores of financial services publications, news programs, and
Internet chat rooms. And it altered the look of newspapers, many of
which now devote entire sections to personal finance.
</P>
<P>
   But if the good times end and the stock market goes south, Homo
investorus may find life a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad thing is that people think they've figured it all
out,'' Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a giddiness and overconfidence on the part of many
individuals that before was confined to the professionals. The
disturbing thing is that this is kind of what happened in the
1920s, when every shoeshine boy had a stock tip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real test will be when we see a serious stock market
fall.''

CANDIDATES HAVE SHUNNED NASTINESS _ VOTERS SHOULD TAKE A BOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Inside three weeks to Iowa's caucus and four to New Hampshire's
crucial verdict, the biggest surprise in the most important month
of campaigning is the virtual absence of campaign nastiness.
</P>
<P>
   There has been none of what the Brits call ``a slanging match,''
when opponents castigate each other and the ears of onlookers with
intemperate, vitriolic, insulting language. What explains this
outbreak of etiquette?
</P>
<P>
   The voters have signaled through polling, focus groups,
interviews, and the ``feel'' veteran campaigners accumulate on the
ground that they won't put up with the ``politics of personal
destruction'' visited upon us by the Washington establishment in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   This is reform from the bottom up. It's my ``lava theory'' in
action: The real shifts in political behavior occur when a seismic
shift in the electorate dictates changes to the politicians who
would rule us. The voters, at least in New Hampshire, put out the
word they wanted a higher-toned debate than the pond-scum that
surfaced from the wrangling of the Clinton impeachment trial and
the bitterly divided and dysfunctional Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He who goes negative in New Hampshire can expect an avalanche of
criticism from the media, the academics, the spin-artists of other
campaigns, but most tellingly from voters. And in the lopsidedly
front-loaded primary schedule, where 12 states apportion a Mother
Lode of delegates on March 12, there is much less time to recover
from the damage a self-inflicted negative attack can have on an
imperiled candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the TV advertising buys keyed to New Hampshire by the
five candidates with money. To this point, the money is going for
uplifting stuff, minibiographicals, and issues plug-ins. There may
be an 11th-hour eruption of negative campaigning. But the
difference between this campaign and the last one is this: The fear
of going negative is greater than the temptation to take a rival
down a peg. Everyone suspects the Steve Forbes campaign of being
the one most likely to hurl mud. He did it last time. Forbes's
fourth-quarter torrent of negative TV spots four years ago targeted
the hapless Bob Dole and the surging Lamar Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   But as so often happens with negative ads, the flurry damages
not only the target(s) but the tosser. The beneficiary in 1996 was
Pat Buchanan, a man to whom negative campaigning is normally meat
and drink. But Pat had no money to do negative TV on his own, and
he was riding a populist wave. This year, he is a marginalized
figure, not even a factor in New Hampshire as he wrestles for the
levers of the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   The big spenders on TV-for-New Hampshire, which includes outlays
on Boston stations that beam north but don't get counted against
the Granite State spending cap, are Bill Bradley and George W.
Bush. Bradley's surprisingly well-heeled campaign bought $1.6
million worth for just the six weeks ending Dec. 20, in a Globe
survey, while Bush shelled out nearly $1.2 million in the same time
frame. Vice President Gore's cash-strapped effort was outspent,
2-1, by Bradley in the same six weeks, as was Senator John McCain
by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, surprisingly, bought zero Boston tube time for the
period, and spent less than a quarter-million on Manchester
outlets, which leads some to suspect that he is going to spend a
blockbuster amount late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation to go negative tends to be overwhelming in the
late stages of a closely fought campaign. Who can forget Bob Dole
snarling to Tom Brokaw the night George Bush edged him in New
Hampshire '88. ``Tell him (Bush) to stop lying about my record.''
That year, Dole's victory in the Iowa caucuses gave him the lead in
New Hampshire, till then-Governor John Sununu blackjacked WMUR-TV
into taking a last-weekend TV spot castigating Dole, and that
shifted the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Those who remember Bush Sr.'s spots against Michael Dukakis in
'88, the Willie Horton ad and other low blows, take with a grain of
salt the claims of the current Bush campaign that they will refrain
from below-the-belt tactics.
</P>
<P>
   But the dynamics of New Hampshire this time seem to militate
against last-minute fang-and-claw attacks. Both races are close,
possibly within the margin of polling error. The New Hampshire poll
numbers for mid-to-late December had both races within 3 percentage
points, with McCain leading Bush, 36-33, and Bradley edging Gore,
42-39.
</P>
<P>
   Given those virtual dead heats, an over-eager candidate or
campaign handler could spill the wind out of his own man's sails by
a hasty lunge for the gutter. As a result, we get these stilted
debate performances, with everyone afraid to make the big gaffe. We
get Alphonse-Gastone routines from Bush and McCain, whose
compliments to each other are a daily staple of life on the trail.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley are more pointed in their criticisms of each
other, and the pair have flogged each other's health care policies.
But we have yet to come anywhere near the ``why, you dirty rat''
fare of other years.
</P>
<P>
   Keep your fingers crossed that this Mr. Nice Guy stuff lasts.

ESCAPING TO OGUNQUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the end of this century of yak-yak, dare we scream for
silence, for solitude, for an escape from the electronic prison?
Pagers, cell phones, faxes, voice mail, alarm clocks. Midnight
malfunctions of store, home and car security systems. Home
theaters, Walkmans, and boom boxes. E-mail, e-trade,
PokeEEEEK!!!mon. VCR, CD, DVD, HDTV, AOL. Let's go AWOL.
</P>
<P>
   This is a perfect time to find a Harlequin duck.
</P>
<P>
   My 9-year-old son Tano and I decided to do a little walk last
week on a coastal path in Ogunquit, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   This area is known as a wintering spot for the harlequin, so
named for its clownish combination of slate blue, black, rusty
orange, and wild splashes of white stripes and spots on the male.
Nature's graffiti on the harlequin gives it the ``unlikely look of
a whimsical porcelain bird,'' in the Reader's Digest Book of North
American Birds.
</P>
<P>
   There was not a cloud in the sky. There was almost no wind. The
view to the horizon over the calm waters seemed endless, broken
only by the occasional lobster boat. It was almost too
</P>
<P>
   calm. As we got out of the car and looked down at the cove, we
saw few ducks at first.
</P>
<P>
   Then we walked up over a rise that led to the most exposed jut
of the rocky cove. It was the only place on this serene day where
surf slapped at the rocks. Down there were 20 or so harlequins.
While here was I, seeking peace, here were the harlequins, bobbing
their heads as they reveled in the chop.
</P>
<P>
   Tano marveled and laughed at the frenetic swimming in circles of
the ducks. He then went rock hopping, leaving me alone on a bench
to watch. Human beings have just spent a great deal of energy and
money over celebrating the new millennium. For free, I could
witness millions of years of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   This darting in and around the crashing waves is just their
warmup exercise for the spring when they become the salmon of
ducks. The harlequin is the only North American duck that comes in
from the sea to lay her eggs along the banks of fast moving, even
raging streams and rivers.
</P>
<P>
   To get to their nesting spots, they have to swim and walk
against the current, diving for insects, small fish, and
crustaceans along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Humans talk a lot about stress, but after thinking about how
harlequins spend their whole lives being tossed about and battered
by winter's waves and fighting against the spring torrents, you do
not feel so bad. Harlequins cannot take a timeout for fireworks,
champagne, most important people lists, panicking over Y2K bugs,
and running out for power generators and bottled water. They had to
fly on New Year's Eve no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, the harlequin did not need us to feel sorry for
the daily pummeling it gets from nature. But how long it will fly
in the next 1,000 years is unfortunately up to us. In a calendar
switch where we have made so many artificial lists, the harlequin
is the perfect bird for the millennium because its population in
eastern North America is about 1,000 birds.
</P>
<P>
   The US Fish and Wildlife Service declined to propose the eastern
population of the harlequin for the endangered list a year and a
half ago saying it thought the population was stable. But because
of the constant possibility of a population crash due to spills off
oil and chemical tankers, it is listed as endangered in Canada and
threatened in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the 1,000 birds winter in Maine. The harlequin was
one of the birds most severely affected by the Exxon Valdez oil
spill in 1989. Five years after the spill the birds were still not
producing any young in the polluted areas.

   The western North American population has been much more
numerous, but last summer, federal scientists warn that harlequins
and other sea ducks such as scoters, eiders, scaup, goldeneyes, and
oldsquaws have suffered severe declines. Each duck has his own
particular reason. Scoters along the coast of urbanized California
may be crippled by the toxins concentrated in the mussels and clams
they eat. Eiders may be getting poisoned from lead shot left over
in lakes from hunting.
</P>
<P>
   As regards the harlequin, biologist Dan Rosenberg of the Alaska
Department of Fish and Game, said, ``The biggest problem in the
West is increased development and recreational activity on streams.
Vacation homes are going up on many remote rivers and fishing and
rafting pressure has increased tremendously. Harlequins are shy,
reclusive birds, and they're easily disturbed by human activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that they are so easily disturbed is a reminder that
the next millennium is about much more than technology and our
pleasures. I still remember staring in 1965 at a model of the solar
system put up by my fifth-grade teacher.
</P>
<P>
   I wondered where I would be by the year 2000. Mars? Touring past
the Great Red Spot? A $398 round-trip fare through the rings of
Saturn?
</P>
<P>
   Now, I am reduced to more simple questions. I wonder what Tano
will find when he brings his children to this cove 30 or 40 years
from now. A thousand years from now, will those 1,000 harlequin
ducks still be here?

MAGAZINE RANKS TOP 10 PREACHERS OF THE CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Rev. Billy Graham were
ranked among the Top 10 greatest preachers of the 20th century,
according to a list compiled by Preaching Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 ranking was given to the late James S. Stewart who
served for two years as moderator of the General Assembly of the
Church of Scotland and was a professor of New Testament studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``His books such as `Heralds of God'. . . and `A Faith to
Proclaim' . . . have inspired tens of thousands of preachers to
strive for greater effectiveness in their proclamation of God's
word,'' wrote Michael Duduit, editor of Preaching, bimonthly
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the Top Ten were: evangelist Graham; the late
George Buttrick, an English-born preacher who served for nearly 30
years as pastor of Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church in New York;
King, the late civil rights leader; and the late Harry Emerson
Fosdick, who was pastor of New York's Riverside Church.
</P>
<P>
   Also making the list were: the late G. Campbell Morgan, an
English-born minister who influenced evangelical preaching; the
late Edwin Sangster, an evangelical Methodist minister who led the
largest Sunday-evening congregation in London during World War II;
John R.W. Scott, the rector emeritus of All Souls Church in London
and director of London's Institute for Contemporary Christianity;
the late D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones, who was pastor of Westminster
Chapel in London from 1943 to 1968; and the late Clarence
Macartney, who was pastor of First Presbyterian Church of
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Duduit said the preachers were chosen as ``great'' based on
their influence on other preachers as well as on church and
society.
</P>

RELIGION NOTES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --The Vatican is stepping up plans for Pope John Paul II's visit
to the Holy Land in March with two papal aides working with
Jordanian officials on what would be the first leg of John Paul's
pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican is expected to announce the exact dates about a
month in advance despite controversies and difficulties that have
left visits to holy sites in Greece, Iraq, and Israel up in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Jordanian government, the pope would start his
trip in Amman where he would visit Mount Nebo, from which the Bible
says Moses saw the Promised Land before his death at the age of
120.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, authorities have told the Vatican they cannot
adequately organize a papal visit to Ur of the Chaldees, the
reputed birthplace of the Prophet Abraham, because of ``abnormal
conditions'' caused by a UN embargo.
</P>
<P>
   In Greece, the Greek Orthodox Church has said the pope is
unwelcome to commemorate St. Paul's sermon on the Areopagus in
Athens because of the Roman Catholic Church's conduct through the
centuries toward the Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   And in Israel, the Vatican and the government are feuding over
plans to build a mosque next to the Basilica of the Annunciation in
Nazareth. John Paul wants to visit Nazareth on March 25, the Feast
of the Annunication that commemorates the angel Gabriel's
appearance to Mary to tell her she would conceive a son.

GURUS NEAR AND FAR OFFER VIEWS FOR FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANCIE LATOUR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So. It's here. The future. You know, that thing that never
seemed like it was ever going to arrive. The thing that was
happening all along as we whipped ourselves into grander and
grander retrospectives of the decade, the century, the millennium
past.
</P>
<P>
   After obsessively watching and waiting for days to turn to hours
to grind down to minutes to get to the seconds that tick, ticked us
into a new century, the future seems undeniably here in a way it
never seemed before. Maybe it's that total-nothingness concept, the
empty space in the circle, or the circles themselves, but there's
something about these twin digits _ 00 _ that spell what is
supposed to be, not what is.
</P>
<P>
   This month, several January issues attempt to get us into the
empty space, offering glimpses of how the future, now an unfurling
present, will feel.
</P>
<P>
   A magazine as aptly named as any to take on the challenge,
Civilization this month zeroes in on Buddhism and its expansion
westward in a special section that includes an interview with the
rust-robed, bifocaled one himself, His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama
of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   With his new book, ``Ethics for a New Millennium,'' eclipsing
its Bill-Gates competitor as a best-selling business book _ not to
mention those larger-than-life, Think-Different iMac billboards
featuring his shaven head full as a yellow moon _ the Holy One
seems the perfect symbol of the dawning of a new time, one where
digital advancement, dollar dominance, and divine enlightenment
might all somehow cohere, not collide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can transform our society. And not only our society, but
also the whole of humanity,'' the monk of monks tells author and
student of Buddhism Robert Thurman. Speaking about the mythic bliss
of Tibetan society glorified by the likes of Richard Gere and rock
stars, the Dalai Lama says, ``When you are happy, you don't feel
anything special about it. But when you get sick, then you feel,
`Oh, in the past, my good health was such happiness!' Then you
appreciate the happiness of feeling good.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely.
</P>
<P>
   Why Buddhism? Why now? And why in America? Author Jan Nattier
poses all three questions to explain how, by conservative
estimates, the number of Buddhists in America has jumped tenfold in
just 40 years, from 200,000 to between 2 to 3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Nattier admits, there are Buddhists and then there are
Buddhists: Do we really think Courtney Love and Madonna fall into
the radical-transformation-of-self category _ or is it more like
the night-stand Buddhist sympathizer category? Still, in an age
where road maps _ not rote doctrines _ define everything from
search engines to self-navigating cars, Buddhism offered the
original road map, a map for profound personal change.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Nattier leaves some questions unanswered. Such as,
will Buddhism follow the course of almost every other world
religion? Will Western followers become disillusioned by Buddhism's
rigid hierarchy or the second-class status it imposes on women? For
those answers, you'll have to wait. That's the future. It's not
here yet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you can get past the black-leather-motorcycle-machismo cover
of February's Cigar Aficionado, you'll find Faith Popcorn
meditating meaningfully on the future question. Founder of the New
York-based marketing consulting firm BrainReserve, Popcorn has made
a business of knowing not only what the future will look like, but
when a consumer society is ready to hear what it is about to
become. ``The great thing about the future,'' she says, ``is that
it always comes. The tough thing about the future is that no matter
how exciting it is, we don't always feel we're ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The untold story behind the Y2K drama, Popcorn says, is that it
was all a subconscious, Freudian wish. That is to say, we're all so
terrified of the future that part of us wanted the world to grind
to a halt. Like the Dalai Lama, she argues that amid the blurred
boundaries of nations, cultures, distance, and even time, people
are desperately searching for some kind of anchor. To that end, she
offers some commandments of her own for a new age: ``Thou shalt
decrease your reliance on work as your prime identity. Thou shalt
treat ethical issues ethically. Thou shalt leave no one out. Thou
shalt not fear a mind finer than your own.'' And, perhaps most
important, thou shalt not fight evolution. That's the future.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you must have your dose of the future a la Jetsons,
Cigar veers into adventures in the high-tech smart home. Which, by
the way, is also here now, specifically at Rich Harvest Farms
outside Chicago, Ill. There writer Daren Fonda finds sprawling
estates that give new meaning to what famed French architect Le
Corbusier called ``a machine for living in.''
</P>
<P>
   Through wall-mounted touch screens linked by a maze of
high-grade sensors, the home of the future-present thinks for its
dwellers, heating a bath and drawing the blinds when you're ready
for bed. When it's time to walk the dog, a pet-friendly icon
deactivates a back-door alarm and shines a path to the kennel. All
brought to you by the TronArch network, and for the mere price of
$350,000 to $4 million in installation costs for your $10 million
to $30 million home.
</P>
<P>
   This ain't the Jetsons, folks. The home with a brain is now and
here. It's the future.

SOME UNSCIENTIFIC ADVICE FOR THE CANDIDATES

  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's Campaign
Countdown commentary column.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 By LAURA INGRAHAM  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    VIRGIN GORDA, British Virgin Islands
 &HT;    Here, where the rich and famous came to play far from millennium
mania, American presidential politics really isn't enough to keep a
dinner conversation going.
 &HT;    People would rather talk about the new restaurant on the other
side of the island, the scuba diving or the SPF of their suntan
lotions. When the discussion does turn substantive, it usually
centers on something really interesting, such as when someone's
stock options vest.
 &HT;    But not being one of the rich and famous _ merely a lucky guest
of a delightful couple who are _ I persisted in injecting politics
into an otherwise enjoyable vacation.
 &HT;    As stale cigar smoke and the smell of old champagne filled the
air, I decided to conduct my own little focus group. I asked some
of the jet-set Americans vacationing here, along with some of the
folks who make their holidays luxurious, what New Year's
resolutions various political figures should make.
 &HT;    My informal survey included a 33-year-old New Economy
billionaire, a few former models, a yacht crewman, a cleaning lady,
an investment banker, an Arab-American businessman who smokes six
cigars a day and, of course, myself. Here's the collective wisdom.
 &HT;    Note: All offensive or mean-spirited comments are to be
attributed to overexposure to the sun and/or the lingering effects
of millennial bacchanalia. 
 -0- 
 &HT;    + AL GORE.
 &HT;    Billionaire: ``He should take out a want ad. `MWM, 6'1'',
reasonably athletic, well-educated. Seeks personality.'''
 &HT;    Columnist: ``He should refuse all campaign-fundraising efforts
by the president and stick to less tainted sources, like the
Chinese and impoverished Buddhist monks.''
 &HT;    + GEORGE W. BUSH.
 &HT;    Investment banker: ``He should learn how to pronounce the word
`nuclear,' or ask for a refund of his Yale tuition money.''
 &HT;    Columnist: ``He should ask to buy a vowel the next time some
smart-aleck journalist asks him a question most prominent
historians wouldn't know.'' 
 &HT;    + BILL BRADLEY.
 &HT;    Yacht crewman: ``He should invest in a nautical compass and
locate his chin.''
 &HT;    Investment banker: ``He should do to Al Gore what he did for his
entire NBA career _ throw a few elbows.'' 
 &HT;    + JOHN McCAIN.
 &HT;    Former model: ``He should license his image to be used in a new
line of GI Joe dolls, and donate the proceeds to public financing
of presidential campaigns.''
 &HT;    Cleaning lady: ``Oh, I don't know _ but he's the one who was the
soldier prisoner, right? Him, I think I like!'' 
 &HT;    + STEVE FORBES.
 &HT;    Billionaire: ``He should resolve to stop wasting time with
politics and concentrate on making some real money.''
 &HT;    Columnist: ``Steve should pour the millions of dollars he's
spending on his presidential campaign down a rat-hole, which would
at least feed the rats _ more than he's accomplishing on the
campaign trail.'' 
 &HT;    + GARY BAUER.
 &HT;    Businessman: ``He should go at least three minutes during major
television appearances without claiming to be `the only real
political heir to Ronald Reagan.''' 
 &HT;    + ALAN KEYES.
 &HT;    Businessman, by now half-drunk: ``Alan Keyes? Do you mean of the
`Star-Spangled Banner' Keys family?'' 
 &HT;    + ORRIN HATCH.
 &HT;    Investment banker: ``Orrin Hatch should try to jumpstart his
campaign by releasing a music video called `Mormons Just Want to
Have Fun.'''
 &HT;    As you can see, my holiday focus group was pretty cynical about
politicians. Most knew practically nothing about Bauer, Keyes or
Hatch _ so much for those riveting pre-primary debates.
 &HT;    Reactions tended to be more visceral, a la ``he seems really
weird,'' than substantive. But just when I thought that our age of
irrational financial exuberance had evaporated any sense of civic
responsibility, this eclectic group surprised me.
 &HT;    The kid billionaire talked about plans he has to remove the two
biggest barriers to a quality education today _ money and
geography. He sees a new century of Internet universities and high
schools which will give parents and kids who want to learn a chance
to bypass failing public schools.
 &HT;    The former models have entered the entrepreneurial world,
starting their own production company, but they still find time to
organize an annual Washington charity event to fight domestic
abuse.
 &HT;    The cleaning lady is a Honduran native who had recently gotten
her green card, and was ecstatic to be working and traveling the
world on a yacht.
 &HT;    The boathand recently graduated from a college in Kentucky, is
saving up for a trip around Europe and was as thoroughly optimistic
about the world as you'd hope a 24-year-old would be.
 &HT;    The investment banker thinks some new political figure is going
to emerge to reinvigorate our interest and faith in government. His
personal New Year's resolution wasn't to sock more away in his
portfolio _ it was to be a better dad and spend more time with his
two kids.
 &HT;    Wouldn't it be great if America had a president who made a
resolution like that, and if we actually believed him?
 &HT;    Happy New Year!

   MEXICO-HOUSE (Undated) _ During our fourth year of spending time
in the Mexican mountain town of San Miguel de Allende, I and my
wife, the artist and photographer Masako Takahashi, were taken to
see a derelict house with an interior courtyard, a stable and a
small attached house. Ravished by the possibilities, but daunted by
the house's condition and its price ($65,000), we nonetheless took
the plunge. With time, we came to understand that this house in
fact completed us as much as we completed it. By Tony Cohan.

   NY-LANDFILL (New York) _ Dr. Steven Handel stood on top of a
mountain of garbage, 150 feet above Richmond Creek, and imagined
woodlands and meadows rambling over the Fresh Kills landfill in
Staten Island. ``This is the biggest landfill in the world,'' said
Handel, a plant ecologist based at Rutgers University in New
Brunswick, N.J. ``But you have to have vision. Imagine this as a
developing oak forest. Or a stand of red cedars, or a wildflower
meadow. With 3,000 acres, we could bring back some plants which are
locally uncommon.'' By Anne Raver.

   LONDON-FERRIS-WHEEL (London) _ They had promised their children
a New Year's Eve ride on the British Airways London Eye, the
455-foot Ferris wheel that stands over the Thames across from Big
Ben. Instead, David Marks and Julia Barfield, the husband-and-wife
architects who designed the structure, had to entertain their
family on the ground. The children _ plus several hundred guests of
British Airways _ were unable to ride after the attraction failed
an 11th-hour inspection. For Ms. Barfield and Marks, who went into
debt to get the $40 million dollar wheel built, the failure of a
clutch mechanism in one of its 32 passenger compartments was only
the latest indignity. By Fred A. Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K-HOARD (Undated) _ Two times during the 19th Century, the
Millerites predicted that the world would end. The first error was
attributed to a little miscalculation. Before the second date _
Oct. 22, 1844 _ followers eagerly packed up their homes, sold all
their possessions, and prayed. Once again, the Apocalypse failed to
arrive and this time the (penniless) followers insisted that their
prayers had kept it at bay. More modest versions of this scenario
appear to be taking place now in homes across the country: while
the Y2K crisis never materialized, the most dedicated hoarders are
holding on to their 200 cans of tuna fish, 100 freeze dried MREs,
and 55-gallon water tanks as tightly as their convictions. By Lynn
Ermann.

&HT;     LAWMAKER CALLS FOR ACTION ON DRUG-RELATED ABSCESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RACHEL GORDON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Supervisor Gavin Newsom has called for City Hall
to intensify its efforts to combat the costly epidemic of skin
abscesses plaguing addicts who inject drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The drug-related skin infections have placed a tremendous burden
on emergency rooms and filled hospital beds. The cost to San
Francisco General Hospital, which handles most of the drug addicts'
abscess cases in the city, is estimated at $20 million to $40
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   And since most of the victims are uninsured, city taxpayers pay
most of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This requires attention by the Board of Supervisors,'' said
Newsom, referring to the city's governing body. ``The cost alone
should scare us.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug users who shoot up in their muscles or under their skin
because their veins are scarred from overuse are particularly
vulnerable to abscesses, which can form at the point of injection.
</P>
<P>
   The bacterial infections, if allowed to fester, can eat away at
a person's skin, bone, muscle and tissue. It is not uncommon to
treat the most severe cases with amputation.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in San Francisco say they are seeing more such
infections than ever before, especially among heroin users. Public
health officials are calling for more aggressive measures to battle
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials are looking at expanding programs to provide
on-site medical care for drug users at the places they gather, such
as needle-exchange sites, to provide treatment early on before the
infections get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Newsom also is pushing for expanding methadone treatment to help
get people off heroin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there has to be a greater emphasis on prevention
efforts because the costs are astronomical,'' he said.

architects who designed the structure, had to entertain their
family on the ground. The children _ plus several hundred guests of
British Airways _ were unable to ride after the attraction failed
an 11th-hour inspection. For Ms. Barfield and Marks, who went into
debt to get the $40 million dollar wheel built, the failure of a

their possessions, and prayed. Once again, the Apocalypse failed to
arrive and this time the (penniless) followers insisted that their
prayers had kept it at bay. More modest versions of this scenario
appear to be taking place now in homes across the country: while
the Y2K crisis never materialized, the most dedicated hoarders are
holding on to their 200 cans of tuna fish, 100 freeze dried MREs,
and 55-gallon water tanks as tightly as their convictions. By Lynn

&HT;     HIGH AND DRY TIMES IN THE SIERRA NEVADA HAVE FARMERS WORRIED 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC BRAZIL  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The blanket of snow on the Sierra Nevada is less
than a quarter of its normal depth at this time of year, causing
consternation among farmers who rely on the melting snow to
irrigate fields in some of California's most fertile areas.
</P>
<P>
   Near the 7,000-foot level at Echo Summit, the snow's water
content ranged from a piddling 1.7 inches to 4.1 inches Tuesday,
compared to a 35-year average of 12 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Water Resources' first snow survey of the year
found ``not a whole lot of snow,'' said survey chief Frank Gherke.
Actual depths ranged between 5 and 16.8 inches in the five areas
measured.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're looking at is that this year is in the bottom 25
percent of water content for this survey,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Sierra Nevada snowpack is 22 percent of normal.
</P>
<P>
   But Gherke cautioned that it was too early to jump to
conclusions, because ``the rest of the year can go either way.'' In
five of the nine worst January snow water-content years _ most
recently 1996 _ the snowpack wound up above average, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Runoff from the Sierra Nevada snowpack fills the Central Valley
and state water projects, providing drinking water and irrigating
fields during the dry summer months.
</P>
<P>
   None of the state's major water districts has yet sent out a
distress call, but the farmers are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Pumping restrictions in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta are
artificially restricting supplies, agricultural contractors say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen it as bad as it is now _ the anger and fear
and uncertainty,'' said Jason Peltier, manager of the Central
Valley Project Water Users Association. ``They're pretty
desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's major reservoirs are actually storing average or
above average amounts of water. The Central Valley Project's Shasta
Dam currently holds 123 percent of the long-term average. But
``we're not getting in what we're letting out,'' said U.S. Bureau
of Reclamation spokesman Jeff McCracken.
</P>
<P>
   Central Valley Project water contractors south of the San
Joaquin Delta were told in December to expect just 45 percent of
the amounts they have contracted for. Now, McCracken said, ``45
percent is more than we're probably going to forecast'' later this
month. ``It ain't pretty. The forecast calls for pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Pumping restrictions imposed last spring to protect the
endangered Delta smelt throttled down the state and federal pumps
that convey water southward.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the San Luis Reservoir, a state and federal
off-stream storage facility in Merced County, is only half full,
said John Coburn, spokesman for the State Water Contractors
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers believe that in addition to finicky operation of its
Delta pumps, the Bureau of Reclamation is being overly generous in
allocating a full supply of water to the state's wildlife refuges
and for increased flows to protect fisheries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can get to 70 percent (of contracted amounts),''
Peltier said. ``We're trying to persuade the bureau to exercise
discretion so that the water supply can be improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Orth, spokesman for the 550,000-acre Westlands Water
District, is more pessimistic. ``There's no regulatory relief in
sight,'' he said. ``I would hope that the administration sees fit
to rethink its re-use of 800,000 acre-feet (for fish) and its
refuge supply policies to get a little more out of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   While Monterey and Santa Cruz counties already are exhorting
people to conserve water and hinting that some rationing may be
imposed if the rest of the year is dry, conditions elsewhere are
much less dire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing pretty good,'' said Joanne Wilfert, a water
analyst for the Hetch Hetchy system, which taps the Tuolumne River
watershed to provide drinking water for 2.3 million people in the
San Francisco Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which is
by far the state's biggest domestic water supplier, is also ``in
pretty good shape,'' operations manager Jill Wick said. ``We're
concerned by the fact that there hasn't been any rain, but not
overly concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Water District already has begun filling its
East Side reservoir in Riverside County with a blend of State Water
Project and Colorado River water, Wick said.

   WASHINGTON _ U.S. President Bill Clinton on Tuesday nominated
Alan Greenspan to serve a fourth term as chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board, saying that his leadership had ``inspired confidence
not only here in America but all around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The move signaled continuity on the path of strong and steady
economic growth and also helped remove the Fed chairmanship from
the political arena in a presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in making the White House announcement, thanked
Greenspan for agreeing to continue serving while ``at a pinnacle of
success.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman, a still-vigorous 73-year-old, has served in the
post since his appointment by President Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   When Greenspan was appointed in August 1987, one cartoonist
portrayed him as a midget dwarfed by the big shoes of his
predecessor, Paul Volcker.
</P>
<P>
   He since has emerged as a widely respected steward of the
remarkable economic growth, blessed by low inflation and low
interest rates, that has accompanied most of the Clinton
administration, bringing the United States its longest peacetime
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed chairman enjoys broad support among both politicians and
investors after helping calm markets during the U.S. savings and
loan crisis of the late-1980s, the collapse of the Mexican peso in
1994-95 and the Asian currency crisis that began in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He has managed that, analysts say, amid the dramatic
transformations that have marked his tenure, from the end of
Soviet-bloc Communism to the advent of Internet-based commerce and
the astonishing high-tech growth that has created millionaires by
the thousand.
</P>
<P>
   The economy has performed in ways once thought impossible.
During 1999, it grew at a rate of about 5 percent, which economists
once figured would lead to increases in wages and prices.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, whose re-election in 1996 owed much to the strong
economy, had made no secret of his plan to renominate Greenspan, a
Republican. ``I have enjoyed a very good relationship, both
personally and professionally, with Mr. Greenspan,'' he said last
year. ``I think he has done a terrific job.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan took office two months before the stock-market
collapse of October 1987, and in 1990 and 1991, the country endured
a nine-month recession.
</P>
<P>
   But for the past nine years, the economy has continued to
expand, and next month the expansion is set to become the longest
on record, eight years and 11 months. Greenspan has been credited
as the steady hand who has helped keep the economy on track.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's four-year term expires in June, but with solid
support in Congress, he is expected to face easy confirmation by
the Senate. The White House contacted leading legislators Tuesday
to announce the renomination.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement in any case should remove Greenspan as a
possible issue in the presidential campaign this year. Governor
George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican front-runner, last year
urged Clinton to announce his intentions regarding Greenspan early
in order to remove the uncertainty as an issue in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Had Greenspan not been renominated, there was speculation that
former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin or his successor, Lawrence
Summers, might have been considered to head the body sometimes
called the ``fourth branch of government,'' in addition to the
legislative, executive and judicial arms.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in making the announcement, thanked Greenspan, saying
that the Fed had made ``probably wise judgments about our monetary
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised the chairman for ``a rare combination of
technical expertise, sophisticated analysis and old-fashioned
common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His wise and steady leadership has inspired confidence not
only here in America but all around the world,'' he said. &QL;

   GREENWICH, CONN. _ Drive by the Fisher home in the southern
Connecticut town of Darien and you will be in for a big surprise.
</P>
<P>
   While all around there is brown and muddy green _ the evidence
of a balmy winter in these parts that has yet to yield a snowflake
_ the Fisher garden is a sparkling white. And there are children on
toboggans.
</P>
<P>
   What, you might reasonably ask, is going on? I have heard of
localized weather phenomena. I have seen a tornado path where just
a few yards separate total destruction from zero damage. I've seen
rain squalls dousing single blocks in the city. But a one-house
blizzard in suburbia? I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   But I am being naive. These are prosperous times and most things
are possible if you are willing to pay for them. Even snow.
</P>
<P>
   The Fishers decided that white stuff was required for the
perfect Christmas and to realize their dream they had to go no
further than a local Darien outfit called ``Snowman Services.''
</P>
<P>
   Snowman, started by Jonathan Sweeney as an offshoot of his
landscaping business, has been making snow to order for a couple of
years.
</P>
<P>
   Customers who figure that waiting for Mother Nature to oblige is
a fool's game range from families like the Fishers to local
businesses demanding drifts for parties.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum charge for a few inches is $750, although a good
dumping can cost a whole lot more.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney uses technology developed by snow-hungry ski resorts.
All that is required is lots of water and sufficiently cold
temperatures _ below freezing, in fact. Force the water through the
snowmaking canons and _ hey presto _ you have the perfect winter
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   This Christmas was a bonanza for Sweeney. High pressure over
eastern Canada in the last days of December ensured frigid nights
and no chance of any natural snowfall.
</P>
<P>
   He reports that one local man offered $5,000 for a good few feet
of snow _ on condition his house was the only one on the block to
get it.
</P>
<P>
   At the Fisher's, meanwhile, the fun is still not over. In spite
of record warmth since the New Year, with temperatures in the
mid-teens, the snow has hardly melted at all.
</P>
<P>
   Four-year-old Jack and his cousin, Ravi Banerjee, are still
tobogganing every day. From a seven-foot drift near the house, the
boys can race the length of the garden all the way down to a frozen
pond at the far end.
</P>
<P>
   Ravi, 14, is impressed. One would hope so. ``I thought it was
pretty cool,'' he says, remembering when he got the phone call from
his cousin's on Christmas Day urging him to come over. But he is
thinking about next Christmas now. ``I am hoping for a half-pipe,''
he says. He has the snowboard already. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's acting president, Vladimir Putin, appears to
be contemplating bringing forward elections that could confirm him
in his post, thus giving the weakened opposition even less of a
chance to challenge him for the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said his tactics were unfair and some analysts thought
developments in Russia were beginning to look less like a
democratic transition than a creeping coup.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that went largely unnoticed as Russians continued to
celebrate their New Year holiday, Putin met Marat Baglai, head of
the constitutional court, on Monday to seek advice about the
election provisions of the basic law.
</P>
<P>
   The constitution says that if the president retires early, as
Boris Yeltsin did on New Year's Eve, then fresh elections must be
held within three months.
</P>
<P>
   The election has been tentatively set for March 26 but Baglai
said that Putin might ask the regional governors in the Federation
Council or Upper House to bring it forward.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, with the promoted prime minister in the most
advantageous position and enjoying huge popularity because of the
war in Chechnya, Russia's other politicians are severely
handicapped in the race for the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   If the elections are brought forward, Gennady Zyuganov, Yevgeny
Primakov, Grigory Yavlinsky and any other hopefuls will have even
less time to prepare their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are considering strategy and refraining from comment
but the former Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, for one, has said
that in such conditions, Russia's presidential elections cannot
possibly be fair.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than a democratic choice, they will be nothing more than
a plebiscite to confirm Putin, 47, a former KGB agent based in East
Germany, in the second most powerful job in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium celebrations distracted the world's attention
from Yeltsin's retirement. Amid the fireworks and parties, the
sensational news was reported but little analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   What actually happened on Dec. 31 when Yeltsin asked Russians to
forgive him for failing to fulfill their dreams and announced that
he was handing over to the younger generation?
</P>
<P>
   Few Russians believe the official version according to which
Yeltsin made his decision on impulse the day before he went on
national television to say farewell to his people.
</P>
<P>
   One of Putin's first acts after he moved into the presidential
office was to sign a decree, guaranteeing Yeltsin, 68, immunity
from prosecution and state privileges for life.
</P>
<P>
   This strengthened the case of conspiracy theorists who argued
that since August, when Yeltsin and his daughters were personally
implicated in corruption scandals, the aging president, or his
entourage, had been plotting to promote an heir they could trust.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is that, rather than Yeltsin having pulled
off a trick with a ``Trojan horse,'' the successors to the KGB have
carried out a silent coup, getting rid of the old man who had
become a liability.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before Yeltsin announced his early retirement, Putin
visited him at his country residence, Gorky-9, and may have made
him an ``offer he could not refuse.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Putin sacked Yeltsin's daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko,
who had exercised considerable influence in the role of
``presidential image maker.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, when he was still prime minister, Putin, who
has never held an elected post, attended a celebration of security
service officers and told them: ``You now have your agent working
under cover in the government.'' Many a true word is spoken in
jest.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a bronze plaque embossed with the face of the late
KGB chairman, Yuri Andropov, taken down during the period of
reforms, has gone up again near the Lubyanka.
</P>
<P>
   Admirers of Putin note that he espouses the same values of
austerity and discipline as Andropov, who briefly ruled the Kremlin
after the death of Leonid Brezhnev.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent congress of the artificially created Unity or
``Bear'' party, which came from nowhere to win second place in
parliamentary elections in December, delegates approved two
policies.
</P>
<P>
   One was to create a ``young bears''' movement, similar to the
old Komsomol or Communist Youth League, and the other was to tackle
unemployment under the slogan: ``Those who don't want to work will
be made to work.''
</P>
<P>
   That was very much in the style of Andropov, who had the police
check queues to make sure citizens were not shopping in their
working hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Mr. Putin has a KGB background does not worry
me, per se,'' said one Western analyst. ``Some of the cleverest
people in Russia began their careers in the KGB. It all depends on
what he does with power, assuming he secures it.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Western diplomat said that Putin had the potential to
do either great good for Russia after the failure of the Yeltsin
years or more harm to a country that had suffered throughout the
20th century. To some extent, the way the West approached him could
determine how he developed.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides of Vladimir Putin were clear for all to see when,
in place of Yeltsin, the acting president made the traditional New
Year greeting to the nation as 1999 turned into the year 2000. The
tone of his voice was as telling as the text.
</P>
<P>
   He began with a chilling warning to anybody who might perceive a
power vacuum and try to take advantage of it by violating the
constitution that such an attempt would be ``decisively crushed.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he went on to say that free speech and property rights
would be guaranteed and he ended on a warm, paternal note,
promising that dreams would come true and drinking to peace and
love.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the midnight speech, NTV had been showing a
documentary about his early years in Leningrad, now renamed St.
Petersburg. Most neighbors spoke highly of the quiet, modest young
man who used to live next door.
</P>
<P>
   Only one woman remembered a disturbing detail: that children had
been frightened of Vladimir Putin. &QL;

KNOCK OFF 10 POUNDS AND 10 YEARS WITHOUT EXERCISE OR DIETING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Are your saddlebags bulging from binging?
</P>
<P>
   Has your your hairdresser hinted you'd look younger with a new
'do?
</P>
<P>
   Are you still pinning a scarf on the shoulder?
</P>
<P>
   Consider a millennium makeover. It's a wardrobe overhaul that
will knock off 10 pounds and 10 years without exercising or
dieting.
</P>
<P>
   For more details we talked to numerous makeover experts, asking
them for their best-kept secrets as well as those tell-tale signs
of fashion frumpiness. And in the spirit of a better-dressed
nation, they spilled.
</P>
<P>
   _ Start with a firm foundation: TV and film stylist Jane
Mannfolk advises an uplifting, minimizing bra and support hose
instead of those with tummy-control panels for the smoothest fit.
And for heavy-duty support, she suggests a shaper (formerly known
as a girdle).
</P>
<P>
   _ Dump the old-lady handbag: A woman's age and fashion
consciousness is spotted in her choice of purse, according to Eve
Michaels, consultant for Nordstrom and Enhancements Professional
Image Consulting. ``Big, soft, mushy shoulder bags are
old-thinking, while smaller, structured bags with shorter straps
are young.''
</P>
<P>
   Get rid of the hefty, oversized satchel and try something
colorful and fun, suggests Linda Arroz, editor of Realsize.Com. Try
a small fabric tote embellished with beads or mirrors. But maybe
not for the office.
</P>
<P>
   When shopping for a new purse, advises Mannfolk, look at
yourself in the mirror. Sometimes the bag with counter appeal can
make you look older and heavier even though it's able to hold all
your photo albums of the grandkids, a phone, beeper, bottle of
water and a box of tissues.
</P>
<P>
   _ Minimize jewelry: To take off more years and pounds, Mannfolk
always advises her clients to minimize their jewelry. ``All those
gold chains, bangle bracelets, rings on the fingers ... things you
wore back in the '70s and '80s give your age away. Get rid of the
clutter, and opt for statement makers, such as a Cartier tank watch
or one that looks like it. Then add a stunning pair of earrings or
simple diamond studs. But do keep the kitty earrings and items your
kids gave you for family affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Look at your glasses: Are they older than the family car?
Frames need to be updated as your image changes, Mannfolk says,
noting that big black plastic frames go with artsy images, while
cat's eye styles are losing their cachet, being upstaged by the
return of aviator styles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Polish your weekend wear: Jeans are fine (try the stretch
denim in dark blue), especially when teamed with a long hooded
pullover or a man-tailored white shirt. And a sweater set with long
cardigan will hide all kinds of diet sins. To knock off a few
years, says Arroz, avoid those brightly colored jogging suits for
non-joggers and sweat shirts with crafty appliques with
elastic-waist pants.
</P>
<P>
   Arroz is also big on monochromatic statements and believes that
even head-to-toe white (although darker is better) is more slimming
than a multicolored ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   _ Suit your figure: When it comes to professional attire, make
sure the jacket fits well, especially at the shoulders. ``If you're
buying a new suit, look for simple lines with a three or
four-button jacket in stretch techo fabrics, such as wool with
Lycra,'' says Michaels. ``Not only will it flatter the body, as
long as it's not too tight, but it will show that you're
up-to-date.''
</P>
<P>
   Although slim knee-length skirts are the norm, a longer skirt
will look newer, and also thinner because it creates a long,
vertical illusion, says Michaels. Regardless of skirt length, Arroz
says to wear sheer nude stockings instead of suntan. And start
noticing that sheer black is making a comeback for spring.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cover defects: Got flabby upper arms that need some
camouflage? Arroz goes back to the cardigan, but says large scarves
and stoles _ such as the pashmina _ are great cover-ups for
evening. And don't rule out peasant tops as being too young. They
can hide fuller arms and waists and bring the eye up, which is your
ultimate goal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Add height: No matter what your height, you can add a couple
of inches by just standing up straight and lifting your rib cage,
says Arroz. For added height and curvier calves, add higher heels;
for a younger stance, try a shoe with square toes or a novelty such
as pony print.
</P>
<P>
   _ Update your 'do: ``It's a fact _ gray hair makes you look
older. But so does overbleached or overdyed hair,'' says Dawn
Ellinwood, senior colorist at Frederic Fekkai Beaute de Provence in
Beverly Hills. According to Ellinwood, ``As we get older, we lose
color in our skin and hair, and we need some warmth in our hair
color. For instance, instead of an ash brown, try toffee or
chestnut.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Edwards, co-owner of Allen Edwards Salons, says women
shouldn't be afraid to change their hairstyle frequently, because
it's one of the quickest way to update their image. She points to
the big hair of the '80s and says that's the giveaway on a woman's
mindset. Although she thinks super short hair can erase pounds and
years, Edwards says the classic bob can work if it is made shorter
in back and has a side part or bangs. Key details to younger hair
are less pouf and more shine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Freshen your face: When it comes to makeup, the biggest
mistake women make, says makeup artist David Sokolsky of Frederic
Fekkai salon, is overuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Less is more when you get older, so you want to use a lighter
base and less powder for a dewy complexion. Choose a color that
matches your skin in a tinted moisturizer or foundation mixed with
a little moisturizer, and consider using a light wash of bronzing
gel for a sun-kissed look,'' Sokolsky advises.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid frost: Anything with glitter or sparkle is a no-no on
mature skin because it magnifies wrinkles, says Sokolsky. And that
includes eye shadow and nail polish (especially blue).
</P>
<P>
   Makeup artist-to-the-stars Bobbe Joy adds that women will look
more contemporary if they consider their eye color and use soft
shades that are the opposites of their eyes. For instance, says
Joy, peach and apricot shades work well with blue eyes, while
lavender looks good with green eyes. For brown-eyed brunettes she
suggests plum.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gloss it over: The next trick is create a youthful pout that
won't bleed into the fine lines around the mouth. To minimize the
problem, Sokolsky and Joy suggest lining the lips, completely
filling them in and then adding a tiny bit of gloss or moist
lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   The final touch is blush, which shouldn't be so dark it makes
your face look dirty, and it should be applied in the apples of
your cheeks, then your hairline and a dab on the chin to create a
slimmer you. &QL;

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: The new refrigerator we purchased a couple of years ago did
not have a built-in ice maker, but we have learned that this model
is equipped to accept one and has space for it at the top of the
freezer compartment.
</P>
<P>
   I plan to buy and install this accessory but I have to connect
this to a cold water supply line and I would like to avoid having
to call in a plumber.
</P>
<P>
   However, I have had very little experience working with copper
water pipe and tubing. How difficult is it for an amateur to make
such a hookup?
</P>
<P>
   A: For this particular task you actually need little or no
experience in doing plumbing work.
</P>
<P>
   You can tap into your existing water line with an easily
installed two-piece saddle valve similar to the one shown in the
illustration.
</P>
<P>
   Aftea shutting off the water supply you simply position one half
of the saddle valve under or behind the existing water line, then
place the other half on the opposite side of that pipe.
</P>
<P>
   The two pieces are then clamped together by using a wrench and
screwdriver to tighten the bolts provided, after which you tighten
the handle on the valve to puncture the pipe. This connects the
tubing for the ice maker to the water supply.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The walls in my kitchen and bath are covered with a washable,
vinyl type wallcovering that is supposed to last almost forever.
</P>
<P>
   However, after about five years some of this material started to
pull away from the wall, especially along the seams and corners.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of adhesive can I use to paste this material back
properly?
</P>
<P>
   A: Your best bet is to use a ready mixed vinyl adhesive that is
normally used to paste up heavy vinyl wallcoverings. It is sold in
most paint and wallpaper stores.
</P>
<P>
   If the old vinyl wallcovering is stiff and hard to press back
without cracking you may find it easier to dampen the back of the
material first in order to make it more flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The walls in my bathroom are covered with very old plastic
tiles that I now want to remove.
</P>
<P>
   I have started scraping off the tile, but there is still quite a
bit of the mastic adhesive left on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   What is the easiest way to remove this old adhesive?
</P>
<P>
   A: There is no ``easy'' way. It just has to be removed by
scraping or sanding _ both messy and time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   If the wall underneath is drywall rather than plaster, chances
are you may not be able to do this without damaging the wall
surface.
</P>
<P>
   In that event you will probably be better off simply ripping all
of the old wallboard off and then merely putting up new gypsum
board.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The interior brick wall that surrounds our large fireplace is
continually plagued with a white powdery efflorescence that shows
up clearly.
</P>
<P>
   We cleaned off the white powder by washing with water and a
dilute solution of muriatic acid, but it keeps coming back.
</P>
<P>
   Any idea as to what we can do to get rid of this problem?
</P>
<P>
   A: Efflorescence is caused by excess moisture in the masonry, so
you must solve the moisture problem on the outside to get rid of
it.
</P>
<P>
   It may mean tuck pointing all the mortar joints in the brick on
the outside of the chimney wall, or there may be cracks that need
repairing in the chimney cap at the top of the chimney.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is defective or missing flashing where the
brick meets the house walls on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about home-repair problems should be addressed to

</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Drawing captioned ``SADDLE VALVE'' goes with this column.
</P>
<P>
   CAPTION: The simplest way to tap into a cold water line for the
refrigerator's ice maker is to use a saddle valve like the one
shown here.

CHURCHILL AND ROOSEVELT CONSIDERED REMOVING DE GAULLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt considered
removing Charles de Gaulle as leader of the French resistance at a
critical moment during World War II, saying that they found him
boastful, conceited and deeply biased against Britain and the
United States, according to newly released British records.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hates England and has left a trail of Anglophobia behind
him everywhere,'' Churchill said in May 1943 in top secret
telegrams sent to his ministers from Washington, where he was
visiting the White House. The British prime minister described the
French general as ``vain and even malignant'' and said he suspected
him of ``fascist tendencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing under his telegraphic code name ``Britman,'' Churchill
urged his war cabinet to remove de Gaulle, who was then based in
London. To bolster his argument he passed on telegrams he had
received from Roosevelt in which the American president labeled the
French general ``well-nigh intolerable'' and doubted that he
enjoyed the support of the French people that he claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt even had a tart suggestion for what Churchill might do
with de Gaulle: ``Possibly you could make him governor of
Madagascar.''
</P>
<P>
   The irritation between Churchill and de Gaulle has long been
known, but the lengths to which the British prime minister was
willing to go to rid himself of the man whom he had championed at
the war's outset had not been revealed until now.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Record office considered the documents so sensitive
that they were kept secret for 57 years, even though British policy
is to declassify most records after 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   In his calls for the autocratic French leader's head, Churchill
was emboldened by the antipathy to de Gaulle that he encountered in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we consider the absolutely vital interest which we have
in preserving good relations with the United States,'' Churchill
wired his ministers on May 23, ``it seems to me most questionable
that we should allow this marplot and mischief-maker to continue
the harm he is doing.'' (Webster's New World College Dictionary
defines a marplot as ``a person who mars or spoils some plan by
officious interference.'')
</P>
<P>
   That same night in London, the war cabinet held an emergency
meeting, and Clement Attlee, the deputy prime minister, and Anthony
Eden, the foreign secretary, wired Churchill back, dismissing the
American view and expressing alarm over its short-sightedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``A precipitate break with de Gaulle would have far-reaching
consequences in a number of spheres that the Americans have
probably never thought about,'' they said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   They also quarreled with Roosevelt's attitude about the depths
of support that de Gaulle enjoyed with the French.
</P>
<P>
   ``The de Gaulle they follow is of course an idealized,
semimystic figure very different from the man we know,'' they said.
``But nothing that Allied propaganda could do would convince the
French that their idol has feet of clay, and the removal of de
Gaulle would probably have a disastrous reaction on the whole
resistance movement.''
</P>
<P>
   In May 1943, de Gaulle was fighting for pre-eminence among the
expatriate French factions based in North Africa, and the Americans
were backing another general, Henri Giraud. By autumn, de Gaulle
had won the power struggle for leadership of the Free French
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill accepted his cabinet's rebuff in a reply on May 24,
though in a grumpy aside he wondered if Anglo-American relations
might suffer more from not acting than acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should be very sorry to become responsible for breaking up
that harmony for the sake of a Frenchman who is a bitter foe of
Britain and may well bring civil war upon France,'' Churchill said.

 &HT;    GRANDPARENTS ENGAGED WITH THEIR GRANDCHILDREN, SURVEY FINDS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Grandparents' relationships with their
grandchildren are stronger than ever, with more than 10 percent
acting as caregivers for a grandchild and nearly half acting as a
frequent companion, the AARP reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The yearlong survey of more than 800 randomly chosen
grandparents nationwide ``paints a clear picture of the
relationships between grandparents and their grandchildren,'' said
Katie Sloan of AARP's Applied Gerontology Group.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the Pennsylvania-based IRC Survey of Media found
that of the nearly 63 million American grandparents, 3 percent are
raising one or more of their grandchildren and another 8 percent
provide day care.
</P>
<P>
   It found that eight in 10 grandparents talk on the phone with
their grandchildren weekly, while three in 10 both see and talk on
the phone with their grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the grandparents surveyed also said they keep in contact
with their grandchildren through the mail. They regularly send
postcards as well as greeting cards.
</P>
<P>
   About 49 percent said they frequently act as a friend or
companion to their grandchildren, and a third said they normally
assume the role of adviser and confidant.
</P>
<P>
   The participants were given a list of 17 activities and were
asked to choose the ones they frequently engaged in with their
grandchildren. The five most popular were eating together, watching
a TV comedy, staying overnight, shopping for clothes and exercising
or playing sports.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that grandparents are generous financially as
well as with time they spend with their grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   On average, 74 percent of American grandparents buy clothes for
grandchildren, 60 percent buy books, 38 percent buy toys and 12
percent pay tuition.
</P>
<P>
   The average grandparent spends $489 a year on their
grandchildren, the survey said. However, those who are raising
their grandchildren tend to spend nearly $700 annually.
</P>
<P>
   Money aside, a vast majority of grandparents said they hope to
pass on morals and integrity to their grandchildren. Others
mentioned hobbies and religious values.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Straw, associate director of AARP's research group,
said family dynamics strongly influence whether or not parents have
good relationships with their grandchildren. She said if the
parents have bad relationships with their parents, their children
will most likely have bad relationships with their grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   Straw added that grandparent-grandchildren relations are a lot
stronger when the children also have good relationships with both
their parents.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was done in 1998, but was not released until now
because of staff changes within AARP. However, the things that were
examined in the survey ``most likely won't change in the new
millennium,'' Straw said.
</P>
<P>
   The study was released the eve of oral arguments in a U.S.
Supreme Court case, Troxel v. Granville, in which a Washington
state couple is suing for the right to visit their granddaughters.

   Straw added that grandparent-grandchildren relations are a lot
stronger when the children also have good relationships with both
their parents.

   The survey was done in 1998, but was not released until now
because of staff changes within AARP. However, the things that were
examined in the survey ``most likely won't change in the new
millennium,'' Straw said.

   The study was released the eve of oral arguments in a U.S.
Supreme Court case, Troxel v. Granville, in which a Washington
state couple is suing for the right to visit their granddaughters.

   A well-constructed staircase is made of many components: treads,
risers and stringers that fit together like a fine cabinet. Some
staircases are enclosed between two walls, but most are usually
built against one wall with the opposite side being open. For
safety reasons, the open side should be enclosed with a balustrade.
The balustrade is a series of vertical posts, called balusters.
These support the handrail. One end of the handrail is usually
anchored to a wall or a railing at the top of the stairs. At the
other end of the balustrade, at the foot of the stairs, is the
newel post. It supports the handrail and anchors the balustrade.
</P>
<P>
   All this may seem complicated, but the balustrade is basically a
very simple and sturdy structure. Occasionally, problems develop if
the joints between the parts loosen or if a baluster cracks or
breaks. Balusters generally work loose at the top where they
support the handrail. They can be tightened with glue and wooden
shims.
</P>
<P>
   To tighten a loose baluster, cut a thin shim from a piece of
hardwood and coat it with glue. Use a small mallet and a wooden
block to drive the shim into the gap between the rail and baluster
top. Ideally, you should make this repair at night when the stairs
will not be used. In this way the glue can set for 12 hours without
being disturbed. When the glue is dry, use a utility knife to trim
the shim so it is flush with the baluster.
</P>
<P>
   You can also use a long wood screw to secure a loose baluster.
Drill a pilot hole at an angle through the side of the baluster up
into the rail. Next, countersink the hole so the screw head will be
hidden below the surface of the wood. Driving the screw through the
hole should pull the rail and baluster securely together.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing a broken baluster is more difficult because the piece
is usually doweled or dovetailed into the tread and it may be hard
to remove. It is usually easier to saw the baluster in half, then
pull the top part out from the rail. In some cases, the top of the
baluster may be fitted in a rectangular groove in the handrail and
secured in place between fillet blocks (rectangular pieces of wood
that fit in the rail groove between each baluster). Before you can
pull out the sawed baluster, you may have to chisel out one of the
fillets.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom part of the baluster may have a doweled end set with
glue into a hole in the tread, or it may have a base that is
dovetailed into slots in the tread. To loosen and remove a doweled
baluster base, grip it with an adjustable wrench and twist it. This
should break the glue bond so you can pull the piece free. If you
cannot loosen the baluster with a wrench, you will have to drill it
out. First, saw the baluster so it is flush with the tread, then
use a spade bit the same diameter as the dowel to bore out the
hole.
</P>
<P>
   Balusters with dovetails are concealed behind a piece of
decorative molding mounted on the edge of the tread. Before you can
remove the baluster, you must pry away the molding to reveal the
dovetail joints. With the molding removed, you can tap the baluster
with a mallet to force it from the tread slot. If that doesn't
work, saw it flush with the tread then chisel the remaining piece
from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   If your staircase was built within the last 25 years, it was
probably constructed with standard mass-produced parts, and you
should be able to find replacement balusters at the local
lumberyard or building supply store. These dealers usually carry a
variety of standard balusters that match contemporary designs. If
you cannot find a matching piece in stock, you will have to have
one made to order by an experienced cabinetmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Installing the replacement baluster is a matter of angling it
between the rail and tread, then gently tapping it into a vertical
position. Before doing this, coat the dowel hole or dovetail slot
in the tread with glue.
</P>
<P>
   Newel posts are sturdy, so they rarely need to be replaced. They
do, however, loosen over time and need to be tightened. Tightening
a newel post depends upon its construction. One type has a base
extension that extends through the floor and is bolted to a joist.
Firm up the post by tightening the nut on the extension. The other
type of newel post is hollow with a vertical threaded rod running
through the core of the post. Tightening the nut on the end of the
rod will firm up the post. To gain access to the rod, remove the
decorative finial cap on top of the post.

 AN AUTEUR IS BORN, VIA iMAC  
 (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Opening Scene: Interior. Zoom in on man sitting alone at a
personal computer in a heavily fortified, well provisioned bunker,
surfing the Internet, browsing for recipes that call for lots of
canned tuna and peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   As movie scripts go, it needs some work. But then, my desktop
movie, along with the whole idea of desktop video, is only just
beginning to come into focus.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Apple Computer and its software partners created
the idea of desktop publishing. Now, at the cusp of the 21st
century, Apple is endeavoring to make desktop video publishing as
common as desktop paper publishing.
</P>
<P>
   Video is a major theme of the annual Macworld trade show that is
being held in San Francisco this week, and the centerpiece of
Apple's video evangelism is the iMovie video editing software that
comes standard on the consumer iMac DV and iMac DV SE computer
models. The iMovie software enables Mac users to create
surprisingly sophisticated videos, with special effects, animated
titles and credits, simple musical scores and sound effects.
Windows-based computers can accomplish the same thing, of course,
but not with the simplicity, ease of use or low cost of the iMac
and iMovie systems.
</P>
<P>
   In Apple's vision, people will use small, inexpensive digital
video cameras and microphones to record video postcards that can
replace or supplement plain old text e-mail messages. Instead of
sending holiday cards and the now traditional Christmas form
letters, which often arrived by e-mail in 1999, the 21st century
family will gather in front of the videocam and deliver greetings
as video files, in color, in full motion, with voices and perhaps a
soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Desktop video will also become the production studio for home
movies of the 21st century, and even people who hate computers will
recognize that this is a major advance for society. Unlike analogue
video tapes, which drag the viewers along in a linear progression,
digital video can be edited easily on a computer screen, pruned of
botched and blurry shots, rearranged to make a coherent story line,
enhanced with a soundtrack, and, best of all, shortened. Being
invited over to watch the neighbors' vacation movies may actually
become enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, digital video is a wonderful playground for people who
want to use the video capabilities of the Macintosh to advance a
new art form, the digital movie short. It is easy to imagine
teen-agers creating their own MTV-style music videos, blending
their favorite CD tunes with imaginative digital videocam images of
their friends, or with DVD video clips.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers will be able to preview their destinations or revisit
memories by downloading short video travelogues posted on the
Internet by those who have been there. Family genealogies will move
scrapbooks and picture frames on the wall to videos on the TV
screen. And would-be screenwriters, novelists and directors can
dragoon their friends and families to act in their low-budget
videos.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of desktop publishing did not necessarily usher in a
new era of clever, literate publishing. Instead, it was, and is, a
very democratic medium, allowing everyone from graphic geniuses to
people with absolutely no sense of design or style to create all
sorts of newsletters, brochures and other paper documents that
previously might have been taken to, and repaired by, a
professional printer. All it took was a Macintosh (and later a
Windows PC), a laser printer and a program like Aldus (later Adobe)
Pagemaker. In the mid-1980s such a set-up cost many thousands of
dollars, but it was much cheaper than a professional job press.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the emergence of desktop video means that people will
be able to flood the world and clog the Internet with digital
video, using a Macintosh DV model, a digital video camera and
iMovie software. The cost to get started is actually less than it
was in the early days of desktop publishing, and considerably less
than the professional video editing consoles that the Mac can
replace.
</P>
<P>
   An iMac DV SE with iMovie software costs $1,499 _ I recommend
this graphite-colored model over the cheaper iMac DV because of its
larger and more video-friendly memory and hard disk resources _ and
a digital video camera can be had for $1,000 to $2,500, depending
on features. Transferring images from the video camera to the iMac
requires a special high-speed Firewire cable (about $70) with six
pins on the computer end and four pins on the camera end.
</P>
<P>
   Firewire is Apple's name for the IEEE 1394 technical
specification for high-speed transfer of digital files, like video.
Sony, whose digital video camera I used, calls it iLink.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I connected the video camera to the iMac with the Firewire
cable, launched the iMovie software with a couple of clicks, and
was able to start making movies in minutes, even without reading
the on-screen manual or following the video tutorial. Long
stretches of boring video were pared to their dramatic essence, and
these gems were stored as individual scenes on a story board.
</P>
<P>
   Once I had assembled 12 scenes that cut to the core of the human
experience, or at least represented the high points of my recent
family vacation to the Yucatan, I dragged the clips one by one to
an editing bar and arranged them in something like a coherent
order. Simple text titles were added, transitions were added to
blend the scenes into one another, banal human dialogue was
replaced (and improved) with dog barks and cat meows drawn from a
collection of canned audio clips that came with iMovie, and a
dramatic soundtrack was added from the nearest audio CD I could
reach, which unfortunately was Barber's ``Adagio for Strings.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was every bit as professional and clever as one would
expect from someone who did not read the manual. But it inspired me
to learn how to think like a director, envisioning clever story
lines, smooth and imaginative camera angles, witty dialogue and
compelling scenes. The process is so alluring that I can already
envision budget overruns, tantrums from temperamental actors (like
my family members), and the sadness of being misunderstood by
critics. Art is suffering. But digital video is fun, especially the
Apple way.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not all fun. Now begins the tedious project of
transferring large archives of older VHS and 8-millimeter family
videos to the digital video camera, and from the DV camera to the
Mac, because the iMac accepts only digital input. In the end,
however, preserving those older films and videotapes in digital
form will greatly improve the chance that they will be viewed by
our children and grandchildren in this coming digital century.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the digital era, one of the several computer
meltdowns in my bunker over the Y2K weekend _ none of them directly
related to the Y2K bug _ occurred when Apple offered me a software
patch to correct what sounded like an alarming flaw in its new Mac
OS 9 operating system software.
</P>
<P>
   According to Apple, there is a bug in OS 9's built-in Open
Transport networking utility that could enable hackers to attack
and disable Macintosh computers that are connected to the Internet
on a persistent network connection with a static Internet Protocol
address. This rules out most Macs, especially those that connect to
the Internet through a dial-up modem, but it exactly describes my
home set-up.
</P>
<P>
   So I downloaded and installed Apple's software patch. The next
day, just long enough after downloading the patch that it did not
occur to me to be related, my Airport wireless network suddenly
stopped working, my browser software began spewing unhelpful error
messages, and my iMac started having seizures. I had a moment when
I wished that I had stocked up on more tuna fish and peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   After picking my communications settings apart and resetting
them several times at no profit, and then picking them apart again
during several long calls to a technician at my local Internet
service provider, I finally recognized that Apple's software
``fix'' must be the problem, and not the year 2000 rollover.
</P>
<P>
   The offending patch was plucked from the iMac and purged, and my
computer was once again partying like it was 1999. It may get
hammered by hackers, of course, but wouldn't that make a great
movie?

JAILED EX-CHIEF OF UNITED WAY OWED $4.2 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ United Way of America owes its imprisoned former
president, William Aramony, the full $4.2 million in his deferred
compensation plan because the plan did not include a clause
forfeiting the money if Aramony committed a felony, a federal judge
ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Shira Scheindlin of U.S. District Court in Manhattan
ruled, however, that United Way can withhold $2.02 million in
salary, investigative costs and interest that Aramony owes the
organization that he ran for 19 years. She also ruled that Aramony
is not entitled to legal fees due the lawyer who won the case,
Dennis Houdek of Flacone, Houdek &AMP; Curd in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling Tuesday focused on a tax law issue that could have
reduced the award by $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, United Way directors approved a ``top hat'' pension
plan for Aramony in addition to his standard pension. The term top
hat derives from the fact that only executives and other highly
paid workers can have such benefits on top of the basic pension
plan that all workers in an organization may earn.
</P>
<P>
   When the top hat plan was approved, a judge found in an earlier
proceeding that Aramony and a second executive, Steve Paulacheck,
were already stealing from the charity. Both men were convicted on
federal fraud and embezzling charges after the thefts were
disclosed by The Washington Post in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The thefts prompted a sharp drop in gifts to local United Ways,
which funnels most of their money to youth, social services and
health charities.
</P>
<P>
   The draft of the top hat plan shown to the board included a
``bad boy'' clause that denied the top hat money to the executive
if he committed a felony.
</P>
<P>
   The board authorized Mutual of America, a New York insurance and
pension plan company with close ties to the United Way movement, to
draw up the top hat plan and it authorized Paulacheck to sign on
behalf of United Way of America directors. But somehow the ``bad
boy'' clause never made its way into the final contract.
</P>
<P>
   Scheindlin ruled earlier that United Way of America produced no
evidence of collusion in the disappearance of the ``bad
boy''language and so its disappearance would not be construed to
damage Aramony's claim.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Amundsen, chief administrative officer of United Way of
America, sent an e-mail memo to all 1,300 local United Ways on
Tuesday night announcing that it ``is disappointed with the court's
ruling and disagrees'' with the reasoning used to ``conclude that
Mr. Aramony is entitled'' to money in the top hat plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reviewing with outside counsel to determine if there is
any reasonable basis for appeal,'' Amundsen wrote. ``In any event,
sufficient funds have been set aside and are available to satisfy
the judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony De Cristofaro, a United Way of America spokesman, said
lawyers would also be consulted about whether to sue Mutual of
America. He said talks with Mutual of America began in November.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Moran, president and chief executive of Mutual of
America, said Tuesday night that he was unaware of any such talks.
</P>
<P>
   Moran declined to comment on whether Mutual of America had erred
in preparing the documents beyond saying that the judge had upheld
the contract and found that it was in line with the board's
understanding of its contents.
</P>
<P>
   United Way of America officials insist that the signed contract
did not accurately reflect the board's intent.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Aramony's son, Bob, were unsuccessful Tuesday
night. Houdek, Aramony's civil lawyer, said he felt ``absolutely
terrific'' about the ruling.

Russia's campaign to seize the capital of Chechnya, Grozny, has
turned into a grinding battle of attrition. Vladimir Manilov, the
deputy chief of the Russia army's general staff, said last week
that the fall of Grozny would occur within days. But Russian troops
have run into fierce opposition in their campaign to seize the
city. In recent days bands of rebels have lashed back, prompting
furious fights on the outskirts of the city. By Michael R. Gordon.

   JERUSALEM _ They're seeing the good and bad of Israel _ from
religious piety to hostility, from Israelis who view America as a
dependable friend to those who see it as the producer of the coarse
``South Park'' cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 college students from Palm Beach County are in a
worldwide program that began this winter and is aimed at bringing
massive numbers of young Jews to visit Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers began ``Birthright Israel'' to strengthen Jewish
identity and enhance the ties between Israel and Jews around the
world. Backed by the Israeli government, Jewish groups and
philanthropists, the program is designed to eventually bring 50,000
young people to Israel each year free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 6,000 students will be in the program. Of those,
4,000 are Americans and most are in Israel this winter. The group
includes 360 Florida students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to go see my homeland, Israel,'' said Cory
Zadanosky, a Nova Southeast University law student in Israel this
week. ``I felt like coming here would allow me to see my roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Zadanosky, 24, went to Olympic Heights High School in Boca
Raton, and, like many on the trip, said he is not a deeply
religious Jew. But, the program peaked his interest.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's been struck by how many Israelis have told him that
American Jews should live in Israel and help defend the country.
</P>
<P>
   He considered it a highlight to walk on the Golan Heights
plateau just as negotiators in West Virginia are discussing whether
Israel should return the captured land to Syria. He was moved by a
trip up the mountain to the archeological site at Masada, a key
symbol of Israeli patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   But, he and two friends were surprised by an encounter with a
Jewish store owner who told them not to shop with his next-door
neighbor because he was Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's peace, yet there's hostility,'' Zadanosky said.
</P>
<P>
   Their 10-day trip includes the standard sights _ the Wailing
Wall, Masada _ but also includes a presentation from a Palestinian
peace negotiator and meetings with Israeli high school students.
</P>
<P>
   George Ackerman, a 22-year-old Brooklyn native and recent
graduate of Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, said he was
surprised when an Israeli high school student shouted that he loved
the raunchy ``South Park'' television cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   During the trip, the participants review their experiences in
regular group conversations and discuss their relationship to
Israel and Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   This first Birthright trip was paid for primarily by Wall Street
money manager Michael Steinhardt and Seagram Co. Ltd. co-chairman
Charles Bronfman. Organizers hope to raise $210 million for the
program.

SOON: COMPUTERS THAT KNOW YOU HATE THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By IAN AUSTEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to emotions, computers are about as warm and
understanding as, well, a pile of plastic, silicon, glass and
metal. But if a gadget sitting in an office at IBM's Almaden
Research Center in San Jose, Calif., ever makes it to the assembly
line, people may develop a new, warm relationship with their
electronic companions.
</P>
<P>
   The gadget is the Emotion mouse. If you ignore the copper
coating on its buttons and a small infrared port on its side, the
Emotion mouse looks like any other computer mouse, but it is a very
different breed. It tracks its user's skin temperature, heart rate
and even very tiny hand movements, along with the electrical
conductivity of the user's skin (which changes with moisture), and
feeds that information into the computer. Acting like a kind of
polygraph, the computer analyzes the data to try to determine the
emotional state of the user.
</P>
<P>
   ``If computers are going to adapt to their users,'' said Wendy
Ark, the IBM researcher who developed the Emotion mouse, ``they
first have to understand a little more about the user. It could be
that we touch our computer mouse more than we touch other people
during a typical day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Emotion mouse is one of the less fantastic ideas floating
around a field known as affective computing. As anyone even vaguely
familiar with polygraph lie-detector tests knows, the body reacts
physically to different emotional states. Affective computing
scientists hope that by blending information about the physical
expressions of emotion with the cold calculations of silicon, they
can improve the relationship between people and their computers.
</P>
<P>
   A computer that understands its user's emotional states might be
able to adjust its interface to reduce frustration, sense when an
employee may be burning out, automatically spice up computer game
action, judge the user's reactions to products or base an automatic
search for television sitcoms on a user's personal perceptions of
what's funny.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers say affective computing may even lead to
computerized therapy. Jonathan Klein, who designs interactive toys
for I.S. Robotics, said that affective computing could ultimately
be a way to reach ``the walking wounded, the people who can't get
their emotional needs fulfilled and who are seriously lonely or
furious.'' But peeking into people's souls may raise the level of
concern about computers and personal privacy.
</P>
<P>
   If affective computing devices took hold, employers could track
employees' emotions and companies could probe consumers' feelings
in a way not previously possible.
</P>
<P>
   The starting point for much of the research on affective
computing has been the study of how people evaluate the emotional
state of others. At the Almaden laboratory, Chris Dryer, a social
psychologist who is no longer with the company, had groups of
people play specially concocted computer puzzles. Some puzzles were
designed to be so challenging that they would be stressful to play.
Easier versions were designed to malfunction in the hope of
frustrating players. The players, who were videotaped, wrote down
their emotional states during the session.
</P>
<P>
   Then Dryer had another group of people watch the videotapes and
describe the game players' emotional states. Dryer found that the
observers could usually determine the players' emotions by
observing movements of the eyes and parts of the face.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to translate the unspoken body language that
reflects emotions into the mathematical equations of computer
software, a process IBM calls Project BlueEyes. ``There's nothing
on the technical side that prevents computers from using this as
well,'' Dryer said. ``All the computational hardware is in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Dryer began working with Ms. Ark to develop unobtrusive ways for
computers to go beyond looking in measuring the physiological signs
of emotions. One result was the Emotion mouse, now in its second
generation.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse system has to be trained to spot the user's emotions,
just as computers must be taught to recognize a person's voice or
handwriting. Ms. Ark has new users hold the mouse for half an hour
while watching videos, listening to readings and, under
instruction, thinking certain thoughts _ about happiness, for
example _ to provide the computer with a sense of their emotional
range. When that is done, the emotion mouse software is about 75
percent successful at determining a user's emotional state.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's emotion mouse is still a laboratory curiosity. Ms. Ark
says such devices are likely to find their way into objects other
than computers, like car steering wheels that could sense when a
driver was getting drowdy or keychains that would summon the police
if the user seemed unusually frightened. ``These sensors can really
be put anywhere,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A similar mouse has been developed at the Media Laboratory at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As the founder of the
laboratory's Affective Computing Research Group, Dr. Rosalind
Picard is one of the leading scientists looking at the interaction
of human emotions and computers. It is, Picard said, a bit like the
Wizard of Oz giving the Tin Man a heart. ``Several of the things
that are broken in computers are the same things that are broken in
some people.''
</P>
<P>
   Picard didn't end up in the field of affective computing by
design. In fact, she said, she used to share at least one major
trait with the computers she studied. ``I certainly wasn't
interested in emotion,'' she said. ``Actually, I tried to stay away
from emotion most of my life because I'm a scientist. Mathematics
and analysis were my focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Picard's early work fit the traditional pattern of
someone trained in electrical engineering and computer science.
When she was a chip designer at Bell Laboratories, Picard began
considering emotions for practical reasons. Her research had moved
into the areas of computer vision and pattern recognition and
analysis, technologies that might, for example, allow computers to
plow accurately through hours of videotapes to find specific
scenes. Like many researchers in that field, she said, she found it
extremely hard to get computers ``to perceive information in the
same way as people.''
</P>
<P>
   She was struck by social science theories suggesting that
emotions played a significant role in how people analyzed what they
saw and heard. To her, it was not too great a stretch to think that
computers could become more perceptive and easier to use if they
also paid at least some attention to emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Because disparate emotions can produce similar body signals,
affective computing software can easily misinterpret what a user is
feeling. One approach to eliminating confusion is to add
measurements, like the breathing rate, that would require more
intrusive forms of monitoring, like a chest belt laden with
sensors.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that the technical questions will be sorted out, a
philosophical one remains: who wants a computer that can guess how
the user is feeling and respond accordingly?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of hard even for myself to picture wanting my
computer to know my emotional state all the time,'' Ms. Ark said.
</P>
<P>
   Myron Flickner, the leader of Project Blue Eyes, said that
affective computing systems would not be accepted if they were seen
by users as emotional spies. ``This is something that you need to
be able to turn on and off,'' he said. ``Users are going to want to
be in control.''
</P>
<P>
   Dryer said he expected that interest in affective computing
would increase with e-commerce, perhaps leading to systems that
would help manage customer relations. ``Increasingly, we don't want
face-to-face contact all the time with businesses,'' he said.
``People are going to want to have more natural communications in
computer-mediated transactions.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If affective computing becomes more widespread, computer game
designers may come up with software that will constantly vary its
level of playing excitement, based on in-game emotional feedback
from players. Teachers offering lectures over the Internet may be
able to judge their presentations for clarity, and tedium, based on
anonymous data from their faceless students. Similarly, a computer
could automatically replay portions of a lecture if it sensed that
a student's mind had wandered. Public opinion polling and market
research companies are other potential users.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to market, the goals are considerably more modest. Dr.
Picard's group is working with Microsoft to alter one of its more
irksome features: Clippie, the talking paper clip that first popped
up in Microsoft Office 97 to offer technical advice. Although many
users found the cartoon device helpful, others found it
infuriating. Affective computing might produce an online helper
that would, in Dr. Picard's words, ``sense you despise it'' and
turn itself off.
</P>
<P>
   One of Dr. Picard's concerns is that affective computing could
acquire a bad name through childish applications. There has been
speculation, for example, that future personal computers might try
to perk up sad users by playing jolly music _ a kind of automated,
personal Muzak. ``That's a really bad idea that, unfortunately,
people keep putting out,'' Dr. Picard said. ``It's belittling to
have something that knows nothing of human experience try and cheer
you up.''
</P>
<P>
   A big hurdle to acceptance will be persuading people _ who often
find it hard to share emotions with other people _ to allow a
machine to track and perhaps record their moods. ``It's quite
possible that many people could be so creeped out that they
wouldn't want to have anything to do with it,'' Dr. Picard said.
</P>
<P>
   Acceptance will come, Dr. Picard said, only if it can be clearly
demonstrated that affective computing offers clear benefits to its
immediate users, not just to, say, market research companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Picard said there was little danger that computers would
become so competent at evaluating human feelings that they would
turn into the murderous Hal 9000 in ``2001: A Space Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotions are about internal feeling,'' Dr. Picard said. ``We
can't measure that. All we can measure are external expressions.
Often, true emotions are so powerful and so deep that they remain
undisclosed even to yourself.''

HOUSE PROUD: FIXING UP AN ADOBE HACIENDA MANANA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Tony Cohan is a novelist and travel writer. These passages
are adapted from his memoir to be published next week, ``On Mexican
Time'' (Broadway Books, $25).)  
 (bl)  
 By TONY COHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   During our fourth year of spending time in the Mexican mountain
town of San Miguel de Allende, I and my wife, the artist and
photographer Masako Takahashi, were taken to see a derelict house
with an interior courtyard, a stable and a small attached house.
Ravished by the possibilities, but daunted by the house's condition
and its price ($65,000), we nonetheless took the plunge. With time,
we came to understand that this house in fact completed us as much
as we completed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't say I didn't warn you,'' said Felipe, the real estate
agent, as he pulled a fat key ring out of his pocket. I stepped
back and looked up. The facades of Mexican houses, like their
Spanish and Moorish models, often reveal little of what lies
within. Still, the crumbling white cal (lime and whitewash) surface
had worn away almost entirely, revealing earlier coats of green,
blue and ocher. Chunks of plaster hung loose or were missing. The
molding along the roof's rim was broken off. Crushed beer cans,
candy bar wrappers and plastic bags clustered in the well of a
green shuttered window, its glass missing, its black iron flecked
with drips of hardened paint.
</P>
<P>
   Masako leaned close. ``What are we doing here?''
</P>
<P>
   The mesquite door shuddered open. Two small, dark birds exploded
into the sky beyond: ``golondrinas,'' swallows. An old iron
chandelier, stuffed with nests, hung by a chain from a dark wood
beam 20 feet overhead. Hearing chirps, I looked up to see three
chicks' raw, open mouths. Years of droppings stained the stones at
my feet.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead, through a tall arch, a giant, untrimmed avocado tree hung
over a leaf-strewn stone patio. Above a glass-enclosed room at its
far end, eroded walls exposed straw-and-mud adobe. One good summer
rain away from collapse, I figured.
</P>
<P>
   The front door slammed behind us. We stood uncertainly in the
darkness. Felipe pointed to a door inset into the wall a meter
deep. ``They don't build like that anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's watered anything in years,'' Masako said. Only a
tenacious crawling fern, brittle and yellowing, survived on the
slate-and-dirt patio floor. A scraggly papaya tree clung to a wall,
its splayed leaves frayed and dusty. Miraculously, it bore four fat
papayas along its trunk, blushing orange at their tips.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the dark entry, Felipe struggled with another key. A
door in the side wall burst open. I saw dead cockroaches on the
unglazed terra cotta floors, mounds of termite dust from the huge
pine crossbeams above. A ventilator hood hung over a void where a
stove might have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dining room,'' Felipe announced, throwing open the next
door. We stepped into a long rectangle with soaring walls, empty
but for a cobwebbed iron chandelier and an oak table. Still, it
wasn't hard to imagine the high, ample room filled with candles,
food, people. ``It reminds me of old palazzo rooms in Ravenna,
Assisi,'' Masako said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or Frida Kahlo's house.''
</P>
<P>
   The rear garden was little more than a broken path of loose
bricks through dirt and weeds. Masako pointed to a structure to our
right, a separate building along the north end. ``The old stable,''
Felipe said. Over 20 feet high and easily 40 feet long, it was
built of the same rock as the walls. I watched Masako taking in its
surfaces and dimensions. ``Your studio,'' I whispered to her.
</P>
<P>
   A steep stairway of bricks led to the roof. The cement roof was
strewn with crossed wires, discarded glass, pop bottles, tar,
broken tiles, abandoned tool parts. Gingerly picking my way toward
the front of the building, I stopped midway and looked up. Across
the ascending rooftops I saw the back of the parish church, La
Parroquia, two blocks away: a rare angle unavailable from the
street, one I'd never seen in a photo or postcard.
</P>
<P>
   In the dying sun, the town flared red, as if heated by some
inner forge. Glossy-eyed grackles wheeled toward La Parroquia
against the deepening sky. My heart began to race.
</P>
<P>
   I took the stairs down and rejoined Masako.
</P>
<P>
   ``So?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a junkyard up there,'' I said, ``with the best view of
San Miguel I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   What folly led us to project our dreams into this place? From
the dining room I watched three skinny teen-agers mix sand and
pebbles and cement with shovels and buckets of water on the patio
floor. Earlier cement mixes had hardened on the slate. Some
machismo code prevented the men from spreading ground cover before
working, and cleaning up was an afterthought, if a thought at all.
The walls they patch-painted with cal peeled almost overnight. In a
country where lots of people worked for little, worrying about
getting things to last seemed a kind of vice. More hours of work
was good, not bad.
</P>
<P>
   I carried my dictionary everywhere, claiming new words daily:
``goteras'' (leaks), ``escombro'' (debris), ``clavos'' (nails). I
learned that ``ahorita'' didn't mean ``right away,'' ``pronto''
didn't mean ``soon,'' and ``manana'' didn't always mean
``tomorrow.'' If someone said ``quince dias,'' two weeks, I was out
of luck.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing up places had never been our strong suit. The one time we
tried it in California we almost split up. We were full of ideas,
short on execution. Masako kept folders of clippings; but when it
was time to pull things together, she would rather be in her
studio. I spent too many young summers building and laying patios
to have much interest in doing more.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To avoid clashes, we worked out a scheme of territoriality. For
the kitchen, Masako's domain, she bought a blue stove and a shiny,
fire-engine-red refrigerator. ``At least they're fun,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, we took possession of our ruin. Each day we decoded a
little more of the original house, seeing structure and history
through the decay: our own house as archaeological dig. Casa de
Misterios, we called it, House of Mysteries. Gradually, we worked
on the house less and lived in it more. We tried to remember that
we had time, that having time was in fact the whole idea. We fought
the gringo urges to fall ``under the lash of completion,'' as one
writer put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get rid of those bathroom tiles,'' one of us
would say. ``We will,'' the other would answer. ``Ojala,'' that
expression meaning ``hopefully'' or ``God willing,'' with its
suggestion of surrender to fate, crept deeper into our vocabulary
the more we worked on the house.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, we had hot and cold water, new toilets and working
phones. Masako hung an entire side of the kitchen with tin votive
paintings. Pots and pans dangled from iron hooks above the blue
stove. In the dining room, an old wood ``trastero,'' a dish rack,
was stacked with bright ceramic cups and plates.
</P>
<P>
   Seasons passed. Summers we lingered in the cool, ample southern
rooms. When it got cold we warmed ourselves on the patio stones.
The house, little changed but for patched leaks, paint, furnishings
and plants, had become a refuge and work space. After five years,
we felt we knew the place a little.
</P>
<P>
   One day I decided to liberate the roof, that aerie of birds,
light and church spires I'd seen that first day. Most of my
neighbors didn't particularly value such views; they hewed to the
medieval enclosure, and their rooftops remained the province of
watchdogs and refuse. To use our roof we would have to build it
anew, add a veranda. But where to put the new stairway?
</P>
<P>
   Masako and I stalked the town, studying stair treatments,
balustrades, roofs, verandas. We became voyeurs of solutions,
design burglars. When we redid the roof, we decided, we would also
get rid of the chipped bathroom tiles, the dangling wires, the
missing glass. We would patch and paint, tend to all the things we
had never gotten around to.
</P>
<P>
   Here is where our ambitions usually tended to collapse,
subverted by the languid allure of the place. Our roof remodeling
seemed headed for that fate when a friend dropped by with a
contractor named Epifanio.
</P>
<P>
   Epifanio stood on the roof squinting in the sun, making tape
measurements, scribbling with an old ballpoint pen in the palm of
his hand. We drew diagrams of new stairs in the dirt with our
fingers. This is the way to build, I thought: architecture without
architects. We decided on a cantera stone stairway with an arch
over the dining room door.
</P>
<P>
   Each morning, we admitted a dozen strangers, forked out pesos
for obscure materials and services. Weeks passed: dust settled
permanently into our ears, our hair, our clothes. Leon, a tubby
mason with a sweet grin, began chipping boulders and adhering them
to smaller stones, building what was to become our stairs. The
stairway grew, stone by stone; but would it land flush at the roof
ledge? I had never seen him take a measure.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Leon's arching stairway, with its gentle weave
of river boulders and stones and cement, was up. It was beautiful,
the work of a true artisan. It looked as if it had been there for
centuries. Mounting the stairs to the roof at sunset for the first
time, we tasted completion.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A boy rescued at sea and brought to the United
States must be returned to Cuba to live with his father, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service said Wednesday, ruling in a
poignant tug-of-war that blended international politics with
age-old human emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This little boy, who has been through so much, belongs with
his father,'' the INS Commissioner, Doris Meissner, said. She said
the 6-year-old boy, Elian Gonzalez, must be reunited with his
father by Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meissner said immigration officials made their decision
after two extensive interviews in Cuba with the boy's father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez. She said the father had provided vivid and
extensive details of his bond with Elian, including family
photographs and medical and school records.
</P>
<P>
   Returning Elian to his father is ``the right decision legally,
it's the right decision morally,'' Ms. Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that the decision will be unpopular in some
quarters, and expressing the hope that there will be no resistance
to it, she urged people to ``respect the bond between parent and
child and respect the laws of the United States.'' She said
Attorney General Janet Reno had been notified of the INS decision
and backed it. The immigration agency is a branch of the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Elian has been not only a family issue but a
political one since a 17-foot aluminum boat carrying the boy and a
dozen other people capsized in the Caribbean six weeks ago as they
were trying to cross from Cuba to Florida. Ten people were killed,
including Elian's mother and stepfather. Elian survived, along with
two adults, and was rescued on Nov. 25 after clinging to an inner
tube for two days.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Elian unwittingly became the focus of an international
incident as well as a custody fight, with anti-Castro groups and
politicians in Miami embracing him and thousands of Cubans
protesting in Havana that he should be returned to the island
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's great-uncle and other relatives of his father have
wanted the child to stay with them in the United States for what
they see as a chance for a better life. But Gonzalez, who was
divorced from Elian's mother, and both sets of grandparents have
wanted him returned to their hometown, Cardenas, a port east of
Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meissner said the father ``wants Elian returned to him as
soon as possible.'' She said her agency had chosen the deadline of
Jan. 14 to assure both promptness and enough time for arrangements
to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner said the boy could be turned over to his father
in one of several ways. Elian's father might be granted permission
to come to the United States to pick up his son, a possibility that
has been discussed with the Cuban government. Or one of Elian's
relatives might simply take him to Cuba. Or a third party _ a
church organization, for instance _ might ease the transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The INS is ready to work with the family and others to make
appropriate arrangements for Elian to be reunited with his
father,'' Ms. Meissner said. ``We believe this decision can be
carried out without INS's taking charge of Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   That portion of the commissioner's statement seemed to address
the possibility that Elian's relatives in Florida might resist
sending him back, perhaps even to the point of secluding him. Ms.
Meissner fielded several questions on that issue, stating again and
again that she hoped people would respect American and
international law and ``the bond between parent and child.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner said the immigration office, having recognized
the father's right to speak for his son, would not acknowledge any
asylum petition that the boy's great-uncle in Miami might seek to
file to keep him in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The days ahead hold several possibilities, not all of them
easily anticipated. The commissioner was asked what her agency
would do if the father arrived in the United States, ostensibly to
pick up his son, then asked for permission to stay here with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can speculate on that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of repeated questioning about possible resistance to
Elian's return to Cuba, the commissioner promised official
flexibility. ``One step at a time,'' she said at one point. ``Let's
let this process go forward.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The case has already become a domestic political issue, and may
become a hotter one. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who is seeking
the Republican presidential nomination, has spoken in favor of
keeping the boy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   James Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee,
offered to pay for bringing Elian's entire family to Miami ``so
that we can learn for sure what his father wants _ free of
Communist coercion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meissner said Wednesday that the issue of coercion had been
addressed, but she repeated that American officials had found no
sign that Gonzalez was anything but a loving father eager to be
reunited with his son.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meissner deflected a question about whether her office had
considered the possible political difficulties for the Clinton
administration, repeating that adherence to the law and parental
rights had governed the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, President Clinton's spokesman, said the president
believed the immigration service had handled the matter fairly.
``They gathered the facts in a very comprehensive way and applied
the relevant rules and regulations and law fairly,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   J. Kelly Ryan, a lawyer for the immigration agency, said any
court challenge to the agency's decision was ``a separate matter.''

`SICK PUPPY': LOTS OF BAD-NATURED FLORIDIANS AND ONE GOOD-NATURED
DOG 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) (DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to find someone to root for in Carl Hiaasen's latest
over-the-edge comedy, ``Sick Puppy,'' about avarice and corruption
in what one of the novel's characters refers to as ``the swamp of
teeming greed known as Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of people to root against: the developers who
want to cement over the entire Florida shoreline, the lobbyists who
know which politicians to bribe to get the cementing done and the
politicians themselves, particularly Gov. Dick Artemis, a former
Toyota salesman who describes himself in interviews as ``a people
person's people person,'' inspiring groans from his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Hemmed in by such repellent riffraff, the reader's heart inches
out toward Twilly Spree, introduced by the text as ``an unemployed
26-year-old college dropout with a brief but spectacular history of
psychological problems.'' The narrator adds, ``Not incidentally, he
also had inherited millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   You want to like Twilly because he's for the right things. He
hates the developers and the despoilers of Florida's natural
beauty. The trouble is that he carries things a little far, having
been traumatized early in life by a developer-father who helped
ruin the skyline of Marco Island with ``a concrete picket of
towering hotels and high-rise condominiums.'' Twilly carries things
so far that early on we meet him in an anger-management course that
he has to take because he blew up his uncle's bank for lending
millions ``to a rock-mining company that's digging craters in the
Amazon River basin.''
</P>
<P>
   When the instructor suggests this might be acting out something
subconscious, Twilly announces that he has no subconscious; he
doesn't even dream. You want to like Twilly, but he's hard to
identify with.
</P>
<P>
   One day on the turnpike north of Yeehaw Junction, Twilly sees a
Burger King hamburger carton fly out the window of a Range Rover,
followed by a cup, a wadded paper napkin and another hamburger
carton. To punish the litterbug, Twilly follows him home and
arranges to have his wife's BMW convertible submerged in a ton of
garbage.
</P>
<P>
   When Twilly catches the driver littering again, he invades his
house and dognaps his big black Labrador retriever, Boodle, whom he
renames McGuinn after a favorite musician. When he discovers that
the dog's owner, Palmer Stoat, is a lobbyist helping a developer to
turn nearby Toad Island into ``a golfer's paradise,'' Twilly tries
to get him to stop by threatening the dog's life and sending Stoat
what appear to be parts of the animal, although in fact Twilly is
getting fond of McGuinn and wouldn't dream of harming him.
</P>
<P>
   The developers retaliate by sicking nasty people on Twilly. The
battle steadily escalates, and Hiaasen uses the resulting mayhem to
spit poison at all he finds excessive about Florida, where of
course he was reared and lives and writes a column for The Miami
Herald.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't so much that you grow fond of Twilly as that you come
to revile most of the characters surrounding him, who often edge
over into extremes. Besides the lobbyist Stoat, whose hobby is to
shoot crippled big-game animals at the Wilderness Veldt Plantation
near Ocala, there's the Toad Island developer, Robert Clapley, who
has a fetish for Barbie Dolls and is arranging to convert two of
his female friends into a life-size pair.
</P>
<P>
   There's the menacing Gash, who collects recordings of 911 calls
and sets them to music, including one from a hysterical man on a
cell phone in a plane that is about to crash near Duluth, who wants
the operator to cover for him by telling his wife why he isn't in
Eau Claire. There's the conservative call girl who sleeps only with
Republicans. There's the Toad Island project supervisor who hates
all nature because as a child he was bitten on his scrotum by a
chipmunk. There's the ex-governor who has retired to the Everglades
and survives by eating road kill.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Twilly, despite his unmanaged rage, seems
positively benign. And he improves as the story progresses, falling
in love with Stoat's beautiful, disaffected wife, Desirata, who
begins to tame him. He even starts to dream. But the character who
really keeps you involved in the plot is the black Lab,
Boodle-McGuinn, the literal ``sick puppy'' of the title (something
he swallowed has to be surgically removed), the less literal ones
being legion in the story.
</P>
<P>
   It is this galumphing creature that softens the novel's
brutality and brings out the occasional burst of joy in Hiaasen's
prose: ``That's the thing about being a Labrador retriever _ you
were born for fun. Seldom was your loopy, freewheeling mind
cluttered by contemplation, and never at all by somber worry; every
day was a romp. What else could there possibly be to life? Eating
was a thrill. ... And everywhere you went were gullible human
beings who patted and hugged and fussed over you.''
</P>
<P>
   It is this animal that with its innocent clowning lends the
story its moral perspective and gives some meaning to the novel's
message, delivered by the road-kill-eating ex-governor, an angry
counterpart to Twilly: ``I will tell you there's probably no peace
for people like you and me in this world. Somebody's got to be
angry or nothing gets fixed. That's what we were put here for.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone in ``Sick Puppy'' seems to be angry. But this
big, affectionate dog amid all the novel's cartoon sadism makes it
possible for the reader to laugh.

FOR DOOMSDAY HOARDERS, WHAT NOW? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Conn., Mont., Md.)   (bl)  
 By LYNN ERMANN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1950s, a small cult led by a suburban housewife believed
that on a given day, a flood would wipe out all mankind, except for
a few true followers who would be spared. In preparation, many sold
their homes and possessions or quit their jobs. When the world
didn't end as predicted, members of the sect still rejoiced:
obviously the world had been saved to reward their faith.
</P>
<P>
   Modest versions of this scenario appear to be taking place now
in homes across the country. While the Year 2000 crisis never
materialized, the most dedicated hoarders (they prefer the word
``storers'') are holding on to their 200 cans of tuna fish, 100
freeze-dried MREs (or meals ready to eat) and 55-gallon water tanks
as tightly as their convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Far from feeling humiliated, they express ``relief and gratitude
and a sense of abundance,'' said David Gershon, the president of
the Global Action Plan in Woodstock, N.Y., an organization that has
consulted with other Year 2000 groups around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Anderson, the founder of Y2K Women, a support network that
helped women prepare for contingencies, said that many members have
told her how empowering the experience has been. (She has also
received a few angry e-mails from those who felt they had been
persuaded to overstock.)
</P>
<P>
   Also upbeat is Kathleen Davis, the founder of Daniel Boone Y2K
Preparedness Group, in Berks County, Pa. Yes, she has 15 gallons of
kerosene, 15 more than she needs. (``I don't even know what I did
with the receipts,'' she said.) But she's been wanting to try out
kerosene lamps for a while. She also has a guard dog, which she and
her husband bought for Year 2000 protection and which she will keep
even though the bandits look like no-shows.
</P>
<P>
   There's the pool she bought for bathing in the event of water
shortages, but that's no problem, either. ``We always wanted a
swimming pool,'' she said. And anyway, she added, ``We are ready
for whatever might occur, anything else that might knock out the
infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many die-hard naysayers, Sandra Ghost, the author of ``Why
2K?'' (1998) and a resident of Meadville, Pa., is telling people to
hold on to their supplies for at least six months in case there are
residual effects from the Year 2000 computer flaw.
</P>
<P>
   Most consumers are dealing with much smaller stashes _ the
recommended three or four days' worth. Thirty percent of Americans
planned stockpiles, according to an Associated Press poll. Lisa
McCue, a spokeswoman for the Grocery Manufacturers of America, also
reports that there was no major rush on stores to buy last-minute
supplies. Serious storers started buying last year and bought a lot
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even those who just got the basics aren't returning items
or complaining: Year 2000 fears appear to have been a catalyst for
the kind of emergency buying that many consumers ordinarily put
off. Suddenly, that much-needed generator or flashlight was at the
top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot spokesman John Simley said generator sales have risen
significantly nationwide over the last year, a fact that he
hesitates to attribute only to Year 2000 fears. Gershon agrees.
``We bought stuff we would normally want anyway,'' Gershon said.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, returns of items appear to be minimal.
``Nobody's brought back a large quantity of anything,'' said Karen
Cervi, a cashier supervisor at the Stew Leonard's in Norwalk, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, at the Pioneer Supermarket on Columbus Avenue at
74th Street, where the water aisles were cleared out last week,
``No one is experiencing any returns,'' said the manager, Anthony
Scerri. ``Water sells. It's a commodity.''
</P>
<P>
   Return policies at local stores have varied, with a few stores
taking a harder line. Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. recently got some
criticism for insisting that customers pay a 20 percent restocking
fee for returning its generators.
</P>
<P>
   DeLollo's True Value Hardware in Watervliet, N.Y., which hung a
sign in the window saying, ``Y2K Are You Ready?'' refuses to take
generators or kerosene lamps back.
</P>
<P>
   Many major retailers, like the Home Depot, are sticking to their
regular return policies. Todd Hulquist, a spokesman for the Food
Marketing Institute, a trade group based in Washington that
represents food retailers, said, ``Our retailers are accepting
returns, with very little exceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Perishables are tougher to return, even vacuum-packed ones, said
Carole Munson, the chief executive of Millennium III Foods, a
manufacturer based in Belgrade, Mont. Millennium III, which sells
foods packed in double ceramic enameled cans, many over the
Internet, has a 10-day return policy but has thus far received no
returns.
</P>
<P>
   Food Plus, a distributor based in Smithtown, N.Y., that sells
Alpine-Aire freeze-dried products, many of them also online, told
customers up front that no returns would be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   This year might, in fact, become a record year for charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any canned-food drives will do very well this year,'' said
Steve Davis, the director of Coalition 2000, in Columbia, Md.
</P>
<P>
   America's Second Harvest, a nonprofit hunger relief
organization, hopes its millennium food drive on Jan. 15 _ to
redistribute food and supplies that many Americans stockpiled _
will attract donations.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ferry of Meadville, Pa., who had a substantial stash of
supplies, has started a local can collection out of his church.
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 preparations have also brought residents closer
together. Kathleen Davis, of Daniel Boone Y2K Preparedness, said,
``I came out of this with good friends I wouldn't have met
otherwise and neighbors I wouldn't have met.''

ON THE NET, IT'S GHENGHIS WHO? SPARSE GLORY FOR A CONQUEROR 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poor Genghis Khan. Work your way up from up tribal nomad to
world's most successful warlord, conquer large parts of Asia,
laying the groundwork for the largest contiguous empire ever known,
even become a political byword. And what does it get you? Precious
little on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Genghis (also spelled Chingis, Jinghis or Jenghiz) didn't help
his historical record by, apparently, taking much of his booty with
him; no grave or personal artifacts have ever been found.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Secret History of the Mongols,'' written decades after his
death in 1227, is the closest to a contemporary report. Since he
was initially contemptuous of cities, the sites of learning in
those days, there are few written records of him except by the
Mongols' enemies. Mongolia's Communist government banned references
to Genghis Khan _ Russia's conqueror _ until the government fell
(peacefully) in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But his memory is being revived again in a freer Mongolia, and,
while ``uplifted'' may be too strong a word, his bloodthirsty
reputation is being leavened by several online sites that stress
not just his massacres but also his genius at leadership and
unification, his role in bringing East and West together (it was
his grandson Kublai who welcomed Marco Polo to his new capital in
Beijing) and his animistic spiritualism, which fostered a simple,
rough equality.
</P>
<P>
   For those who aren't going to master Tajiki, Uighur and the
dozen or more other languages of the Mongol empire, this is a good
time to benefit from The Encyclopedia Brittanica's free site: see
the Genghis Khan entry at www.brittanica.com. Despite an iron sense
of loyalty, ``he was not obstinate and would listen to advice from
others, including his wives and mother,'' the entry concludes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a bibliography, Brittanica also has entries on
the Mongol Empire and the descendants of Genghis Khan, in
particular his son Ogodei and grandson Kublai.
</P>
<P>
   Per Inge Oestmoen, a student at the University of Oslo, has an
attractive site at http://home.powertech.no/pioe/index.html. ``The
main theme of the history of Chingis Khan is the breaking out of
existing barriers of the society in which one lives,'' he wrote in
an e-mail message.
</P>

   (The Secret History, he notes, lists the wolf and the doe as the
ancestors of Genghis and his people, and places a high value on the

<P>
   ``We ought to be able,'' Oestmoen writes, ``to distinguish
between war and warrior. That means to accept the warrior within
ourselves and, if need be, cultivate it without escalating it to
purposelessly destructive action.''
</P>
<P>
   Catriona McPherson's site,
members.tripod.com/whitebard/ca54.htm, notes, ``Skilled artists and
craftsmen, as well as scientists, physicians and astronomers, from
captured countries, were moved freely around the vast Mongol
empire.'' So were food recipes, she adds; one legacy of Genghis
Khan is sherbet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women of the Mongol Court,'' by Morris Rossabi 
(www.woodrow.org/teachers/world-history/teaching/mongol/women.html),
 gives accounts of notables like Sorghaghtani Beki, Kublai Khan's
mother, who, it is said, set the stage for all four of her sons to
become khans and insisted on literacy and religious toleration.
</P>
<P>
   Also mentioned is Kublai's niece Khutulun, who announced that
she would marry only a man who could out-wrestle her _ with a
100-horse bet. According to Marco Polo, she accumulated 10,000
horses and never married.
</P>
<P>
   Selections from Marco Polo's account of Genghis Khan and the
Tartars, an account whose authenticity is questioned by some
scholars, are available on Fordham University's Internet Medieval
Sourcebook Web site at
www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/mpolo44-46.html.
</P>
<P>
   And for a focus on mayhem, see ``Mongol Invasion of Europe'' by
Eric Hildinger, an online reprint from Military History magazine 
(www.thehistorynet.com/MilitaryHistory/articles/1997/06972(underscor
e)text.htm). It contrasts the Europeans, heavily armored for close
combat, with the Mongol warriors (all cavalrymen), most of them
armed only with a bow and little armor but a silk shirt that
enabled arrowheads to be withdrawn more easily.
</P>
<P>
   The conquest of Western Europe, the site suggests, was averted
mainly because Ogodei, Genghis' son, died in 1241, causing his
generals to return home rather than continue their successes.

SANTANA STAGES COMEBACK IN '99 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE GANAHL  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Carlos Santana was always a believer in
miracles. But even he might be having a hard time believing this
one.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year ago, more than three decades into his career, the
guitar master seemed to be sliding into ``remember-when'' status _
in which you get your star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and are
inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, all the
while struggling to remain relevant. But instead of going gently
into that good night, the 52-year-old rock legend became 1999's
musical comeback story of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Nominated Tuesday for a staggering 10 Grammy Awards (two in one
category) for his No. 1 best-selling album, ``Supernatural'' (now
pushing 7 million sold), Santana seems to have been touched by the
same magic he's spent his life trying to spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am deeply gratified to know that we were able to touch the
hearts and minds of a whole new generation of fans,'' Santana said
Tuesday in a statement. ``The response to ``Supernatural' has far
exceeded all our expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   But when you break it down, Santana's remarkable re-emergence
had less to do with his new-age views of the world than with
marketing savvy _ and a dose of old-fashioned luck.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, 1999 was the year the United States caught
on to Latin music in all its forms _ from the hip-shaking pop of
Ricky Martin and Jennifer Lopez to the straight-up rock of Mexican
superstars Mana. For Santana, who has never varied his guitar fury
more than a degree or two over the decades, it was more a matter of
waiting for the rest of the world to catch up to him.
</P>
<P>
   That, and to find new vehicles to carry his message to the
people. That's where the marketing genius _ whether planned or
unplanned _ came in.
</P>
<P>
   Santana, whose biggest hits from the '60s and '70s were covers
of other band's songs (Fleetwood Mac's ``Black Magic Woman,'' The
Zombies' ``She's Not There'' and Tito Puente's ``Oye Como Va''),
seemed to languish in the years when he was working solo. Albums
released in the past decade barely made a blip on the charts.
</P>
<P>
   But when Santana re-teamed with Arista president Clive Davis,
who originally had signed Santana in the late '60s, to collaborate
on ``Supernatural,'' it was Davis who suggested that the artist
team with a host of guest musicians. Given Santana's standing as
guitarist emeritus (inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
last year) and role model for the younger generation, it was not
hard to sign 'em up.
</P>
<P>
   Artists as formidable as Lauryn Hill, Dave Matthews and Eric
Clapton jumped at the chance to record duets with him.
</P>
<P>
   But it was up-and-coming vocalist Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20 who
found the perfect pairing for his pop songwriting sensibilities in
Santana's salsa tempos. The result was the irresistible ``Smooth,''
a perfect hybrid of classic rock and Latin pop that was the year's
No. 1 single _ atop the charts for 12 consecutive weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And it's what put ``Supernatural'' into the record books.
</P>
<P>
   Released in June at the No. 19 slot on Billboard's Top 200,
``Supernatural'' did the unheard of: It slowly crept up to No. 1
after four months on the chart. (These days, the normal pattern is
to debut high and then sink, often like a stone.) Then again, when
you consider how many radio markets have been affected by the
album's singles, the snowball effect is not as surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Latin stations are spinning ``Da Le Yaleo''; adult contemporary
stations are playing, besides ``Smooth,'' Matthews' beautiful
``Love of My Life''; modern rock stations play Santana's
collaboration with Everlast, ``Put Your Lights On''; urban
contemporary stations are playing ``Maria Maria'' with hip-hopper
Wyclef Jean.
</P>
<P>
   Across the board, ``Supernatural'' has proved enormously
appealing. The full list of Santana's nominations are: album of the
year, record of the year (``Smooth''), song of the year
(``Smooth''), best pop collaboration with vocals (two nominations,
for ``Smooth'' with Thomas and ``Love of My Life'' with Matthews),
best pop instrumental (``El Farol''), best rock duo (``Put Your
Lights On,'' with Everlast), best rock instrumental (``The
Calling'' with Clapton), best rock album, best pop performance by a
duo or group with vocal (``Maria Maria'' with Wyclef), and best
instrumental composition (``El Farol'').
</P>
<P>
   Other local nominees: The San Francisco Symphony (three for
Michael Tilson Thomas and the orchestra's Stravinsky recordings;
one for the Symphony Chorus' ``Christmas by the Bay''),
Chanticleer, Green Day, Metallica, Charlie Musselwhite, Ramblin'
Jack Elliott and Robert Cray.
</P>
<P>
   The 42nd annual Grammys will air live on CBS on Feb. 23 from the
Staples Center in Los Angeles.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Steven Handel stood on top of a mountain of
garbage, 150 feet above Richmond Creek, and imagined woodlands and
meadows rambling over the Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest landfill in the world,'' said Handel, a
plant ecologist at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J. ``But
you have to have vision. Imagine this as a developing oak forest.
Or a stand of red cedars, or a wildflower meadow. With 3,000 acres,
we could bring back some plants which are locally uncommon.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe make it a park four times the size of Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, New York City's Sanitation Department hired
Handel to research the possibilities of reclaiming this vast mound
of garbage _ where the city's waste has been dumped for 60 years _
to restore native habitats, like coastal plain woodlands and
grassland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not some romantic, `Let's bring back the forest primeval that
Henry Hudson saw,''' Handel said. ``But, `What is possible here?'''
</P>
<P>
   The natural resources group of the Parks and Recreation
Department has restored the salt marshes along the channels and
creeks. Handel and his students are concentrating on what native
plants might thrive on the mounds of trash.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, barges used to bring as much as 27,000 tons of
garbage a day here; now they bring about 6,000 tons. And sanitation
engineers are racing to reduce that stream to zero by Dec. 31,
2001, the city's deadline for the closing of the Fresh Kills
landfill.
</P>
<P>
   Handel and his students demonstrated the potential of
restoration ecology _ the study of rehabilitating devastated
ecosystems _ for the Hacksensack Meadowlands Development
Commission, on 16 acres of the old Kearney, N.J., landfill, as a
pilot for revegetating degraded areas along the New Jersey
Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   And with 6,000 landfills across the country all eventually faced
with the problem of what to do after closing, Handel is in the
forefront of a rapidly growing field in ecology.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to think that you had to go to a wild place like
Costa Rica to do something important in ecology,'' said Handel, who
grew up in the honky-tonk, sandy reaches of Far Rockaway, Queens.
``But now ecologists realize we have to go where people live, to
protect the water, the air.'' His scientist's eye flickered at
something up on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look! There's a redtail.'' The bird floated over the thick
grass of an old covered mound of trash. ``Probably chasing voles.''
It's amazing what does survive here, but it's nothing like the
original landscape, when a tidal creek flowed against the terminal
moraine, full of oaks, tulip trees, beech and maples.
</P>
<P>
   But still, on a good day, the estuaries are full of skimmers and
egrets.
</P>
<P>
   And what a view of Gotham! To the north, the World Trade Center
towers shimmered in the haze, the Bayonne Bridge arched over the
water to New Jersey. To the west, tugs pulled 600-ton garbage
barges from Arthur Kill to Fresh Kill, the Dutch names for the
tidal estuaries that meander through Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   There's a powerful beauty to this wasteland. Hydraulic cranes
with huge toothed buckets chomp waste from barges docked on the
edge of the creeks and drop it onto loading stations, where
front-end loaders lift it onto monstrous trucks. From our vantage
point, atop an old mound capped years ago, the scene was
incongruously peaceful. Seagulls fluttered over the garbage barges.
It didn't even smell.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of care taken by the sanitation crew,'' Handel
said, pointing out the booms stretching into the water to keep
trash from straying into the harbor and the fences circling the
tops of the active mounds to corral windblown litter.
</P>
<P>
   Giant perforated pipes stuck into the mounds capture methane
from decomposing garbage and funnel it to a boxy-looking recovery
plant near the West Shore Expressway, where it is cleaned and sold
to Brooklyn Union Gas Co. (Think of it: you may have garbage
heating your house.) We looked down on neat windrows of leaves and
chipped wood quietly composting, piles of concrete and asphalt
being crushed into building materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the kids I bring up here say they'll never look at garbage
the same way again,'' Handel said. Two experiments, one financed by
the city with $250,000, and the other with $430,000 from the
National Science Foundation, are trying to answer key questions
about how plants colonize degraded habitats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The engineers who designed this had one thing in mind,'' he
said. ``To not let the soil erode. So they planted perennial
grasses, mowed it and walked away.'' Such areas, costly to mow,
provide a pretty sterile habitat for diverse plants and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Handel first experimented with planting clusters of 50 different
trees and shrubs up the face of two covered garbage mounds. Some,
like wild black cherry and arrowroot, died because they couldn't
take the wind and dry, sterile soil.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``So we tried hackberry, gray dogwood and sumac, which can
tolerate drought,'' he said. ``And those did beautifully.'' But a
covered landfill's tough turf does not attract enough birds and
insects to disperse seeds.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1993, Handel and three other ecologists _ Joan Ehrenfeld
of Rutgers, Jennifer Mattei of Sacred Heart University in
Connecticut and George Robinson of the State University at Albany _
began a more extensive, National Science Foundation-financed study.
They planted 20 clusters of trees and shrubs on a landfill slope
close to the West Shore Expressway. Each cluster had the same seven
species, but some had more plants than others.
</P>
<P>
   Would fewer birds and bees come to the smaller clusters of
plants? How high would shrubs have to be for fruit-eating birds to
perch, defecating thousands of seeds to the ground below? How far
do such clusters have to be from the oak or maple forest remnants
on the island to benefit from creatures and wind carrying seeds out
of these living gene pools?
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to jump-start the succession of plants that occur
naturally in abandoned fields. But initial plantings produced
almost no offspring, and there was very little germination of new
species, except for invasive types like ailanthus and multiflora
rose. Theorizing that the thick grass cover discouraged
germination, the ecologists cleared a patch of grass next to each
cluster last August, to see what would take root on the bare
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know seeds came in by the thousands last fall,'' Handel
said. ``So we'll see what comes up this spring. We want to convince
the city to plant different grasses.''
</P>
<P>
   The soil has to change, too. ``It's not good enough to support a
diverse woodland,'' he said. ``That's why the first plantings
died.'' About three or four feet of compost would be ideal.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Gleason, the city's director of landfill engineering,
understands the need for different vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Native grasses reinforce the soil better,'' he said. ``They're
more drought-tolerant, and they enhance other habitat
development.''
</P>
<P>
   What Gleason and other landfill engineers are most concerned
about is protecting environmental controls, like the methane gas
pipes and ground water protection systems. ``Open land is worth a
lot of money, but you can't build big commercial buildings or
industrial facilities here,'' he said. ``The options are limited,
so that helps protect the environmental engineering. And vegetation
can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   City planners say it is premature to comment on the possible
uses for Fresh Kills, but Parks Commissioner Henry Stern is already
conjuring visions of the city's largest park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it could be a Garden of Eden, a natural wilderness,''
Stern said. ``Another could be a forest primeval. Then you could
have active uses, like baseball, soccer, tennis. There's room for a
golf course. It's a golden opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Up on the mound, Handel sniffed the wind and grinned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine a little marina down on the creek with rowboats,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably a good thing Handel didn't leave New York for
Costa Rica. The urban wilderness needs him more.

 &HT;    Jay-Z takes it to the streets with cutting-edge `Vol. 3'
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, a primer for those who may have just heard about this
rapper last month after he was charged with a stabbing at a club.
No, he's not Puffy.
</P>
<P>
   While they both have an affinity for an infectious hook, Puffy
probably wishes he could write like this (while this guy probably
wishes he had Puffy's bank account).
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, this is Jay-Z, named after the ``J'' and ``Z'' subway
trains that run in Brooklyn's Marcy Projects, where he grew up. His
mother named him Shawn Carter. Fans refer to him as ``Jigga'' and
``Hova.'' And after this follow-up to the biggest album of his
career, you can call him anything but a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   Jay-Z's fourth album consists of 15 testaments that selling
5-million records and having suburban preteen girls singing along
with the Broadway hook on his Grammy-winning ``Hard Knock Life''
single haven' diverted his attention from the hard streets to the
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   The melodies on his first single ``Do It Again'' and ``It's
Hot'' are intricate and harder to get around than the ``Jigga
Whats'' and ``Can I Get As ...'' on ``Vol. 2.'' And while there's
still a lot of talk about the diamonds he wears and the cars he
drives _ as on last summer's favorite ``Money Ain't a Thing'' _
there's more well-told, cinematic tales of the less shiny things,
such as the conflicts of drug dealing in a ghetto (``Dope Man'')
and the troubles success can attract (``There's Been a Murder'').
</P>
<P>
   This obviously uncommercial-minded effort picks up where his
underappreciated first album, ``Reasonable Doubt,'' left off,
forcing listeners to consider (and appreciate) Jay-Z for what you
hear right now. Not what you might have heard about him last month.
Or on his last album, for that matter.

<P>
   ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Windmills of Your Mind'' is still on the soundtrack, in
subdued jazz mode. But the big hats, the seductive chess game and
even the bank are gone from the remake of ``The Thomas Crown
Affair.'' Good riddance.
</P>
<P>
   The revamp from director John McTiernan (``Die Hard'') appraises
the 1968 Steve McQueen-Faye Dunaway caper flick for what it was: a
lively, sexy piece of junk whose main purpose was to give
moviegoers a taste of livin' large.
</P>
<P>
   More than three decades later, McTiernan and his screenwriters
know it's the same thing. Sure, we want to find out if billionaire
Thomas Crown (Pierce
</P>
<P>
   Brosnan) will get away with his part-time hobby of stealing
priceless impressionist paintings, or if solo investigator
Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) will pin the theft on him, before,
during or after their extended sex scene in his lavish townhouse.
</P>
<P>
   But really, that townhouse is the real reason for the movie. Oh,
yeah, and the tropical island getaway he whisks Catherine to. And
that sheer, no-underwear dress Catherine wears to the black-tie
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crown'' is a guilt-free pleasure, a way to waste a couple of
hours happily. Brosnan makes an appealing gentleman rogue. But the
movie belongs to Russo, whose pleasure is almost palpable as she
prowls around the screen savoring a smart, sexed-up character who's
not above sunbathing nude for viewers' prurient interests. Grade: B

   The star of the movie and the soundtrack ``Next Friday,'' Ice
Cube, proves once again capable of crafting music suitable for both
strip clubs and dance floors _ on one song. His come-on, ``You Can
Do It,'' bounces with as much amiability as ``We Be Clubbin'''
(also from an Ice Cube soundtrack). R&AMP;B singer Aaliyah delivers ``I
Don't Wanna'' in as interesting a fashion as the earlier hit ``Are
You That Somebody?'' (also from a soundtrack). And Atlanta rapper
Lil' Zane makes an even more confident bow on ``Money Stretch''
than pioneering gangster rap act N.W.A.'s reunion on ``Chin
Check.'' Both of which, by the way, are on this appropriately
leisurely soundtrack.

 &HT;    Hollywood's heavy-hitting flicks pull no punches
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Denzel Washington gives a one-two punch of a performance in
``The Hurricane'' (opening Friday in metro Atlanta) that could lead
him to an Oscar nomination. But he's hardly the first actor ever to
step into the ring, and his is hardly the first movie to use boxing
as part of a larger theme.
</P>
<P>
   Racism in America in ``The Great White Hope.'' Following your
dream or following the money in ``Golden Boy.'' Fathers and sons in
``The Champ.'' Sylvester Stallone and his ego in the ``Rocky''
series. Barbra Streisand and her ego in ``The Main Event.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few other worthy contenders:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Raging Bull'' (1980): This could be the all-time champ of
boxing flicks. The critics certainly thought so; they voted it the
best movie of the decade for the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Middleweight champion of 1949, Jake La Motta (played with
luggish authority by Robert De Niro) is shown by director Martin
Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader to be a champ almost in
spite of himself. But the film, co-starring Cathy Moriarity and Joe
Pesci and shot in luminous, almost surreal black and white, is
nothing but class. It's a whirling dervish of a picture, impelled
by a force as irresistible as whatever drove the thick-headed La
Motta to the top of his game.
</P>
<P>
   De Niro's Oscar-winning performance floats like a butterfly
while Scorsese's electrifying direction stings like a bee. What
else can we say? It's a knockout.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Champion'' (1949): Kirk Douglas became a bonafide star (and
an Oscar nominee) thanks to his portrayal of Midge Kelley, a
ruthless, manipulative and unscrupulous boxer who fights his way to
the championship but screws over everyone who helped him get there.
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, producer Stanley Kramer recalls that
Douglas, then not well-known, was so eager to get the job that he
ripped off his shirt at the interview to show off his muscles. In
his autobiography, Douglas tells the same story but insinuates that
he bared his chest because he sensed the producer wanted him to
(``I'm probably the only man in Hollywood who's had to strip to get
a part,'' he wrote). Either way, they both agree that Douglas did
his own boxing and was darn convincing.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Set-Up'' (1949): This gritty little flick came out the
same year as ``Champion,'' and many film buffs think it's the
better movie.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ryan gives a memorably
</P>
<P>
   poignant performance as an over-the-hill boxer gearing up for
one last bout _ one he's supposed to lose (his trainer has already
taken the payoff from a local mobster). Ryan captures the sport's
devastating yin/yang of macho and masochism as he pulls together
whatever he's got left, determined not to take the dive.
</P>
<P>
   Director Robert Wise shot the picture in real time, a gimmick
used more famously a few years later in ``High Noon.'' And look for
celebrated New York photographer Weegee in a cameo as the
timekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Fat City'' (1972): John Huston's grimly effective film is
set on the third-rate circuit of rundown gymnasiums, cheap fights
and boxers either on their way down or on their way nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Keach, in a role originally intended for Marlon Brando, is
the punch-drunk has-been and a young Jeff Bridges is his
less-than-promising protege. Huston used a lot of nonprofessionals
in the movie, including a kid from a local high school who
apparently showed something a little extra. When Huston screened
the picture for Muhammad Ali, ``The Greatest'' stood up and
shouted, ``Stop the picture! That's me up there!''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Somebody Up There Likes Me'' (1956): Director Wise gets back
in the ring, this time with a young Paul Newman and a more
uplifting story.
</P>
<P>
   Newman plays real-life middleweight champ Rocky Graziano, who
battled his way out of poverty and reform school to make it in the
ring. Interestingly, the part was initially supposed to be played
by James Dean, but Dean had just smashed himself into legend. And
look for another up-and-comer, Steve McQueen, making his screen
debut in a bit part that paid $19 a day.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``When We Were Kings'' (1996): This Oscar-winning documentary
ostensibly focuses on ``The Rumble in the Jungle,'' the 1974
heavyweight bout in Zaire between Ali and George Foreman. But at
heart it's an unabashed tribute to Ali and his larger-than-life
presence in our nation's cultural and political history. He really
was ``The Greatest.'' He still is.

Journal-Constitution.

 &HT;    Breakfast recipes worth waking up for
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no other meal where folks fall into a rut like they do
with breakfast. Day after day, it's the same cereal or the same
sausage biscuit from the drive-through. Day after day the same
loads of sugar, fat and sodium. It's exactly how we should not
start each morning.
</P>
<P>
   Research by the University of North Carolina shows adult
breakfast eating habits break down like this:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  22 percent eat bread, bagels, English muffins or similar
items.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  17 percent eat cold cereal.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  15 percent eat eggs (with or without bacon, toast, cereal or
other foods).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  15 percent eat pastries (like doughnuts) and/or coffee or a
soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  6 percent eat just fruit or juice.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  4 percent eat hot cereal.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  17 percent eat nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Below we offer recipes that should appeal to all tastes, even
those who usually eat nothing. The recipes are easy. Many can be
made ahead and are ideal for the grab-and-go commuter or those who
often eat ``deskfast'' (breakfast at your desk). Best of all, they
are healthy.

   This recipe takes advantage of many healthier options, such as
reduced-fat link sausage and egg substitute, to create a delicious
casserole. It's a nice weekend option, especially when there's
company in the house. Our tester preferred the low-fat cheese over
the fat-free version and suggested some might want to try bulk
turkey sausage instead of links.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable oil spray
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound (8 ounces) reduced-fat smoked link sausage
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons maple syrup
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds frozen country-style hash browns (no oil added)
</P>
<P>
   2 cups fat-free milk
</P>
<P>
   Egg substitute equivalent to 6 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 slices (2 ounces) fat-free or low-fat American cheese, diced
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely snipped green onion (green part only),
optional
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly spray a 13-by-9-by-2-inch
baking pan with vegetable oil spray.
</P>
<P>
   Heat a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Saute sausage for 3
to 4 minutes, or until browned, turning occasionally. Wipe skillet
with a paper towel.
</P>
<P>
   Add maple syrup and cook for 1 minute, stirring to coat sausage.
Arrange in a single layer in baking pan, then top with hash browns.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the milk, egg substitute, mustard
and pepper. Pour over hash browns. Sprinkle American cheese and
Parmesan cheese on top.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 1 hour, or until center is set. Sprinkle with green
onions and let cool for at least 10 minutes before cutting in
squares.
</P>
<P>
   Tip: If you prepare this casserole the night before, cover the
unbaked dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Put the cold
casserole in a cold oven, set the oven at 350 degrees, and bake for
1 hour and 15 minutes. Sprinkle with green onions and let cool for
at least 10 minutes before cutting in squares. _ From: ``The New

 &HT;    CANDIDATES HAVE HISTORY OF HELPING FINANCIAL BACKERS, STUDY SAYS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ All the major presidential contenders have used
their government positions to do favors for longtime financial
backers, concludes an 18-month study released Wednesday by the
non-partisan Center for Public Integrity.
</P>
<P>
   In a kind of consumer guide for voters, the group explores the
candidates' big-money patrons. Those relationships are ``seldom
acknowledged or discussed publicly,'' but play a central role in
the electoral process, said Charles Lewis, executive director of
the Washington-based group.
</P>
<P>
   The study, titled ``The Buying of the President 2000,'' reports:
</P>
<P>
   _ Vice President Al Gore, despite his Boy Scout image, has ties
to more than a half-dozen political ``money people'' who are under
ethical clouds. Among them, his campaign chairman Tony Coelho
resigned from the House amid charges of financial impropriety. One
of Gore's fund-raisers, Maria Hsia, faces trial early this year on
charges of making illegal contributions, and another, Howard
Glicken, was convicted of seeking a donation from a foreign
national.
</P>
<P>
   The study also raised questions about the Gore ``reinvention''
plan for the federal government, which included a proposal to sell
off the 47,000-acre Elk Hills oil and gas field in California. The
reserves, long sought by the oil industry, were bought by
Occidental Petroleum, a company with long-standing financial ties
to Gore and his father, the late Sen. Albert Gore Sr. of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore campaign spokeswoman, Laura Quinn, said Wednesday that
the proposal to sell the oil field had been first offered by the
Reagan administration. ``Basically 22 companies bid on it.
Occidental was the highest bidder,'' she said, adding that the
selling price was 50 percent more than the Congressional Budget
Office had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   _ Republican Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was ``enriched'' by
his relationships with wealthy associates, and he, in turn,
appointed them to top positions and backed their causes, according
to Lewis and his researchers.
</P>
<P>
   In a little-known episode, the report found that Harvard
University, where Bush earned a business degree, came to the rescue
of Bush's oil exploration company, Harken Energy Corp. Harvard's
endowment managers, who included at least one director with ties to
the Bush family, invested about $20 million in the then-struggling
company just a month after Bush came on its board. The investment
turned sour in 1990, with a loss of millions of dollars, but Bush
sold most of his shares two months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Wrinn, spokesman for the university, denied that personal
ties had any bearing on the stock purchase. ``Harvard would never
be so irresponsible as to make multimillion investments based on a
personal connection,'' he said. ``Harvard would like every
investment to come out ahead, but they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the backing from the school helped steady Bush's
investment and produce capital for his stake later in the Texas
Rangers baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bill Bradley, a former New Jersey senator and the only other
major Democratic candidate, has fostered the image of a reformer.
Yet as a member of the Senate, he was a leading ``junketeer.''
During his last year in Congress, Bradley took 29 of these
all-expenses-paid trips, the most of any senator, said the report.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that Bradley, who champions tax reform,
sought special breaks for pharmaceutical companies that were major
campaign contributors. From 1986 to 1993, he introduced at least 45
bills to reduce taxes on imported chemicals, the book said.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Ludecke, a spokeswoman for the Bradley campaign,
defended Bradley's congressional travels as mostly financed by
research groups and universities. She said of the tax breaks for
the imported chemicals: ``They lowered drug costs to consumers and
the chemicals are used to treat diseases like leukemia. So it's all
in how you look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., won qualified praise from Lewis for
being the one candidate willing to admit that contributions can
sway political leaders. However, the report recites McCain's ties
to Charles H. Keating Jr., the real estate developer who gave
McCain campaign funds, family vacations, and rides on his corporate
jet.
</P>
<P>
   After Keating was exposed as having caused a major collapse in
the savings and loan industry, McCain repaid him for the vacations,
wrote a check to the U.S. Treasury for $112,000 Keating had donated
to his campaigns, and became a promoter of campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the report said that McCain's legislative work closely
tracks the interests of major contributors, including the regional
telephone company U.S. West. The company, which has donated more
than $107,000 to McCain, would benefit from the senator's proposed
legislation to deregulate the Internet. McCain, answering such
charges, has argued that as chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee he deals with most of the sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a long-shot candidate with a squeaky
clean image, accepted a championship ring from former heavyweight
boxer Muhammad Ali in 1988. Hatch had announced he would sponsor
legislation to reinstate Ali's $50 million lawsuit against the
federal government for prosecuting him for draft evasion during the
Vietnam war. The conviction was later overturned.
</P>
<P>
   After much criticism at home for accepting the valuable ring,
Hatch dropped the legislative effort on Ali's behalf. The Hatch
campaign declined to comment on the incident.

 &HT;    Whether losing weight or just trying to eat right, make it a
better day with an energy boost from a real breakfast
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a new millennium, a new century, a new year and a new day.
</P>
<P>
   But chances are, many are struggling with the same old
resolutions _ to lose weight and eat right. If you want to succeed
this time, it's best to get off to a good start.
</P>
<P>
   Eat breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you tremendous energy. You can think better, learn
better and do better,'' said Ellen Haas, former U.S. Undersecretary
of Agriculture for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services. She's
written a new cookbook, ``Great Adventures in Food'' (St. Martin's
Press, $25), devoted to good eating that includes an entire chapter
on breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's all this scientific evidence that shows children who
eat breakfast do better on tests. And I think this applies to
adults in their work, too,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does breakfast give fuel for a morning's work, it
provides at least a quarter of the daily nutritional needs and
moderates the appetite throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Moffatt, general manager of Weight Watchers in the Atlanta
area, said members are always urged to eat breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you skip breakfast, by the time you get to lunch, you are
really hungry,'' explained Moffatt. ``That increases the chance
you'll make inappropriate food choices by grabbing the first thing
available, and you may overeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Rosenbloom, a nutrition professor at Georgia State
University, agreed. ``Almost 90 percent of dieters skip breakfast.
It's not a good idea and contributes to the high failure rate of
dieters.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad habit doesn't belong to dieters alone. Surveys have
shown that nearly 75 percent of Americans skip breakfast at least
once a week. ``It's really the easiest meal of the day to
prepare,'' said Rosenbloom, ``but I think many people just need to
make it a habit again.''
</P>
<P>
   That old standby of cereal, milk and juice provides
carbohydrates, protein, vitamins and minerals and generally takes
little more than 5 minutes to prepare and eat. For folks who eat at
home, Rosenbloom suggests putting the cereal bowl, spoon and glass
out on the kitchen table the night before. Fruit such as oranges
can be sectioned and put in baggies.
</P>
<P>
   No time to sit down at the breakfast table in the morning? There
are many portable breakfast foods that don't come from the
drive-through window of a fast food restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bagel with low-fat cream cheese, a tortilla with leftovers
rolled up in it ... many things are better than a fried chicken
biscuit,'' Rosenbloom said. ``The same juice packs you buy for the
kids work just as well for you while you are driving to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, we offer some ideas that should make breakfast tempting.
Morning Glory muffins, chock-full of carrots, raisins and sunflower
seeds, are ideal grab-and-go fare. Or how about making a low-fat
blueberry coffeecake on Sunday, then indulging in a leftover slice
on your Monday-morning commute?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just give yourself time to make breakfast a habit again,''
urges Rosenbloom. ``You'll see how much better you'll feel.''

 &HT;    Popularity of Lemon curd spans the globe
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Although delicious lemon curd is available in
specialty food shops, Martha Cawthon of Decatur, Ga., wrote asking
for a recipe to make her own after a fruitless search through her
cookbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Readers sent dozens they had gathered from around the globe.
Frances Smith of Atlanta got hers from a British friend when she
lived in Venezuela; Phoebe Payne of Lilburn, Ga., sent one from her
high school ``domestic science'' cookbook in England from the late
1930s; Joyce Esterhuizen of Alpharetta, Ga., sent a South African
version; Margaret Pavey of Kennesaw, Ga., sent the recipe from
Harrod's in London; Nancy Bennett of Atlanta sent the formula her
grandmother used incorporating lemons she grew in Santa Paula,
Calif.; Patti Hamilton of Marietta, Ga., sent her husband's
family's recipe from Vancouver; and Angela Stone e-mailed one she
uses from an Australian cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe from the cookbook ``Feast of Scotland'' was sent by
Kim Clower of Fayetteville, Ga., who is from Scotland and says it
is her favorite.
</P>
<P>
   While it says to seal in warm jars as you would when making jam
or jelly, other recipes say to cover and refrigerate until needed.
Properly canned and kept in a cool, dry place, it will keep about 2
weeks. Refrigerated and covered well, it will keep more than a
month.
</P>
<P>
   You may not be able to keep it that long, however, as it goes
well on all kinds of desserts like warm gingerbread, and it is good
on scones, bagels and even plain toast.

A WILD RIDE THAT'S NOT OVER YET FOR LONDON'S FERRIS WHEEL

 By FRED BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ They had promised their children a New Year's Eve ride
on the British Airways London Eye, the 450-foot Ferris wheel that
stands over the Thames across from Big Ben.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, David Marks and Julia Barfield, the husband-and-wife
architects who designed the structure, had to entertain their
family on the ground. The children _ plus several hundred guests of
British Airways, the wheel's primary sponsor _ were unable to ride
after it failed an 11th-hour inspection.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Barfield and Marks, who went into debt to get the $40
million dollar wheel built, the failure of a clutch mechanism in
one of its 32 passenger compartments was only the latest indignity.
There were problems in October raising the 1,500-ton structure,
which was constructed horizontally over the Thames, then hoisted to
its vertical position. A few days later, nine environmentalists
climbed the wheel and stayed overnight, in a protest against dam
construction in India.
</P>
<P>
   Now this. Jamie Bowden, a British Airways spokesman, said the
clutch failed during a Dec. 30 simulation and that it is being
disassembled and tested. He said: ``If we have found a `rogue'
clutch, it could be fixed by possibly the end of this week.'' If
the problem is not just with that clutch, repairs could take
longer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was a bit gutted,'' said Marks, using a Britishism
for disappointed. Yet he and Ms. Barfield, who have lived in the
same modest South London house for 25 years, are philosophical.
``It was still a great New Year's Eve,'' Marks said. The couple
were honored by Tony Blair (``We're now MBE's,'' he said) and got
to see the wheel illuminated by fireworks. Said Marks, ``A friend
called from Wilkes-Barre, Pa., to tell us how gorgeous the wheel
looked on TV.'' He added, ``We're chuffed,'' which, he explained,
means happy.
</P>
<P>
   The mixed emotions _ gutted and chuffed _ were shared by 250
Britons, who had won tickets to the wheel's debut in a national
competition. As compensation, British Airways said it would give
them round-trip tickets to any of its destinations, and it promised
rain checks when the wheel opens. Bowden said he's still hoping for
Feb. 1, with a celebration two weeks later, on Valentine's Day.
(Several hundred Londoners have applied to be married on the
wheel.)
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, when the couple proposed the wheel, their small
South London architecture firm was in the midst of a recession.
``We proposed it as something uplifting for the country for the
millennium and, frankly, something uplifting for ourselves,'' Marks
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said computers allowed them to design an unusually thin
wheel. ``It's twice as tall as the original Ferris wheel, in
Chicago,'' he said, ``but only half the weight.''
</P>
<P>
   The lightness also meant the wheel needed few supports, and that
it could be cantilevered over the Thames. That, said Marks, who has
ridden the wheel several times, means that ``as soon as you get
into the capsule, you're experiencing an amazing view.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Marks and Ms. Barfield, both 47, had no reason to assume
their wheel would be built. Then, a London newspaper, The Evening
Standard, made the structure, said to be the world's largest Ferris
wheel, a pet cause. Said Marks, ``They interviewed celebrities
about the idea, and only published the favorable quotes.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Marks and Ms. Barfield formed a corporation and
began seeking sponsors, a process that, they say, left them heavily
in debt. ``It's almost as if people test you, to see how much
you're willing to sacrifice to get it built,'' Marks said, during
an interview in December at his home, where he and his wife were
both suffering from the flu. They admit to spending too much time
away from their three children during the years they devoted to the
wheel. When their son, Benjamin, now 13, presented Ms. Barfield
with a painting of the wheel for her recent birthday, they
considered it a peace offering.
</P>
<P>
   The wheel's 32 capsules, shaped like Airstream trailers and
hanging from the wheel like jewels, will each hold 25 passengers.
The ride will take 30 minutes, and is, Marks said, ``an efficient
way to get people up to great heights.'' (On a clear day, the view
will take in Windsor Castle, 25 miles away.) So far, more than half
a million tickets have been sold at 7.45 pounds and 4.95 pounds for
children, about $12 and $8, meaning the sponsors could well make
back their investment. The wheel is expected to remain up for five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ms. Barfield and Marks, who let the rest of their
architectural practice languish during their wheel years, say they
need to focus on finding other work.
</P>
<P>
   Eight miles east of their wheel, the Millennium Dome, which cost
30 times as much (and was paid for by a national lottery), is
languishing. (The couple, who both worked for its architect,
Richard Rogers, say he has been very supportive of their competing
project.) The Guardian's architecture critic, Jonathan Glancey,
called the dome ``a '70s mall in a grimy tent.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the wheel has been a crowd pleaser. Even Richard
Branson, whose Virgin Airways competes with British Airways,
praised the wheel's beauty, adding, ``It's the best thing British
Air has done in 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   One Londoner observed, ``It's captured the imagination, so
people are forgiving of its problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barfield, at her home in South London (where the biggest
wheel is on her daughter's hot pink bicycle), displayed a Christmas
card from the family's dentist. It featured a drawing of the
Millennium Dome, under a gentle snowfall, Currier &AMP; Ives style.
Next year, she hopes, the card will show the millennium wheel.

A CHILD'S GUIDE TO THE WORLD OF KNOWLEDGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMON &AMP; SCHUSTER NEW MILLENNIUM CHILDREN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA
</P>
<P>
   AND REFERENCE LIBRARY DELUXE 2000
</P>
<P>
   (Simon &AMP; Schuster Interactive; $29.95; Windows 95, 98; ages 8 to
12.)
</P>
<P>
   If you tend not to read the instructions before you dive into a
new piece of software, be prepared: this disc-based encyclopedia's
many customization and interactivity options will test the patience
of even the most skilled user.
</P>
<P>
   My first doubts about how appropriate the software was for
preteen-agers surfaced when the tour video flashed a picture of a
Palm III and proclaimed that users could send articles and books
from the program to their personal digital assistants. That made me
grab the packaging again _ yes, it did say ages 8 to 12. Think of
it: Fifth graders beaming the latest research on tree frogs to one
another with their palmtops. Does Simon &AMP; Schuster know something
that I don't?
</P>
<P>
   Six basic reference works are the core of the program: a
dictionary, an almanac, an atlas, a general encyclopedia and two
other books devoted to animals and ``the world and its cultures.''
Everything a child could need for exploring the world of knowledge
is probably here, and if it isn't, the program works with a browser
to let you incorporate even more information from the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The virtual library uses a bookshelf theme. Using a cumbersome
interface, the searcher can organize any or all of the six
references onto ``shelves'' like Reference or Encyclopedias and
Dictionaries, and can create and name new shelves. Looking at the
screen's array of areas and icons _ Books, Bookstore, Research
Desk, Research Center _ it was hard to imagine a lone 10-year-old
sorting it all out.
</P>
<P>
   With a mouse click, users can reach an online bookstore and
download material from a separate collection called Versabooks. I
added a Literature shelf, then downloaded from Versabooks a free
copy of ``Cyrano de Bergerac.'' Of 25 categories of books, only 2 _
Children's Books and Young Adult _ were geared to children. But the
depth was impressive, and some Versabooks were available in more
than one language.
</P>
<P>
   The six reference works (and any that may be added from
Versabooks) are searchable. Young searchers can use the default
``condensed'' search option, along with so-called natural language
queries. But many of the advanced search options _ ``sounds like
the word,'' ``case sensitive'' and ``thesaurus,'' for example _
seem unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   And there are six search options for multiple-word searching:
``phrase,'' ``very close together,'' ``very close together in
order,'' ``close together in order,'' ``close together,''
``anywhere in article.'' I can't envision many elementary-school
students pondering those options.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the more sophisticated bells and whistles of the
program, its overall vocabulary and bright look are well suited to
children. The articles in the six reference works are easy to read,
and if you place the cursor on a highlighted word, a definition
appears. (For many a parent, that alone might be worth the price.)
</P>
<P>
   From the main menu, a click on Online takes you to the New
Millennium InfoCenter, which has links to its Research Desk and
Current Events areas. The Research Desk's InfoCenter Navigator
leads to more than 1,200 Web sites that supplement the basic
reference books.
</P>
<P>
   The sites are grouped into general categories, then subdivided,
Yahoo style, to help students narrow the focus of their searches.
But after all that, some of the articles seem strangely arbitrary.
I clicked on Social Sciences, for instance, then History, then
Historical Figures, and at the top of the list of retrieved
articles was ``1936 Woman of the Year _ Mrs. Wallis Simpson.'' The
user can get more relevant information _ and faster _ by using the
search function of the software's Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the program is feature overload, a problem that
seems increasingly common. (Do I really need more than 30 icons
across the top of my Microsoft Word 97 screen?) It's as if the
developers included every neat trick that came to mind, simply
because they could. It's hard to see the need for any 12-year-old
to download Milton's ``Aeropagitica'' or to wade through
``hypersearch'' parameters. Basic tools work well enough for an
encyclopedia. This isn't Playstation, after all.

   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Sometimes a museum is also a monument, to
persistence, to a dream, to the durability of an idea. Rarely is
that more the case than with the Salvador Allende Museum of
Solidarity, which has opened here nearly 30 years after it was
conceived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was beautiful,'' Carmen Waugh, director of the museum, said
recently, recalling the official opening night on Sept. 2.
``Talking about it had almost become an abstraction because no one
had seen the collection. And, here it was! Almost a thousand people
attended the inauguration.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Waugh devoted years to creating the museum, housed in a
handsome, partly restored 19th-century building in Santiago's old
section. The opening exhibition featured 250 of the more than 1,500
pieces that make up the museum's collection. Many of those works
spent years in limbo after President Salvadore Allende Gossens died
in a military coup in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the museum itself was also in limbo during that
time. But once a democratically elected president took office in
1991, the project started moving slowly forward again. A
``reconciliation'' policy devised in 1991 to ease the country back
toward a democratic system discouraged references to the recent
past, particularly because Gen. Augusto Pinochet remained the head
of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   But the passage of time, Pinochet's arrest in Europe on a
Spanish warrant and the arrival of the millennium have given a
certain sanction to what is called here ``La Memoria'' _ that is,
remembering the dark period of military rule in Chile. There have
been a number of books and seminars on the subject and a revival of
Chile's tradition of a close alignment between art and politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Solidarity was first envisioned in 1971, when such
a linkage was common. Mario Pedroza, a Brazilian artist exiled in
Chile, and a small group of visiting European cultural leaders
approached Allende with a proposal to ask contemporary
international painters and sculptors to donate works for a museum
of modern art in Santiago to show support for Allende's newly
elected government.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-1973, 268 artists from all over the world, including Joan
Miro, David Siqueros and Alexander Calder, had contributed
paintings or sculptures. The museum organizers commissioned Dore
Ashton, the New York art historian, to ask artists in the United
States to donate works.
</P>
<P>
   But with the military coup of Sept. 11, 1973, works that were on
exhibit in the Presidential Palace and many others still crated on
the docks simply disappeared. The works that remained, including a
25-by-100-foot painting by Frank Stella, were wrapped and stored
for 17 years in the basement of the Museum of Contemporary Art at
the University of Chile.
</P>
<P>
   When Pinochet was voted out of power and a civilian government
assumed control, the collection was given to the Salvador Allende
Foundation, with a mandate to enlarge it and find it a permanent
home. One of Allende's daughters, Isabel, who is an officer of the
foundation and a representative in Chile's Congress, enlisted Ms.
Waugh for the job. During the 17-year period of military rule, she
had organized various ``Museums in Exile'' in Europe from her base
in Spain. As those collections began to arrive in Chile, they were
added to the salvaged works donated before the coup.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the city of Santiago offered Ms. Waugh a vacant
building that had been used as a storehouse by the National
Library. It was built at the end of the last century as an elegant
boarding school for young ladies who wanted to be teachers, but
years of neglect and damages from a 1985 earthquake had left the
building nearly in ruins. Ms. Waugh recalled: ``I spoke to Isabel
about the offer and she said, `I think it's a great idea. Let's go
ahead with it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Various regional governments in Spain that had offered the
foundation money for a cultural center (which was never built)
began contributing to the museum project, enough to restore half of
the building's 30,000 square feet. Future restoration plans include
a cafeteria and an auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the museum was inaugurated in September, Ms.
Waugh opened a large installation by Yoko Ono, ``Ex It,'' in the
building's former chapel. It consisted of 100 simple wooden coffins
that filled the magnificent 35-by-80-foot chapel space. Planted in
each was a small cinnamon tree (the sacred tree of Chile's Mapuche
Indians) where one would normally view the face of the deceased. A
soundtrack of chirping birds provided a peaceful backdrop for Ms.
Ono's homage to those who have died under repressive regimes.
</P>
<P>
   The persistent theme of death from a repressed or forgotten past
continues to haunt much of Chile's artistic expression. It is
graphically portrayed in Silvio Caiozzi's 30-minute film,
``Fernando ha vuelto'' (``Fernando Has Come Back''), a chilling
testimony to the thousands who disappeared soon after the coup. The
film documents the Institute of Legal Medicine's official
identification of the remains of Fernando Olivares Mori, a
27-year-old man who disappeared in 1973, and his family's efforts
to come to terms with the loss. But despite several international
prizes, the film has not yet been given a public showing in Chile,
something Caiozzi attributes to a residual impulse of
self-censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Theater, however explicit, has never posed the same threat as
film, even during the Pinochet era. The National Theater's revival
of Juan Radrigan's modern classic, ``Hechos consumados'' (``No Way
Back''), which opened a two-month run on Oct. 20 under the
direction of Alfredo Castro, attracted record audiences to the
481-seat Antonio Varas Theater. Fernando Gonzalez, the National
Theater's artistic director, said it was the first time in years
that balcony seats had been filled. The production, now on tour,
will return to the National in March to open its 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   The play, first staged in 1981, tells the reluctant love story
of two homeless people trapped in a world of fear and uncertainty.
``My interest was to put on stage the play's universal themes of
nonequality and human dignity,'' Castro said. ``From the experience
I perceive in the young people who attend the performances, who did
not live through that tragic period of history in this country, the
play echoes that point in their consciousness. The world has not
changed. Poverty and marginality have only changed their faces.''

 &HT;    CLINTON MAKES SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION FUNDS A TOP PRIORITY
 &HT;    With CLINTON-LIST.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal subsidies for school construction topped
the annual legislative agenda announced Wednesday by President
Clinton and Democratic congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our New Year's resolution is to reach across party lines to
help our children reach for the sky,'' Clinton said on the White
House lawn.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats said about 25,000 schools need extensive repairs,
additions or replacement, and almost as many schools need at least
some repairs.
</P>
<P>
   They proposed two plans:
</P>
<P>
   _ A new mix of loans and grants would help exceptionally needy
school districts make urgent repairs to roofs, walls, climate
control systems, plumbing or technology. The first year would cost
$1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Over five years, 8,300 schools would be helped by the new plan,
which is based on a $400-million-a-year loan program that was
renewed last year by Clinton and Congress. Since 1998, a few
districts in six states have obtained such loans and a handful in
eight other states have started the process of applying.
</P>
<P>
   _ A long-standing proposal would allow school districts to
borrow nearly $25 million to fix up or replace 6,000 schools in the
next two years, at a federal cost of $3.7 billion over five years.
The federal money would consist of tax credits that would cover the
interest payments, while local school districts would repay the
principal.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Congress rejected Clinton's $3.7 billion bond plan
and Clinton vetoed a Republican tax bill that contained a $1.4
billion alternative.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee, said, ``I hope this year that our
schoolchildren will come before politics, and that the president
works with us to enact a school construction initiative into law.
We need to get this done.''
</P>
<P>
   The short, politically potent wish list announced by the
Democrats also includes several other items on which Clinton failed
to find compromises with the Republican-controlled Congress last
year. They included tax cuts aimed at lower- and middle-income
earners, a ``real'' patients' bill of rights, voluntary
prescription drug benefits for Medicare, gun legislation, a higher
minimum wage and legislation against hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging ``last year's raw partisan politics,'' House
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said, ``We all hope that this
year can be different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm particularly excited about the president's new proposal to
help local communities fund urgent school renovations,'' said
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in his home state he has visited one old school
that must be evacuated when the wind exceeds 40 miles per hour and
another where desks must be moved away from the rattling windows on
windy days.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling a report last year that the average public school is
42 years old, he said, ``Experts tell us that a school building
begins to deteriorate rapidly after 40 years. Kind of like people,
I guess.''

 &HT;    There's nothing like soup to warm night
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Soup puts the heart at ease, calms down the violence of
hunger, eliminates the tension of the day, and awakens and refines
the appetite.''
</P>
<P>
   Auguste Escoffier (1847-1935)
</P>
<P>
   A busy work schedule should no longer keep you from one of the
great culinary joys of the season _ soup. While time constraints
may keep you from tackling a number of labor-intensive recipes
during the week, soup should not be one of them.
</P>
<P>
   While there are myriad so-called ``homemade'' prepared soups
readily available and certainly speedy to prepare, nothing that
comes out of a can will match the alchemy that occurs when various
ingredients are melded together into a pot of simmering homemade
soup.
</P>
<P>
   Many soups do indeed involve hours of pot watching and
adjusting, but the Internet provides a host of quick soup recipes
that will enable you to enjoy the comforting benefits of homemade
soup during the workweek, when you need them the most.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the lovely collection of rich and robust quick
soups compiled by Lynn Nelson, About.com's Guide for Busy Cooks at
busycooks.About.com/library/weekly/aa100499.htm.
</P>
<P>
   While each of these soups takes only half an hour or less to
prepare, they offer the same soothing comfort and warmth as soup
that has simmered for hours.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe that her hearty tortellini soup _ made with
onions, garlic, chicken broth, stewed tomatoes, spinach and
tortellini _ can be whipped up in 20 minutes and is guaranteed to
reverse the effects of a long, chilly commute.
</P>
<P>
   Pick up a crusty loaf of bread on the way home and in just an
amazing 10 minutes whip up a rich clam chowder that blends butter,
green onions, cream-style corn, chopped clams, frozen hash brown
potatoes and cream cheese. Then watch the stress of the day
evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing slapdash or instant about any of these recipes:
Beef Barley, Southwest Chicken Tortilla Soup, Chinese Curried Corn
Soup With Chicken, Hearty Black Bean Soup, Straciatella Alla Romana
(an Italian-style egg-drop soup that uses just three ingredients),
Iowa Corn Chowder, Lentil Tortellini Soup and Sausage and
Vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the recipes, Nelson offers quick soup tips and
advises keeping your pantry stocked with canned stocks, beans,
tomato products and assorted pastas to have ready whenever the soup
urge hits.
</P>
<P>
   If you are in a real pinch, she offers suggestions for putting
together a quick ``cheater'' soup by doctoring canned soup with
herbs, spices, cheese and leftover meats and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   There is also information on how to make stocks,
flavor-enhancing tricks and tips on how to simulate cream soup
without using cream by adding pureed cooked rice to the broth,
adding instant mashed potato flakes or using low-fat buttermilk.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson also passes along a list of other sites offering quick
soup information and recipes:

<P>
   Unbelievable Beef Barley Soup
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings Preparation time: 10 minutes Cooking time: 20
minutes
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe you can create such a rich and satisfying
beef barley soup in only 20 minutes, but you can with this one from
Desperation Dinners.
</P>
<P>
   1 pound (frozen) extra-lean ground beef
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion chopped (1 cup)
</P>
<P>
   1 package (8 ounces) sliced mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   1 can (14 1/2 ounces) beef broth, fat removed
</P>
<P>
   1 can (14 1/2 ounces) fat-free chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   1 3/4 cups water
</P>
<P>
   1 cup quick-cooking barley
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon bottled minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 envelope (1.4 ounces) demi-glace mix or au jus mix (see note)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup shredded carrots
</P>
<P>
   Black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   If the beef is frozen, place it on a microwavable plate and
microwave uncovered on high for 3 minutes to begin defrosting.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, heat the oil on medium heat in a 4 1/2-quart Dutch
oven or soup pot. Peel and coarsely chop the onion, adding it to
the pot as you chop. Add the beef and raise the heat to high. Stir
from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Coarsely chop the mushrooms, adding them to the pot as you chop.
Cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly to begin breaking up the
beef.
</P>
<P>
   Open the broth cans and remove any visible fat. Add broth, water
and barley. Cover the pot and begin bringing the broth to a boil.
Add garlic, Worcestershire sauce and thyme, keeping the pot covered
as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   When the soup comes to a rolling boil, keep it from boiling over
(if necessary) by reducing the heat to medium-high or cracking the
pot lid. Add the demi-glace and stir until it dissolves. Boil for 5
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, chop the shredded carrots into bite-size lengths and
set them aside.
</P>
<P>
   When the broth has boiled 5 minutes, add the carrots and
re-cover the pot. Continue to boil 5 more minutes or until the
barley is tender.
</P>
<P>
   Season with pepper to taste. Serve at once.
</P>
<P>
   Note: You'll find demi-glace (also called demi-glaze) mix with
the dry pasta sauce and packaged soup mixes, or with the spices.
The most commonly available brand is Knorr Classic Sauces
Demi-Glace. If it is unavailable, au jus mix can be substituted.

U.S. GIRDS FOR LASER ATTACKS ON ITS SATELLITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the next five to eight years, several nations
potentially hostile to the United States are expected to field
so-called ``laser dazzler'' devices that could blind American
satellites, the commander-in-chief of the U.S. Space Command said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While declining to name specific countries, Air Force Gen.
Richard Myers said some nations are about to complete a weapon that
could be used to disable key U.S. satellites by blasting them with
concentrated energy. The United States increasingly relies on both
military and commercial satellites to command troops and provide
crucial communications and data.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there are folks out there working on laser dazzlers
that would perhaps have an impact on our electro-optical
intelligence systems or other systems,'' said Myers, who next month
will become vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Myers added that the U.S. military, which operates some 200
satellites worth more than $100 billion, is unsure how widespread
the threat is. Commanders are asking the U.S. intelligence
community to devote more attention to the problem. ``Our plea is
that we need to put more resources exactly in that area so we can
help define this threat better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many nations already are able to electronically ``jam''
satellites in order to temporarily prevent them from communicating
with a ground station that receives the signals from space, he
said. Several key U.S. military satellites, such as the MILSTAR
network of communications satellites, are designed to thwart such
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. commanders are far more concerned about laser attacks
because they could render some military and most commercial
satellites useless for extended periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tracking of satellites in low Earth orbit is not difficult,''
Myers said. ``People do that all the time, and you can do that with
off-the-shelf equipment and software. That is relatively easy.''
The tracking system could then be coupled with a low-power laser
aimed at a specific satellite. ``This is not high-tech stuff,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   John Pike, a military and space analyst with the nonpartisan
Federation of American Scientists, said that countries such as Iraq
and North Korea ``could put together such a laser without
particularly great difficulty and without our being able to detect
it.'' Pike added that while U.S. satellites used to detect nuclear
missile launches and provide spy imagery most likely could
withstand such attacks, the many commercial satellites that the
U.S. military relies on could not.
</P>
<P>
   According to a bipartisan congressional report released last
year, China is developing an anti-satellite, or ASAT, military
capability for possible use against U.S. satellites. China ``is
believed to be developing space-based and ground-based
anti-satellite laser weapons. Such weapons would be of exceptional
value for the control of space and information,'' the report
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   White House and Pentagon officials said last year that 20 to 30
countries, which they did not name, have the potential to develop
laser ASAT systems.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Myers said the Pentagon should conduct additional laser tests of
U.S. satellites to ``understand our vulnerabilities.'' In 1997
tests at the White Sands, N.M., Missile Range, the Pentagon fired
the Army's Mid-Infrared Advanced Chemical Laser at a U.S. satellite
to test its susceptibility to attack. One test went awry, but in
another the Army's MIRACL hit the orbiting satellite, and while not
destroying it, the beam damaged at least one of its sensors.
</P>
<P>
   The tests sparked concern in foreign capitals and among arms
control experts that the Pentagon would soon develop a class of
anti-satellite weapons of its own, thereby igniting a new arms race
in space.
</P>
<P>
   Myers said the military has no such weapons now, but he added,
``It is an area where we are investing some of our technology
dollars to look at.''

   &UR; Award-Winning Plants &LR;
</P>
<P>
   While people look back over the highs and lows of the past 1,000
years, the plant world continues to look forward. Perhaps that is
why the entire plant kingdom was Y2K-ready long before some members
of the animal kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   As it has for the last 11 years, the Pennsylvania Horticultural
Society has given gold medals to underappreciated trees, shrubs and
woody vines that are hardy from Washington to New York City. This
year six plants were chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, the New England horticultural societies and
professional groups that grant the Cary Awards for outstanding
woody plants that are hardy in New England have picked three plants
to highlight for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   These are the gold medal winners:
</P>
<P>
   _Acer buergerianum, the trident maple, a low-branching tree with
year-round interest.
</P>
<P>
   _Aronia arbutifolia Brilliantissima, red chokeberry with
brilliant fall color and striking red berries.
</P>
<P>
   _Parrotia persica, a medium-size tree with handsome, patchy bark
and terrific fall color.
</P>
<P>
   _Quercus alba, the native white oak, which seems to have been
forgotten by too many people. It is a stately slow-growing shade
tree with bold horizontal limbs.
</P>
<P>
   _Syringa meyeri Palibin, a disease-resistant compact-growing
lilac with small leaves. It is completely covered with pale
violet-pink flowers in spring.
</P>
<P>
   _ Weigela florida Wine and Roses, a new cultivar of a familiar
old shrub, with hot pink flowers in late spring and
burgundy-colored leaves.
</P>
<P>
   The Cary Award winners are:
</P>
<P>
   _Pieris Brouwer's Beauty, a compact evergreen hybrid andromeda
with colorful buds, stems and new growth.
</P>
<P>
   _Clethra alnifolia Ruby Spice, summersweet, with spikes of
fragrant, deep pink flowers in midsummer and brilliant fall color.
</P>
<P>
   _Syringa reticulata, the Japanese tree lilac, with its early
summer clusters of creamy white flowers and interesting, cherrylike
bark.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the next 1,000 years bring, your garden will
still bring pleasure, especially if you choose your plants with
care. Any of these, or past winners, are worth looking for. They
are all being promoted to the nursery trade, so they are widely
available.
</P>
<P>
   For the descriptions and sources of all the winners, current and
past, send a 55-cent stamped, self-addressed envelope to the
Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, Gold Medal, 100 N 20th Street,
Fifth Floor, Philadelphia 19103; and to Cary Award, WCHS, P.O. Box
598, Boylston, Mass. 01505. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hardwood vs. Soft &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Please settle a horticultural argument. A good friend,
usually intelligent, insists that balsa, that ever-so-soft wood we
used to carve into models, is a hardwood. He is being very stubborn
about this. Can you offer some help in straightening him out?
</P>
<P>
   A. Listen to him again, and see if he says ``hard wood'' or
``hardwood.'' While it is mostly true that hardwoods are harder
than softwoods, there are exceptions, including balsa, which is a
very soft hardwood, and slash pine, a very dense Southern softwood.
</P>
<P>
   Botanically, it is a bit more complex. Hardwoods are
angiosperms, flowering plants whose seeds are enclosed in an ovary,
and softwoods are gymnosperms, nonflowering plants with naked
seeds. For all practical purposes, conifers are classified as
softwoods, and deciduous trees are classified as hardwoods,
regardless of how hard or soft their wood actually is. That is,
deciduous trees with leaves, not needles, since bald cypress, dawn
redwood and larch are all deciduous conifers, which can be
confusing. Whether the wood is hard or soft is more a function of
how fast a tree grows.
</P>
<P>
   There are structural differences between them, too, but again,
there are exceptions. These differences have to do with how the
cells of the tree's vascular system are made. Hardwood trees
produce columns of open-ended cells, much like stacks of tin cans
with the tops and bottoms removed. Softwood trees produce very
long, thin cells that pass liquids from one to another through
small pits in their ends, which touch each other. Does this matter
to you or to the tree? Probably not. Both conifers and deciduous
trees seem comfortable with their choices.
</P>

`JAMES THURBER': HOW HIS WIT IGNITED SPARKS IN THE DARKNESS

<P>
   An enthusiastic cadre of fans contribute fond reflections and
glowing reviews of James Thurber, whose short stories and cartoons
helped give The New Yorker its reputation for sophisticated humor
and classy writing over the 30 years of their connection.
</P>
<P>
   In the nature of such appreciations, the competition for who can
come up with the most complimentary blurbs sometimes gets out of
hand.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary's award for excess goes to Burton Bernstein, a
Thurber biographer, who says Thurber drew on the peculiarities of
his Ohio family to create ``this wild, mad world of eccentric
middle-class American Midwesterners,'' which left Bernstein
``rolling on the floor with laughter.'' He credits E.B. White, the
prototypical New Yorker stylist, with teaching Thurber to write
``incredibly beautiful English,'' not a phrase that would have
passed White's editing pencil.
</P>
<P>
   George Plimpton, narrating ``James Thurber: The Life and Hard
Times,'' calls him ``a master satirist in the short form,'' and
others go so far as to place him up there just a laugh or two
behind Mark Twain, although his own favorite writer, improbably, is
reported to have been Henry James.
</P>
<P>
   John Updike, whose comments are less effusive but shrewder than
those of other members of the fan club, finds something Kafkaesque
about Thurber's looming and manic cartoon characters, especially
those domineering women lording it over pipsqueak men.
</P>
<P>
   Like many humorists, Thurber was not a bundle of laughs. When he
was 8, he was shot in the left eye with a toy arrow, which led to
his gradual loss of sight in middle age.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Updike suggests by way of compensation, the
near-blindness ``sort of froze'' his drawings at ``a kind of
primitive state'' that would have been spoiled by visual
refinements. Few redeeming qualities can be found in his other
tribulations, like a failed first marriage, alcoholism, loneliness
and bouts of depression. Thurber wasn't kidding when he told an
interviewer, ``Humor is a serious thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The examples of his work quoted here are not likely to send you
rolling around down there with Bernstein, but at least one, from
``Mr. Preble Gets Rid of His Wife,'' is still pretty funny:
</P>
<P>
   ``He opened the cellar door. `Here, you go first.'
</P>
<P>
   ```Brr,' said Mrs. Preble, starting down the steps, `It's cold
down here. You would think of this at this time of the year, any
other husband would have buried his wife in the summer.'
</P>
<P>
   ```You can't arrange those things just whenever you want to,'
said Mr. Preble. `I didn't fall in love with this girl till last
fall.'
</P>
<P>
   ```Anybody else would have fallen in love with her long before
that. She's been around for years. Why is it you always let other
men get in ahead of you?'''
</P>
<P>
   How well do Thurber's best-known works, like ``The Secret Life
of Walter Mitty'' (which inspired a Danny Kaye movie hit in 1947,
due for a remake this year, starring Jim Carrey), hold up on the
page? The accommodating Bernstein says that Walter Mitty, the timid
fellow who has fantasies of being a hero, ``is universal.'' Does
that mean he is just an old joke?
</P>
<P>
   The documentary deepens when the rapture subsides. In the 1950s,
when Thurber's career was already on the slide and The New Yorker
was turning down much of his work, Roger Angell, who served as his
editor, reports, ``He was not writing well, and he was alcoholic,
he was suspicious, he was harsh, hard to get along with.''
</P>
<P>
   In an affecting confession to Mark Van Doren, Thurber said he
had always dealt with meanness and stupidity in his work, never
goodness and strength. ``I have always talked about poor terrible,
weak people and made fun of them. And so this is a punishment. I
have been stricken blind.''
</P>
<P>
   During his decline as a writer he took consolation in telling
people, ``Do you know that I've been called the most important
American humorist since Mark Twain!'' Perhaps on his bleak days he
would have found comfort in the show's compliments.

   WASHINGTON _ Until the Exxon-Mobil merger last year, Walter
Arnheim was an oil executive with a fondness for opera. Now that
the oil giants have combined, Arnheim has put the economics of
petroleum behind him and will devote all his time to expiring
sopranos and soaring tenors, not to mention the occasional scheming
baritone.
</P>
<P>
   Arnheim was appointed chief operating officer of the Washington
Opera last week, and he is to succeed Patricia Mossel as executive
director in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view myself as an opportunist,'' Arnheim said in an
interview in a temporary office in the Watergate complex, near the
Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the opera's home.
</P>
<P>
   As the chairs in the oil company's executive suite were
rearranged, he got the chance to leave the Mobil Corp. after a
31-year career, most recently as treasurer, and start a new job at
the age of 55, running the business part of an opera whose artistic
director is Placido Domingo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have stayed at the merged company, but a new
opportunity came up,'' Arnheim said. ``The chance to move from one
world-class organization to another world-class organization is
thrilling.''
</P>
<P>
   In the merger, Mobil's headquarters in the Washington suburbs of
Virginia were combined with Exxon's in Irvine, Texas, a move that
has made cultural institutions in the Washington area afraid that
the contributions they have received from Mobil may fade away.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil is the chief corporate sponsor of the Washington Opera,
and Arnheim has been a member of the opera's board.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the contributions to the Washington Opera by
Exxon-Mobil might be less than Mobil's, Arnheim said: ``I hope not.
Maybe my being here will mean even greater support.'' (Because of
their high visibility in the capital, the Washington Opera and
other cultural institutions here do receive contributions from
companies with headquarters elsewhere.)
</P>
<P>
   Arnheim also hopes that the Washington Opera can gain
recognition as a national company. He cites the reputation that
Domingo has brought to the company and its growth since Ms. Mossel
became executive director in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The opera's budget has grown to from $11.7 million in 1995 to
$26 million, and, Ms. Mossel said, ``We're still solvent. That's a
nice achievement in five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mossel, who is 66 and previously worked at the San Francisco
Opera, plans an active retirement, resuming her painting career,
completing an unfinished novel and serving as an opera consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Arnheim will pick up the 67-performance season that Ms. Mossel
will leave him and will try to expand it after renovations to the
Kennedy Center Opera House. There are, for example, the financial
and artistic considerations of whether to present Wagner's ``Ring''
cycle, whose staging is viewed as something of a dividing line
between the ordinary and the exceptional opera company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to do the `Ring,''' he said. ``We hope to put
that on the drawing board in a few years.''

JOURNEY TO AMERZONE: KEEP YOUR EARS OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Playing Amerzone is like watching a silent movie: you appreciate
its expressiveness, but you can't help thinking how far the medium
has progressed since the early days. With CD-ROMs, early days means
1994, the heyday of the point-and-click adventure epitomized by
Myst.
</P>
<P>
   Amerzone is one of those worlds. The game begins on a desolate
coast (like neutron bomb sites, these worlds contain plenty of
buildings with no signs of human habitation). A lighthouse looms
ahead. Inside it, you find lots of switches in the basement and a
5\-inch floppy disk beside an old computer.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, a naturalist's study contains dozens of objects you
can't pick up. An old man sits at the desk, oblivious to your
presence until you click on him. ``The egg,'' he says, wheezing.
``The egg. It's still alive! Yes. But now, it's all over. I have no
strength left. You must go for me. Take the egg, take the egg of
the white birds back to Amerzone _ I beg you, please!''
</P>
<P>
   He dies.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving him slumped over the desk, you climb a spiral staircase
to the attic, where you find (get ready, this is a shocker) a
journal containing the professor's curriculum vitae and a detailed
account of a tropical expedition in which he pilots a hydrofloat
upriver, encounters Indians and teaches them the wonders of
mechanical devices (the schematics are artfully sketched in pencil)
and finds the white birds of native mythology circling above a
sacred volcano.
</P>
<P>
   A letter on the bookshelf explains how, possessed by ambition
and greed, he stole the birds' only egg, containing the entire
future of the species, only to be ridiculed by the Parisian
scientific establishment. Meanwhile, Amerzone has been overtaken by
a military despot. The egg, however, remains intact, and inside,
``slow, continuous heartbeats'' can be heard with a stethoscope,
some 50 years later. The professor kept it in a climate-controlled
storage area while he was building a new hydrofloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, as I have already told you, I am now an old man,'' he
wrote, with prescient knowledge that he would expire just before
the letter was read. ``So it is up to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus begins a paint-by-numbers Myst-like adventure of lush
scenery and lever-pulling. It's beautiful on its own terms. But
it's hard to play that kind of game anymore, having ranged freely
in three-dimensional worlds where every object can be freely
examined, destroyed, pocketed or used, and where there is more than
one way to solve a problem.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, Amerzone's tightly scripted sequences are constrictive
_ the illusion of choice doesn't hold up because the old illusions
have been rendered obsolete. For someone accustomed to deeper and
more seamless virtual worlds, Amerzone's game play feels like a
straitjacket.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of 20 hours of knobs and cogs and compass readings
seemed purgatorial. The audio environment was gorgeous, however,
and after an hour of game play I decided it would be more fun to
play the sound files than the game itself.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Choose Your Own Adventure? Anyone who grew up in the
'80s remembers that book series _ it was the first interactive
fiction to sell in huge quantities. You were supposed to carve
alternative pathways through the story by making choices and
flipping to different page numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But it was generally more fun to read the books from cover to
cover, abandoning the linear narrative for a cubist collage of
decision points and consequences and a better understanding of all
possible solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Amerzone is best experienced in this fashion. The game consists
of four CD-ROMs, each containing dozens of audio snippets, and if
you play all the sound files in alphabetical order, you get a
pretty good idea of what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   On the first disc, there's the sound of pages flipping (from the
journal), switches being thrown, water running through pipes and
plinking into buckets, a message from the director of the Museum of
Natural History warning you in a high nasal voice not to venture
into the Amerzone under any circumstances and lots of squeaky
doors. There's water splashing against a dock, bubbling lab
equipment and the unmistakable sound of hydraulic machinery.
</P>
<P>
   On later discs, you hear gulls and the sound of a large object
splashing into water. ``It's coming back to me now,'' a grizzled
sea codger says. ``Happened a long time ago, 1932, '33 maybe. There
were three of them. They had a machine just like yours, the same
thing. They never managed to restart it. They eventually left on a
freighter that was passing through. The machine remained in the
lagoon for some time. Then, in time, it sank. They also left a
chest behind somewhere. Look, here's the key.''
</P>
<P>
   You find the chest. A key turns in the lock. You haul something
heavy out of the water. There are rapid-fire machine noises,
gunfire perhaps, and an engine being fired from a standstill into
high gear.
</P>
<P>
   Further into the heart of WAV file darkness, there are jungle
sounds and animal snorts. Ferried across the marshes by the
web-footed giraffe described in the professor's journal, you reach
a temple at the base of the sacred volcano, where hot lava bubbles
in close proximity to a sliding stone wall. A heavy plate shifts
into place. The egg is deposited in its proper place. The white
birds are restored to life, and Amerzone is redeemed. The End.
</P>
<P>
   I spent several hours delving into Amerzone's audio files. It
wasn't a rich media experience. But it was immersive in a way that
the panoramic vistas were not because it was an unfettered
exploration, with room for competing theories and imaginative
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   As a game, Amerzone is too shallow to be interesting. But it's
fun to draw back the curtain, play with the stage rigging and fill
in the blanks with sheer speculation. It also makes for wonderful
moments of deja vu later, when you go back into the game and
recognize a creaky bridge from your audio safari.
</P>
<P>
   Try it sometime. Dig up a vintage CD-ROM and just play the audio
files. A 40-hour puzzle saga probably contains a pretty decent
40-minute audio sampler (a sonic scrapbook of your adventures, if
nothing else).
</P>
<P>
   The games aren't worth replaying, but the sounds might be worth
dragging back onto your hard drive. I would never suggest any kind
of MP3 naughtiness with copyrighted material, but if you're sick of
standard computer noises, tropical insects and mystical machines
are a change of pace.
</P>
<P>
   There's gold in them there coasters.

RAIDERS FACE A PAIR OF IMPORTANT DECISIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ One year, Al Davis waited all the way until
Christmas Eve to fire his head coach. Another year, he entered into
high-level checkbook discussions with agent Leigh Steinberg over
Jeff George and personally signed Desmond Howard. And always, he
jousted with the Oakland city government and the National Football
League, usually timing his noisemaking with either a news lull or a
development in the Los Angeles football void.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the 1999 season, a season like too many others
for them in this decade, one might think it would be quiet in the
Oakland Raiders' Alameda digs this spring. Joe Nedney apparently
made the offseason safe for Jon Gruden, and gave the fans a reason
for hope at 8-8 that they would not have had at 7-9.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there are two huge issues awaiting them that will
determine the direction of the franchise for years.
</P>
<P>
   The first is deciding how much to overpay wide receiver Tim
Brown, and how many years to overpay him. Brown will be 34 when
camp opens, and beginning his 14th year, all with Team Al. He has
said all the right things about Gruden and the team's direction,
but he is also the one who asked for the out in his contract that
would let him seek out another team at the end of the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he is very definitely for sale, and will
certainly cast an eye toward any team that has made the playoffs
more than three times since 1986 and has hot and ready cash to
blow.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the Raiders owner, can pay the going rate; money isn't
the problem. He cannot, however, offer any promise of postseason
play, because Brown knows the Raiders' history on his watch far too
well. As much of a no-brainer as this seems to you, to Brown it is
a matter of faith vs. experience, a religious matter with which
only he can grapple.
</P>
<P>
   The Tim Brown matter is nothing, though, next to the real fun:
Davis' lawsuit against the city of Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is suing the city because, he alleges, they duped him into
returning to Oakland by promising him sellouts for all eternity, or
something like that. He's not suing for snicks and giggles, either.
He wants $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   Many legal experts think he can't win this one, although many
legal experts never thought he'd beat the NFL the first time he
dropped a dime on them, either. In other words, legal experts
aren't really that helpful here.
</P>
<P>
   If Davis wins, he could begin scaring the locals in earnest. The
city sued him in anticipation of his leaving again, and he
countersued the city figuring that nobody sues Al Davis and gets
away with it. Pre-emptive lawsuits are never greeted cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   A loss by Davis in court essentially weds the Raiders to
Oakland, presumably forcing him to do more about his ticket
problems than blaming the politicians he outwitted to get the
stadium deal he got (and outwitting the Oakland pols isn't exactly
like running the numbers without a pen or pad). A win, on the other
hand, puts Los Angeles front and center again, changes the entire
organizational focus and almost surely distracts the rank-and-file
from its football duties. Beating the Chiefs in Kansas City will
seem like child's play in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, you can see how, come June or so, all this
brain-numbing whine-and-grind about Bill Belichick, Ray Rhodes,
Doug Flutie and the San Francisco 49ers will have faded into
insignificance. They'll all get new jobs, or get their feelings
soothed, or fire all the non-minimum-wage help and go to court to
keep the in-laws out of the luxury suite.
</P>
<P>
   And there, still standing as always, will be Al Davis _ the
Once-and-Future King of the Offseason, before which all other
self-directed malcontents, greedheads and snivelers must bow, now
as before and for decades to come.

BOOK TALK: CHALLENGING ATTENTION SPANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The past isn't dead. It's not even past.'' This epigrammatic
reflection from William Faulkner seems to have seized publishing,
and books that celebrate remembrance _ there is no past after all _
have dominated sales this millennial season. Nine of them are on
the New York Times' nonfiction best-seller list for Jan. 16, and
two others float just below the Top 15.
</P>
<P>
   These books commemorate 100 years of history. But more
commercially questionable are the books that explore events of the
last year or two, books signed up in the fever of the moment when
the happenings are dominating the front pages and the top of the
television news reports.
</P>
<P>
   This week ``A Vast Conspiracy: The Real Story of the Sex Scandal
That Nearly Brought Down a President'' (Random House), by Jeffrey
Toobin, landed in bookstores, with a first printing of 125,000
copies. Toobin has a reputation of high quality as a writer and
reporter, and the publisher is counting on that standing and the
inclusion of purported new documents in the book to lift it out of
the ho-hum of overfamiliarity into the wow of freshness.
</P>
<P>
   Toobin's book on the O.J. Simpson case, ``The Run of His Life''
(Random House), was published in September 1996, about a year after
the verdict; it was critically acclaimed and arguably the best book
on the subject. Ann Godoff, the author's publisher, said: ``People
said then that nobody cared anymore, like they say about the
Clinton scandal. But Toobin does it better, and it's history, and
it takes some time to put it in context.''
</P>
<P>
   Were readers sated and bored with O.J.? Toobin's book was on the
Times' best-seller list for six weeks, a respectable run, not a
great one. Are readers not fatigued by the thought of anything more
about the Clintons? Michael Isikoff's ``Uncovering Clinton: A
Reporter's Story'' (Crown) was on the list for four weeks last
spring, but Gail Sheehy's ``Hillary's Choice'' (Random House) was a
best seller for only a week in December. (To be fair, ``Hillary's
Choice'' might have had a longer run had there not been so many
``century'' books.)
</P>
<P>
   Often news-driven books are a quick hit, with a velocity of
sales based on some new revelation that makes them best sellers for
a month or so. Will Toobin's latest book have that  &UR; new &LR; 
information that generates the fast break in bookstores? Even if it
does, do enough people care enough about the Clinton sex scandal _
which seems to have been an eternity ago _ in enough of a quantity
to make the book a hit?
</P>
<P>
   That is always the gamble of event-driven nonfiction, a gamble
the publisher doesn't dare resist, but one that seldom pays off. If
the book is out too soon after the event, critics dismiss it as a
quickie cut-and-paste job; if it takes a year of hard work, it's
old news. Yes, Monica Lewinsky still appears on Larry King's
program and Linda Tripp keeps popping up on television too, and
people do watch. But that's free entertainment. Books cost money.
</P>
<P>
   What's involved is not the validity of publishers' editorial
judgments. Book publishers, like journalists, have to make quick
decisions, and nothing focuses their minds so sharply as a
crescendo of daily headlines and news bites. They ask, Can we
afford  &UR; not &LR;  to sign up the book, even though there is almost
instant public apathy toward current events?
</P>
<P>
   Books of achievement are at least as commercially risky as books
of scandal. Still, HarperCollins executive editor David Hirshey was
quick to sign up a book on the U.S. women's soccer team when it won
the Women's World Cup in July. ``My feeling was that 40 million
people can't be wrong,'' he said, referring to the event's
estimated television audience. ``Less than half were prepubescent
teen-agers.'' So he contracted with Jere Longman, a reporter for
The New York Times who covered the event, for a low six-figure
advance to finish the book in time for sales to coincide with this
year's Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Hirshey said: ``Not since the U.S. hockey team beat the Russians
in 1980 has a group of athletes been so bombarded with love as
these women have been. I'm betting that that enthusiasm will hold,
so from a publishing standpoint it's not like we're putting out the
book in a vacuum.'' True enough, but nine times out of 10 sports
books are over almost before they are written.
</P>
<P>
   So this book, like similar ones, will strive for some necessary
deeper meanings to make it viable. ``For instance,'' Hirshey asked,
``what does it mean to be a black player in a largely white
upper-middle-class suburban sport?'' (The goaltender was black.)
``How confident do you have to be to display your body in front of
millions of people?'' (One player whipped off her jersey, exposing
her sports bra after the victory.) ``When will women get an equal
share of the sports financial pie?''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer was a big one for U.S. sports internationally. Lance
Armstrong became the second American to win the most important
bicycle race in the world, the almost mindlessly grueling Tour de
France. If that wasn't dramatic enough, he did it about three years
after recovering from testicular cancer that had spread to his
abdomen, lungs and brain. He became a hero in that strata of sports
figure in which Michael Jordan and few others dwell.
</P>
<P>
   This was the stuff of great books, and Armstrong is doing a book
with the writer Sally Jenkins. But will anyone care about recalling
that heady moment by the time it is published? Putnam thinks so,
and Neil Nyren, the publisher and editor in chief at the house,
explains his high hopes this way: ``Of course it's not just about
winning a bicycle race. Lance became a symbol of something bigger
because he had to overcome cancer to win the championship. Because
of his cancer, he rediscovered his spirituality. That's what the
book is about.''
</P>
<P>
   The past might not even be past, as Faulkner said, but 100 years
from now, all these events are likely to be little more that a few
paragraphs or a picture caption in end-of-the-21st-century books
dominating The Times' best-seller lists.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What to wear _ not what to sing _ was among female
dance-pop trio TLC's biggest concerns last year.
</P>
<P>
   The multi-Grammy nominated threesome _ Tionne ``T-Boz'' Watkins,
Lisa ``Left Eye'' Lopes and Rozanda ``Chilli'' Thomas _ left most
of the musical decisions to their producers during the making of
their third and latest record, ``FanMail'' (LaFace/Arista).
</P>
<P>
   The album, which spawned the No. 1 singles ``No Scrubs'' and
``UnPretty,'' was executive produced by Atlanta's LaFace label
co-founders Antonio ``L.A.'' Reid and Kenneth ``Babyface'' Edmonds,
and super hitmaker Dallas Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat around and worried about what we were gonna wear,''
said Thomas, who adds that the r&AMP;b vocal trio downplayed their
overt rap connections since starting in 1992. ``Dallas and the guys
set the tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Filled with tough grooves and melodic jams, ``FanMail,'' is the
most personal album the trio has made because it reflects
experiences and emotions the group faced in the years since TLC
became known around the world, Thomas says.
</P>
<P>
   Among the tracks is ``Come on Down,'' a provocative ballad
penned for TLC by award-winning songwriter Diane Warren. The single
``Silly Ho'' deals with a certain type of female who hasn't found
herself, while the album's first smash hit, ``No Scrubs'' (produced
by newcomer Kevin ``Shekspere'' Briggs and penned by Columbia
recording artists Tiny and Candy from Xscape), puts men with no
cars, jobs or love lives in their proper places.
</P>
<P>
   TLC _ nominated for seven Grammy Awards on Tuesday including
album of the year and best pop performance by a duo or group with
vocal for the song ``Unpretty'' _ appears tonight with best new
artist Grammy nominee Christina Aguilera and Blaque at the Pond in
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking it to the next place in terms of production,
artwork, concept and image,'' boasts Thomas. ``We want to be
universal with this record. It's for our fans _ which is why we
called it `FanMail.' But we also want to get it to people who've
never heard of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The album, which peaked at No. 1 upon release, is on its way
back up the albums chart from last week's No. 67, thanks to the
well-attended ``FanMail'' trek.
</P>
<P>
   The groove-flavored title track says thank you to fans for seven
years of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll never see us copy anyone else,'' says Watkins. ``We're
always a little scared when we put out a new record, but we stand
firm in what we believe in, and we have our own thoughts which come
through in our music.''
</P>
<P>
   Production for ``FanMail'' began in early 1998. But in the years
since the 1994 release of TLC's 10-million-selling smash second
album, the Grammy-winning ``CrazySexyCool,'' all three women have
been busy working on various projects.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent magazine article about the trio suggested things
were not as cozy as they seem. In the article, Thomas and Watkins
lashed out at Lopes, who they said was a loose cannon whose erratic
behavior was dragging the group down.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine said Lopes quit the group prior to the making of
``FanMail,'' temporarily freezing the trio's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked about the supposed rift, Thomas just said
everyone was doing their own thing prior to the production of the
album and the start of the current tour, and everything has been
worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the last record, I've become a mother,'' says Thomas.
``And since I don't believe in the nanny thing, I've been spending
all my time with my new son. I also did some acting on the side. I
was in the film `Hav Plenty,' and I've been working with an acting
coach. I turned down quite a few major movie roles because I want
it to be right.''
</P>
<P>
   TLC first came together as teens in Atlanta, releasing their
1992 debut, ``Ooooooohhh...On the TLC Tip,'' to immediate acclaim,
national radio airplay and a No. 14 chart position.
``CrazySexyCool,'' with the hit singles ``Waterfalls,'' ``Red Light
Special'' and ``Creep,'' chugged up to No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't always been smooth sailing, though. Shortly before the
release of the second record, Lopes was charged with felony arson
for setting fire to the house of her then-boyfriend, Andre Rison, a
receiver for the Atlanta Falcons football team, in June 1994. She
received five years probation and a fine.
</P>
<P>
   Lopes kept busy before the release of ``FanMail'' by hosting
MTV's daily ``The Cut'' show, while developing her Left Eye
production company and working on projects for Sony Music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some groups have tried to take off from where we left off in
1994,'' Lopes said. ``We've heard about record companies who've
tried to put together groups just like us, but no one can do it.
It's the combinations of our personalities and the chemistry
between us that makes TLC what it is.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a bright, crisp Friday morning in November, Martin
Cooper was sipping orange juice in the dining room of the Essex
House hotel on Central Park South in Manhattan when his
well-planned day fell apart. One meeting had to be rescheduled and
another had to be relocated even though one of Cooper's colleagues
was already en route to the old location.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones were produced and arrangements quietly changed (so
as not to annoy nearby diners). Six calls and 10 minutes later, the
situation was resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank goodness for cell phones'' is something we might say to
ourselves when we're not busy cursing the lack of a signal or the
shrill ring that cuts into a quiet dinner. What made those
sentiments resonate on that morning was that Cooper, a former
general manager for the systems division at Motorola, is considered
the inventor of the first portable handset and the first person to
make a call on a portable cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I was the one people credit with inventing the cell
phone,'' Cooper, 70, said almost sheepishly. ``Now, whenever anyone
gets a dropped call, they blame me.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes later, a few blocks down Sixth Avenue, Cooper was
atop the 50-story Alliance Capital Building, looking for the base
station that processed the first hand-held cell phone call in 1973.
(Noncellular Car phones had been use since the late 1950s.) With
rooftop gravel crunching under his feet, he approached what looked
like the entrance to an engine room. Dozens of dish antennas lined
the perimeter of the building's roof.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper pulled the door open and stepped into a dimly lighted
space. Inside, rows of cages secured dozens of transmitters that
controlled the thousands of mobile phone calls coursing through the
outside antennas. Stepping into a cage marked with a Motorola sign,
Cooper brightened up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it,'' he said with almost childlike enthusiasm,
pointing to a six-foot-high metallic box filled with old circuit
boards and transistors, and a Motorola stamp. ``I can't say it's
the one, but it looks exactly like what we brought up here in
1973.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Motorola was known for its expertise in radio
communications and terminals. In 1973, when the company installed
the base station to handle the first public demonstration of a
phone call over the cellular network, Motorola was trying to
persuade the Federal Communications Commission to allocate
frequency space to private companies for use in the emerging
technology of cellular communications.
</P>
<P>
   But the company faced formidable competition in AT&AMP;T. It was
AT&AMP;T's research arm, Bell Laboratories, that introduced the idea of
cellular communications in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T wanted to run the whole wireless world,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Bell Laboratories wanted the first system limited to
car phones. Cooper wanted people to be able to carry their phones
with them anywhere. While crediting Bell Laboratories with
technical brilliance, Cooper believed that giving them the whole
spectrum would cause a huge delay in making cellular phones
portable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bell Labs was an extraordinary operation, but we were living
in the real world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After some initial testing in Washington, for the FCC, Cooper
and Motorola took the phone technology to New York to show the
public.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Richard Frenkiel was the head of systems
engineering for Bell Laboratories. ``It was a real triumph,'' he
said about Cooper's phone. ``We were using 30-pound units in the
trunks of cars. So their ability to package the whole thing into a
2-pound unit was a great breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 3, 1973 standing on a street near the Manhattan Hilton,
Cooper decided to attempt a private call before going to a press
conference upstairs in the hotel. He picked up the two-pound
Motorola handset called the Dyna-Tac and pushed the ``off hook''
button. The phone came alive, connecting Cooper with the base
station on the roof of the Burlington Consolidated Tower (now the
Alliance Capital Building) and into the land-line system. To the
bewilderment of some passers-by, he dialed the number and held the
phone to his ear.
</P>
<P>
   Who did he call for this historic event?
</P>
<P>
   ``The first call I made was to Joel Engel, the Bell Labs head of
research,'' Cooper said. ``I think they were a little bit annoyed.
They thought it was impertinent for a company like Motorola to go
after them.''
</P>
<P>
   Engel, now a telecommunications consultant, does not remember
the first call so clearly. ``Marty may very well have given me the
honor of being the first recipient of a call from that hand-held
unit, but I just don't remember it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Engel does recall the intense effort by Motorola to make a place
for itself in the cellular world: ``Give Marty Cooper credit for
the foresight in recognizing that the business was going towards
hand-helds and not the car. It was as much a marketing insight as
it was a technological breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   The public demonstration landed Motorola's mobile unit on the
July, 1973 cover of Popular Science magazine, which referred to it
as a ``new type of computerized, walkie-talkie-size portable.'' It
also seems to have had some effect on the FCC, which decided to
give more space to private companies to foster competition in
cellular communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Ma Bell was impressed that little a could make
such a huge PR flash against that behemoth,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper grew up in Chicago and earned a degree in electrical
engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology. After four
years in the Navy serving on destroyers and a submarine, he worked
for a year at a telecommunications company he described as ``100
engineers in a big room with no air conditioning.''
</P>
<P>
   Hired by Motorola in 1954, Cooper worked on developing portable
products, including the first portable hand-held police radios,
made for the Chicago police department in 1967. He then led
Motorola's cellular research.
</P>
<P>
   He left Motorola in 1983, the year that the first cellular
systems became commercially available. After starting, then selling
a company that managed billing for cellular companies, Cooper was
an independent consultant until he founded his current venture,
ArrayComm, in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, I was supposed to spend a day a month as an
adviser,'' he said. ``But soon, I was working seven days a week.
When you get involved in a startup, you have to be passionate.''
</P>
<P>
   The company was originally focused on creating smart antennas
that mobile phone providers could install to increase capacity
without building new transmitters. Cooper is now passionate about
trying to change the way we use the Internet. Harkening back to
when he worked to move people away from thinking of cell phones as
anchored to cars, Cooper applies the same thinking to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cellular was the forerunner to true wireless communications,''
he says. ``And just as people got used to taking phones with them
everywhere, the way people use the Internet is ultimately going to
be wireless. With our technology, you will be able to open your
notebook anywhere and log on to the Internet at a very high speed
with relatively low cost.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, our story is about what a relatively small
company is doing with high-tech stuff in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when people get used to logging on anywhere, well, that's
going to be a revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a revolution in which he wants to play an important role.
``I have trouble going to sleep at night,'' he said, ``because you
always get the feeling that there is another thing you could do.''

COMMENTARY: THE COMFORT ZONE FOR POLICE OFFICERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On July 8, 1984, police officers in Albany, N.Y., invaded the
apartment of a 35-year-old mentally ill man named Jessie Davis. The
officers were responding to a report of a disturbance at the
third-floor apartment on Clinton Avenue in the city's predominantly
black Arbor Hill neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Davis lived alone. Accord)ng to the police, when the cops
confronted him in his bedroom, he came at them with a knife in one
hand and a fork in the other, and therefore they had to shoot him.
He was shot several times, including once in the back and once in
the top of the head, and he died as he was being taken to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   There were five officers at the scene and three of them fired.
All of the officers were white and Davis was black. The shooting
angered many residents of Arbor Hill, where complaints have been
made for years about the mistreatment of neighborhood residents by
the police.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that in this particular case there was much to get
upset about.
</P>
<P>
   When the shooting was reviewed by a grand jury the officers
insisted that Davis had been greatly agitated and they were unable
to subdue him. When he tried to attack them with the knife and a
long-tined serving fork, they had no choice but to open fire, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury cleared the officers of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Lewis B. Oliver Jr., an attorney who represented Davis'
family in a pair of lawsuits against the officers. Oliver, who
pursued the case for years, eventually came up with a photograph of
Davis, mortally wounded, lying on his bedroom floor. The photo was
taken by Police Officer George Venter, who arrived at the scene
just minutes after Davis had been shot.
</P>
<P>
   The photo shows clearly that the dying Davis was indeed
clutching an item in each of his hands, but there was no knife and
no fork. He held a key case in his left hand and a toy truck in his
right.
</P>
<P>
   Now if you want to know why Albany County is considered a
world-class comfort zone for police officers who find themselves in
a tight spot, consider this: Although the photo of Davis was
crucial evidence that appeared to contradict the police version of
the event, a juror would later tell The Albany Times Union that it
was never shown to the grand jury that investigated the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he had were his keys and one of those little Matchbox
trucks,'' said Oliver in an interview last week. ``And it was
claimed all along that he had rushed the police with a big fork.''
</P>
<P>
   The photograph of Davis came to light as a result of the
lawsuits, but not until 1993. It was published on the front page of
The Times Union.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 the city reached a $500,000 settlement with Davis'
family, and the mayor of Albany, Gerald Jennings, issued a public
apology. Jennings said, in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Davis was not accused of any crime at the time of the
incident, and he was undergoing medical treatment for a mental
health condition. In settling this case with the Jessie Davis
family, the city is acknowledging that it would have been better if
this incident had been handled by mental health professionals in
conjunction with the police department.''
</P>
<P>
   Not much has changed. The criminal justice system in Albany
County remains as notoriously reluctant as it ever was to hold
police officers accountable for misconduct, and this is the venue
into which the Amadou Diallo case has been shifted. The murder
trial of the officers who shot Diallo will begin in Albany on Jan.
31.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the officers will be tried fairly remains to be seen.
The Bronx district attorney's office will present the case. But
because so few cops are ever convicted of wrongdoing in Albany, and
because there are so few African-Americans in the jury pool,
acquittals in this case will be widely viewed as illegitimate, the
result of the criminal justice system's effort to find a venue in
which acquittals were virtually preordained.
</P>
<P>
   In a coincidence that adds a note of rueful irony to an already
emotionally complex case, the judge assigned to the Diallo trial,
Joseph Teresi, represented one of the police officers in the civil
suit filed by Jessie Davis' family. The officer, Charles Peters,
was at the scene but did not shoot Davis.

TO BOLDLY GO TO THE SUPERMARKET WITH CAPTAIN KIRK 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (af)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For weeks, I avoided using Priceline's new online grocery
service because I was sure I would hate it.
</P>
<P>
   Let's leave aside for the moment Priceline's reputation in the
name-your-price airline ticket business (too many stopovers, crazy
departure times), and the annoying television ads for the new
grocery service featuring the ``Star Trek'' actor William Shatner
(as if Captain Kirk ever set foot inside a Waldbaum's, much less
knew the first thing about how to keep a low profile with extra
items in the express line).
</P>
<P>
   More important, Priceline's online grocery service, called the
Priceline WebHouse Club, would force me to confront one of life's
worst weekly horrors _ grocery shopping _ not once, but twice.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it would work: Before I even went to a supermarket
(where you know I would have to pilot a cart with one skewed wheel
through a crash course of cereal displays, stand in line forever
and _ since I live in the New York area _ await the privilege of
bagging my own food), I would have to sit at my computer and pick
out every item I wanted on the site, which offers thousands of
items, from apples to Ziploc bags. For each item, I would specify
quantity, at least two brands I would be willing to accept and a
discounted price I thought was reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Then I would type in a credit card number and would have to
agree to pay for items fitting my criteria before the service's
software would negotiate with the manufacturers' software and spit
out a list of the items I had actually bought.
</P>
<P>
   Then I would print the list (oh, did I forget to say you need a
printer?), and take it to one of the hundreds of participating
stores in 12 major chains in the New York area. There, I would have
to pick out the right sizes and brands. (The service is also
available in Philadelphia and just began in Washington and
Baltimore; Boston will be next.) The company says 10,000 people are
using Priceline each day in the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   Then _ are you still with me? _ at the checkout, I would have to
separate the Priceline items from everything else and get them by
using a special debit card, which I had to send away for (it took a
few days to arrive). After 90 days, Priceline would charge me $3 a
month in months when I used the service. Oh, yes _ I would still
have to bag everything.
</P>
<P>
   All that made me want to scream. But last week, I finally
screwed up enough courage (a gin and tonic helped) to go to
www.Webhouse.priceline.com. And you know what? I loved it. In fact,
it may have been my best online shopping experience.
</P>
<P>
   The Priceline grocery service is the opposite of most Internet
conceits, which sound really cool in the abstract but fall far
short in the execution. With Priceline, the biggest hurdle was
embracing the headache-provoking concept. After that, the service
performed beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to remember, however, that the idea behind
Priceline groceries, like the one behind Priceline airline tickets,
is not about convenience. It's about saving a lot of money.
According to the company, the average Priceline shopping basket
totals $32, $12.75 less than the same items would otherwise cost.
</P>
<P>
   I decided on a few items for a test run. Take diapers, for
example. I agreed to buy a package (containing 36 to 56 diapers,
depending on size) and to accept either Pampers or Huggies. The
site said the typical price range was $11.99 to $13.79 (I usually
pay $13.49), then suggested that I name a lower price.
</P>
<P>
   Five lower amounts, ranging from $6.45 to $10.67, were listed,
or I could type in another amount. The higher I went, the greater
the chance I would get the item. I chose the lowest specified
amount, $6.45, a price that would be subsidized from a stash of
coupons called WebHouse dollars I received for being a first-time
customer.
</P>
<P>
   After I chose the diapers and eight other items, I clicked on
the Buy button. The site quickly announced that I had bought all
nine items for $40.76, which was immediately charged to my American
Express card. But as I printed the list, I panicked. I had just
paid for this stuff, but what if the store didn't have it in stock?
</P>
<P>
   So I called the site's toll-free customer service number _ and
got a shock. In less than 30 seconds, a knowledgeable person who
told me her full name answered my questions in a calm and
forthright manner. She was, in fact, the first online customer
service representative I had badgered _ er, spoken to _ in weeks
whose voice didn't sound as shifty as a Nixon administration
operative trying to explain erased tapes. I could use my prepaid
grocery list to pick up any item on it for up to 90 days. After
that, Priceline would automatically issue a refund.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't necessary. My local store had every item. And a
friendly checkout clerk was so familiar with the procedure _ she
said she rang up at least one Priceline sale a day and planned to
register on the site herself _ that she reminded me that the debit
card's PIN was 5555. I saved nearly $35 on nine items, paying
$40.76 instead of the $75 the store would otherwise have charged.
</P>
<P>
   Did that make me happy, like those people in Priceline ads? No,
it made me paranoid. Had I had been a patsy in a setup from an old
episode of ``Mission Impossible''? Now that I thought about it,
that clerk had looked suspiciously like Peter Graves in a wig. So I
phoned Priceline's founder, Jay Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's bankrolling this thing?'' I asked. That's the question
we always ask in my house when we're not quite sure what's going
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The manufacturers,'' Walker said. ``And they'll do it
forever.'' The groceries handle Priceline sales as if the shoppers
had coupons _ purchases are subsidized by manufacturers or
Priceline itself.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, Walker said, is this. By agreeing to accept more
than one brand, a Priceline shopper demonstrates a fickle nature.
``The manufacturers would rather not give you a discount, of
course, but if you prove that you're willing to switch brands,
they're willing to pay to keep you,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   As for my getting all nine items, that was unusual. Shoppers who
want nine things are usually able to get only five or seven, he
said. ``But for a first-time customer, our software bends over
backward,'' he said. ``So if the price you're willing to pay is 10
cents off what the manufacturer is willing to accept, the first
time we let you have it.''
</P>
<P>
   To see if I could repeat my success without being a first-time
customer, on Monday I tried nine different items. Again, I got all
nine. I paid $16.12, saving $10.28.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of tips if you plan to try Priceline: Don't buy an item
if you cannot accept a brand you usually don't choose. For
instance, I would be afraid to play Russian roulette with canned
tuna, fearing that I would end up with fish that had bits of scary
dark flesh and those little bones. But when it comes to diapers,
I'll take either Pampers or Huggies. And if I can get them for
half-price, I don't care that Priceline collects information about
what I buy or that Priceline shares it with manufacturers or
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, to ensure a continued supply of very cheap diapers, I
ratted on four friends. I gave their e-mail addresses to Priceline
in return for an extra 10 WebHouse dollars. You can get more
WebHouse dollars by filling out marketing surveys on the Priceline
site.
</P>
<P>
   If more than one manufacturer will accept the price you offer
for a product, you are matched randomly with one of them. Later,
you are more likely to matched with the same brand because your
previous purchase indicates that you like it.
</P>
<P>
   So far, I have no complaints with Priceline. Even the William
Shatner issue has been resolved. ``We've moved to testimonials
showing real people,'' Walker said. ``But we did consumer research,
and you'd be surprised at how high William Shatner's credibility
was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a grocery shopper?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Walker said. ``He was Captain Kirk. Remember?''

<P>
   The atmospheric pattern in the East does not favor wintry
weather during the next few days as the air covering the region is
relatively mild and the disturbance in the Great Lakes too weak to
cause widespread wintry precipitation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a large area of high pressure over Maine and an
approaching cold front in the Mississippi Valley, most places will
be dry and seasonable in the East. High clouds will increase in
western New England, however, as milder air returns above 5,000
feet.
</P>
<P>
   An onshore flow in the Southeast will draw mild and increasingly
moist air to the coast with thickening clouds and perhaps some
showers in eastern Georgia and portions of Florida. A weak
disturbance in the southern branch of the jet stream may induce low
pressure along an offshore front Thursday night, perhaps
threatening the Middle Atlantic or Northeast shoreline with light
rain or snow on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Steady light snow and snow showers will bring up to 3 inches of
snow from northern Minnesota to upper Michigan as low pressure
treks eastward through Ontario. A cold front in the Mississippi
Valley will be moisture-starved. Humid air streaming into Texas
should trigger some showers as the southern end of the front
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure over the central Rockies will keep the West
seasonably cool and dry. A strengthening flow from the east in
California will draw warm air to the Pacific coast. The Northwest
will turn dull and windy as a front approaches with showers likely
later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SNOWLESS IN BOSTON
</P>
<P>
   At the stroke of midnight Thursday morning, Boston tied an
all-time record for the latest date in winter without measurable
snow. The last time snowflakes were noted at Boston was March 15,
1999, a snowless streak that establishes a record for the city.
Boston's latest date for measurable snow (0.1 inches or more) was
observed on January 6, 1892. This record may also fall by the
wayside, given the currently tame weather pattern. A weak
disturbance will produce splotchy, light precipitation Friday, but,
even if precipitation develops at Logan Airport, it should be rain.

MARTIN BUBER AND THE SEATTLE RIOTS

 &HT;    
 &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA
WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)
 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Of all the events of recent months, none surprised the media as
much as the riots in Seattle around the World Trade Organization
talks.
 &HT;    For days following the initial outbreak of violence, pundits
were oddly silent, unable to interpret what they were seeing. World
political leaders, economists and trade advocates versus
environmentalists, human rights activists and labor?
 &HT;    Laid-back, successful Seattle? What could have caused such a
thing?
 &HT;    Although Seattle may be receding in memory as just one more 1999
news story, I would like to nominate it as last year's top religion
story. Indeed, when pundits look back on the first decade of the
twenty-first century, they may choose Seattle as the event that
initiated a new chapter of American ethics and spirituality.
 &HT;    The riots, sparked by a small anarchist group, made the
headlines. However, a large contingent of attendees went to Seattle
out of religious conviction. Roman Catholic nuns and priests,
liberal Protestants, progressive evangelicals, Jews and Buddhists
converged on Seattle to protest industrialized globalization and
its disregard for the dignity of creation.
 &HT;    One of the least-reported aspects of contemporary religion is
the greening of spirituality. Since the 1970s, religious belief and
environmentalism have converged on a number of fronts.
 &HT;    Americans have embraced a host of spiritualities honoring
nature: Wicca, Native American practices, and eastern religions.
Writers like Annie Dillard and Wendell Berry extol the vision of
God in creation. Even rather stuffy Christian organizations, such
as the National Council of Churches, have pursued ``green''
agendas.
 &HT;    Christian saints who embody ecological wholeness, like St.
Francis of Assisi and Hildegard of Bingen, enjoy surprising
popularity. And Jewish scholars cull the Hebrew scriptures to find
new understandings of early Israel as a people serving the land.
 &HT;    All this contrasts sharply with the past. Historically, western
religions have been ambivalent or hostile to nature. Some scholars
even attribute the environmental crisis to western religion. The
Bible, it is widely held, taught humanity to ``dominate'' the
earth. Backed by God's command to subdue nature, western Europeans
wreacked ecological havoc on the world.
 &HT;    Seattle proved that religious belief is not at enmity with the
earth. Those wanting to ``dominate'' the earth were the politicians
and economists. Among those wanting to save it were many thousands
of religious people.
 &HT;    Typically, Wiccans, Buddhists, Roman Catholics and Presbyterians
do not have much in common. But in Seattle they joined forces for
human rights and the rights of all nature: for slaves, debt relief,
humane labor conditions; for clean air, sea turtles and rain
forests.
 &HT;    Diverse groups laid aside theological difference for common
cause: if we lose the earth, we lose everything.
 &HT;    What traditional Christians are finally realizing -- and why
they can join with others in this cause -- is that there is no
fundamental divide between ``man'' and ``nature.'' For nearly two
millennia, this dualism reigned in the West. Humanity was ``above''
the rest of creation, thus superior to it.
 &HT;    But a new message has gotten through. All creation -- humanity
included -- is connected. We are all part of a divine ecosystem,
God's habitat. Everyone, everything in the world is kin.
 &HT;    In his influential ``I and Thou,'' Jewish theologian Martin
Buber depicted relationship as the basis of all religious ethics.
When something is defined as an ``It'' -- a separate and outside
entity -- human beings feel justified in abusing it. But when
things as defined as ``Thou'' -- things possessing a fundamental
dignity of their own -- a relationship of mutual respect ensues.
 &HT;    Thus, ``I-Thou'' is the starting point for true spirituality.
``In the beginning,'' Buber wrote, ``there is relation.''
 &HT;    Seattle was not an outbreak of isolated rowdiness or
eco-terrorism. Seattle was a clash between two worldviews: those
who see nature as an ``It'' and those who see it as a ``Thou.'' On
a street in front of Starbucks, those concerned with the utility of
things versus those concerned with the dignity of creation played
out the future.
 &HT;    And it is the future. Jane Goodall says, ``If only we can
overcome cruelty, human and animal, with love and compassion shall
we stand at the threshold of a new era in human moral and spiritual
evolution -- and realize, at last, our most unique quality:
humanity.''
 &HT;    In other words, by embracing ``I-Thou,'' the world has a chance
to survive.
 &HT;    Through the broken glass of Nordstrom, we glimpse a new hope --
a hope to overcome division, a hope for peace, a hope for genuine
global community. And this community is not tied together by the
Internet, but it is linked in its common divinity.
 &HT;    Looking past the violent minority, Seattle demonstrated there
are more ``I-Thou'' folks than I dared hope.

 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Of all the events of recent months, none surprised the media as
much as the riots in Seattle around the World Trade Organization
talks.
 &HT;    For days following the initial outbreak of violence, pundits
were oddly silent, unable to interpret what they were seeing. World
political leaders, economists and trade advocates versus
environmentalists, human rights activists and labor?
 &HT;    Laid-back, successful Seattle? What could have caused such a
thing?
 &HT;    Although Seattle may be receding in memory as just one more 1999
news story, I would like to nominate it as last year's top religion
story. Indeed, when pundits look back on the first decade of the
twenty-first century, they may choose Seattle as the event that
initiated a new chapter of American ethics and spirituality.
 &HT;    The riots, sparked by a small anarchist group, made the
headlines. However, a large contingent of attendees went to Seattle
out of religious conviction. Roman Catholic nuns and priests,
liberal Protestants, progressive evangelicals, Jews and Buddhists
converged on Seattle to protest industrialized globalization and
its disregard for the dignity of creation.
 &HT;    One of the least-reported aspects of contemporary religion is
the greening of spirituality. Since the 1970s, religious belief and
environmentalism have converged on a number of fronts.
 &HT;    Americans have embraced a host of spiritualities honoring
nature: Wicca, Native American practices, and eastern religions.
Writers like Annie Dillard and Wendell Berry extol the vision of
God in creation. Even rather stuffy Christian organizations, such
as the National Council of Churches, have pursued ``green''
agendas.
 &HT;    Christian saints who embody ecological wholeness, like St.
Francis of Assisi and Hildegard of Bingen, enjoy surprising
popularity. And Jewish scholars cull the Hebrew scriptures to find
new understandings of early Israel as a people serving the land.
 &HT;    All this contrasts sharply with the past. Historically, western
religions have been ambivalent or hostile to nature. Some scholars
even attribute the environmental crisis to western religion. The
Bible, it is widely held, taught humanity to ``dominate'' the
earth. Backed by God's command to subdue nature, western Europeans
wreacked ecological havoc on the world.
 &HT;    Seattle proved that religious belief is not at enmity with the
earth. Those wanting to ``dominate'' the earth were the politicians
and economists. Among those wanting to save it were many thousands
of religious people.
 &HT;    Typically, Wiccans, Buddhists, Roman Catholics and Presbyterians
do not have much in common. But in Seattle they joined forces for
human rights and the rights of all nature: for slaves, debt relief,
humane labor conditions; for clean air, sea turtles and rain
forests.
 &HT;    Diverse groups laid aside theological difference for common
cause: if we lose the earth, we lose everything.
 &HT;    What traditional Christians are finally realizing -- and why
they can join with others in this cause -- is that there is no
fundamental divide between ``man'' and ``nature.'' For nearly two
millennia, this dualism reigned in the West. Humanity was ``above''
the rest of creation, thus superior to it.
 &HT;    But a new message has gotten through. All creation -- humanity
included -- is connected. We are all part of a divine ecosystem,
God's habitat. Everyone, everything in the world is kin.
 &HT;    In his influential ``I and Thou,'' Jewish theologian Martin
Buber depicted relationship as the basis of all religious ethics.
When something is defined as an ``It'' -- a separate and outside
entity -- human beings feel justified in abusing it. But when
things as defined as ``Thou'' -- things possessing a fundamental
dignity of their own -- a relationship of mutual respect ensues.
 &HT;    Thus, ``I-Thou'' is the starting point for true spirituality.
``In the beginning,'' Buber wrote, ``there is relation.''
 &HT;    Seattle was not an outbreak of isolated rowdiness or
eco-terrorism. Seattle was a clash between two worldviews: those
who see nature as an ``It'' and those who see it as a ``Thou.'' On
a street in front of Starbucks, those concerned with the utility of
things versus those concerned with the dignity of creation played
out the future.
 &HT;    And it is the future. Jane Goodall says, ``If only we can
overcome cruelty, human and animal, with love and compassion shall
we stand at the threshold of a new era in human moral and spiritual
evolution -- and realize, at last, our most unique quality:
humanity.''
 &HT;    In other words, by embracing ``I-Thou,'' the world has a chance
to survive.
 &HT;    Through the broken glass of Nordstrom, we glimpse a new hope --
a hope to overcome division, a hope for peace, a hope for genuine
global community. And this community is not tied together by the
Internet, but it is linked in its common divinity.

   ALABAMA-ETHICS _ Alabama's ethics law was born of a legislative

following the Watergate scandal that toppled President Richard
Nixon. Alabama's Legislature, not particularly known for its
progressivism, was considering a model ethics law. Its Senate
quickly passed legislation drafted largely by the public interest
group Common Cause. Not to be outdone, the House added 16
strengthing amendments, fully believing the Senate woud kill the
legislation. Instead, the Senate accepted all amendments and sent
the legislation to Gov. George C. Wallace. ``They kept making it
stronger and stronger knowing it wouldn't pass. Then, the media and
the public got onto it and the politicians were afraid to vote
against it. Wallace wasn't about to veto it,'' said Ethics
Commission Vice Chairman John L. Watson of Dothan. Today, Alabama's

<P>
   NEW YORK _ So is that ``The Wild Party'' featuring Mandy
Patinkin or ``The Wild Party'' featuring Taye Diggs? ``The Wild
Party'' written by Andrew Lippa or the one by Michael John LaChiusa
and George C. Wolfe? ``The Wild Party'' produced by Manhattan
Theater Club that opens off-Broadway on Feb. 24 or ``The Wild
Party'' presented by the New York Shakespeare Festival/Joseph Papp
Public Theater and several commercial producers that opens on
Broadway on April 6?
</P>
<P>
   This is exactly the confusion that producers of both ``Wild
Party'' productions are worried about creating in the months ahead.
Both sets of producers find themselves part of what the League of
American Theaters and Producers says appears to be a first for New
York theater: two new musicals inspired by the same source material
coming to the stage in the same season.
</P>
<P>
   The work that prompted both productions is the 1928 jazz-era
poem ``The Wild Party,'' by Joseph Moncure March. The poem, told in
syncopated rhyming couplets, chronicles a sex-infused,
liquor-soaked Prohibition-era party that degenerates from hedonism
into murder. The poem _ improvised by March at age 26 after he
resigned as managing editor of The New Yorker _ was considered too
risque to publish until 1928, when a limited edition was released
and then banned in Boston. After producing another poem, ``The
Set-Up,'' March went on to write documentaries and to contribute
many articles to The New York Times Magazine until his death in
1977. A film based on the poem and starring Raquel Welch and James
Coco was released in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, both ``Wild Party'' teams are playing down
the concurrence of the musicals as an insignificant coincidence.
But when pressed, the producers concede that the timing is
unfortunate. ``I would love it if it weren't there, but it's
there,'' said Scott Rudin, one of the producers supporting the
Public Theater's production. But he added, ``You can't run your
life  somebody else is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The simultaneous appearance of two films or two books on the
same subject is common. Several people involved in the ``Wild
Party'' productions commented that there was a time in the 1920s
when two ``Hot Mikado'' productions ran simultaneously, and noted
that an alternative ``Phantom'' by Maury Yeston and Arthur Kopit
has been touring while Andrew Lloyd Webber's hit ``Phantom of the
Opera'' is ensconced on Broadway. Shows with similar subject matter
have been staged in other Broadway seasons: in 1972-73, there were
three plays about Mary Todd Lincoln; in 1975-76, a ``Rockabye
Hamlet'' and a ``Hamlet.'' But no one could remember when two shows
with the same title based on the same work were simultaneously
running in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe, who is writing the book of the musical with LaChiusa as
well as directing and producing it, said he would have liked to
open first, and almost did, given that he originally expected to
mount the play last season. But the show needed more work, Wolfe
said, and then scheduling conflicts pushed it back.
</P>
<P>
   The production almost hit another roadblock in September when
Vanessa Williams, who was supposed to play the leading role,
Queenie, dropped out because of her pregnancy (the Public quickly
replaced her with Toni Collette, the Australian actress best known
to American audiences for the movies ``Sixth Sense'' and ``Muriel's
Wedding''). As a result, the Public's production will start
previews in March, one month after Manhattan Theater Club's
production has opened.
</P>
<P>
   One could argue that the Public's production, which also
features Eartha Kitt, has the advantage of being the big kid on the
block, given that it will start on Broadway, with all the publicity
that brings. In addition to Rudin, the Broadway producers Roger
Berlind, Elizabeth Williams and Anita Waxman are backing the
Public's version.
</P>
<P>
   But starting on Broadway also has its drawbacks. For one thing,
it costs more to produce there _ $5 million for ``The Wild Party''
_ even though Wolfe said everyone involved was working for lower
rates. (Manhattan Theater Club would not disclose the cost of its
version.) Moreover, the scrutiny given to Broadway shows is greater
and often less forgiving. And one could argue that these stakes are
even higher than usual for Wolfe, given that his ill-fated Broadway
revival of ``On the Town'' closed with an estimated loss of $6
million last season.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan Theater Club, on the other hand, will have the luxury
of testing its ``Wild Party'' on the relatively safer ground of a
loyal subscriber audience and can wait to gauge critical support
before deciding whether to risk a more costly commercial run.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, there are two commercial producers waiting in the
wings to do exactly that, Jeffrey Seller and Kevin McCollum, both
of whom have long supported Lippa's work and helped produce the
successful rock musical ``Rent.'' But though they provided
``enhancement money'' to Manhattan Theater Club for its production
and said they had secured the commercial rights to the project _
meaning the right to transfer the show _ Seller and McCollum are
keeping a low profile.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the show's prospects for a life beyond Manhattan
Theater Club, Seller said: ``We don't want to talk about any of
that right now. We just want to see the show reach its potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Manhattan Theater Club's production is no small undertaking.
The cast of 19, which also features Brian d'Arcy James, Idina
Menzel and Julia Murney, is larger than the Public's 15. And rather
than use Eliran/Murphy Ltd., the theater club's usual agency, to
design the ads for the musical, the producers have enlisted Spotco,
the theater industry's new hip ad agency, which did the ``Rent''
posters that drew so much attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose it's an advantage to be first, but it's even more of
an advantage to be good,'' said Rocco Landesman, president of
Jujamcyn Theaters which owns the Virginia Theater, where the
Public's production will be. ``It'll be fun to see how it all
evolves.''
</P>
<P>
   Be it a car or a theatrical production, selling a product
bearing the same name as another on the market presents a costly
challenge, and possibly a catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be about the ad images and the stars,'' said
Randall L. Wreghitt, a Broadway producer who runs a company called
Promarketing. ``There is a contest there of sorts that goes not
only for the shows themselves but how each show is presented to the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams went so far as to suggest that a name change might
be necessary if both shows end up on Broadway. ``Maybe we'll have
to call ours, `George Wolfe's ``Wild Party,'''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe said it was distracting _ even destructive _ to focus on
anything other than creating the musical, which starts rehearsals
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a producer, you have to be aware of the landscape,'' Wolfe
said. ``But that really can't inform the work that you do.''
Creating a musical, he added, is hard enough without looking over
your shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe and others involved in the two shows repeatedly emphasized
that with distinct creative teams, the projects might well turn out
to have nothing in common except the source. Wolfe said that it
would be like comparing ``Romanoff and Juliet'' and ``West Side
Story,'' two entirely different contemporary works inspired by
``Romeo and Juliet'' that appeared on Broadway in the same 1956-57
season.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, those who so far seem least affected by the existence of
two productions are the creative people involved. ``We don't think
about it too much, frankly,'' said Gabriel Barre, who is directing
the Manhattan Theater Club version.
</P>
<P>
   Patinkin, who is starring in the Public's production, said:
``I'm fascinated by it. I'd love to see the other one.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Each composer said he had been far too consumed by writing his
``Wild Party'' to worry about the other.
</P>
<P>
   Both young composers _ Lippa is 35, LaChiusa, 37 _ describe
encountering the poem in their own personal ways, and being drawn
in by those first compelling lines: ``Queenie was a blonde, and her
age stood still/And she danced twice a day in vaudeville.''
</P>
<P>
   Lippa said he had come upon the poem, which had been reissued in
1994 with illustrations by Art Spiegelman, while browsing through
the poetry section at a Barnes &AMP; Noble. In January 1996 he started
writing. In the past Lippa had only written the music for pieces
like ``John and Jen'' at the Lamb's Theater in 1995 and last
season's ``You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Meadow, artistic director of Manhattan Theater Club, said
she was not discouraged by the other production. ``The fact that
someone else was drawn to it certainly as a matter of interest is
fascinating,'' she said. ``But that did not deter our interest or
affect our decision.''
</P>
<P>
   LaChiusa and Wolfe had worked together on two productions at the
Public, ``The Petrified Prince,'' for which LaChiusa wrote
incidental music, and ``First Lady Suite,'' three musical vignettes
about first ladies. When Wolfe offered the composer a yearlong paid
artist's residency in April 1997 and commissioned him to write
something for the Public, LaChiusa said he turned to the March
poem. A friend had brought the Spiegelman version to his attention
and he had stored it away as something he might return to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read through it and thought, this is right now, what I want
to say,'' said LaChiusa, who also wrote ``Marie Christine,'' now
playing at the Vivian Beaumont.
</P>
<P>
   Why bring ``The Wild Party'' straight to Broadway? Wolfe said
that his theater could not accommodate a production on the scale
that ``The Wild Party'' had assumed. Nevertheless, the musical will
be arriving at the Virginia at a time when Broadway seems to be
moving away from riskier new work and toward more sure-fire
revivals.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, LaChiusa's ``Marie Christine'' received mixed reviews
when it opened last month. Rudin said that bucking the tide is what
theater producing is all about. ``If you're part of trend, you're
behind it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe said he never thought of postponing or dropping the
project. ``To not go ahead would be wrong,'' he said. ``Because
it's a piece that's ready to be born.''
</P>
<P>
   And much as the press and some theater insiders have licked
their chops over the prospect of a ``Wild Party'' showdown, and
though the New York theater world is notorious for its
Schadenfreude, the people behind each production seem at this point
to harbor little ill will. One reason may be that each musical
originated in the more collegial world of institutional theater.
</P>
<P>
   Even Berlind, who has known the high of producing a show like
the recent hit revival ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' and the lows of producing
a show like the 1997 bomb ``Steel Pier,'' and is normally the first
to say that producing on Broadway is about making a profit, seemed
strangely magnanimous about the whole thing. ``I don't view them as
competitors,'' he said. ``We're all in the same leaky boat.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Stock markets across much of Asia plummeted Wednesday,
abruptly ending a new-year rally as investors reacted with alarm to
Wall Street's stumble Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fears that the United States plans to raise interest rates
prompted investors to dump shares in blue-chip companies from Seoul
to Singapore. The selloff was most severe in Hong Kong, where the
benchmark Hang Seng index plunged 7.2 percent, or 1,226 points, its
second-largest point loss in history.
</P>
<P>
   But while the flood of losses seemed to echo the tumultuous
first days of the Asian economic crisis, analysts said there was
little reason to panic. They said that investors were mainly
seeking to lock in their profits after a powerful year-end rally,
particularly in high-flying technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a surprise because virtually every day over the last
two months, we have been waiting and wondering when the market
would correct,'' said Dong Tao, a regional strategist at Credit
Suisse First Boston in Hong Kong. ``Asia's recovery is still very
much alive,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei index fell 460.31 points, or 2.4
percent, to 18,542.55. But importantly, more shares gained value
than lost value, as investors took their money out of technology
and Internet-related stocks and put it into traditional sectors
like construction, steel and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the stocks to be looking at,'' said Craig Chudler, a
strategist at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo. ``There are real
opportunities in those bombed-out areas of the market, whereas the
Sonys and Softbanks have been oversold,'' he said, referring to two
popular Japanese technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In other Asian markets, it was hard to see the big picture as
the losses piled up. South Korea's market dropped 6.9 percent, or
72.73 points, its worst single-day point loss ever. Shares in
Singapore declined by 5.5 percent, while the markets in Malaysia
and Thailand fell 2.2 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   China's stock markets took some hits as well, though not as
badly. In the southern city of Shenzhen adjoining Hong Kong, the
stock index representing shares that can be purchased by foreign
investors fell 2.5 percent, and a similar index in Shanghai ended
unchanged. Shares of companies available only to Chinese investors
rose, however, with the main index in Shanghai gaining 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan avoided the rout. Taipei's weighted price index rose 1.1
percent as investors bought shares of semiconductor companies.
Taiwan's market is driven by technology manufacturing companies _
as opposed to Internet-related concerns _ which makes it less
vulnerable to wild swings.
</P>
<P>
   Though stock markets in Asia have always paid attention to Wall
Street, the link has become closer as Asian countries have come to
depend on the United States as the locomotive pulling them out of
recession. Investors in Asia worry that if the Federal Reserve
raises interest rates, as is widely expected, it would diminish the
appetite of American consumers for goods from Asia.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That fear is magnified in Hong Kong because the former British
colony ties the value of its currency to the U.S. dollar. When the
United States raises interest rates, Hong Kong's banks must follow
suit to defend the value of the Hong Kong dollar. Hong Kong has put
last year's recession behind it, but some people fear that higher
rates could strangle the recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's sensitivity to the United States has also been heightened
by the recent surge in popularity of technology stocks here. Shares
of companies like Softbank in Japan and Pacific Century Cyberworks
in Hong Kong have propelled the broader markets to record levels.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, when the Nasdaq composite index, which lists many
top American technology stocks, fell 5.6 percent Tuesday, its
reverberations were felt in Asia. Pacific Century Cyberworks _ an
Internet-related company that has been the toast of Hong Kong, even
hosting the most talked-about New Year's Eve party _ slid 15
percent, to $16.05 a share, in furious trading.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said such setbacks were to be expected, given the
torrid performance of most Asian markets in the last six months.
Shares in Tokyo rose 37 percent in 1999, buoyed by hopes that Japan
is finally pulling out of its chronic downturn. Hong Kong's market
plowed through 17,000 points on the first day of trading in 2000,
after soaring from one record after another last week.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Hang Seng index plummeted more than 1,000 points
in the opening minutes of trading, to less than 16,000, before
stabilizing. The dizzying decline prompted Hong Kong's financial
secretary, Sir Donald Tsang, to appeal for calm among investors.
The market recovered its equilibrium in afternoon trading, closing
at 15,846.72, 158 points above its lowest point of the day.
</P>
<P>
   But Asia is worlds away from October 1997, when a market crash
in Hong Kong augured a financial crisis across the region. In those
tense days, investors were unnerved by a series of currency
devaluations and the dawning recognition that hundreds of Asian
banks and companies were effectively insolvent.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after two painful years, most Asian countries are emerging
from recession faster than expected. And while the region's initial
recovery was driven by exports _ particularly in Korea and Malaysia
_ economists say domestic consumption is perking up in these
countries as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this had happened a few months earlier, it would have much
more threatening,'' Tao of Credit Suisse said. ``Asia's recovery
depended much more on exports, and investors were still very
fragile.''

CROATIA'S OPPOSITION LEADERS FRET OVER DELAY IN TRANSFER OF POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia _ In the midst of the euphoria and high
expectations following their convincing victory in parliamentary
elections on Monday, leaders of Croatia's democratic opposition are
growing concerned about when they will be able to take power and
what they will find when they do so.
</P>
<P>
   Ivica Racan, the moderate former Communist who is expected to
become the country's new prime minister, said in an interview on
Wednesday that it could be a month or more before Croatia's
cumbersome constitutional process allows him to form a government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we have a program of political and economic
change,'' Racan said wryly. ``But we'll have to see what the real
situation is with the budget and everything else. It will be much
worse, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Racan, leader of the Social Democrats, and his coalition
partner, presidential hopeful Drazen Budisa of the Social Liberals,
will rule with the help of an allied four-party coalition. They
will replace the Croatian Democratic Union that has run the country
since the late president, Franjo Tudjman, took Croatia out of
Yugoslavia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tudjmanism _ this mixture of authoritarianism, nationalism and
socialism _ is dead with its creator,'' said Mirko Galic, editor in
chief of the independent weekly Globus.
</P>
<P>
   But with the death of Tudjman last month and the rebuff to his
party, known as the HDZ, ``we're really entering a period of
instability,'' said Damir Matkovic, a television journalist. ``It's
a sort of paradox, but real freedom has come. And the problems the
HDZ is leaving are so deep and complicated, you can't solve them
quickly or without real pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy is mired in deep recession, with unemployment well
over 20 percent, a large budget deficit, a $10 billion national
debt, declining foreign investment and a fifth of the 4.8 million
Croatians due some kind of government pension from a pension fund
that is practically bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racan and Budisa have to move quickly, in the next two or
three weeks, to lay out a comprehensive plan of economic reform,''
a senior Western diplomat said. ``That's what they've been elected
to do, and if they don't they'll be dead, and this euphoria will
turn against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Racan and Budisa are discussing some symbolic steps to distance
themselves from the past, among them giving up state control over
Tito's resort and moving the presidential apparatus out of the
former Tito villa and closer to Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is already preparing a package of policies, both
substantive and symbolic, to aid the new opposition government,
whose election the Clinton administration supported.
</P>
<P>
   That package will include economic advisers, a quick opening of
talks with Croatia, some association with NATO and a visit by
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, perhaps for the inauguration
of a new president. Representatives of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund will also be encouraged to begin
working with the new government.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals for more substantive American aid are still being
discussed, officials said, and they will expect the new government
to take quick action first on promises to free up the media,
respect human rights and cooperate better in Bosnia and with the
international war crimes tribunal in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
   But Racan will want to move carefully, also, not to leave
himself open to attacks in a Croatia that remains ``extremely, even
rabidly nationalist,'' a senior European diplomat said. Another
Western diplomat expressed concern that the tribunal will ask too
much of Racan's government just as it is trying to push unpopular
economic changes.
</P>
<P>
   Much will also depend on who is elected president, with the
first round of voting on Jan. 24 and a second round expected Feb.
7. The main opposition candidate, Budisa, is also a strong
nationalist. The current foreign minister, Mate Granic of the HDZ,
is considered relatively moderate, at least in the context of his
party.
</P>
<P>
   Either would be far easier to work with than Tudjman. Diplomats
say Washington would have preferred Granic to run as an independent
instead of as the candidate of the HDZ.
</P>
<P>
   American officials are wary of what promises he may have made to
more conservative or nationalist officials to obtain his party's
nomination. But the HDZ's stinging defeat in the parliamentary vote
has hurt Granic's chances and boosted those of Budisa.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Racan is also concerned about the high expectations that
Croatians now have about rapid change from a new government. People
tell him, he said, that ``we know it will be difficult for you, and
that you must change many things in Croatia, but don't change
yourself.'' They want honest government, he said, adding that at
least, he can try to provide that to them.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for the winning coalition, Tihomir Ladisic,
thinks there is real danger in the long gap between winning the
election and forming a government.
</P>
<P>
   The state electoral commission found irregularities in 11
polling places, and there is talk of vote-rigging among Bosnian
Croats. New voting in those polling places will take place on Jan.
16, the commission announced, thus delaying both official results
and the convening of a new Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The current acting president, a member of the HDZ, has the
right, under the constitution, to wait up to 20 days after official
results to call a new Parliament into session.
</P>
<P>
   The Parliament must elect a new speaker and acting president.
That person must then ask a political leader, presumably Racan, to
form a government. But the Parliament might not be called into
session until after at least the first round of presidential voting
on Jan. 24, or even until after the new president is elected and
inaugurated. Some diplomats here think that could be as late as
mid-February.

&HT;     HOUSE GOP MARKS ANNIVERSARY OF '95 TAKEOVER; GINGRICH
UNINVITED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans celebrated the fifth anniversary
of their takeover of Congress Wednesday with a news conference that
conspicuously didn't include former House Speaker Newt Gingrich but
that revived the GOP goal of delivering a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders also vowed to increase their narrow 5-vote
majority in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is not just to retain control of the House but
to grow our majority,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts Jr., R-Okla., the No.
4 ranked Republican House member. ``Our vital signs show we're in
very good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts also said Republicans plan to draft a tax cut bill over
the next two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want tax relief for working Americans,'' said Watts, adding
that it would be good for the economy ``to give people money back
to buy the things they use everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   The fifth anniversary celebration took the form of a Capitol
Hill news conference where two dozen Republican House members,
primarily from the class of 1994, touted their legislative
successes.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, once heralded as the architect of the historic
Republican victories in the 1994 election that gave the GOP a House
majority for the first time in 40 years, was noticeably absent.
After resigning as speaker and giving up his House seat following
his party's losses in the November 1998 elections, Gingrich was
romantically linked with a woman staff member of a House committee.
He and his wife later divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether GOP members were distancing themselves from
Gingrich because of his messy divorce, Watts denied the former
speaker was intentionally excluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a whole lot of folks (who) contributed to getting us
where we are,'' Watts said. ``I personally believe Gingrich was one
who led the charge.'' But, Watts added, Gingrich ``was one of the
first to say don't focus on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich wrote a letter to a Capitol Hill newspaper last fall
saying it wouldn't be appropriate for him to attend such an event
because he was part of the past and this was about the future.
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions about rumors that he plans to resign or
retire from the House, Watts said he hasn't made a decision yet.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he has spent 10 years in public service, adding: ``
You've got to be careful you don't get on a political treadmill
that you can't get off.''
</P>
<P>
   During the news conference the Republican House members claimed
credit for balancing the budget, reducing taxes for families and
businesses, protecting Social Security from being spent on other
programs, overhauling the welfare system and increasing defense
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Watts also said Republicans have plans to send education dollars
back to school districts and strengthen national defense.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., a former House GOP leader, said
Republican efforts to save Social Security are especially good for
women who live an average of seven years longer than men and ``find
themselves with fewer dollars.''

BOWDEN LOOKING AHEAD TO NEXT YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ He says he might strut for a week or so now. But
not too much mind you. ``I'm too old to celebrate,'' said Bobby
Bowden with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden savored the moment, then started to talk about next
season.
</P>
<P>
   So while Bourbon Street started to empty out Wednesday, with
celebrations over Florida State's 46-29 Sugar Bowl victory over
Virginia Tech fresh in their fans' memory banks, Bowden talked
about doing it again next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (quarterback Chris) Weinke come back,'' said Bowden. ``We
got a chance to be back here, we sure do. We've got all of our
defensive ends coming back, all of our linebackers, three quarters
of our defensive backfield. We've got some good, young offensive
linemen and some good skilled people.''
</P>
<P>
   Who wants to bet against the Seminoles? Not only did their win
in the Bowl Championship Series title game Tuesday give them their
second national championship, but it also marked the 13th
consecutive time the Seminoles have finished in the Top 5.
</P>
<P>
   This season was special, however, because no team had ever gone
wire to wire as No. 1 since the Associated Press started preseason
polls in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   In lots of ways, the Seminoles' victory over Virginia Tech was a
condensed version of their season.
</P>
<P>
   They played well at times, building a 28-7 lead 19 minutes into
the game. They played poorly, allowing Virginia Tech's sensational
redshirt freshman quarterback, Michael Vick, to rally the Hokies to
a 29-28 third-quarter lead. And they finished strong, pulling away
as Weinke (20 for 34, 329 yards, 2 TDs) and wide receiver Peter
Warrick (two touchdown catches, a 59-yard punt return for a
touchdown, and a 2-point conversion reception) took over.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second quarter, we kind of had a chance to blow open
the game,'' said Bowden Wednesday. ``And then the thing kind of
slipped away from us. But the kids did what they had to do, just
like they have been doing all year.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Seminoles celebrated afterward, Bowden savored the
moment, and took a call from President Clinton, of which the
transcript offers the quintiessental Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   ``How come you're not working tonight?'' Bowden began the
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   This is how he ended it: ``We're thrilled you were able to see
the game. All, I can say, is `Go Hogs.' Thanks again. See ya,
buddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Pure Bowden. Homespun humor, marked with a touch of humility.
And that is why Bowden is still coaching at 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess when you're 70, you're supposed to go ride off in the
sunset,'' he said. ``Is there a saloon out there or something?''
</P>
<P>
   But truth be told, Bowden wants to coach because he knows
coaching. Wednesday he said he had the same passion he had 40 years
ago when he was a young coach in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   He also worries about what will happen if he doesn't coach.
People closest to him say he saw how quickly legendary coach Paul
Bear Bryant died when he retired at Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   And he's also still good at it. His role is more CEO than head
coach. What coach can you name who would consent to being
interviewed on television while the game was going on as Bowden did
Tuesday?
</P>
<P>
   In offensive coordinator Mark Richt and defensive coordinator
Mickey Andrews, Bowden has two assistants who could be head coaches
at most programs.
</P>
<P>
   So Bowden plays the role of father figure as he did in guiding
Warrick throught a turbulent season. He puts on the headsets only
to listen generally as the calls are made by Richt and Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   But like Joe Paterno at Penn State, Bowden is FSU football. And
it is very good football.
</P>
<P>
   You might not like the players. You might think Bowden is too
lenient, but he will argue that point forever. He says he will not
throw his players to the wolves when something bad happens, but
rather treat them as he would his own children and discpline them
in his own way _ public opinion be damned.
</P>
<P>
   And now he has two national championships. ``This one is
sweeter,'' he said Wednesday as he collected trophies from the
Associated Press, the American Football Coaches Association, and
the Football Writers of America. ``The first one (in 1993) was more
a sense of relief.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also more enjoyable, Bowden says, because the Seminoles
had to earn this title. ``If we had won going away, it might have
been different,'' he said. ``But we had to come from behind in this
one, so, yeah, I enjoyed it more.''
</P>
<P>
   As well he should. Virginia Tech doesn't have to apologize to
anyone about its credentials. The Hokies with Vick passing (15 for
29, 225 yards, 1 TD) and running (23 carries, 97 yards, 1 TD) never
flinched.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Vick is better than I thought,'' said Bowden. ``I looked
at tape of him before the game and I said, `We can catch him.' But
he's quick. We had a tough time.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the Seminoles were tougher. And Bowden had his
second national championship because of it.

PULLMAN TAKES TNT'S NEW `VIRGINIAN' BY THE REINS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are so many things to think about _ developing the concept
for the production, planning its look with designers, rehearsing
the actors, bringing in the best crew you can find, and, when the
show is ready to go, hoping the critics are kind.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Pullman is not just talking about his film directing debut
on TNT's remake of the classic western ``The Virginian,''
premiering Sunday. He's recounting the seven or so years he spent
directing plays in small theaters around the country, including
college campuses and Shakespeare festivals _ even, he confesses, a
community-theater staging of the hillbilly musical ``Li'l Abner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where you learn organization,'' he said, laughing.
``You think movie directing is hard, wait till you get all the moms
and their kids and you have to make sure they're all getting there
on time.''
</P>
<P>
   Pullman holds a master of fine arts degree in directing from the
University of Massachusetts, Amherst, unbeknownst to moviegoers who
think of him simply as one of the stars of ``Independence Day'' and
``While You Were Sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   But TNT executives knew of his directing skills when they
approached him a couple of years ago about directing and starring
in ``The Virginian,'' the 1902 Owen Wister story considered by many
to be the seed of its genre. He also is one of the show's
producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at the book again, and that's what hooked me,''
Pullman said, talking over coffee at a Beverly Hills hotel. ``I had
read it quickly _ it was like adjunct reading in college, you do
your old phony-baloney reading of it _ but it wasn't what I
expected or remembered. It was more interesting, it was darker, the
dialogue was great between him and her, and I liked the language of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   After four screen versions, most memorably the 1929 film
starring Gary Cooper and the 1946 production with Joel McCrea,
there is one bit of ``Virginian'' dialogue that has found its place
in American folklore, although it often is misquoted: ``If you want
to call me that, smile.'' The line became fodder for Looney Tunes
cartoons and ``I Love Lucy'' gags, but in the hands of Pullman and
screenwriter Larry Gross, it has sensible context and
believability.
</P>
<P>
   Believability of the story was important to Wister, a patrician
Easterner who spent time in the West for his health, and it
remained a focal point for Pullman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Virginian'' is about a Southerner who tends cattle on a
Wyoming territory ranch at the turn of the last century. A new
schoolteacher, the strong-willed Molly Stark (Diane Lane), arrives
from Vermont and tries to bring an Eastern civility to the wild
territory where property claims and other disputes between ranchers
and cowboys are settled through vigilante justice. The Virginian is
caught between his own interpretation of right and wrong and his
growing respect for Molly, who abhors violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like a psychology that was atypical to westerns, and
yet it was the seminal western,'' Pullman said. ``(Wister) had very
elaborate journals, so I think he had a good ear, and the journals
were attempts to record a style of talking, but then he was an
admirer of Henry James and Jane Austen and was a personal friend of
Teddy Roosevelt, so he saw himself as trying to maintain a certain
sensitivity inside the story. I think that might have also
encouraged him to pay attention to the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``TNT, I think, was a little surprised when the first drafts
were coming in because the cowboy image now is a man of few words
who is pretty `aw shucks' about the girl, and she usually has to
make the advances, and he reluctantly and kind of stubbornly and
stoically complies.
</P>
<P>
   ``And here was a story of a guy who actually enjoys language
with her ... and he's literate, and when he needs to talk, he
talks, and he's the one who makes advances to her, almost like a
quest to win her.''
</P>
<P>
   True to the novel, Pullman's cowboy is referred to only as the
Virginian, never by a given name or surname. ``The idea of not
knowing his name felt really right because so many of the other
characters really aren't identified by their right names either,
and the more I thought about it, it's like any nomadic culture,
like a circus or hobos, where they get names like Shorty or Honey
or Nebrasky _ no one ever really gets to know each other in that
encumbered way.''
</P>
<P>
   Pullman; co-stars Lane, Dennis Weaver (evil rancher Sam Balaam)
and John Savage (Steve); and some 200 other actors, livestock
wranglers and crew filmed the movie last July in a wide expanse of
Alberta, Canada, about 90 minutes' drive from Calgary and
beautifully unspoiled by telephone wires, asphalt and jet vapor
trails. Pullman said he passed up ready-made western towns and
instead had the streetless town of Medicine Bow, Wyo., constructed
to match Wister's account of buildings that resembled ``a bunch of
bones just thrown out on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, chatting from his solar-powered home in southwestern
Colorado, said Pullman showed none of the signs of a novice
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't have ever known it was his first time had that
information not gotten out,'' Weaver said. ``He handled his camera
extremely well, he related to the crew very professionally, he
excited the actors in a very wonderful way. He had no problems his
first time out.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying there were ``no problems'' may be a little generous.
After all, Weaver recalled learning the hard way that he was
astride a stunt horse trained to rear when the reins were pulled
back _ the cue for other horses to halt. ``I felt like I was Roy
Rogers or somebody. But I maintained my position in the saddle and
it made for a very exciting shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Pullman talked about developing a great respect for the
wranglers, his concerns about uncooperative longhorns, his regrets
that he wasn't more attentive to his horse, a camera truck dragging
bottom over the rough terrain, the 28-day schedule being ``too
tight a shoe.''
</P>
<P>
   He's no stranger to hard work in the great outdoors. Pullman and
his three brothers spent summers in their teen-age years working on
dairy farms, and all four still have a hand in agriculture. Bill
owns a Montana cattle ranch with his brother John, a doctor who
tends about 40 cows between patients. Bill, his wife and three
children go up to work whenever they can.
</P>
<P>
   But after shooting ``The Virginian,'' he isn't crazy about
wearing chaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe what that does to your day,'' he said,
beefing about the overly long 60-pound leather leg protectors.
``You're getting on and off the horse setting up things, and it's
hot, and I'm leading a string of five horses, John Savage is
leading a string of four horses and Dennis Weaver is riding a horse
that he's making look like it's nervy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a circus. But that's why (filmmakers) get attracted to
those kinds of movies. The last great campaign of the 20th century
is making adventure movies. Philosophically, (westerns) give you a
kind of access to a level or discussion about things that you don't
get in any other genre: what morality is and character and
integrity, and what the individual's relationship is to the
community, and the community's obligation to the individual.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take on a western, it's like taking a Rorschach test
or something, because you are defining what you want to say about
things,'' Pullman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I liked about doing `The Virginian.' It wasn't a
new story where you could get distracted by some revisionist twist
or whatever, but the fact that it had real elemental components and
it was all about interpretation. In that way, it felt like
theater.'' &QL;

DISAPPOINTED 49ERS EMBARK ON REBUILDING TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFRI CHADIHA  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ The quarterback still talked as if the San
Francisco 49ers' ability to return to prominence hinged on only a
simple attitude adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message quarterback Steve Young left as he headed
into an offseason filled with questions about his future and that
of his beloved team. Young missed 13 games this season as a result
of a concussion, and from the sidelines he witnessed a 49ers team
that had lost the edge that once made them great, their ``craving''
for a championship, as Young put it.
</P>
<P>
   In Young's view, if the 49ers can just get that attitude back,
4-12 seasons won't become commonplace around here. That's right. It
wasn't talent that was most responsible for leading this year's
team to the bottom of the standings. It was their mind-set,
according to Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been that craving for a championship,'' Young
said as players cleaned out their lockers Tuesday afternoon.
``We've had down years before but that attitude was always there.
We lost that. It's the 49ers way. It's the way we do things. We
lost that sense of the 49ers way and we can get it back but we have
to have a cohesive plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the big question surrounding the 49ers is just what
the plan will be. When owner John York, coach Steve Mariucci,
general manager Bill Walsh and personnel director Terry Donahue
meet in the next few weeks, they will embark on the most compelling
offseason this organization has faced in more than 20 years,
possibly ever. They will stop thinking about when the 49ers were
kings and begin the process of rebuilding the kingdom. Establishing
a championship ``craving'' is just one of the issues they will try
to address.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers finished this season with their worst record since
1979. For that, they will receive the third overall pick in this
year's NFL draft, but that selection ranks as one of the few things
this team can look forward to in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult part for the 49ers front office will be
determining who belongs on next year's team and how to resolve a
$20 million salary-cap burden. Said Mariucci: ``We have to decide
who our guys are going to be, who our heart and soul is and we have
to keep those guys here and playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those players need no introduction: Young, wide receiver
Jerry Rice, linebacker Ken Norton Jr., strong safety Tim McDonald
and guard Ray Brown are included among them. All of those players
are over 30 years old and will be asked to take some form of pay
cut if they are to remain with the organization. According to
Mariucci, 35-year-old defensive end Charles Haley already is
expected to retire again after a disappointing return to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The older players aren't alone in their concerns about the
future. Linebacker Lee Woodall has heard through media reports that
the 49ers management has plans to meet with him. Until that
information reached him, he thought he was safe from the shake-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like you sit there and think it will never happen
to you,'' Woodall said. ``Now that it has, I wonder if they're
thinking about how much money I make or how I played. I don't have
enough answers right now to ease my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci tried to paint some scenarios Tuesday that could return
the 49ers to glory, but even he understood the difficulty in
climbing back to the top. It will take years, and Mariucci is ready
to start rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the players that we start preparing for the 2000 season
(on Wednesday) at 8 a.m.,'' Mariucci said. ``We're wasting no time
to get our minds right and our bodies right so we can be a better
team next year.''

   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Mozdok, Russia) _ Instead of a speedy victory,
Russia's campaign to seize the capital of Chechnya, Grozny, has

deputy chief of the Russia army's general staff, said last week
that the fall of Grozny would occur within days. But Russian troops
have run into fierce opposition in their campaign to seize the
city. In recent days bands of rebels have lashed back, prompting
furious fights on the outskirts of the city. By Michael R. Gordon.

in a poignant tug-of-war that blended international politics with
age-old human emotions. ``This little boy, who has been through so

Meissner, said. She said the 6-year-old boy, Elian Gonzalez, should

   RUSHING-RUSH-LIMBAUGH (Undated) _ Rush Limbaugh noticed it about
two months ago. Listeners were asking why there were more
commercials on his daily three-hour radio program. ``At first I
didn't know what they were talking about,'' Limbaugh said. ``I was
talking for the same amount of time every day.'' But without his
knowledge, his words were being sucked into a temporal never-never
land. A new kind of digital technology was literally snipping out
the silent pockets in between words, shortening the pauses and
generally speeding up the pace of his speechifying. With no
fanfare, the digital program has established a foothold in the
radio industry in the last six months. General managers at about 50
radio stations across the country are eagerly using it, unbeknownst
to consumers, for one purpose: squeezing talk and music so that
they can wedge in more commercials and make more money. By Alex

   SEC-STOCK-CHAT (Undated) _ Stepping up its pursuit of securities
fraud on the Internet, the Securities and Exchange Commission on

four counts of fraud, contending that he enriched himself at his
customers' expense, lied about his past returns and secretly
accepted payment in exchange for recommending one company's stock.

 &HT;    PALM BEACH STUDENTS TAKE FIRST ``BIRTHRIGHT'' TRIP TO ISRAEL
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ They're seeing the good and bad of Israel _ from
religious piety to hostility, from Israelis who view America as a
dependable friend to those who see it as the producer of the coarse
``South Park'' cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 college students from Palm Beach County are in a
worldwide program that began this winter and is aimed at bringing
massive numbers of young Jews to visit Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers began ``Birthright Israel'' to strengthen Jewish
identity and enhance the ties between Israel and Jews around the
world. Backed by the Israeli government, Jewish groups and
philanthropists, the program is designed to eventually bring 50,000
young people to Israel each year free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 6,000 students will be in the program. Of those,
4,000 are Americans and most are in Israel this winter. The group
includes 360 Florida students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to go see my homeland, Israel,'' said Cory
Zadanosky, a Nova Southeast University law student in Israel this
week. ``I felt like coming here would allow me to see my roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Zadanosky, 24, went to Olympic Heights High School in Boca
Raton, and, like many on the trip, said he is not a deeply
religious Jew. But, the program peaked his interest.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's been struck by how many Israelis have told him that
American Jews should live in Israel and help defend the country.
</P>
<P>
   He considered it a highlight to walk on the Golan Heights
plateau just as negotiators in West Virginia are discussing whether
Israel should return the captured land to Syria. He was moved by a
trip up the mountain to the archeological site at Masada, a key
symbol of Israeli patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   But, he and two friends were surprised by an encounter with a
Jewish store owner who told them not to shop with his next-door
neighbor because he was Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's peace, yet there's hostility,'' Zadanosky said.
</P>
<P>
   Their 10-day trip includes the standard sights _ the Wailing
Wall, Masada _ but also includes a presentation from a Palestinian
peace negotiator and meetings with Israeli high school students.
</P>
<P>
   George Ackerman, a 22-year-old Brooklyn native and recent
graduate of Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, said he was
surprised when an Israeli high school student shouted that he loved
the raunchy ``South Park'' television cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   During the trip, the participants review their experiences in
regular group conversations and discuss their relationship to
Israel and Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   This first Birthright trip was paid for primarily by Wall Street
money manager Michael Steinhardt and Seagram Co. Ltd. co-chairman
Charles Bronfman. Organizers hope to raise $210 million for the
program.

&HT;     HOUSE GOP MARKS ANNIVERSARY OF '95 TAKEOVER; GINGRICH
UNINVITED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 By JUDY HOLLAND   
 c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans celebrated the fifth anniversary
of their takeover of Congress Wednesday with a news conference that
conspicuously didn't include former House Speaker Newt Gingrich but
that revived the GOP goal of delivering a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders also vowed to increase their narrow 5-vote
majority in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is not just to retain control of the House but
to grow our majority,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts Jr., R-Okla., the No.
4 ranked Republican House member. ``Our vital signs show we're in
very good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts also said Republicans plan to draft a tax cut bill over
the next two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want tax relief for working Americans,'' said Watts, adding
that it would be good for the economy ``to give people money back
to buy the things they use everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   The fifth anniversary celebration took the form of a Capitol
Hill news conference where two dozen Republican House members,
primarily from the class of 1994, touted their legislative
successes.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, once heralded as the architect of the historic
Republican victories in the 1994 election that gave the GOP a House
majority for the first time in 40 years, was noticeably absent.
After resigning as speaker and giving up his House seat following
his party's losses in the November 1998 elections, Gingrich was
romantically linked with a woman staff member of a House committee.
He and his wife later divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether GOP members were distancing themselves from
Gingrich because of his messy divorce, Watts denied the former
speaker was intentionally excluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a whole lot of folks (who) contributed to getting us
where we are,'' Watts said. ``I personally believe Gingrich was one
who led the charge.'' But, Watts added, Gingrich ``was one of the
first to say don't focus on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich wrote a letter to a Capitol Hill newspaper last fall
saying it wouldn't be appropriate for him to attend such an event
because he was part of the past and this was about the future.
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions about rumors that he plans to resign or
retire from the House, Watts said he hasn't made a decision yet.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he has spent 10 years in public service, adding: ``
You've got to be careful you don't get on a political treadmill
that you can't get off.''
</P>
<P>
   During the news conference the Republican House members claimed
credit for balancing the budget, reducing taxes for families and
businesses, protecting Social Security from being spent on other
programs, overhauling the welfare system and increasing defense
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Watts also said Republicans have plans to send education dollars
back to school districts and strengthen national defense.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., a former House GOP leader, said
Republican efforts to save Social Security are especially good for
women who live an average of seven years longer than men and ``find
themselves with fewer dollars.''

MANNESMANN CONTINUES ITS ASSAULT ON VODAFONE TAKEOVER BID 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain, Germany)  (th) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Mannesmann AG of Germany escalated a verbal assault on
Vodafone AirTouch PLC of Britain, asserting on Wednesday that a
combination of the two big mobile telephone companies would lead to
enormous financial losses.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann's attack against Vodafone came as several British
mobile telephone operators, including Vodafone and Orange, which
Mannesmann recently acquired, reported that a record number of
customers bought mobile phones in the fourth quarter, spurred by
prepaid access incentives that do not require customers to purchase
long-term service contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The rapidly increasing popularity of mobile telephones in
Britain and elsewhere in Europe is a major reason why Vodafone, the
industry's world leader, has been trying to purchase Mannesmann,
the leading mobile phone company in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann executives have rejected the $127.7 billion all-stock
offer since it was announced nearly two months ago, contending that
the company's growth prospects are far better if it remains
independent.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy interview published Wednesday in Boersen-Zeitung, a
German newspaper, Klaus Esser, the chief executive of Mannesmann,
led the latest public relations effort to sway shareholders against
the proposal. Esser said he expected Vodafone would have to pay as
much as 60 billion euros, or nearly $62 billion, in addition to its
all-stock offer to buy any outstanding shares from investors who
had not sold their shares after the bid period expires in early
February.
</P>
<P>
   Esser also contended that a hostile takeover by Vodafone would
force the combined company to absorb as much as $103.2 billion of
good will on its books.
</P>
<P>
   Esser said that Orange is growing faster than Vodafone. In
Britain, Orange said it signed up 1.4 million new customers in the
fourth quarter, compared with Vodafone's 1.08 million. Vodafone
remains the market leader, however, with a worldwide customer base
of more than 35.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   If Vodafone succeeds in acquiring Mannesmann, it will have to
shed Orange to placate regulators, a point Esser does not want
investors to forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's numbers confirm Vodafone cannot keep up with Orange
today, just as under its bid it cannot keep Orange tomorrow,''
Esser said. ``And being a forced seller of Orange, Vodafone would
remove one of the key drivers of growth acceleration of an
independent Mannesmann, growth that outstrips anything Vodafone can
offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gent, Vodafone's chief executive, avoided responding to
Esser's jabs, saying: ``It is particularly pleasing to see that not
only is the demand for mobiles worldwide continuing unabated, but
we are also gaining significant additional revenues from the
greater use of data services throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Vodafone and Orange, BT Cellnet, the subsidiary of
British Telecommunications that is Britain's second-largest mobile
phone operator, said it had added 1 million customers in the fourth
quarter, compared with 343,000 during the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   And One 2 One, a mobile phone company owned by Deutsche Telekom,
said it had added 903,000 customers in the last three months of
1999, doubling the number of subscribers signed up in the quarter a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in customers is the direct result of a new emphasis on
prepaid packages in Britain that let customers buy a set amount of
calling time without requiring restrictive contracts or monthly
access fees. Prepaid phones have sold especially well as holiday
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Mobile phone operators hope to eventually switch prepaid users
to full-featured packages that bill by the month.

</P>
<P>
   Israel began the transfer of more West Bank land to the
Palestinians. Soldiers pulled out of an army base near Nablus
flashing peace signs at the Palestinians, who immediately took the
base over, hoisting a Palestinian flag to replace the Star of
David. The soldiers also left three army camps near Jenin, and by
late Thursday, Israel will have withdrawn from another 5 percent of
the West Bank.

   ISRAEL: POST-WEIZMAN PICKS
</P>
<P>
   As the Parliament debated whether President Ezer Weizman should
be forced to resign, Israeli political analysts had moved on to
predicting his successor. The leading candidate appears to be
former Prime Minister Shimon Peres. Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
favored choice is said to be Foreign Minister David Levy, with whom
he has a close relationship.
</P>

   IRAQ: U.N. CHOICE DUE
</P>
<P>
   United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan is expected to name
a new chief arms inspector for Iraq by Jan. 14, a month after the
Security Council created a new plan under which Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein could have sanctions suspended if he cooperates with
a new monitoring commission. Diplomats say a leading contender is a
Finnish disarmament expert, Pasi Patokallio, but there are at least
half a dozen other contenders and no final agreement in the

 &HT;    Dow gets back on upward track; Nasdaq manages to limit loss
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The market's New Year's sell-off slowed Wednesday as
profit-taking turned to bargain-hunting among blue chip stocks and
the hemorrhage in technology stocks slowed.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Tuesday's selling or Wednesday's rally sets the
pattern for the rest of January depends on the way ``two negatives
and one positive'' play themselves out, said Wachovia Securities
analyst Ricky T. Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The negatives are the threat of higher interest rates and the
over-valuation of stocks, and the positive is the seasonal flow of
new money into the market in January,'' said Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts believe the Federal Reserve will raise interest
rates again this year, possibly at its Feb. 2 meeting. Increased
anxiety about interest rates at the beginning of the year prompted
many investors this week to convert strong, late-1999 gains into
profits. That sent indexes plummeting.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attributed much of Wednesday's rebound to the lower
prices caused by Tuesday's selling. The Dow Jones industrial
average rallied by 1.1 percent, while the technology-loaded Nasdaq
composite's slide slowed to 0.6 percent from Tuesday's 5.6 percent.
On Tuesday, the index fell 229.46 points, its worst ever one-day
point loss.
</P>
<P>
   From here, Harrington sees the market's near-term alternatives
as ``a significant first-quarter correction, or a trading range''
below the market's 1999 year-end highs.
</P>
<P>
   More optimistic is Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist
</P>
<P>
   for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons, who said, ``There is a bigger picture
to focus on: it is still a bull market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market is supported by solid fundamentals, with a
healthy economy, low inflation, low interest rates and strong
corporate earnings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One thing all analysts agree on is that the market will be even
more volatile in 2000 than it was last year, meaning big up and
down swings will be more common.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the 10 biggest one-day point losses by the Dow Jones
industrial average have occurred since August 1998, ranging from
235.23 points to 554.26 points.
</P>
<P>
   Recovery times for the Dow to return to a pre-sell-off close
have ranged in that period from 4 calendar days to 92 _ not
counting Wednesday's rebound.
</P>
<P>
   At Prudential Securities, technical analyst Ralph Acampora
reiterated an earlier forecast that 2000 ``will not be a smooth
ride,'' as it will be accompanied by inflationary concerns and
rising Treasury yields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a reaction could cause some scary corrections _ in the
neighborhood of 5 percent to 10 percent. But these corrections or
pauses will not terminate the bull market,'' said Acampora. His
advice to investors is to ``concentrate on individual stocks rather
than the overall market averages.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology weakness is expected to continue, however,
because of the size of that sector's late 1999 price gains. The
Nasdaq rose almost 50 percent in the last two and a half months of
the year as the market recovered from a late summer slump.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Kaufman, editor of Standard &AMP; Poor's market letter, ``The
Outlook,'' said profit-taking in technology stocks _ especially
Internet-related stocks _ was prompted by individual investors
``looking to salt away at least part of their gains.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the turn of the year allows them to defer taxes (on
trading transactions) until April 2001,'' said Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   Longer range, Kaufman said the Nasdaq market should outdo the
Dow and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 again this year, although not by
last year's stunning margin.

CRIMES KINDLE DRIVE TO LIMIT SOUTH AFRICAN RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Angered by several bombings in Cape
Town and frustrated by the difficulties in solving such cases,
South Africa is considering constitutional changes that would curb
the rights of suspected terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The country's Safety and Security minister, Steve Tshwete, wants
the police to have the power to hold such suspects without charges
for more than the 48 hours now allowed and wants to curtail their
access to lawyers, law enforcement officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The changes, which Tshwete plans to bring before Parliament,
have been proposed as the police continue to search for the
attackers responsible for a bombing in Cape Town on Dec. 24 that
injured several police officers and set the city on edge days
before its big millennium bash.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest of several dozen bombings over the last few
years _ most of them in Cape Town, and most still unsolved _ that
have cowed a crime-weary country and confounded its understaffed
national police force.
</P>
<P>
   A local vigilante group, People Against Gangsterism and Drugs,
has been a focus of the investigation. Several members of the
organization, including its national coordinator, appeared in court
on Tuesday on various charges unrelated to the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The national coordinator, Abdus Salaam Ebrahim, was arrested
last week in connection with the killing of a gang leader but like
the other members of the group recently arrested, he has not been
charged in connection with any bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The police and prosecutors want more constitutional latitude to
build cases against suspects like Ebrahim. But changing this
country's new, liberal constitution, which has been lauded around
the world, is unlikely to be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the apartheid regime's harsh security laws have been off
the books for less than a decade, and few people here have
forgotten what can happen when the government is given too much
power in matters of law and justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be on our guard,'' said Peter Gastrow, head of the
Cape Town office of the Institute for Security Studies and an
expert on crime in South Africa. ``We have a disastrous history
when it comes to security legislation and its abuse, and we should
not walk into a similar disaster without knowing what the
consequences are.''
</P>
<P>
   The country, Gastrow said, is in a ``Rambo mood'' and law
enforcement is trying to exploit that in ways that could hurt the
country down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you change the constitution for every social ill or
security problem, you cheapen the democracy and you put at risk the
long-term role which the constitution plays in society,'' Gastrow
said.
</P>
<P>
   How far public sentiment has shifted from the liberal spirit
that spawned the three-year-old constitution will become clearer as
the Ministries of Safety and Security and of Justice present their
proposals in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the public perspective, the sense is, `We've had enough;
do what must be done,''' said Jody Kollapen, a member of the South
African Human Rights Commission. ``And I can understand that kind
of pressure being brought to bear on politicians, but I think we
must resist that and say, `Do what must be done, but do it within
the parameters of the constitution.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kollapen said, ``There hasn't been an adequate examination of
the shortcomings of existing laws and of the constitution and that
must be the absolute first step.''
</P>
<P>
   The South African Law Commission, which reviews the country's
laws and recommends changes to them, is completing a study of the
security statutes and its recommendations could shape the outcome
of the debate.

 &HT;    Georgia Power to issue refunds
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Power Co. ratepayers can expect one-time
refunds this summer totaling more than $70 million, or about $14
for the average residential customer, it was announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   PSC Chairman Stan Wise said the utility is obligated to make the
refunds to its 1.8 million customers because 1999 earnings appear
to have exceeded the level authorized in a 1998 rate settlement
with the commission.
</P>
<P>
   He attributed the excess earnings to unusually high temperatures
in August that drove up air conditioning use statewide. ``Because
of the very hot summer, they did gangbusters,'' Wise said of the
state's largest utility company.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rate settlement, Georgia Power agreed to refund
two-thirds of earnings that exceed an authorized rate of return on
equity of 12.5 percent. The company is allowed to keep the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Power spokesman Tal Wright said preliminary figures for
the first nine months of the year indicate that the company earned
about $105 million over the authorized amount. So consumers should
receive about $70 million and about $35 million will boost the
company's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Final figures will not be tallied until March. Wright said the
onetime refunds will appear as credits on bills, probably in early
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Wise said the refunds will boost a three-year rate reduction of
$834 million that was part of the 1998 rate settlement.

 &HT;    Alabama's ethics laws models for the country
 &HT;    By Richard Whitt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY _ Alabama's ethics law was born of a legislative
joke.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1973 and a torrent of reform swept the country
following the Watergate scandal that toppled President Richard
Nixon. Alabama's Legislature, not particularly known for its
progressivism, was considering a model ethics law.
</P>
<P>
   Its Senate quickly passed legislation drafted largely by the
public interest group Common Cause. Not to be outdone, the House
added 16 strengthening amendments, fully believing the Senate would
kill the legislation. Instead, the Senate accepted all amendments
and sent the legislation to Gov. George C. Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept making it stronger and stronger knowing it wouldn't
pass. Then, the media and the public got onto it and the
politicians were afraid to vote against it. Wallace wasn't about to
veto it,'' said Ethics Commission Vice Chairman John L. Watson of
Dothan.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Alabama's ethics law is considered one of the nation's
strongest and its enforcement arm, the Alabama Ethics Commission,
is well-funded. The Center for Public Integrity, recently ranked
Alabama's financial disclosure laws second toughest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Alabama law has survived legal challenges by the State Bar,
the League of Municipalities, the University of Alabama, and the
Alabama State Employees Association in what Ethics Commission
Director James Sumner Jr. calls a ``holy war'' against the act and
the Ethics Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Sumner directs a staff of 16, including four full-time
investigators and two lawyers. His expansive office in Montgomery's
downtown RSA Union government complex has a conference room/law
library and private bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people, I've had some houses smaller than this,''
Sumner laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Times weren't always this good for the Ethics Commission.
Although the ethics laws were on the books, the legislature made
enforcement difficult by underfunding the Ethics Commission. The
conduct of Gov. Guy Hunt, more than two decades after Alabama's
ethics law passed, forced the Legislature to further tighten the
law and fully fund the state Ethics Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, revisions strengthening both the Act and the
Commission's powers, swept through the Legislature in the wake of
former Governor Guy Hunt's removal from office for converting
$200,000 in inaugural funds for personal use. In that year, the
budget tripled to $950,000. A systems of fines was established for
minor violations. The Ethics Commission was given power to initiate
it's own investigations and investigators were given police powers
comparable to sworn officers. Financial disclosure was extended to
include public officials' immediate members.
</P>
<P>
   They also the computers with a state-of-the-art system to help
staff members monitor disclosure filings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from what I call the Dark Ages into the modern era in
the last four years,'' said Sumner.
</P>
<P>
   But the panel didn't the authority to subpoena witnesses.
However, Sumner said the Attorney General and local district
attorneys have never refused to subpoena witnesses when asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a practical matter, it has never been a factor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a somewhat unusual move, the legislature even limited
campaign fund-raising limited to 16 months _ one year before an
election and four months after. The impetus for reform ironically
came from the lobbying community. ``The lobbyist wanted some
constraints on fund-raising. They just felt continuous pressure for
campaign contributions and wanted to narrow the window,'' said
Sumner.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is happy with the fund-raising limits or the ethic
commission's interpretation of the law, however.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders in both parties tried to get around the
limits by holding party caucus fundraisers during off-election
years.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, the commission again bit the hand that feeds it,
reiterating its ban on such activities.
</P>
<P>
   The move didn't sit well with some legislators, who feel the
commission is overstepping its authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem we have is that we feel the decision is in
conflict with the Fair Campaign Practices Act. It was and is my
feeling that caucuses can raise funds. I think the Ethics
Commission decision was a little far-reaching,'' said Rep. Ken
Guin, chairman of the House Majority Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   But Guin said the difference won't sour the General Assembly's
relationship with the Ethics Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a good relationship. But I think there are
many members of the Legislature who feel the Commission reached out
too far on this one,'' said Guin.

HOMEWORK HELP SITES (OR, THE DOG ATE MY URL) 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALICE KEIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's face it: the word ``homework'' just does not get students
excited, even when the idea of learning something new does. As a
child, I spent hours each evening comparing notes with friends and
exchanging ideas on different topics. We had encyclopedias and
textbooks as guides, and if we were lucky, we also had help from
our parents. But the biggest resource we had was one another.
Today's students still rely on one another for homework help, but
now they communicate in chat rooms and are able to go onto the huge
information superhighway without interrupting their online
conversation. And for many students, the library encyclopedia has
been replaced by search engines like Yahooligans and Searchopolis.
And there are now many sites on the Net designed specifically to
aid students with their homework assignments. Some rely on experts
who respond by e-mail or chat with students. Others work as Web
site clearinghouses by providing links to child-friendly
educational sites on different subject areas.
</P>
<P>
   As an experiment, I recently collected a week's worth of
assignments for fifth-graders at my school. I brought textbooks
home to complete the assignments but primarily relied on the
Internet and the various homework help sites to answer my
questions. I tried to balance the lofty goal of learning as much as
possible through each assignment with the all-too-common tendency
to get the answers as quickly and easily as possible. As my mother
says, done is beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   What I found was that homework sites are frequently trustworthy
and accurate and that some provide amazingly speedy responses. They
are a convenient way to get answers within a couple of days, but if
you are working on a tighter deadline, you must find a live
tutoring site. I also found that it is easy to get almost too much
help _ good news for the student who needs a quick fix and
potentially bad news for teachers and parents.
</P>
<P>
   Any site that provides an e-mail exchange with teachers, or an
online chat room with subject area experts, gives a child the
opportunity to ask a question and get the correct answer before
trying to answer it without assistance. The online experts cannot
determine who needs the help and who just wants a shortcut.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICA ONLINE HOMEWORK HELPER
</P>
<P>
   I have never been a fan of AOL _ I find it an unnecessary
shortcut for students who should be learning to manage information
on the Web. But last year when I asked a room of 80 fifth-graders
whether any of them used AOL, roughly 90 percent of the students
raised their hands, so I thought its homework area deserved a look.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's Homework Helper section of its Kids Only channel proved to
be a pleasant surprise. It has 1,700 volunteer teachers and tutors
and more than 100 peer tutors. Most of the tutors are certified
teachers who volunteer from their homes in the evenings. Peer
tutors are students between the ages of 16 and 18, many of whom
receive high school service-hour credits for their work with AOL.
Although that is not clearly explained on the site, tutors can be
identified throughout the site by the user-name prefixes AAC for
the teachers and HHPT for the peer tutors. The only problem is
figuring out where exactly to go for help.
</P>
<P>
   The AOL site features elements common to most of the help sites
I visited: a Web search engine and an encyclopedia. I also found a
useful online dictionary and thesaurus on the site. Each major
curriculum area has a link that leads to activities loosely based
on the subject. For example, clicking on the Social Studies link
calls up geography games, maps and a safari game. The activities
vary in actual educational value. The two most prominent sections
of the site are the Ask a Teacher message board and the tutoring
rooms. AOL says the site helps an average of 4,000 students in the
tutoring rooms each week and answers 2,500 questions through the
message board.
</P>
<P>
   Ask a Teacher was somewhat confusing at first, but once I got
used to its clumsy navigation, it proved to be extremely useful.
You choose a subject, then a curriculum area and grade level. You
then post your question. A teacher will post an answer or reply on
the message board within 48 hours. That works, but searching to
find your answer can be difficult. On a Friday night I posted a
science question on the fifth- to sixth-grade Science area. I went
back to the site on the following Sunday and searched but couldn't
find my question. I then went through the listings one at a time
and found my question with two responses attached.
</P>
<P>
   While the answers were right, they seemed to have been answered
by another user or student. Students must determine for themselves
whether the answers are trustworthy. That may involve finding
answers on their own, which defeats the purpose of using a
shortcut, and there are often hundreds of messages to scroll
through.
</P>
<P>
   The AOL Tutoring Room is what truly sets this Web resource apart
from most other homework helper sites. The area is an organized
chat room that allows students to talk one-on-one with online
tutors. The room is open most weeknights and at certain times
during the weekend. The students log in and are immediately asked
for their grade levels and questions. The questions must be related
to the subject area of the chat room, and no off-topic chat is
allowed. I observed some users being suspended for inappropriate
behavior and others receiving warnings because they were not
sticking to the topic. I even reported some suspicious behavior
myself.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I logged on just before 9 on a Friday evening and asked, for a
mythology assignment, what was Vulcan's other name. A tutor sent me
an Instant Message within a few minutes with the answer: Spock. I
responded in confusion but was told to log off. I asked why and
another tutor sent me an e-mail message, explaining that the room
was closing but that he would help me before leaving. The tutor
explained the other teacher's confusion in thinking ``Vulcan'' was
a ``Star Trek'' reference. He was able to refer me to a Web site
that included the Greek and Roman names for most of the gods.
Following the tutor's instructions to scroll down the page, I
quickly located the answer: Hephaestus.
</P>
<P>
   Other questions required more persistence. I joined the science
tutoring chat room, stated my grade level and then asked, If
strawberry plants reproduce asexually (grow runners), why do they
have seeds? Someone whose screen name did not have an AAC or HHPT
prefix sent me an Instant Message. I asked if that person was a
tutor and was told yes. The tutor then asked if I was Jewish. I
ignored the personal question and repeated my extra-credit
challenge. The person then gave me an incorrect answer to my
question and again asked about my religion. When I asked about this
question's relevance to the topic, the person logged off. It is
easy to report inappropriate behavior right at the site, which I
did. Shortly after that, I went through a series of tutors who
tried to answer my query. The first referred me to a fact sheet
about planting that had an extremely difficult vocabulary. I was
eventually referred to a tutor who was able to provide
grade-appropriate help. The answer, that the seeds are used to
spread the plant to other locations, still spurred many questions
about this duplicate system of reproducing. The tutor referred me
to a wonderful Web site with everything I could ever want to know
about fruits. In all, I was in the tutoring room for more than an
hour to find the answer to a difficult question. Ultimately, it was
nice to know that AOL's tutors and other resources could provide
the answers when needed. It may take three minutes or an hour, but
the help is there.
</P>
<P>
   HOMEWORK CENTRAL
</P>
<P>
   www.homeworkcentral.com  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This site has an incredibly extensive database of linked sites
to search. The area for students is broken into three sections:
Kids, Teens, and College and Beyond. While you must still search to
locate your answer, the site does an excellent job of breaking down
the subject areas into manageable sections.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the Kids section, there are 24 subject areas,
each with subheadings. The science group has 11 subheadings, and
clicking on any one of them calls up additional choices. That helps
a student narrow a search before actually getting to the site's
resources.
</P>
<P>
   While there are many resources available at this site, some of
them are less than impressive. While searching in mythology, I
found several text-heavy and cumbersome links. I eventually found
what I was looking for, but it took several tries.
</P>
<P>
   ASKJEEVES FOR KIDS
</P>
<P>
   www.ajkids.com  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This search engine is extremely helpful in answering any
question. Ask Jeeves has long been one of my favorites search
engines for frazzled surfers; the children's site is just as
wonderful as the grown-up version.
</P>
<P>
   The user simply types a question in plain English, and the
engine provide places to find the answers. There is even the option
of having your spelling checked before submitting a question. That
extremely useful for the student users because spelling mistakes
can confuse even the best search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jeeves for Kids is simple and effective. It links the user
only to child-safe sites.
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT.COM
</P>
<P>
   homeworkhelp.about.com
</P>
<P>
   About.com's homework help site is easy to use and
straightforward, and it provides a good shortcut to accurate
information on the Web. Designed for teen-agers, it has a chat room
for students once a week, and it also allows you to e-mail your
expert guide directly with questions or search through previously
answered questions in a Forum section. The forum also offers a
message board for users to post questions.
</P>
<P>
   The messages can be answered by anyone who is using the board,
so the student is left to decide whether the information received
is accurate and reliable. The site also has a limited list of Web
links in the basic subject areas. It is rather heavy on text but
utilitarian and accomplishes many of the same functions as the AOL
site.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   SCHOLASTIC
</P>
<P>
   teacher.scholastic.com/researchtools
</P>
<P>
   While this Scholastic Web site is thoughtfully composed and safe
for children, it is also extremely limited. The home page offers
links for Teachers, Kids and Parents. Among the categories in the
Kids section is Know Way, which links to two sections of research:
Article Archive and Web Guide.
</P>
<P>
   The article archive is a collection of more than 700 articles
from Scholastic's various publications. While the number sounded
impressive, the section would be relatively unappealing and of
little use to an elementary-school student. There is no search
engine for this section, so finding information within an article
is cumbersome. Unless I was looking for one of these very specific
articles, the section would not help.
</P>
<P>
   The Web Guide, on the other hand, is fantastic. It has a simple
search engine that provides easy-to-read summaries of the sites it
picks. The user can search by subject area or look for a specific
topic or word. The linked Web sites are appropriate for children
and, for the most part, easy to understand.
</P>
<P>
   TEKMOM: RESOURCES FOR STUDENTS
</P>
<P>
   www.tekmom.com/students/index.html
</P>
<P>
   Can using the Web be like having a cookie and hot chocolate on a
stormy afternoon? TekMom's Resources for Students site is as close
as you can get on the information superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   TekMom, who identifies herself as a computer teacher in northern
Virginia and the mother of a teen-age son, has put together a
wonderful group of resources for parents, teachers and students.
The layout is simple and the content extremely useful.
</P>
<P>
   TekMom combines a myriad of useful links and student resources
in one easily navigable location. There are four main areas for
students: Search Tools, Technology Buzzwords, citation guidelines
and Computer Ethics. The Tools area is a guide to useful Web tools.
It includes links to subject-specific search engines, engines
created for children, online encyclopedias and dictionaries, maps
and useful images.
</P>
<P>
   TekMom includes a sentence or two about each link. The student
can search directly from this page rather than linking to the
resource's main site. For example, I typed in ``Vulcan'' in the
Encarta Online link, clicked on Search and was connected directly
to Encarta's references on the Roman god.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other TekMom sections are useful but contain
information easily found at other Web sites. The Buzzword section
is a helpful vocabulary list. There is instruction on how to cite
Web sites as reference materials, and the Ethics page provides a
code of ethical computer use. A fifth section, Make Your Own
Smiley, is a disappointing game that allows the student to create
emoticons, or sideways smiley faces, using the keyboard. It
distracts from the thoughtfulness shown on the rest of the site.
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSLEUTH KIDS
</P>
<P>
   www.cybersleuth-kids.com
</P>
<P>
   I admired the CyberSleuth Kids cheery home page, which features
bright but not offensive color and text and an easy-to-read list of
references. But when I searched for answers, I found the
suggestions as confusing as searching blindly on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   For my fifth-grade social studies homework, I needed information
on Sargon of Akkad, who ruled what is considered to be the world's
first empire. When I performed a general search for his name and
the name of some of the areas he conquered, I was faced with
repeated notes saying that the site's server was being upgraded and
that users ``may experience a degradation of service or internal
server errors.'' I then searched specifically in History and
Education but found myself struggling with excessive scrolling and
clicking on consecutive links to get to a helpful site. That is the
kind of help we can all do without.
</P>
<P>
   INFOPLEASE HOMEWORK CENTER
</P>
<P>
   kids.infoplease.com/homework/index.html
</P>
<P>
   The Homework Center is a strong, reliable solution to homework
troubles. There are many ways to search this site. The left side of
the screen features a searchable table of contents to narrow your
inquiry by category. There is a central search box that allows you
to search all of the site's almanacs as well as an encyclopedia and
dictionary. You can also ask an expert a specific question, and
there is a search box to sift through all previously answered
questions.
</P>
<P>
   I used the central search field to look up Hammurabi, the
ancient Mesopotamian ruler. Infoplease answered my search with 2
references in the Kids' Almanac and 27 in the general almanac, a
dictionary and an encyclopedia. I appreciated the option to stay in
a child-oriented area or to branch out if I felt the referred sites
looked more interesting. The sites suggested also impressed me.
This simple search provided more than enough information for a
homework assignment. I also searched through the answered student
questions and found two answers that helped to expand my
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   When I posed my own question to the Infoplease Homework Helpers,
I found the answer prompt but disappointing. I asked for an
explanation of fraction trees for my fifth-grade math assignment.
The Infoplease helpers responded within a couple of hours but could
not answer my question. They included a link to Ask Dr. Math
(forum.swarthmore.edu//dr.math/dr-math.html), which was helpful but
did not provide an easy answer.
</P>
<P>
   I also asked Infoplease if Babylon was part of Mesopotamia.
Again, I received an answer within a few hours. The response
referred me to a very good encyclopedia article. While I was wowed
by the social studies and English assistance at Infoplease, I would
not recommend it for math help. It is clearly stronger in the
humanities.

   B.J. PINCHBECK'S HOMEWORK HELPER
</P>
<P>
   www.bjpinchbeck.com
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Pinchbeck's is hard to resist. In 1996, when B.J. was 9, he
and his father, Bruce, created this homework helper site so other
students would not have to search the whole Web for good
educational material. It took them two days to get their site up
and running, and today it has links to 570 sites. B.J. and his dad
spend about five to seven hours a week maintaining this impressive
site, and their work shows through.
</P>
<P>
   B.J.'s personality gives the site an honest attitude and
provides inspiration for students to be as confident, creative and
productive as B.J. is. The home page features a wordy explanation
of the site on the right three-fourths of the page and a table of
contents on the left. B.J., a seventh-grader in Beaver County, Pa.,
provides the Web resources; the student must find the one that is
best for each homework assignment. Each of B.J.'s suggestions comes
with a brief comment from him, usually referring to the strength of
the site recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   I was particularly impressed by the list of math resources on
B.J.'s site. The site includes some true Web gems like Ask Dr. Math
and Coolmath.com (www.coolmath.com). But beware: the site that B.J.
says he uses for his own assignments, Webmath.com
(www.webmath.com), will do the problems for you without explaining
the process.
</P>
<P>
   XpertSite.com (www.xpertsite.com) sponsors B.J.'s site and has a
prominent advertisement on the home page. The Xpert site allows
users to ask an expert a question on any topic. Bruce Pinchbeck
reports positive results from people he has referred to it. I found
the sponsor site a bit stiff but relatively useful. There is some
additional advertising on B.J.'s site, but it is subtle and
inoffensive.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from the advertisers and sponsors helps defray
maintenance costs of the site, and the remaining profits go into
B.J.'s college fund.

MOVING MUSIC FROM DISC TO MP3

<P>
   Q. What kind of hardware do I need to make my own MP3 files from
my audio CDs? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Because of their sound quality and comparatively small size,
MP3 audio files have quickly become a popular format for digital
music. Unlike sound formats that create huge file sizes to capture
music in digital form, the MP3 standard allows a user to compress
complex sound files like rock songs into files of only one or two
megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   There are scores of Web sites that offer free MP3 songs for
downloading, but if you would like to record songs from your own
compact discs to play on your computer or a portable MP3 player,
you will need software that lets you encode the audio tracks as MP3
files. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Although many programs that let you play but not create MP3
files are free, good encoding software usually costs about $20 to
$30. Such software will let you convert and encode your CD tracks
with a few clicks.
</P>
<P>
   There are also many shareware MP3 encoders available. As for
hardware, most recent computer systems can handle MP3 software, but
if you want to record MP3 files onto blank recordable CDs, you need
a CD-ROM recorder, also called a burner. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Be mindful of copyright laws regarding the use of MP3 files,
both those found on the Web as well as those you create by
converting music from your CDs.
</P>
<P>
   The MP3.com Web site (www.mp3.com) has a wealth of information
on the format, including a special section devoted to software
reviews of MP3 encoders for both Windows and Macintosh and links to
purchase the products.
</P>
<P>
   The site also has a large number of songs to download, along
with MP3 player software and message boards for enthusiasts. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is so congested at airports these days that planes coming
from the West Coast to New York often start lining up around
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   And it is only going to get worse. While more than 650 million
commercial passengers flew last year, that number is expected to
grow to 1 billion by 2015, the Federal Aviation Administration
predicts.
</P>
<P>
   With gridlock only a breath away, a handful of technologies have
emerged that proponents say will increase the capacity of strained
airports and reduce delays at squeeze points in the air traffic
control system.
</P>
<P>
   Right now air traffic controllers locate planes with radar and
guide them by voice communication _ safely but relatively slowly _
to increase the space between planes or hold them back at the first
sign of a problem.
</P>
<P>
   While the computer support available to controllers is limited
now, satellite, computer and communications technologies may lend a
hand in the future. New software may help adjust traffic as planes
approach the airport and calculate flight trajectories to give more
warning of possible problems. One of the most powerful systems,
based on Global Positioning System technology, may one day
supplement or even replace radar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Possibly you can get more aircraft through the pipeline,''
said Richard J. Lay, a Federal Aviation Administration program
manager who is evaluating the GPS-based technology. ``When the
whole system goes to pot because of one little choke point, this
technology is designed to keep planes going at a certain speed and
not have tie-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology Lay is evaluating tells pilots in their cockpits
the exact position, speed and altitude of nearby aircraft,
information that can now be picked up only by the controllers in
their control centers and airport towers.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Speelman, director of business development at UPS Aviation
Technologies, a subsidiary of United Parcel Service that
manufactures the technology, said that with global positioning
technology, each airplane would broadcast its position to other
planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of radar having to paint all the airplanes to get
their location,'' he said, ``each aircraft will have a lighted sign
saying here's where I am and here's where I am going.''
</P>
<P>
   The system, called ADS-B (for Automatic Dependent
Surveillance-Broadcast), works this way: The aircraft pilots know
their own positions from their GPS receivers, which use precise
timing signals emitted by a network of satellites. The planes can
broadcast that information from cockpit to cockpit, letting nearby
aircraft know exactly where they are, and they can also send the
information to ground systems.
</P>
<P>
   ADS-B can be more accurate than radar. It updates every second,
while radar information is relayed only after a complete sweep or
two of the area surveyed, which often takes up to six seconds, and
unlike radar, it works at low altitudes and can be used to track
planes on runways.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the system may prove particularly useful on the ground,
and not just for planes. It would be a simple matter to equip fuel
trucks and other vehicles that operate on runways and taxiways with
a GPS receiver and a low-power transmitter to broadcast the data.
Controllers would then be able to monitor all the traffic on the
ground, even when visibility is poor.
</P>
<P>
   ADS-B was tested by the aviation agency in 1999 in the Ohio
Valley, and the tests went well, Lay said. Further tests will get
under way soon with 132 planes in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Another innovative development being tested by the FAA is
software that predicts where planes will be in 10 or 20 minutes,
something that turns out to be very hard to estimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's surprisingly difficult to predict when, for instance, a
cross-country flight will actually show up,'' said R. John Hansman,
a professor in the department of aeronautics and astronautics at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and director of the
international center for air transportation there. ``If you look at
the times for a year of flights from Los Angeles to New York,
there's 20 to 30 minutes' variability, depending on, say, how
strong the tailwind is.''
</P>
<P>
   The new software, known as conflict probe technology, predicts
the aircraft's trajectory, allowing time for controllers to make
necessary changes and avoid backups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mathematical representation of where the aircraft is
going to be,'' said James A. Kingsbury, an air traffic control
engineer who helped derive the original computer algorithms for a
conflict probe developed by Mitre, which is based in Bedford,
Mass., and McLean, Va., and manages a research center for the
federal aviation agency. A prototype of the probe is in use at FAA
traffic control centers in Indianapolis and Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Current systems take present positions of aircraft and predict
two to three minutes ahead,'' Kingsbury said. ``Conflict probe
extends that look ahead to 12 to 20 minutes and warns controllers
of impending separation violations.''
</P>
<P>
   Digitized communication between pilots and ground controllers is
also expected to speed the flow of traffic. Right now, such
communication is almost entirely by voice; digital communication
will mean that text and graphics will be sent straight to the
cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Graphical information to the cockpit is important,'' Hansman
said. ``Presently you can get better weather information in your
hotel room by turning on the cable TV than you can in the
cockpit.''
</P>
<P>
   Another tool is being developed by NASA under the direction of
Dr. Heinz Erzberger, a senior scientist at the Ames Research
Center. Erzberger is the chief designer of an air traffic control
system called CTAS (pronounced CEE-tass).
</P>
<P>
   The software has a traffic management system, ``software that
helps controllers push the right amount of traffic through the
system _ neither more nor less,'' Erzberger said. CTAS also has
final-approach spacing software that helps controllers order the
flow of traffic so aircraft get to the correct runway in the best
order.
</P>
<P>
   A CTAS prototype is at work at the Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport. Contractors are adapting the technology to
other airports, although Erzberger said the process would be slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a surprisingly complicated and lengthy process to
transfer software technology from a government lab to industry,''
he said, ``so it's going to be another three to four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the innovations to ease airport congestion have been
prompted by the goal of moving toward what is called free flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, free flight meant having all sorts of ways an
aircraft could maneuver freely, rather than following fixed
routes,'' Erzberger explained. Pilots were going to have more
freedom to pick their own routes and more cockpit technology to
proceed safely. ``It's become a rallying cry for the industry to
make improvements in the air traffic control system, improvements
we all agree are sorely needed.''

PUTIN GAINS SUPPORT AS DATE IS CONFIRMED FOR ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A truncated presidential campaign opened in Russia
Wednesday, after the parliament's upper house confirmed March 26 as
the day when voters will choose a successor to Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood that their choice will be acting President
Vladimir Putin, Yeltsin's chosen heir, became even greater
Wednesday when a group of powerful regional governors dropped their
allegiance to his potential rival, former Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, and swung on board the Putin bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Another candidate, Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the liberal
Yabloko party, Wednesday broke a four-day silence and announced his
intention to run for president. But in an interview on a Moscow
radio station, he admitted his chances were slight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything stays the same, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin
will win,'' said Yavlinsky, who said he was running both for the
sake of democratic principles and for the sake of his own
electorate, which, according to results in the December
parliamentary elections, now represents 6 percent of Russian
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a political maverick with a record of
supporting the Kremlin in tight spots, has already declared his
candidacy, and Thursday, the Communist party leader, Gennady
Zyuganov is expected to announce that he, too, will join the
lopsided race. A final word from Primakov _ a favorite for the
presidency just six months ago _ is not expected until next week.
</P>
<P>
   But as Russia's governors filed out of the extraordinary session
of the Council of Federation Wednesday afternoon, several confirmed
the view that Putin's candidacy is at this point virtually
unstoppable. ``There are no forces that can stand against Putin
today,'' said Dmitry Ayatskov, governor of the Saratov region.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, several governors noted, no one wants to see succession
by acclamation. ``If there are no rivals, then there is no
democracy, and if there is no democracy, then what was the point of
demolishing the country,'' asked Vasily Starodubtsev, the Communist
governor of Tula province, in an interview on NTV, a
privately-owned television network.
</P>
<P>
   Now both acting president and prime minister, Putin, 47,
Wednesday called for a different kind of Russian election campaign,
one that is ``utterly clean, without any mudslinging and aimed at
one thing _ creating equal conditions for all participants,'' he
said. ``This will not only bring the most positive results, but
will also help consolidate society.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's presidential chances were given their biggest boost in
the Dec. 19 parliamentary elections where two pro-government
parties did surprisingly well, benefiting from a an ugly media war
waged on their behalf on two government-controlled television
stations.
</P>
<P>
   After a four-day holiday that began Dec. 31, the day of
Yeltsin's surprise resignation, several Russian newspapers resumed
publication Wednesday, providing new detail on the timing of his
decision, and generally giving him a fond farewell.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Kommersant, applauding the Kremlin for its ``New
Year's show,'' said that Yeltsin first told Putin of his decision
on Dec. 22 _ the same date given by Putin in a television interview
that aired Tuesday night. On Dec. 29, the paper said, Yeltsin
informed his chief of staff, Aleksandr Voloshin, of his decision.
Joined by a former chief of staff, Valentin Yumashev, the three sat
down at Yeltsin's country house to write the television
announcement that was broadcast at noon Friday.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kommersant, the broadcast was not made until early
Friday morning, and the tape was taken to the television
broadcasting center only a half hour before airtime. When Yeltsin
and a small entourage sat down together for an informal lunch to
watch the broadcast, they discovered there was no television in the
dining room, and had to send Voloshin scurrying through Kremlin
offices to find one.
</P>
<P>
   Kommersant Wednesday also published a rare interview with one of
Yeltsin's daughters, Tatyana Dyachenko, in which she said she and
her mother, Naina Yeltsin, were only informed of the resignation on
the morning of Dec. 31, as the president was getting ready to film
the broadcast. ``When he hold us at home on the morning of the 31st
that he had decided to retire, Mama didn't quite understand that he
meant now, today,'' said Mrs. Dyachenko.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dyahcenko, 39, was relieved of her Kremlin job as the
president's ``image maker'' by Putin on Monday. But some political
observers say that her influence as a member of a small group of
Kremlin insiders _ including Voloshin, who has been reappointed
Kremlin chief of staff by Putin _ will probably continue, at least
until the March 26 election.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Russian newspapers, which have typically mocked Yeltsin for much
of his last term, Wednesday gave him a positive send-off, digging
up photographs for their front pages that were unusually
flattering. Headlines applauded him for a grand exit, and even
those skeptical of his motives congratulated him on rigging a
succession worthy of a czar.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, now a quasi-private citizen who has been granted a full
range of retirement benefits and privileges, flew from Moscow
Wednesday to Bethlehem, where he will celebrate Russian Orthodox
Christmas with his wife and Aleksy II, patriarch of the Russian
Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   In a decree that provides Yeltsin with immunity against
prosecution, Putin also guaranteed financial security for the
Yeltsin family, providing them with security, cars, a government
country house, communications and, for the former president, even a
Kremlin office. Already, two top Kremlin staff members, relieved of
their old jobs by Putin, have gone to work on Yeltsin's private
staff which will also include the former presidential spokesman,
Dmitry Yakushkin.
</P>
<P>
   In her interview Wednesday, Ms. Dyachenko said her father plans
to travel abroad and to set up his own foundation _ similar to one
set up by former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev when he
resigned eight years ago. She said she plans to work there as well.
</P>
<P>
   At a departure ceremony at a Moscow airport Wednesday, where
Yeltsin and his wife were seen off by a high-level delegation that
included the ministers of Foreign Affairs and Defense, the former
president, in remarks to journalists, made a point of noting that
his status remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you feel?'' he was asked. ``I feel like Russia's first
president,'' said Yeltsin, before turning on his heels and setting
off for his plane.

   Hide the Rocky Videos: Chair Metes Out the Hits &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough anymore to see and hear movies, television shows
and video games. People want to  &UR; feel  &LR; them.
</P>
<P>
   That is the conclusion of the developers of a chair called the
Intensor LX Gaming Chair _ a molded seat that delivers thumps to
the back of its users, choreographed in time and intensity to
whatever noises are emitted from its surround-sound speakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can actually feel the hits of a football game,'' said Bill
Beres, senior vice president for sales and marketing at Imeron, the
company that sells the Intensor as well as vests and smaller seats
that offer similar body impacts.
</P>
<P>
   The jolts come from a whirling disk in the lower back of the
chair, which translates sounds into thumps against the user's back.
The thumps are not rough enough, Beres promises, to keep you from
indulging in some munchies while watching. ``I would call it a more
controlled thump than one that will spill your popcorn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   How many people want to subject themselves to such a sensation?
Thousands, if holiday sales of the Intensor chair are any
indication. Beres said the company shipped 20,000 chairs to stores
like Costco and Sam's Club before Christmas. Many stores have sold
out, so Imeron plans to ship 12,000 more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not been able to make them fast enough,'' Beres said.
The chair can also be ordered on line, for $170, at www.imeron.com.
</P>
<P>
   Beres is, of course, a chair fan himself. A few nights ago, he
watched the original ``Star Wars'' movie while sitting in the chair
at home. Even the sound that accompanies the scrolling words at the
opening provided a, well, moving experience. ``You don't realize
how much it rumbles,'' Beres said. ``It vibrates your whole
body.'' &QL;

   WebTV Flaw &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A security flaw has been uncovered in WebTV, one that could send
out hostile third-party e-mail from WebTV subscribers' accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw, which was first reported on the Internet television
site Net4TV, has been known to hackers since September. Last week,
some hackers began using the flaw to spam WebTV's own mailboxes.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft acknowledged the flaw on Tuesday and a spokeswoman
said the company would post a patch on Wednesday. WebTV subscribers
who fear that their own e-mail may have been compromised should
look in their Sent box for any mail that looks unfamiliar. &QL;

   Political News Site on Net Turns Its Clock Back to 1900 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The conventional reactions to the Year 2000 problem were fear
and optimism. The staff at Evote.com (www.evote.com/y2k), a
political news site, took a third approach: parody. Pretending that
the two-digit debacle had taken place, it turned back the clock on
the Web site to Jan. 1, 1900. Instead of being greeted with
articles about Al Gore and George W. Bush, viewers found articles
about President William McKinley, women's suffrage and a young Sen.
Strom Thurmond.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to the parody, which is still available at
www.evote.com/Y2K, was, according to the Evote staff, better than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``With only one exception, everyone realized it was a parody.
Sadly, one person actually wasn't sure. We'll keep the poor
wretch's name confidential,'' said Bill Laforme, Evote.com's news
editor. ``And we want to stress that rumors that it was the mayor
of Seattle, Paul Schell, are completely untrue.''

   New York State Receives A Low-Tech Rating &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is New York state at the corner of Silicon and Nowhere?
According to a recent report by Forrester Research, the home of
Silicon Alley is closer to a digital Dogpatch than a technological
nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   The report mapped the country according to ``receptiveness to
and adoption of technology,'' by comparing states on number of
computers in homes and offices, online purchases and a subjective
category, ``optimism about technology.'' Among the ``fast lane''
states were Texas, Georgia and Connecticut. New York was ranked a
giant step down as a ``middle of the road'' state.
</P>
<P>
   Ekaterina Walsh, an analyst with Forrester, said that a
surprisingly large factor was the proportion of urban and rural
areas. ``The rural parts really set off the advances of the big
cities,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   New York can take heart that Washington, home to Microsoft, was
another also-ran. ``Again, rural areas,'' Ms. Walsh said. ``Of
course, you have a concentration around Seattle and Redmond. But in
other parts of the state, you might as well be in Montana or
Idaho.''

   Start-up Will Offer Free DSL, But Service Will Come With Ads  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The marketing frenzy of the past year has brought offers of free
computers and free Internet service. This year, make way for free
high-speed access.
</P>
<P>
   Broadband Digital Group, a start-up company in Newport Beach,
Calif., announced a new service this week called FreeDSL. Starting
in April, the company plans to provide people in several major
metropolitan areas with free access to digital subscriber lines,
commonly known as DSL, in exchange for information about their
demographics and their attention to advertisements. In most
markets, subscribers are now paying $30 to $50 a month for DSL
service.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Steelberg, the chief executive of Broadband Digital, likens
the strategy to that of an entertainment network. Television
advertisers spend $350 on every viewer each year, he said. In his
estimate, his company should be able to accrue at least as much for
advertising and premium services on the broadband Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the same bandwidth capabilities as television,'' said
``But you can augment it with e-commerce, gaming on demand and
video on demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadband Digital intends to become something like a reseller of
the service, buying it from telecommunications companies for a
wholesale rate. Steelberg said he could not yet disclose names of
Broadband Digital's advertisers or DSL providers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it expects to spend a lot of money upfront, covering the
cost of installation (which often includes paying for trucks and
laborers) and purchasing radio advertising in cities like Boston
and Los Angeles. The company has set up a Web site,
www.freedsl.com, for registrants.
</P>
<P>
   Jeannette Noyes, a DSL analyst for International Data Corp.,
calls FreeDSL ``somewhat inevitable.'' But she added, ``What
surprises me is that it's come so quickly.'' To succeed, she said,
the company will have to deliver on its promises from the start _
to both advertisers and customers. Her assessment: ``It's going to
be a challenge, that's for sure.''

EMBATTLED WEIZMAN MAY BE OUSTED OVER GIFT SCANDAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Members of Israel's Parliament added their voices
Wednesday to the clamor for President Ezer Weizman to step down
following accusations he accepted huge sums of money from a wealthy
French businessman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he should resign as soon as possible,'' Tzippi Livni,
a junior lawmaker for the opposition Likud Party, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But in a debate on the future of the man who holds the largely
ceremonial post, the Knesset remained divided along party lines.
Many members of the Parliament on the political right called for
Weizman to quit, while many on the political left defended him
against allegations that he accepted $453,000 in gifts from
businessman Edouard Sarousi from 1988 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was a growing sense that it could be only a matter
of days before Weizman surrenders the post he has held since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, editorials in several Israeli newspapers began
reviewing the career of the blunt but popular president as if he
had already stepped off the political stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tragic end for a man with too many principles,''
wrote Sima Kadmon, a columnist for the daily Yedioth Ahronoth. ``It
(is) hard to summon up any satisfaction over Weizman's downfall.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnon Dankner of the daily Maariv added, ``One has to admit that
the president of the country must go home.''
</P>
<P>
   The English-language Jerusalem Post and the more liberal
Hebrew-language daily Haaretz issued strong calls earlier this week
for Weizman to stand down.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the allegations that Weizman accepted money from
Serousi, the president also has been accused of pocketing hundreds
of thousands of dollars in donations made by the Frenchman to a
small political party headed by Weizman during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Since the allegations were first made by journalist Yoav Yitzhak
at a press conference last week, Weizman has insisted he is
innocent of any wrongdoing and has vowed to stay in office until
his term expires in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   But if the feisty and embattled politician does leave office, it
would suit many right-wing Knesset members, some of whom had begun
impeachment proceedings against Weizman even before the allegations
had been raised.
</P>
<P>
   The rightists were outraged by Weizman's announcement last week
that he would be disappointed if the public voted against an
Israeli-Syrian peace deal that is expected to include a withdrawal
from the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in 1967. Prime Minister
Ehud Barak has promised to present any agreement with Syria to the
Israeli voters for their approval.
</P>
<P>
   Such a blunt statement, however much it enraged the right, was
vintage Weizman. During his political career, which began with the
establishment of the state of Israel in 1948, he has managed to
anger both the left and the right by taking sides in heated
partisan political battles.
</P>
<P>
   A staunch Likud Party member at the beginning of his career,
Weizman slowly transformed into a political dove and a champion of
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Twice he put aside his own personal political aspirations to
stay true to his principles, first by quitting the Likud government
and then by maneuvering to force a national unity government in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   His straightforward style has captured the hearts of many
Israelis, who view his plain talk as proof of an honest, if abrupt,
politician.
</P>
<P>
   Kadmon, writing in the newspaper Yedioth, called him ``a
national seismograph, the person who reflected the people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was coarse, irascible, impatient and intolerant,
warm-hearted and sensitive to human pain, bitter and uncompromising
when it came to his political positions,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Dankner of the newspaper Maariv called Weizman ``a man of great
charm whom we all love to love.''
</P>
<P>
   That popularity seems to have sheltered him from attack, even by
members of the opposition, who seemed loath Wednesday to criticize
him too much before the investigation into his conduct had been
completed.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, though, Weizman has been criticized for
being too political for his nonpartisan post. During his first term
as president, which began in 1993, he publicly blamed then-Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for stalling on peacemaking with the
Palestinians and openly campaigned for the election of Barak last
May.
</P>
<P>
   But for some politicians, his comments on the Golan Heights
represented the last straw.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prefer that Mr. Weizman will resign,'' said Shaul Yahalom
of the National Religious Party. ``Our problem with President
Weizman is not only about the money, but especially about his
attitude toward the Golan Heights.''
</P>
<P>
   Those on the left, however, pointed to Weizman's political and
military career that has spanned five decades and refrained from
passing judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Weizman has served in a variety of capacities,''
said Naomi Chazan of the left-wing Meretz party. ``He will act for
the well-being and the good of the state of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   After the controversy broke last week, Weizman acknowledged
having received the money from Serousi, but stressed that it was
legal. Israeli newspapers quoted the president's associates as
saying that the money was meant to help Weizman's son, Shaul, who
had been injured in fighting against Egyptian forces on the Suez
Canal in 1970. Shaul Weizman died in a car wreck in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Attorney General Elyakim Rubenstein requested that
Weizman turn over all documents pertaining to the allegations, and
on Monday, Weizman's attorney, Hanina Brandeis, began submitting
the material. For his part, Weizman said he was glad to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, however, Weizman announced that several of the
documents were missing. His attorneys said the dossier containing
information about the contributions from Sarousi had been stolen.

 &HT;    S.C. debate very important fo McCain
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a general misconception about Southern Republicans that
starts with South Carolina, the state where the GOP's presidential
candidates are heading for a debate Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Because Sen. Strom Thurmond's 1964 party switch sparked its
growth, there is a tendency to attribute to the modern-day
Republican party there some of the bolt-the-reservation mentality
and right-wing defiance of orthodoxy that marked the old
Dixiecrats.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina Republicans are very conservative, but they
could not be less Dixiecrat in style. Instead of defying their
party's establishment, they long ago locked on the goal of becoming
an integral part of it, and like Republicans in the South
generally, they succeeded. Within their own party they have usually
shown their conservatism by not rocking the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very orthodox, predicatable, traditional Republican
primary electorate,'' said Warren Tompkins, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush's Southeastern chairman.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina warmed only slowly to Ronald Reagan, who defeated
John Connally in the 1980 primary with the help of Tompkins'
mentor, Carroll Campbell, who went on to serve two terms as
governor. The state's Republicans saved the elder George Bush from
Pat Robertson in 1988, with South Carolinian Lee Atwater leading
Bush's campaign, and halted Pat Buchanan's march on Bob Dole in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``A serious insurgency campaign, as far as the Republicans go,
is an oxymoron,'' said former Democratic National Chairman Don
Fowler, a wry observer of the GOP in his home state.
</P>
<P>
   This background helps to explain why Sen. John McCain has so far
failed to make as much headway against Bush in Georgia's
neighboring state as he has in New Hampshire. A poll released just
after Christmas by the Columbia State newspaper has the race at
54-21, only a slight improvement for the Arizona senator from
earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   McCain still hopes to capitalize on his attraction to veterans,
who are numerous in the state. And he has the help of Reps. Lindsey
Graham and Mark Sanford, young Republicans who might hope to remake
the party as Campbell did after 1980.
</P>
<P>
   But he has to begin making headway quickly, raising the stakes
for Friday night's candidate forum.
</P>
<P>
   The mix of voters in South Carolina - fewer independents, more
social conservatives - is much more typical of the Republican
primaries that come quickly after its Feb. 19 primary than New
Hampshire's, said GOP pollster Whit Ayres, a former South
Carolinian.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina voters are more likely to focus on the
challenger's positions on issues than his personal story, Ayres
said, and in that sense the state also represents a shift in focus
toward the factors that become important after Iowa and New
Hampshire have their say.
</P>
<P>
   A key to victory for McCain-- have we been watching too many
bowl games?-- will be to demonstrate that he can compete with Bush
on a full range of issues - an establishment essential -- and isn't
limited to the campaign finance theme. Any way you shake it,
however, Georgia's neighbor will be a challenge to wrest away from
Bush.

 &HT;    McCain campaign manager confident about his candidate
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rick Davis, 42, manager of Sen. John McCain's (R-Ariz.) campaign
for president, is a veteran of the Reagan administration and 1996
Republican nominee Bob Dole's campaign. He lives in the Washington
area with his wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you expect to be at this point in late December?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. When we sat around and gamed this thing out, we didn't
think we'd have this much money. We didn't think we'd have this
much organization. We didn't think we'd have this much ballot
strength. But, in that regard, we did think we could beat George
Bush in New Hampshire. We did think that we'd raise the necessary
money to compete in the early primary states. ... Our thought was
you slide into home plate and all the dust settles and the guy
goes, ``Safe!'' And then you know you've won New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But are you in a situation now where a month's worth of
sustained advertising and appearances by Bush in New Hampshire gets
him back to even or ahead of you?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't know. ... The only thing that's consistent in this
campaign is that the more people have seen the both of them, we've
gone up and he's gone down. ... I'm confident that my margins hold
up in a comparison of the two of them. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you fear an issues-based campaign because, for one thing,
he and Bush are pretty similar on a lot of issues and for another,
some of those issues grate on the establishment Republican?
</P>
<P>
   A: ... These guys are conservative Republicans. So probably in
80 percent of the different areas, they're going to agree. So
you've got a 20 percent bogey. I do think with primary voters in
New Hampshire and South Carolina, there are some pretty big bogeys.
... What we're doing with the surplus ... John is taking a big
chunk of the surplus and saying we're going to shore up Social
Security _ not the Social Security surplus but the general surplus
_ and Bush is using that to give a tax cut. ... People care a lot
about tax cuts and they care a lot about Social Security. And
they're going to get a good choice there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When you look at your ads that are running, a lot are still
these character-based ads ...
</P>
<P>
   A: But the Social Security ad we have right now. It doesn't rely
on the bio.
</P>
<P>
   Q: No, but it does sort of hit on this same point, which is ``no
one said being president would be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   A: But I do think that's a salient political issue. ... We've
just had eight years of a presidency that was convenience. ... And
the next president, I think, is going to be in the position of
needing to make some really big, tough decisions. And I think he's
got to put the country ahead of his own interest. ... And that is
what's different in our ads. We're not asking whether you agree
with us in our positions. We're saying what we believe in and we're
hoping that you get there because that's the right place to go. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q: If an independent, more moderate voter were to spend a lot of
time looking at John McCain's record on abortion, on his opposition
to the Martin Luther King birthday holiday, even though he says now
he was wrong ...
</P>
<P>
   A: He's very conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does that become a problem?
</P>
<P>
   A: ... There is a large segment of supporters who will set aside
any given single issue because they believe he has the character to
be a president. ... And that includes Democrats. ... That's why
we're going to catch heat sometimes when we meet with different
constituencies. We saw the reaction when we met the Log Cabin
Republicans and George Bush came out and said, ``I'd never meet
with them.'' Is that something Ronald Reagan would say? Give me a
break. Of course not. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q: But there's already in South Carolina been an anonymous
mailing on this very issue ...
</P>
<P>
   A: No doubt about it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And it's the kind of thing one could try to use to drive a
wedge with voters who are thinking about the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   A: The more that we educate voters on who John McCain is and why
he does the things he does ... then they don't get hung up on all
these single issues. It's a race against time. ... This is not a
national campaign. Any way you shake it down, this is a campaign of
Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Arizona, Michigan, Virginia,
Washington state and then everything on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you'll be in South Carolina every day between the
primaries in New Hampshire and South Carolina?
</P>
<P>
   A: Just about. We've got 18 days and probably 15 of them will be
in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's been a lot of talk about how McCain can't be
``handled'' the way other candidates are handled. But campaign
managers sort of like to handle candidates. Isn't that what they
do?
</P>
<P>
   A: The difference is I'm coming off the last campaign I worked
on, Bob Dole's. It was probably the most over-handled campaign on
the face of the earth. ... We depend on John McCain because he's
our product and we want that as unfettered as is humanly possible.
You've seen it. It's about as unfettered as you can get.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think that there comes a time where that changes? He
hasn't really shot himself in the foot yet, to put it bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   A: It strikes me that there's almost this sour grapes from Bush
supporters in the media ... that somehow ... they don't pick on
John McCain's foibles as much as they pick on his. But let me
explain. ... If you just open it up all the time, there's a lot
less likelihood that you're graded on one performance a day.

   The New York Times computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times computer model collapses runaway scores and takes note
of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than earlier
games. Bowl games count as one and a half times a regular season
game.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team.
</P>
<P>
   This week, for example, there is a large difference between
Florida State (No. 1) and Nebraska (2), but the difference between
Michigan (3) and Virginia Tech (4) is fairly small.

COMMENTARY: RHYMES WITH RASPUTIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What if Bill Clinton, this past New Year's Eve, had
resigned and turned the presidency over to Al Gore? Incumbency
would have helped Gore gain the nomination and perhaps the
election. But both men would have been properly denounced for
undermining our constitutional elections.
</P>
<P>
   That's the trick that Boris Yeltsin played on Russians in his
no-prosecution deal with the KGB's Vladimir Putin. But they are not
being denounced; on the contrary, Russophiles here are hailing the
manipulation as a great boon to ``reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Acting President Putin (pronounced POO-teen, rhymes with
Ras-POO-teen) rocketed to popularity on Russian jubilation about
the massacre of dark-skinned Chechens who dare to demand
independence. He needed a snap election before the blood lust
cooled and Russian body bags began returning home.
</P>
<P>
   Putin could not wait until the election scheduled in June, at
the end of Yeltsin's term; such a delay might have given political
rivals a chance. Instead he moved to capitalize on his reputation
as ruthless conqueror and took charge right away as the appointed
head of state.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of the U.S. government should be coolly correct. We
should neither help nor hinder his rise. His apparent alternatives
_ the Arabist Yevgeny Primakov and the Communist Gennady Zyuganov _
are vainly competing to be equally bloodthirsty.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Time magazine columnist who moonlights as our
president chose to embrace Moscow's position in describing the
savage attack on Chechnya's capital. Columnist Clinton piously
hoped that thousands of civilians would not be killed in what he
called Putin's campaign to ``liberate Grozny.''
</P>
<P>
   That verb turns truth on its head. It is the Chechens who seek
to liberate themselves from Russian rule. The Russian militarists
are the ones raining bombs and shells on people who want the same
independence as Georgians and Ukrainians. For Clinton to
characterize the rape of Grozny as ``liberation'' is an
abomination.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who chose the hunting knife as his symbol (handing out
knives to Russians courageously shelling the city), says Chechnya
is ``the place where Russia's fate is being decided.'' That
military campaign is the essence of his political campaign. He
cannot afford to fail _ or to take heavy losses _ before Election
Day, which is why his sponsors induced Yeltsin to quit and move the
elections three months closer.
</P>
<P>
   Those sponsors are two of the men who divvied up the spoils
after the breakup of the Soviet Union. One is Anatoly Chubais, the
``reformer'' moving to control the Media-Most empire; another is
the media and oil oligarch Boris Berezovsky, whose man has just
been reappointed presidential chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Their task, after last week's coup de main, is to present Putin
(means ``born on the road'') to the electorate as a man on
horseback out to crush the terrorists trying to tear Mother Russia
asunder. At the same time they will portray the KGB apparatchik to
the West as a family man, genial karate black belt, closet democrat
and credit-worthy borrower.
</P>
<P>
   Will their Janus pitch work? Never underestimate the xenophobia
of the Russian public or the love of a new face by American
eliteniks. A non-Yeltsin at last _ a youthful Russian president who
does not stagger, rattle the nuclear saber or go on toots.
</P>
<P>
   Will Putin win? He is not in a race with other Russian
politicians, who will run for the exercise but admit they have
little hope. Putin is in a race with disillusionment _ that moment
when Russians realize that the Chechens won't be beaten without
heavy losses, that the flight of capital will continue under
Chubais-Berezovsky, and that military spending robs Russia of its
ability to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Because his deal with Yeltsin and his Kremlin backers has
shortened that race to an 86-day dash, he is widely expected to
beat disillusionment to the wire. After his legitimation, as his
stock drops, Putin will be tempted to use his military to
``liberate'' the near-abroad and to use his controlled media to
express assent and his KGB to suppress dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's ascension was quite a trick. We have a cunning and
energetic adversary. We should do nothing to finance his clique's
power or further his tiger's ride.

FINDING HOPE WHEN THINGS SEEM HOPELESS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I meet up with people who try to take care of the world in their
own way. Some of them are skeptical and tend to believe that the
media doesn't get it, the government does it wrong and the public
doesn't care. Sometimes they talk doomsday.
</P>
<P>
   Often they are disappointed, sometimes afraid. But they are
indomitable and most of them are fast on the phone tree and the
Internet whenever something goes awry _ be it U.S. inaction in East
Timor, the loss of trees in Wine Country, the threat to Berkeley
public radio or the harpooning of whales off Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   I sometimes wonder how they can spend so much time worrying
about trees and whales and grapevines, but I'm grateful that they
do. Sometimes I wish they would lighten up because they seem so
single-focused when in fact what concerns them the most is nothing
less than the human race.
</P>
<P>
   So, I asked some of these big, bleeding hearts with thick but
tender hides what gives them hope, Millennium-wise.
</P>
<P>
   Rain is a hospital nurse in an intensive care unit who cares
about public radio, the link between pesticides and breast cancer
and what will follow the Battle in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Rain says, ``We as a species have a highly developed survival
instinct and the more that we realize the interconnected nature of
all life, the more important it is to bring loving care to this or
that forest or to this or that youth.'' She counts on people
staying aware of the ``stakes of this period of history'' and
quotes a solemn report from the Humane Society of the United States
that 50 to 100 species become extinct every day, the greatest rate
of extinction since the age of the dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   Jack is a Buddhist who keeps an eye on the military's use of
depleted uranium and the growth of American prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Jack says, ``The Seattle events and the attitude of nonviolence
_ with the exception of a handful of testosterone-laden gonzos
kicking in windows and some rough handling by the police _ are most
encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack worries about the world his granddaughter is likely to
inherit _ ``more wars over the diminution of vital resources, an
accelerating process of global warming, the plan to put 40 some
plutonium-powered satellites in orbit over the next 10 years, and
the influence of great corporate wealth.'' His hope is that he and
others can ``help move events and ideas forward which will enhance
her life and wholesome survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Joanne is a quiet activist who runs a Catholic Worker program
which distributes food and clothing to poor and homeless families.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne says, ``I suppose it's the little things that are the
hopeful signs: A child gets a new bike and the smile says a
thousand words; a resident at the Family Support Center shelter
finally finds a landlord who will bypass a poor credit rating; a
ride is offered to a client who walked to the food pantry; over 100
sleeping bags and blankets are brought to the church as offertory
gifts for the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   She adds, ``I don't suppose we'll ever fix the world's ills but
we do make tiny inroads. In my younger, idealist days, just out of
college, I used to think I could change the world, but now much
older, wiser, calmer, I figure I'll just change one tiny corner of
it; maybe not even that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnie is a war tax resister and psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   He finds hope in history and points out that in the last 1,000
years several practices that are now unthinkable and outlawed were
once acceptable enough to be national policy somewhere in the
world. They include slavery, incest, infanticide, cannibalism. He
also notes that it's ``very recent in our history that you would
try to revive the country of your enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn is a nonprofit administrator and founder of an
environmental coalition regarding vineyard expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn's encouraged by a trend by landowners to dedicate part of
their property in conservation easements so that it will remain
wild and untouched forever. She also sees as ``the best news we've
had in years'' the spread of ``a whole social change movement''
which is happening in her corner of Northern California and
spreading elsewhere, and the fact that some see it as ``the
exciting, cool thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Dion is an animal rights advocate, founder of a baby seal watch
program and ardent protester of the Makah Indian tribe renewing
whale hunts in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Dion's hope for the new Millennium is that, given the depletion
of the ocean's fisheries and a rising human population, more people
will start to agree with her on the merits of a grain-based diet.
Her new hero, though, is Julia Butterfly Hill, the champion of old
growth redwoods who recently climbed down after living 737 days in
an ancient tree. ``Julia gave up a big part of her life for the
trees, actually leaving the earth for two years. She moved people
because she's intelligent, articulate and compassionate. She gives
me hope.''

FAMILY DISCOVERS THE CLINTONS WILL BE NEIGHBORS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DEE DEE CARLSON   
 The Courier, Houma, La.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUMA, La. _ Imagine puttering around the house one Saturday
afternoon, when your spouse walks in and informs you that the
president of the United States is in the back yard. That's what
happened to Sheila MacWilliams, who has lived in Chappaqua, N.Y.,
for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   On that Saturday back in early September, MacWilliams' husband,
Bill, walked in and said, ``Honey, the president is in the back
yard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure he is,'' was her first thought.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as she looked out her back door, she realized that
her husband wasn't joking. Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton, along
with a half-dozen Secret Service agents, were strolling around the
back yard of the house directly behind them.
</P>
<P>
   MacWilliams, a Houma native who is in town on a holiday visit,
said the Clinton house in New York is on a cul-de-sac one street
over from her family's home. It was only for sale one week before
the Clintons bought it.
</P>
<P>
   She knew the house was on the market and she had heard that the
Clintons were house hunting in Westchester County, looking to buy a
home to establish residency for Mrs. Clinton, who has said she will
run for a U.S. Senate seat from New York. ``But I had no idea the
Clintons were even looking in Chappaqua,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The MacWilliams and Clinton homes are two of the larger houses
in the neighborhood at about 6,000 square feet each, she said. The
two homes are directly behind one another.
</P>
<P>
   The day the purchase was finalized, MacWilliams said, was the
day that she, her husband and two of her three children got to meet
the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our oldest son, Kent, was on the back deck and he waved at the
president,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then walked over and chatted with her family and several
other neighbors. ``He was charming,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally shocked and surprised,'' she said of the
impromptu get-together.
</P>
<P>
   She brought pictures of the visit to share with her friends and
family in Houma, many of whom had a hard time believing her when
she called with the news. ``They didn't really believe me at
first,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But after aerial shots of the Clintons' new homestead began to
appear on that night's network news broadcasts, people who had been
to the MacWilliams' New York home recognized landmarks such as
their tennis courts.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons plan to build an 8-foot white picket fence before
they move in. Until then, the MacWilliams family has a clear view
of preparations as Secret Service agents ready the house for the
first family.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of celebrity neighbors was exciting at first, she
said, but having the media descend on Chappaqua was a bit
overwhelming. Chappaqua, with a population of about 18,000, is 45
minutes outside of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll wait and see what happens,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   MacWilliams cited one advantage to all the media attention.
Previously, when she ordered merchandise through catalogs, she
would have to spell Chappaqua at least 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not anymore,'' she laughed.

A TENOR WITH ECHOES OF ANOTHER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 David Mermelstein writes about music for The New Criterion.  
 
 By DAVID MERMELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not since Peter Pears faded from the spotlight in the 1970s has
an English tenor garnered more attention than Ian Bostridge.
Suddenly, this redoubtable 35-year-old seems everywhere on CD,
capturing the interest of music lovers throughout Europe and
America. And though some mavens have demurred, the hype has been
buttressed by albums remarkable for both artistic quality and
repertorial variety.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year alone, the tenor has assumed major roles in new
recordings of Stravinsky's ``Rake's Progress,'' Mozart's
``Abduction From the Seraglio'' and Bach's ``St. Matthew Passion.''
And his CDs of Schubert and Schumann songs reveal a lieder
interpreter of uncommon talent. Yet only recently has Bostridge
focused sustained attention on the music of his own country, with
an all-Britten compilation and a collection of English art songs,
both recorded for EMI.
</P>
<P>
   The Britten disc (CDC-56534), which finds Bostridge supported by
the Britten Sinfonia under Daniel Harding's direction, opens and
closes on familiar notes, with the composer's arrangements of the
folksong ``Waly, Waly'' and the nursery rhyme ``Oliver Cromwell.''
In between lie more substantial offerings, ``Quatre Chansons
Francais'' and ``Our Hunting Fathers'' as well as two French
folksong arrangements. The album also includes a nonvocal work, the
early ``Sinfonietta,'' though exactly why is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Like Pears, Britten's longtime companion and collaborator,
Bostridge possesses a light, reedy tenor and claims elegance,
clarity and nuance as expressive hallmarks. He also shares with
Pears an affinity for oratorio and German lieder, in addition to a
special way with English song. Yet one must be careful not to paint
Bostridge as Pears redux. Though he may resemble Britten's muse,
Bostridge has his own distinct musical personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quatre Chansons Francaises,'' a setting of two poems each by
Victor Hugo and Paul Verlaine, was composed when Britten was 14,
though the work didn't receive its premiere until 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Bostridge's persuasive performance may kindle lasting interest
in the songs, a melange of Impressionist and Wagnerian harmonies
that make up in beauty what they lack in originality.
</P>
<P>
   Bostridge's superb French diction is to be savored in all four
songs, but more than crisp pronunciation distinguishes this
reading. The sense of wonder the tenor brings to Hugo's ``June
Nights,'' for instance, proves especially gratifying, as does the
contrast he draws between a dying mother and her son in the poet's
``Childhood.'' And in the last stanza of Verlaine's ``Wisdom,'' the
singer achieves remarkable unity with the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   In the pair of French folksongs that follow (``When I Lived With
My Father'' and ``Hey-ho, Hey-ho''), Bostridge captures rustic
gaiety in sharply characterized performances. Both songs concern
sheep and wolves, and in each the tenor is grandly boisterous.
</P>
<P>
   Though it bears the designation Op. 8, ``Our Hunting Fathers''
could be considered Britten's first truly original piece. Written
in collaboration with W.H. Auden in 1936, the five-movement cycle
includes many of the signature motivic devices one associates with
this composer. The work's sharp dynamic shifts, irregular rhythms
and rich coloration, combined with Auden's strange texts, mark it
as strikingly original.
</P>
<P>
   Modern ears will surely notice its prefiguring the recent
achievements of Thomas Ades, a young English composer frequently
compared to Britten. For his part, Bostridge gamely welcomes the
music's challenges, evincing voices from manic to poignant for the
cycle's varying moods and tempos. His delectable trilling of the
r's in ``Rats Away!'' and ``Dance of Death'' alone should impress
listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Harding and the chamber-size Britten Sinfonia lend the tenor
dream accompaniment, with particularly excellent work coming from
the winds and cello. Rarely are singers supported so sensitively by
a group of players, and it is a testament to Harding's conducting
that the subtleties in Britten's scores are so transparently
unveiled.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (In hopes of avoiding confusion, record buyers should know that
a disc pairing ``Our Hunting Fathers'' with Bostridge's 1995
recording of Britten's ``Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings'' is
also now available from EMI, though this album does not include the
French songs mentioned here.)
</P>
<P>
   In ``The English Songbook'' (CDC-56830), Bostridge and the
pianist Julius Drake offer an exquisite survey of material by 14
composers, along with a few items credited to Anonymous. Though
smaller record companies, like Hyperion, have recently devoted
considerable attention to English art song, major labels have
mostly neglected this repertory, despite releasing a plethora of
recital discs, so this contribution is especially welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The tenor sings several familiar tunes but also includes enough
unusual music to elicit the interest of connoisseurs. Yet it's the
sustained effect of Bostridge's soft-grained voice, rather than his
way with individual songs, that represents this CD's chief appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In texts by Shakespeare, Keats, Hardy and a host of lesser
lights, he brings welcome freshness to these pastoral-romantic
ballads. Bostridge himself writes in the liner notes that the word
painting required here is more water color than oil or bold
etching, and his singing demonstrates just that, with tasteful,
restrained phrasing a guiding principle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one can certainly point to standout tracks among the
record's 24 selections. For Charles Stanford's ``La Belle Dame Sans
Merci,'' in which Keats tells of a knight's disillusionment,
Bostridge offers an anguished reading worthy of a Schubert lied.
And in ``To Lucasta, on Going to the Wars,'' Arthur Somervell's
setting of a Richard Lovelace poem, the tenor winningly affects the
stance of a wooing cavalier.
</P>
<P>
   Three Peter Warlock songs find Bostridge making a fine case for
this composer's multifarious talents, with two sweet lullabies,
``Cradle Song'' and ``Rest, Sweet Nymphs,'' contrasting sharply
with the comic ditty ``Jillian of Berry.'' And though Bostridge
sings only two of Roger Quilter's songs, his heartfelt accounts of
``Come Away, Death,'' from Shakespeare's ``Twelfth Night,'' and the
ever-popular ``Now Sleeps the Crimson Petal'' distinguish him as a
gifted interpreter of this sublime miniaturist's oeuvre.
</P>
<P>
   Ivor Gurney's songs are less well known than Quilter's, though
he, too, wrote prolifically. Bostridge sings the haunting ``Sleep''
and the anthemic ``I Will Go With My Father a-Ploughing'' with such
conviction as to make one wonder why so few have explored Gurney's
music.
</P>
<P>
   At every turn, Bostridge is ably supported by the assured,
characterful pianism of Drake. One need only hear this player
effortlessly navigate the harmonic shifts in Percy Grainger's
``Bold William Taylor'' or set a warmly sentimental mood for
Vaughan Williams' ``Linden Lea'' to appreciate his gifts.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't taken long for Bostridge, once a budding historian, to
metamorphose from a tenor worth watching to a tenor one can't
afford not to watch. He has accomplished this transformation by
choosing interesting projects and, seemingly, husbanding his vocal
resources.
</P>
<P>
   These two CDs reveal the singer's affinity for the music of his
native land, and though no one wants to see him turn from other
areas, one hopes he will come back to this well often, drinking
just as deeply every time.

800 INTERNET ADDRESSES REVOKED BECAUSE OF CHARACTER FLAW  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to avert a new twist on cybersquatting, the
body that oversees the Internet's address system said it was
revoking hundreds of new domain names because a software bug had
enabled people to claim addresses nearly identical to already
established Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The new trend, where people simply added a dash at the end of
registered addresses, resulted in new domains based on trademarks
like ``www.Microsoft-.com,'' ``www.yahoo-.com'' and a number of
short or catchy phrases, like ``inter-.net.''
</P>
<P>
   The revocation, approved late Tuesday night by the Internet
Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, is believed to the
first wholesale recall of Internet domain names. Officials said the
glitch was a byproduct of opening the lucrative business of
registering domain names to competition last year.
</P>
<P>
   At least some of the revoked registrations, like
www.Microsoft-.com, could be classified as cybersquatting, the
practice of registering domain names with the intent of selling
them to others, especially trademark holders, at a hefty profit.
</P>
<P>
   Icann's president, Michael Roberts, said the more than 800
revoked addresses violated a long-standing policy that prohibits
any character but a numeral or letter at the end or beginning of a
domain name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mistake in the software,'' Roberts said. ``This was
something that shouldn't have been possible.''
</P>
<P>
   A check of the Internet addressing system's database indicates
that some of the registrations were made as early as November.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs who thought they had identified a new trend early
enough to cash in on it were crying foul Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Smith, the director of Consumer.net, a privacy resource for
consumers in Alexandria, Va., said he had registered 164 of the
now-revoked domain names at $30 apiece. He said neither Icann nor
BulkRegister.com, the company that registered his domains, had
informed him as of Wednesday that the registrations were invalid.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there were a mistake, he said, the domains should not be
revoked, as some people have already hired Web hosting services and
begun spending money on establishing a Web presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time they also had a rule that no numbers could be used
in domain names,'' Smith said, ``then 3Com came along and they
changed the rules.''

SURVEY SHOWS REGULAR INVOLVEMENT BETWEEN GRANDPARENTS AND
GRANDCHILDREN

   One in 10 grandparents is either raising a grandchild or
regularly providing day care, and even among those who are not
caregivers, four in 10 see their grandchildren every week,
according to a study released Wednesday by the American Association
of Retired Persons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite our image of far-flung families, and families torn by
divorce, this is a very positive picture of so many grandparents so
closely connected to their grandchildren's lives,'' said Gretchen
Straw, the AARP's associate research director.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of grandparents 50 and over was conducted in the fall
of 1998 and released at a Washington news conference where the AARP
also discussed a case to be argued before the U.S. Supreme Court
next week, Troxel vs. Granville, involving grandparents' visitation
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had hoped to get this study out earlier, but the researcher
who began it left the organization,'' Ms. Straw said. ``When the
Troxel case came up, we decided we needed to get it out because it
gives a sense of the context.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the grandparents surveyed said they were involved in
their grandchildren's lives on many levels. For example, in the
previous month, 72 percent had had a grandchild over for a meal, 65
percent had eaten out together, 55 percent had watched a television
comedy together and 54 percent had had a grandchild stay overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Over the previous year, 74 percent had bought clothes for their
grandchildren, 60 percent had bought books, and 12 percent had paid
tuition or day care. All told, the grandparents said they spent a
median of $489 a year on the grandchildren: those with incomes
under $25,000 spent a median of $239 a year, while those with
incomes of $50,000 or more reported median spending of $840 a year.
</P>
<P>
   More than three-quarters of the grandparents surveyed said they
had at least one grandchild or great-grandchild living within an
hour's drive. Not surprisingly, those with no grandchildren nearby
have less contact: Among those who have no grandchildren within an
hour's drive, 42 percent said they did not see any of their
grandchildren quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   Three percent of those surveyed said they were raising a
grandchild and 8 percent were regularly providing childcare for a
grandchild while the parents worked. African-Americans were twice
as likely as white grandparents to be caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   Only 7 percent of the grandparents in the survey lived in the
same home as their grandchildren, with or without the children's
parents, but among those who did, most served as caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone survey of a nationally representative sample of
823 grandparents was conducted for the AARP between Sept. 28 and
Oct. 25, 1998, by ICR Survey Research Group in Media, Pa. The
margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The grandparents surveyed were divided on whether they liked
having their own children along when they spent time with their
grandchildren. Thirty-five percent said they preferred the parents
to be there, but 27 percent said they preferred activities alone
with the grandchild. Regardless of age, the grandfathers were much
more likely than the grandmothers to want the parents there.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the grandparents who see their grandchildren more
often also reported talking to them on the telephone more often.
Overall, the frequency of phone contact was similar to that of
visiting: 45 percent talked weekly or more, and 10 percent spoke
less than quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   Half the grandparents said they had sent a greeting card to a
grandchild in the past month and three in 10, mostly the older
grandparents, had sent a letter or postcard. Grandmothers, rather
than grandfathers, are the heavier senders of letters and cards.
The survey did not measure e-mail contact.
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters of those surveyed had at least three
grandchildren or great grandchildren, with the median number being
five. One quarter of the grandparents said they had great
grandchildren, and a quarter said they had step-grandchildren or
step-great grandchildren.

   PNEUMONIA-WAVE (LOS ANGELES) -- In lockstep with a wave of flu
and respiratory illnesses, viral and bacterial pneumonia is
marching across Los Angeles, filling hospitals and emptying offices
and schools. Pneumonia typically accounts for about 3 percent or 4
percent of hospital admissions state-wide during summer. Last year
during flu season, flu cases reached 10 percent of admissions. This

   PAROLE_FIGHT (LOS ANGELES) -- A 15-year-old murder case has

not oppose parole of a killer. Robert Rosenkrantz, the son of a
prominent Calabasas attorney, was convicted in 1985 of murdering a
teen-ager who exposed him as gay, but now is up for parole.
Garcetti's office typically opposes parole, but not in this case,
despite the urging of the prosecutor, Larry Diamond. Gov. Gray
Davis and the Board of Parole also opposes the parole, but a Van
Nuys judge Wednesday ordered the parole board to reconsider. Davis
says he will not allow any convicted killers paroled while he is in

ENVIRONMENTAL LEADER ADMITS PROTESTS HURT ANTI-WTO CAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The head of the National Wildlife Federation, which
helped organize major protests in Seattle late last fall against
the World Trade Organization, said Wednesday they hurt the cause of
the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Federation president Mark van Putten said the violence by some
demonstators there overshadowed the message of the mainstream
environmental groups and labor unions that led the protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I turned on the TV at night, I didn't see tens of
thousands of peaceful demonstrators calling for better
environmental protections,'' van Putten said. ``I saw people in
masks breaking windows.''
</P>
<P>
   But he warned that unless global leaders open up the largely
secret WTO meetings and listen to the environmentalists and the
labor activists calling for more attention to workers' rights, they
can expect more major protests.
</P>
<P>
   Van Putten's remarks came at a speech here on the lessons
learned from the demonstrations in Seattle surrounding the meeting
in late November and early December of the WTO, which makes and
enforces trading rules for the most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   He said the trade organization's ``secretive deal-making is
simply unacceptable'' to people living in democratic countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we saw in Seattle was democracy up close and in our
face,'' said van Putten, whose organization is the nation's largest
member-supported conservation group.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO meeting drew more than 45,000 protesters _ organized
primarily by labor unions and environmental groups _ into downtown
Seattle during the global group's four-day meeting starting Nov.
30.
</P>
<P>
   While the majority of protestors were peaceful, the
demonstrations quickly turned violent. Police sprayed tear gas and
rubber pellets into the crowds _ often at peaceful protesters _ but
failed to stop hundreds of others from smashing windows and looting
shops. The National Guard was called in to help restore order. More
than 500 people were arrested in the first two days.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental demonstrators charged that world trade agreements
have threatened individual countries' rights to impose tough
environmental restrictions on imports. Labor union protesters urged
the WTO to permit countries to impose trade sanctions on nations
that allow the use of child labor or low wages. Developing
countries oppose such sanctions as big-nation protectionism aimed
at products that provide jobs to their impoverished people.
</P>
<P>
   Van Putten said that while the violent protesters helped spur
coverage of the WTO meetings and increased the public's awareness
of the trade organization, they also damaged the image of peaceful
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a mainstream organization with mainstream views, but
that's not what people saw when they read about Seattle or saw it
on television,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Putten, whose organization supports the WTO, said
environmental groups and labor unions need to accept the idea that
nations are on an ``unstoppable'' path toward becoming a single
global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see globalization as a fact, not a policy,'' he said.
``That is a lesson that everyone who has problems with the WTO must
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, the WTO and world leaders also need to learn a
lesson from Seattle. That lesson, van Putten said, is that people
around the globe will no longer accept decisions that impact their
lives to be made in secret without input from outside groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``If globalization is a fact, than so too is the growth of
democracy worldwide,'' he said. ``Everywhere you look in the world,
people are demanding that they get a say in who makes important
decisions and what those decisions are.''

LITTLE CAVALIER KEEPS ON TRUCKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Among small economy units, the Chevrolet Cavalier has
been one of the few remaining success stories, now that tiny gas
sippers have slipped in popularity. Though it may be lacking in
refinement, it does offer stylish looks and good features at a
moderate price.
</P>
<P>
   Cavalier is a favorite among young people, especially young
women, who are on tight budgets but still crave sporty,
sharp-looking small cars. And the Cavalier convertible has become a
campus mainstay, a great way to go topless without going broke.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors' top-selling car line for 12 of the past 16
years, Cavalier is also a mainstay of rental fleets, which somewhat
dims the luster. The same car with slightly different curves is
also offered by Pontiac dealers as the Sunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Cavalier has been freshened and updated for 2000, with new
headlights and taillights, monochromatic color schemes and new
wheel treatments. It's still obviously a Cavalier, but at least
it's a distinctive little car not likely to be labeled an
``econobox.''
</P>
<P>
   A new Chevrolet bow tie graces the hood and trunk lids.
</P>
<P>
   The interior has been gone over, most notably with a new look to
the dashboard and gauges. Air-conditioning has been made standard
equipment in all models, including the basic coupe that starts at
about $13,000. Also standard across the board are power steering
and antilock brakes,.
</P>
<P>
   The test car was the hot version of the Cavalier, the Z24, which
boasts good-looking 16-inch aluminum wheels with performance
rubber, a ``more aggressive'' rear spoiler and, most significantly,
a strong twin-cam engine.
</P>
<P>
   It's the engine formerly known as Quad 4, whose name was
abandoned a few years after it earned a reputation as being so
rough and noisy that the extra power output wasn't worth the
hassle. A decade later, that engine has no name at all but has been
tamed to a great degree, though it still roars hoarsely under
acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with a nice-shifting five-speed manual, the twin cam
provides plenty of scoot. There's a significant amount of torque
steer to deal with, but the Z24 still provides some sporty fun.
</P>
<P>
   Standard equipment is a 2.2-liter four that puts out a wimpy 115
horsepower, especially ineffective when hooked up to an automatic.
Still, it will get you there, and for many drivers, that's the goal
of a Cavalier.
</P>
<P>
   Handling is balanced and predictable, helped by those
performance tires, but the suspension is poorly controlled,
allowing the body to sway and heave. The steering is vague with
poor road feel.
</P>
<P>
   Though the interior is fairly spacious for a small car with a
low, sporty roofline, it's also pretty spartan. The seats offer
little support, especially the back seat. One backseat rider
commented, ``Now, I know what they mean by a `bench seat.' This
seat's just like sitting on a bench.''
</P>
<P>
   The dashboard looks nice and has a good feel to it, compared
with the hard-plastic dashes of some other budget offerings. The
gauges, complete with tachometer, are clear and attractive. But in
our test car, with just 1,600 miles on the odometer, the dashboard
had a constant, annoying squeak, often accompanied by some other
rattles in the body upon encountering even mild bumps or rough
pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Cavalier shines in comparison to other budget
offerings is in the standard equipment and low-cost options,
although those options can quickly push the price into the upper
teens and low 20s, where the Cavalier stops looking like such a
great bargain. On the test car, an electric sunroof added just $600
and an upgraded stereo system was just $180.
</P>
<P>
   Cavalier is up against some formidable competition in the
subcompact class, including class-leader Honda Civic, Chrysler
Neon, Volkswagen Golf and Jetta, and the new Ford Focus.
</P>
<P>
   Cavalier soldiers on as an economical alternative, but it's
starting to feel tired and crude compared with more sophisticated
offerings in the same price range.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for Chevrolet to make a major upgrade of the Cavalier
instead of just a face lift. &QL;

RANGERS' LATEST SNOW JOB CHILLS ANY PENNANT FEVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five weeks until spring training opens and the Rangers have
already closed the off-season. Closed it with unsolved mysteries at
second base, third base, leadoff hitter and one rotation spot, or
two if you don't trust Esteban Loaiza.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Melvin was one re-sign away _ free agent Aaron Sele _ from
having the franchise's deepest rotation in forever. But Melvin
wouldn't spend Tom Hicks' money.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Doug should have called Mark Cuban for a loan.
</P>
<P>
   When Sele signs this week with either Baltimore or Tampa Bay,
the off-season will have officially been kissed off. Swept by the
Yankees in October, the Rangers answered that postseason ouster
with an immediate surrender.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us actually thinking the Juan Gonzalez trade would
lead to a progressive and aggressive off-season, towels are
available upon request. To wipe away the egg.
</P>
<P>
   Sele and Todd Zeile followed Juan out the door. The only
high-dollar signee was pitcher Kenny Rogers. Do you smell something
here? Could it be the odor of salary slashing?
</P>
<P>
   Denials come quickly from Rangers officialdom when you mention
such a dreaded P.R. nightmare. Any perception of salary slashing
makes season tickets a harder sell.
</P>
<P>
   But if not that, what then? If Sele had been re-signed _ yes,
$30 million over four years is steep _ there is no complaint at
all. Not with a solid, veteran rotation of Rick Helling, Justin
Thompson, Sele, Rogers and Loaiza.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a hole was left in the rotation, along with the other
holes. Sorry, Mr. Melvin, but this does stink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see where the fans and the media wanted us to take that
extra step and sign one more pitcher,'' Melvin said yesterday.
``Frankly, at times I second-guess myself on \RSele\S.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to have signed Aaron, I think you paint yourself into the
financial spot we had prior to the Juan trade. I thought the
biggest challenge I had this off-season was to create payroll
flexibility, keep spots open for our younger guys and to also
maintain the winning tradition we've been able to establish.''
</P>
<P>
   That last part will be the hardest in 2000. Melvin admits he
could have gone to Hicks and ``probably'' sold the owner on the
idea of re-signing Sele as a bookend for the free-agent signing of
Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Then what the heck stopped him?
</P>
<P>
   ``If Sele comes back here, we don't find out about our young
pitchers,'' said Melvin. ``A Matt Perisho. A Doug Davis. If we are
going to progress, and move beyond winning the division to more
playoff success, the key over the next few years will be how people
from our minor-league system respond at a higher level.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Melvin said his pitching rotation could already be
filled with several established names beyond Aaron Sele. He claims
to have repeatedly turned down trades, particularly when the name
of young reliever Francisco Cordero is mentioned. Which is often.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero came as part of the Juan package from Detroit and is
having a standout winter-ball campaign after making a strong debut
with the Tigers last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have traded Cordero again yesterday,'' said Melvin.
``And that offer involved a starting pitcher. But I'm being honest
when I say I could have made a deal a day involving our young
players. They are in great demand. This is a nice indicator for us
on what we have coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin still frowns when he mentions his deals the past two
years that have sent elsewhere second baseman Warren Morris, third
baseman Fernando Tatis and pitcher Ryan Dempster. Melvin's baseball
roots are all about build-from-within.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we made those deals because it was time to win, and keep
winning,'' he said. ``We had to establish that with our fans. As a
Cowboys fan, I sure wish they'd have kept Patrick Jeffers. But we
sure could use a Tatis right now, couldn't we? I traded him.''
</P>
<P>
   While I call it a very disappointing off-season for the Rangers,
Melvin counters with: ``I'm excited already about spring training.
We are going to have our uncertainties, no doubt about it. But we
are also going to find out about our young players. If they give us
what we need, it's an immediate positive, plus a long-range
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   One way or the other, Melvin also still has the financial
flexibility to do something major during the season. But based on
right now, this was a winter of blahs for a team that needed to
have horns blaring. / nn

CANDIDATES (Washington) - Arizona Sen. John McCain depicts himself
as a straight-talking reform advocate, but an 18-month
investigation of the presidential candidates by a public-interest
group says the Arizona senator ``rarely breaks ranks with the
special interests who finance his campaigns'' and takes steps to
protect them. ``This happens even with Sen. McCain. He's not a
saint,'' saide Charles Lewis of the Center for Public Integrity.
The book also details the relationship the other presidential
candidates have with their large contributors. The book was
released as McCain was denying today that he wrote a letter to the
FCC specifically to try to help a campaign contirbutor. By

GLOBE (Undated) - Sen. John McCain responds to a report in the
``Boston Globe'' that as recently as December, hours before he and
Bill Bradley appeared in a dramatic bipartisan call for
campagn-finance reform, the Arizona senator had intervened with
federal regulators on behalf of a major campaign contributor. The
day before he sent the Dec. 10 letter, McCain used the
contributor's corporate jet for a trip from New York to Florida.
The day after the letter, he took the company jet from Florida to
Washington. The night before McCain sent that letter, SBC's
Washington lobbyist held a fund-raising dinner for McCain that
raised close to $20,000 for his campaign. On March 30, Ameritech's
chairman cohosted another fund-raiser at which McCain raised
$88,000. In addition, the two companies also funneled $10,000 to
McCain's campaign from their political action committee. By KRIS

a chief prosecutor in the office refused to take a tough stance on
this case, saying he's not familiar with all the facts, and that
there are always exceptions to the rule. Defense attorneys and

BUSH DRAWS CRITICISM FOR FOCUSING ON ONE-ON-ONE APPROACH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa _ Erma Leary waited 45 minutes, Mitch Malcolm
more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   After George W. Bush finished delivering a version of his stump
speech in a hotel ballroom here Tuesday night, Leary, Malcolm and
dozens of other Iowans lined up to shake the Texas governor's hand,
get an autograph, pose for pictures, ask a question or engage in a
mini-conversation.
</P>
<P>
   In five appearances in Iowa on Tuesday and Wednesday, Bush,
front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, did not
take a single voter's question in a public forum _ supposedly the
tried-and-true ``town hall'' approach to campaigning in
early-voting states. But by conscientiously working the crowds _
for a hand-numbing hour and 21 minutes at the Five Seasons Hotel
rally _ Bush and his strategists believe he is forging an equally
important link with voters whom they want to turn out for the
season-opening Iowa precinct caucuses Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people like to press the flesh. I think people like
that better than asking questions'' in a public meeting, said state
Rep. Rosemary Thompson, Bush's Linn County chairwoman. Her view was
echoed by Leary, a retired teacher who said she never would have
stood up in a crowd to press her education views on Bush but got to
give them to him in the quiet moment she spent with the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so sincere. I'm quite impressed,'' Leary said. But
opponents contend that Bush, by relying so heavily on his favored
one-on-one approach to meeting voters, is avoiding the
trial-by-questioning that has long been expected of serious
presidential candidates. Bush's father held ``Ask George Bush''
sessions in Iowa and New Hampshire in his 1988 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   By cutting down on the ``town halls,'' said the senior adviser
to a rival Republican candidate, the younger Bush is also avoiding
possible missteps _ that would be recorded by the news media _ in
an unstructured open-forum grilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bum rap,'' Bush said as he neared the end of the Tuesday night
rope line. ``Because the people who are saying I don't answer
questions from audiences haven't been to the audiences I've been
speaking to. I've been to town meeting after town meeting after
town meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   The unspoken comparison is with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who
has refused to campaign in Iowa but is in a neck-and-neck race with
Bush in New Hampshire, where the year's first presidential primary
will be held Feb. 1. Three or four open-to-the-public town hall
meetings a day is routine for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after arriving back in New Hampshire, Bush spoke to
workers at Fidelity Investments and took a half-dozen questions on
foreign and domestic policy. That evening, Bush attended a
gathering of voters _ in a supporter's private aircraft hangar.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the very first trip of the campaign, (Bush) had a `fire
station chat' in New Hampshire,'' said Karen Hughes, the Texas
governor's spokeswoman. ``Maybe we should have called it a `town
hall' instead. The formats are exactly the same.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush seems more at ease with the one-on-one campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to shaking as many hands as I want to shake.
Maybe take a picture of two,'' Bush told the Cedar Rapids crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Bush may have hit on a successful formula, one analyst said,
noting that Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic front-runner,
often stays long after formal speeches to shake every available
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of going to the rope and pressing the flesh is very
connective,'' said Bill Henderson, a professor of communications
studies at the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls.
Practitioners, he said, are ``doing one-on-one as opposed to
one-to-many.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson has noted ``a significant shift to one-on-one''
campaigning by politicians, and ``I think it's far more effective.
Then that person is more likely to make positive comments to
others'' about the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   One drawback, Henderson said, is that the one-on-one approach is
``not very satisfying to the media,'' which rarely can hear what is
being said as a candidate meets with voters. Media disenchantment
with the tack almost certainly has contributed to the buzz among
the political class that Bush is seeking to avoid public exchanges
with possibly hostile questioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the perception is true,'' said Hughes, a former
television reporter. ``I don't hear many voters saying that. Most
voters know they'd have ample opportunity to question the
governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Malcolm, who was near the end of the line to greet Bush,
said anyone in the audience ``could have asked him a question right
here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you meet one-on-one, it's very important,'' said Malcolm, a
marketing representative.

   The New York Times computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times computer model collapses runaway scores and takes note
of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than earlier
games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a fairly small
difference between Jacksonville (1) and St. Louis (2).

RUSSIAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEFER TO PUTIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Virtually unknown five months ago, acting Russian
leader Vladimir V. Putin strengthened his hold on power so much
Wednesday that some rivals in the upcoming presidential elections
abruptly threw their support behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Other rivals looked hopelessly outmaneuvered, conceding that the
former spymaster _ with 70 percent approval ratings _ is the man to
beat in the vote March 26.
</P>
<P>
   The Putin steamroller shows the awesome grip of the Kremlin,
with its control of major media and a large swath of the economy.
And Wednesday's moves, following a meeting of Putin and his rivals,
took much of the drama out of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Stepashin, a former prime minister who until recently was
considered a possible presidential candidate, endorsed the man who
replaced him as prime minister in August and became Russia's acting
president when Boris N. Yeltsin unexpectedly quit on New Year's
Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that democratic forces will unite behind Putin and I
will be among them,'' news agencies quoted Stepashin as saying.
``Putin doesn't have any realistic challengers.''
</P>
<P>
   At least not if his opponents keep endorsing him. In a perhaps
the biggest boost for Putin, the opposition All Russia party
Wednesday gave up, announcing it would back him.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to helping Putin, the move showed how weak political
parties are in this vast country. The party is part of an
opposition coalition cobbled together by Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov
and former prime minister Yevgeny Primakov before parliamentary
elections last month.
</P>
<P>
   The party hoped to dominate those elections and catapult
Primakov into the Kremlin. Instead, the party withered under an
onslaught of negative coverage on Kremlin-controlled television
channels and finished a disappointing third in the parliamentary
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Oleg Morozov, one of the coalition's leading figures,
said the party would not nominate Primakov for president, news
agencies reported. It was also unclear whom the Communists,
Russia's largest and best organized party, would nominate for
president.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party released a vague statement, saying its
presidential candidate would be ``unusual'' _ an indication the
party's candidate may not be Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who
ran unsuccessfully against Yeltsin in the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   There was widespread speculation in Moscow Wednesday that the
Communists may nominate Primakov. Last month, Primakov said he
planned to run for president but since Yeltsin's abrupt resignation
_ which pushed elections forward by three months from June to March
_ he has maintained a public silence.
</P>
<P>
   One candidate who did say he would run is Grigory Yavlinsky,
leader of the liberal Yabloko party. But in declaring his candidacy
Wednesday, Yavlinsky all but conceded defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it isn't serious to speak about anybody other than
Putin winning the election,'' Yavlinsky told a radio interviewer.
``But if we ever want to change things for the better in our
country, if we want to preserve openness and democracy, other
people also must run in the election.''
</P>
<P>
   The only candidate who is acting as if there is a contest is
flamboyant nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky. The lawmaker insists
he is Putin's only serious challenger, this despite his party's 5
percent showing in December's parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now Putin is everybody's bread and butter. With me they
will also get sausage,'' Zhirinovsky said in televised comments.
</P>
<P>
   The upper house of Russia's parliament Wednesday officially set
March 26 as the date for the presidential vote. Candidates have
until Feb. 13 to gather 500,000 signatures to qualify for the
ballot, and are not allowed to begin campaigning until Russia's
Electoral Commission verifies the signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Putin will benefit from the trappings of office, the
benefits of incumbency, and positive coverage on Russia's
state-controlled media. One of Putin's aides said that the acting
president would probably not even need to campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``His activity as prime minister and acting president should be
sufficient. There is no point in excesses,'' the Kremlin deputy
chief of staff, Igor Shabdurasulov, was quoted by news agencies as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   A political unknown when Yeltsin appointed him prime minister in
August, Putin, 47, has captured the public's imagination with his
tough, straightforward style and his uncompromising stance in
Russia's three-month-old military campaign against separatist
rebels in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts here say there is virtually no way Putin can lose, and
he may even win outright in the first round. If no candidate wins a
majority on March 26, a runoff between the top two finishers will
be held two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is a place where unexpected things happen more than in
most countries, as we saw on December 31. But nevertheless, it is
difficult to imagine anybody other than Putin winning this
election,'' said Vyacheslav Nikonov, a Moscow-based political
analyst and an ally of Luzhkov's.
</P>
<P>
   Putin invited political leaders, including some of his
opponents, to the Kremlin Wednesday to urge a clean election
contest. Last month's parliamentary poll was marred by smear
campaigns and dirty tricks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election should be clean, without a war of compromising
materials,'' Putin said in televised comments. Putin also said that
the election should contribute to stability in Russia and ``help
the consolidation of our society.''

NEGOTIATORS RESOLVE PROCEDURAL DISPUTE AS ISRAELI-SYRIAN PEACE
TALKS CONTINUE 

</HEADLINE>

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. _ Israeli and Syrian officials finally got
down to serious discussions Wednesday as they entered their third
day of peace talks in search of an elusive deal to end nearly 52
years of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   With prodding from President Clinton and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, the longtime enemies resolved a procedural
dispute over the agenda and set up four committees to tackle the
difficult issues standing in the way of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the committees _ one dealing with mutual security
arrangements and the other focusing on the terms of peace and
normalization of relations _ met Wednesday. The two others covering
water rights to the Sea of Galilee and where the border will be
drawn following Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights were
expected to meet Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The committees' task is to narrow the divisions between the two
sides and settle on proposals that are likely to win the backing of
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa, who is representing Syrian President Hafez Assad
at the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and al-Sharaa held their first face-to-face session
Tuesday with Clinton and Albright in attendance, but they did not
meet again Wednesday. Instead each held separate sessions with
Albright and met privately with members of the working committees
in an effort to draw up at least a preliminary blueprint of what a
final peace accord could look like.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin continued to caution that
the administration does not expect a core agreement to emerge from
the initial discussions here, even though he said the committee
meetings got off to ``a positive start.``
</P>
<P>
   ``We're chugging along,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the first job of the committees is to make sure that the
Shepherdstown discussions take up where Israeli-Syrian talks left
off in 1996, when the two countries last held low-level meetings on
substantive issues.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said it's important for both sides to get ``some common
understanding'' of where things stood when the 1996 discussions
abruptly ended after a number of terrorist attacks on Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. role in the talks continued to be that of facilitator
and mediator. Clinton is expected to re-enter the talks in person
Thursday to help push along the process. He stayed in touch
Wednesday by telephone from the White House. Albright and a U.S.
team of Middle East diplomats and military experts, meanwhile, are
participating in each committee meeting to help keep things on
track.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration believes that the chances for a
Syrian-Israeli peace agreement are better now than at any time
since the Jewish state was established in 1948. Barak seems willing
to do what is reasonably necessary to secure a deal with Syria, and
Assad, who is said to be ill, would like to see the Golan Heights
under Syrian control again before he dies or relinquishes power to
his son, Bashar.
</P>
<P>
   A deal between Syria and Israel would likely lead to a
comprehensive Middle East peace settlement that includes Lebanon,
which is controlled primarily by Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has already established peace agreements with Egypt and
Jordan, and is now in the process of implementing a deal with the
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. On Wednesday, Israel turned
over five percent of the West Bank to Palestinian control by
carrying out a promised military withdrawal. Another six percent
will be relinquished later this month, which will give Yasser
Arafat's Palestinian Authority control of some 40 percent of the
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the possibility of a deal with Lebanon has been
discussed at the talks in Shepherdstown. Clinton and Albright have
also contacted Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss in hopes of
spurring a resumption of negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   A Syrian-Israeli peace deal will carry a heavy price tag for the
United States. Clinton indicated earlier this week that it will
cost billions, not only in financial aid commitments, but possibly
in military assistance as well.
</P>
<P>
   No figures have been agreed on yet, but Rubin said ``preliminary
discussions'' had begun with Israel about ``what they think they
may need.`` Rubin, however, denied reports in the Israeli press
that the United States is planning to form a military defense pact
with Israel to help deter the possibility of Arab attacks on the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that we're planning a defense pact ... is wrong,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration, however, has not ruled out the possibility
of committing U.S. troops along the border with Israel, Syria and
Lebanon to help keep the peace and ensure that any agreement
reached is fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's border security concerns and how much of the Golan
Heights it will give back to Syria are expected to be the toughest
issues to resolve as the talks proceed. Israel, which captured the
Golan from Syria in the 1967 war, has since annexed much of it and
has allowed 18,000 Israelis to settle there.

 &HT;    U.S. DECISION TO RETURN BOY TO FATHER, CUBA HEATS UP BATTLE OVER
HIS FUTURE
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old boy who lost his mother
on a perilous voyage from Cuba and then became the center of an
international tug-of-war, should be returned to his father in Cuba,
federal immigration officials announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This little boy who has been through so much belongs with his
father,'' Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris
Meissner said, announcing her decision in Washington. ``It is the
right decision legally; it is the right decision morally.''
</P>
<P>
   But the decision immediately touched off a fiery new round in
the battle that erupted shortly after Elian was plucked from stormy
seas off Miami on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   While angry Cuban exile protesters gathered outside the Little
Havana home where Elian has been living with relatives here, those
same relatives vowed to go to court to try to halt the boy's return
to the Communist island.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want is the chance to explain the family's point of
view,'' said a tearful Marisleysis Gonzalez, Elian's cousin. ``His
mother risked her life for him to win his liberty and I hope this
country will at least give us the opportunity to speak for him.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, broadcasters broke into regular programming on Cuban
state television to announce the decision, warning the Cuban people
not to be too optimistic just yet. There was no immediate reaction
from Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, or from Cuban leader
Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Bill Clinton praised what he called a
tough decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you when we started this that I would do my best to
keep this decision out of
</P>
<P>
   politics,'' Clinton said. ``We have done that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of Wednesday's swirling mix of politics and
emotion, Elian attended a Miami elementary school. Relatives, after
being told of the announcement by INS officials, hustled him in and
out of cars and took him to an undisclosed location.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this point, he doesn't know what's going on,'' his cousin
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dramatic announcement, the boy's immediate fate was
still somewhat uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   While Meissner gave a Jan. 14 deadline for the Elian's return to
Cuba, she left open exactly how the transfer will take place. U.S.
immigration officials will give Elian's father a special visa to
come to Miami to get him or will allow a third party, perhaps a
religious organization, to take the boy to Cuba, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our hope that with the knowledge of today's decision,
the Miami relatives will agree to cooperate and work together with
either Elian's father or a third party to facilitate Elian's return
to his father,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, there were reports that Elian's father has
requested that the National Council of Churches bring the boy back
to Cuba. Representatives of the group met with him in Cuba earlier
this week and offered to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials do not anticipate forcibly removing Elian
from his Miami relatives, Meissner said. It is also an image that
Clinton administration officials desperately want to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   But the family clearly seemed reluctant to give up the fight,
and leaders of Miami's volatile exile community promised protests
that might spread across the city and disrupt traffic in coming
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want is to paralyze is the legal process,'' said Ramon
Sanchez, a leader of the anti-Castro Democracy Movement in Miami.
``We hope we don't have to get to the point of paralyzing the city,
but we have that ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives said they sent letters
following Meissner's announcement to Clinton and U.S. Attorney
General Janet Reno requesting an asylum hearing for the boy. If
there is no favorable response, they will file a federal lawsuit
asking for an injunction to halt Elian's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal courts have the jurisdiction to mandate that the
INS follow its own rules and regulations,'' said Linda
Osberg-Braun, one of the family's attorneys. ``It's unprecedented
to neglect letting someone apply for political asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   Several legal scholars, however, said the family has little hope
of prevailing in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not the slightest hint of unfitness of the father,''
said University of Miami law professor David Abraham, an
immigration expert.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Elian's father reportedly maintained a close, loving
relationship with the boy, even after he and Elian's mother
divorced. Family photos show them in loving embraces, while
neighbors said Juan Miguel Gonzalez has been heartbroken at his
son's ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   The father has said he was unaware that Elian's mother,
Elizabeth, was planning to flee Cuba. She and nine others drowned
when their small boat capsized. Elian was rescued clinging to an
inner tube.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives say the father should come to Miami and
present his facts in a court of law, but Gonzalez has told
reporters he is reluctant to make the trip because he fears he
might be attacked.
</P>
<P>
   The case has been one of the most dramatic examples of the
poisonous relations between Miami's Cuban exiles and the Castro
government. While Castro has made Elian a cause celebre in Cuba,
distributing thousands of t-shirts with his picture and speaking at
rallies that have drawn huge crowds, Miami's exiles have rallied to
the boy with equal emotional fervor and political zeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should he go back to Cuba,'' said Alex Ramirez de
Arellano, who stood outside the home of Elian's relatives
Wednesday. ``If he goes, he'll be eating dog food with no future.''
</P>
<P>
   But another Miami Cuban who lives near the Gonzalez home said
she believes blood is thicker than politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shouldn't be a political problem,'' said Tanay Alonso.
``I'm Cuban, but I'm a parent. If something should happen to my
husband, I'd want my kids to be with me.''

WARNINGS FOLLOW SURPRISE HARVARD PILGRIM RECEIVERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Anxious hospital executives, doctors, and employers who
use Harvard Pilgrim Health Care for medical benefits scrambled
Wednesday in an attempt to deal with the surprise order Tuesday to
place the state's largest health plan in receivership.
</P>
<P>
   Financially strapped hospitals, already bleeding from spiraling
medical costs and federal funding cuts, said the move marks the
deepest financial crisis in the history of New England health care
and warned that hospitals could fail if Harvard Pilgrim doesn't pay
its bills in full.
</P>
<P>
   While doctors and hospitals stressed that they would continue to
provide care to all patients, many also began assembling strategies
to cope with a possible financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are an awful lot of people around town scrambling to see
what they should do,'' said Christopher J. Panos, a health care
lawyer at the Boston firm Craig and Macauley who said he was
swamped with calls from clients seeking advice on getting paid by
Harvard Pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense of urgency that's never been there before, and
this time people are really worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim officials sought to assure members and creditors
that services would continue without interruption and that the
beleaguered health plan would return to profitablity within the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
   But a judge's order Tuesday placing Harvard Pilgrim's financial
affairs in the hands of the Massachusetts Insurance Division
sparked such widespread concern over the health plan's future that
New Hampshire Insurance Commisioner Paula T. Rogers took the
extraordinary step of urging people in that state to look for
another plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Harvard Pilgrim is in, and may emerge from,
rehabilitation, I nonetheless would advise insureds of Harvard
Pilgrim to consider other health insurance options,'' Rogers said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim has been an emblem of New England's deepening
health care crisis. Its losses in 1999 totaled a staggering $109
million. Under new management since last May, the health plan had
said it was on track for a recovery in 2000, but this week
officials discovered nearly $60 million in accounting errors,
prompting the state action.
</P>
<P>
   According to terms of the receivership, state insurance
officials have 30 days to devise a business plan that will include
how to pay overdue bills.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals would potentially be hardest hit if the state decides
Harvard Pilgrim can pay only a fraction of past-due bills, industry
executives said. And in a hastily assembled press conference
Wednesday, chief executives from more than a dozen area hospitals
said they could be forced out of business if the full amount of
overdue bills aren't paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now in a full-blown crisis,'' said Ron Hollander,
president of the Massachusetts Hospital Association. ``Things are
as bad as they've ever been. We are already stretched to the limit,
and we have to get paid what we're owed. This thing can't be solved
on the backs of hospitals or I guarantee that hospitals are going
to go under.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollander said Harvard Pilgrim owes a total of $300 million to
the state's hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Small community hospitals are the most vulnerable, industry
sources said, but some large teaching hospitals that have suffered
the brunt of cutbacks under the federal Balanced Budget Act could
also be in deep trouble if they don't get full reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial underpinnings of the entire industry are very
weak right now,'' said James L. Reinertsen, chief executive of Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center, which recently announced layoffs
and other cost-cutting measures to stem financial bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the near term for us, it's business as usual,'' Reinertsen
said. The risk we face is that in the business plan that's
developed, we'll be forced to take discounts on reimbursements.
That is potentially very troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   Many employers, meanwhile, swamped Harvard Pilgrim's
switchboards with calls seeking assurance that their health plans
would remain intact, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some smaller employers who use Harvard Pilgrim as their only
health plan, said they were planning to switch to other plans,
industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the state Group Insurance Commission, which
provides health coverage for more than 250,000 state employees and
is Harvard Pilgrim's largest customer, met to consider what to do.
With assurances from Harvard Pilgrim's chief executive, Charles
Baker, the commission decided to go forward with its current
enrollment negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not happy news, God knows, but I don't think it's time
to hit the panic button yet,'' said Dolores Mitchell, the
commission's executive director. ``Harvard Pilgrim is a very, very
large plan and it's not going to go away overnight. But on the
other hand, we are not bereft of alternatives, and I always think
in terms of contingencies.''

rallies that have drawn huge crowds, Miami's exiles have rallied to
the boy with equal emotional fervor and political zeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should he go back to Cuba,'' said Alex Ramirez de
Arellano, who stood outside the home of Elian's relatives
Wednesday. ``If he goes, he'll be eating dog food with no future.''
</P>
<P>
   But another Miami Cuban who lives near the Gonzalez home said
she believes blood is thicker than politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shouldn't be a political problem,'' said Tanay Alonso.
``I'm Cuban, but I'm a parent. If something should happen to my
husband, I'd want my kids to be with me.''

 &HT;    Opposition rising over S.C. shipping terminal
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fred Lincoln grew up in Wando, S.C., with simple pleasures, the
whiff of salt marshes and the view of the sun setting over the
Cooper River. Now 54, he's fighting to stop a nearly 1,300-acre
cargo terminal that, if built, would vastly expand the State Ports
Authority's shipping operations in Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the growing opposition to the proposed $1.2 billion
terminal on Daniel Island, Lincoln fears construction of a rail
line and a truck route for the project would destroy Wando, a
predominantly black community of 400. Some are descendents of
former slaves who moved there after the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned about losing a community, not just a view of
the river,'' said Lincoln, a firefighter in Mount Pleasant, S.C.,
who serves as president of the Wando Concerned Citizens Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all of the pollution,'' he said, ``the sunset might not
be so orange anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Charleston is already one of the nation's fastest-growing ports,
handling $29.3 billion in imports and exports in 1998, up 7 percent
from 1997. Among its most glamorous exports: the BMW Z3 roadster
and coupe and the X5 sports activity vehicle manufactured in
Spartanburg County.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Charleston port ranked behind Long Beach, Calif.,
Los Angeles and New York as the nation's biggest container port,
while Savannah ranked ninth, according to the Journal of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But that robust growth could evaporate, say Ports Authority
officials in Charleston, if the port fails to expand amid brutal
competition in maritime shipping. East Coast ports _ including
Savannah _ are rushing to accommodate the increasingly large
vessels hauling cargo in metal containers, predicted to dominate
global shipping in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's who has the deepest water, who has the best rail service,
and who can get the containers to their destination,'' said Bob
Merhige, deputy executive director for the Virginia Port Authority,
which is investing $500 million over the next eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to take the long view, or you are going to get left
at the starting gate,'' Merhige said.
</P>
<P>
   But in Charleston, critics say the Ports Authority's proposed
Global Gateway would be so big _ eventually consisting of more than
two miles of wharves along the Cooper and Wando rivers _ that its
toll on the community and the environment would diminish its
economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The intensifying debate shifts today to the board meeting of the
State Ports Authority, whose new chairman, Edgar Buck, last month
acknowledged the critics.
</P>
<P>
   Buck raised the possibility that the terminal's first phase
might be shifted from the Wando River side of Daniel Island to the
more industrialized Cooper River side. For today's meeting, the
authority's staff is preparing a comparison of building on the
Wando or the Cooper River.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Lincoln said, Wando residents would lose because the
proposed rail line and truck route would disrupt three minority
neighborhoods, requiring the demolition of 14 houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to hit me on the back or the head or in the
mouth, it does not matter,'' said Lincoln, who dismissed the
authority's offer to spend $5 million on a new recreation center
and other community projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our community has been here for this long,'' he said, ``why
would we want to leave now?''
</P>
<P>
   The Ports Authority argues, however, that Charleston's
commercial port, one of the state's economic engines, will sputter
unless it expands.
</P>
<P>
   State ports officials say the agency may run out of terminals in
Charleston in six or seven years, a shortage that could prompt
shipping lines to step up business with competing East Coast ports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must either meet the needs of our customers, or we wither
and die,'' State Ports Authority chief executive Bernard Groseclose
told a recent public hearing in North Charleston. ``Our community
needs jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   If built as envisoned over the next 20 years, the terminal would
create more than 14,000 jobs, paying yearly wages of $3.6 billion,
according to the Ports Authority's draft economic impact statement.
Other benefits, such as the creation of spinoff industries, would
bring to 30,000 the number of additional people attracted to the
Charleston area.
</P>
<P>
   Some union employees at the port earn more than $100,000 a year.
``If we lose this port, do they all go to work in the tourist
industry for $6 an hour?'' said Robert New, whose business oversees
the tying and untying of ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stable foundation for the local economy,'' added harbor
pilot Randall Swan.
</P>
<P>
   But the intensifying debate has drawn in some influential
opponents, the Chapel Hill, N.C.-based Southern Environmental Law
Center and some Charleston-area legislators who predict the project
will fail if not scaled back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is probably some need for the port to expand, but how
much I don't know,'' said state Sen. Ernie Passailaigue
(D-Charleston).
</P>
<P>
   Charleston County's legislative delegation decided to hold
public hearings, a setback for Ports Authority officials, who,
working on this project for a decade, already face a complex
federal and state permitting process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were to come to pass, which I doubt, the port would
dominate everything,'' said state Sen. Arthur Ravenel (R-Mount
Pleasant). ``It is just too much.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Senate Finance Committee, Passailaigue doubts
Ports Authority officials could convince the Legislature to fund
the project.
</P>
<P>
   Ports Authority officials counter that the agency would seek
legislative funds only after raising money by issuing revenue
bonds, tapping federal sources and seeking private investors such
as a shipping line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they can get the last drop of blood out of (Sens.) Strom
Thurmond or Fritz Hollings,'' Passailaigue said. ``But I am not
aware of a pot of money around for the Ports Authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Trip Van Noppen, a lawyer for the Southern Environmental Law
Center, said the Ports Authority's draft environmental impact
statement, which is open to public comment until April 14, fails to
adequately address threats to rivers, wetlands and the air. That
makes it vulnerable to legal challenges, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ramifications, Van Noppen said, reach beyond the environment
to overall quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the basic nature of this community going to be?'' he
said. ``Is Charleston going to fit into the port, or is the port
going to fit into Charleston?''

   From Miami to Norfolk, ports are expanding, or planning to do
so, in fierce competition for increasingly large ships.
</P>
<P>
   Miami: $76 million project includes renovation of three cruise
ship terminals and construction of 750-space parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville: $74 million project includes harbor deepening,
purchase of four container cranes, rail improvements at two cargo
terminals, and construction of a vehicle processing warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Savannah: $230.2 million project, includes proposed deepening of
the Savannah River navigation channel. Under construction is a
facility for transferring cargo containers from ships to rail cars.
Two additional berths_one for containers, the other for general
cargo_are planned.
</P>
<P>
   Charleston: $1.2 billion project includes proposed 1,300-acre
cargo terminal to be built on Daniel Island over 20 years. First
phase slated for completion around 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmington: $329 million project includes deepening of the Cape
Fear River navigation channel.
</P>
<P>
   Norfolk: $100 million project to develop northern portion of
Norfolk International Terminals, including 1,500-foot container
wharf and 60 acres of container storage, and purchase of three
cargo cranes. Another $400 million in improvements are planned over
the next eight years.

REGULATORS FACE DIFFICULT CHOICES FOR HARVARD PILGRIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When the dust settles, regulators will have four
choices for dealing with the problems of Harvard Pilgrim Health
Care: they can give the troubled HMO time to make a financial
recovery on its own; they can sell the health plan to a suitor with
deep pockets; they can liquidate the company and let members find a
new insurer; or they can suggest the state itself put up money for
a bailout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rehabilitating the company is clearly the most attractive
option,'' said Steven Weiner, a health care lawyer with Mintz Levin
Cohn Ferris Glovsky And Popeo.
</P>
<P>
   Under the scenario Weiner envisions, the HMO would operate under
state supervision while it came up with a turnaround plan. As in a
bankruptcy proceeding, the state receivership would prevent
creditors from taking action against the company while it was
trying to right itself.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim has already announced its intentions to leave
certain markets, to raise the premiums it charges members and to
sell some of its real estate in an attempt to get back into the
black.
</P>
<P>
   If Harvard Pilgrim needs a turnaround model to follow it can
look to the experience of Oxford Health Plans, a large HMO that
operates in the New York area. Oxford was never put into
receivership, but it lost nearly $900 million in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The company has since returned to profitability by taking many
of the same steps Harvard is proposing. ``And they managed to hang
on to most of their members and their doctors,'' said Stephen
Caulfield, an executive with the Chickering Benefits Planning
Insurance, a Cambridge company in the health insurance field.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the size of Harvard Pilgrim's losses, the HMO might
also ask its creditors _ doctors and hospitals _ to accept less
than full payment on the money they are owed. Again, the bankruptcy
analogy is relevant.
</P>
<P>
   In a press conference Wednesday, the Massachusetts Hospital
Association warned that hospitals are in no position to make
concessions. ``We can't let that happen,'' said Andrew Dreyfus,
executive vice president of the association. ``Hospitals have no
room to absorb losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1992, when a Cambridge-based HMO called Bay State Health
Care got into trouble, hospitals had to accept partial payment on
their debts to help save the company. Dreyfus estimates the
hospitals had to write off $50 million in unpaid claims.
</P>
<P>
   But even with that concession, state regulators in 1992
concluded they could not nurse Bay State back to health. ``Bay
State could not be saved on its own,'' said Nancy Turnbull, a
former state regulator, now a lecturer at the Harvard School of
Public Health. ``We needed a white knight to come in and take
over.''
</P>
<P>
   In September 1992 Bay State was sold to Blue Cross and Blue
Shield of Massachusetts, which agreed to assume about $150 million
of Bay State's debt.
</P>
<P>
   Who might be willing to step in and buy Harvard Pilgrim? Health
specialists say the most likely buyers would be large national
for-profit health insurers such as Cigna Group, based in
Philadelphia, Wellpoint Health Networks, a California HMO, United
Health Care, a Minnesota HMO and Aetna, a health insurer based in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Conceivably Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts might be
interested in stepping in again, but most health executives say the
company does not have the financial wherewithal to pull off such a
feat.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts has traditionally been hostile to for-profit
health care, but as Turnbull put it, ``You can't say anything is
off the table at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Liquidation would be an extreme step, but it too has been done.
When Harvard Pilgrim announced its withdrawal from Rhode Island
last year, its members had to be reassigned to other health
insurers. The same thing is currently underway in New Hampshire
where Tufts Health Plan has decided to leave the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liquidation would be traumatic for everyone,'' said Steven
Tringale, a Boston health care consultant. No one Wednesday could
remember a case in which an HMO the size of Harvard Pilgrim had
been disbanded. The company has more than one million members in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   A state bailout also seems far-fetched. Still Andrew Dreyfus of
the hospital association argued Wednesday that an injection of
state funds into the troubled HMO should at least be considered if
the losses are large enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state could view Harvard Pilgrim as if it were a public
utility,'' said Dreyfus. ``The state may want to insure that the
company doesn't fail at the expense of the rest of the health care
system.''

ISRAEL, SYRIA DISCUSS SECURITY; US SEEKS FASTER PACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. _ In their first nitty-gritty discussions
since talks broke off nearly four years ago, Israeli and Syrian
officials Wednesday negotiated terms of security arrangements and
normalized relations in their quest for a historic peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright met separately with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk Sharaa to urge them to pick up the pace of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to get from a chugging-along phase to the faster
track, we're going to have to get more new ideas,'' said State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin. He said work had begun on two
committees, named Security Arrangements and Normal Peaceful
Relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans on the two committees were struck by the fact they
were constructive, businesslike and positive in terms of getting
down to business, rolling up the sleeves and try to get to some of
these difficult issues,'' Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   That would appear to be unremarkable, except for the fact that
Israeli and Syrian negotiators haven't discussed issues such as
security zones with limited armament and cultural exchanges since
March 1996, when a string of suicide bombings in Israel caused the
Jewish state to shut down talks.
</P>
<P>
   In two days in December in Washington and in two days here at
this hilltop town, President Clinton and American diplomats focused
efforts on allowing Israeli and Syrian leaders to restate their
commitment toward a deal and then establishing a framework to
restart discussions.
</P>
<P>
   US officials believe the Shepherdstown talks represent the most
promising chance yet for an Israeli-Syrian peace deal, which would
call for Israel to give back much or all of the Golan Heights in
exchange for a promise of peaceful relations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing about ending a half-century of enmity has been
particularly easy yet, with troubles arising from the start. And
after US officials found a way to rework the agenda to each side's
approval, the personal interactions have remained on the stiff
side, with the Americans pointedly hosting an informal meeting
Tuesday night to try to start some ease of conversation. According
to a US official, there was only a limited amount of small talk,
including a few words by Barak spoken in Arabic to Syrian
officials.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been no moments of crisis here, either, and US
officials expect a long period of negotiation before their goal of
a core agreement can be reached. In this round, US negotiators hope
the talks last nearly two weeks, ending next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The outlines of a deal are apparent. Israel captured the Golan
Heights, a high plateau east of the Sea of Galilee, in 1967, and
Syria wants it back. Up for negotiation: the exact border, the
sharing of water resources, the security arrangements on the
plateau, and how the two countries will conduct relations
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the two committees that began work Wednesday in
sparely furnished seminar rooms, Rubin said committees on borders
and water would soon meet.
</P>
<P>
   On the security arrangements committee, three generals are
involved. Lt. Gen. Donald R. Kerrick, an aide to Albright, leads an
American delegation that also includes Frank Kramer and Bruce
Reidel. Gen. Ibrahim al-Omar, director of reconnaissance for the
Syrian Army, heads his delegation; his counterpart is Gen. Shlomo
Yani, the Israeli Defense Force planning director.
</P>
<P>
   On the peaceful relations committee, diplomats will head the
talks, including Walid Mualim, Syria's former US ambassador who
headed the 1996 negotiations, and Israel's Zvi Stauber, a top
foreign advisor to Barak and author of an extensive report on peace
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The principals in the talks _ Barak and Sharaa _ and a handful
of top aides will be receiving reports from the committees, Rubin
said. Albright will remain at the talks at least through this week.
Clinton, who helped mediate the talks on Monday and Tuesday, will
likely arrive again either Thursday or Friday, Rubin said.

JOBS DROPS `INTERIM' FROM TITLE AT APPLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ending more than two years of very public
indecision, Apple Computer's co-founder, Steve Jobs, announced on
Wednesday that he was dropping the ``interim'' from ``interim chief
executive,'' the title under which he has led the company back into
prosperity in the last two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement that he was staying on indefinitely at the
computer company he co-founded almost 25 years ago was made in
typical Jobsian style before an overflow crowd of more than 4,000
Macintosh users _ as a footnote to a more than 2-hour keynote
presentation at the company's biannual Macworld exhibition, which
opened here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of that presentation was Apple's new Internet
initiative. Jobs said the Cupertino, Calif., computer maker would
invest $200 million in Earthlink Network, the nation's second
largest Internet Service Provider behind America Online. He also
outlined a World Wide Web portal strategy designed to bring the
company closer to the world's 25 million Macintosh users.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy shift, he said, was intended to play to Apple's
natural advantage as the only major personal computer maker that
also makes its own operating system and software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple is the last company in our industry that makes the whole
widget,'' he said. ``We can take responsibility for the whole
consumer experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to strengthening the computer maker's alliance with
Earthlink, under which Apple receives revenue for Macintosh
customers who use the Earthlink service, Apple also unveiled a new
version of its Web site, which will now offer a set of Mac-specific
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a very well-thought-out portal strategy,'' said
Charles Wolf, a computer industry analyst at Warburg Dillon Reid.
``This is dedicated to the Macintosh community.''
</P>
<P>
   In his presentation, Jobs said the company had shipped 1.35
million Macintosh computers during the last quarter of the year,
the most it had ever shipped in a three-month period.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Internet strategy focuses on a set of Web services
that will be available to Macintosh users from the Apple.com site,
including electronic mail, Web site reviews, online greeting cards,
an Internet ``disk drive'' to store files and a ``Kidsafe'' system
that limits children's surfing to sites prescreened by Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs stressed that the company believed that it could
``monetize'' its new Internet strategy easily, adding, ``We believe
Apple will be one of the most profitable Internet companies.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited the company's $12.5 million investment in Akamai
Technologies Inc., which has developed systems for improving
Internet performance. Jobs said Apple's investment in Akamai was
now worth $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs also demonstrated the company's new user interface for its
Mac OS X operating system. Named Aqua, and carrying visual hints of
Jobs' former Next operating system, which Apple acquired three
years ago, the new operating system will be available for
widespread testing next month and will be available commercially
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Aqua interface, which Jobs suggested was so elegant that it
was ``lickable,'' contains a number of three-dimensional features.
</P>
<P>
   It also makes heavy use of translucency and offers a number of
structural changes. For example, the company's popular Sherlock
search tool is integrated directly into the Mac finder program to
make it easier to retrieve files and other information.
</P>
<P>
   The desktop version of Mac OS X is intended to run existing
Macintosh applications and programs that have been modified to take
advantage of the new operating system, as well as future
applications to be built using the company's Openstep software
development system.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his decision to stay on permanently at Apple, Jobs said
he would defer the issue of his compensation to Apple's board of
directors. Since his return to the company, Jobs has not drawn a
salary and has continued to own only a single share of the
company's stock, which closed at $104 a share on Wednesday and has
reached as high as $118 in recent months. When he stepped in as the
company's temporary leader in July 1997, the shares hovered around
$13.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dropping of the `i' from his title is symbolic,'' said
Wolf. ``He'll stay as long as he's having fun.''

</P>
<P>
   _ Judy Childree, Fayetteville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your husband will have plenty of sole with hand-sewn brown
driving shoes ($95) from the Orvis Clothing &AMP; Gifts catalog (style
number PG024P-02). The multi-piece soles offer good traction so his
feet won't slip when driving or walking. Call 1-800-541-3541.

</P>
<P>
   Another source for driving shoes is the Cole Haan store in

<P>
   Q: I would love to know where I can find instant black bean soup
by Fantastic Foods in Atlanta. I used to buy it in Texas. By just
adding boiling water, you have a fantastic dip!
</P>
<P>
   _ Karen Burpo, Alpharetta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Dip right in. Fantastic Foods' Jumpin' Black Bean is a
low-fat soup of black beans blended with veggies and spices. We
found our soup at Whole Foods Market, 2111 Briarcliff Road N.E.
(404-634-7800). A 2.2-ounce serving is 99 cents. As reader Burpo
says, you simply fill the container with boiling water, stir well,
cover, and let steep five minutes. Then stir. Presto, a super
simple hot dip.
</P>
<P>
   Q: About 2 years ago I found little round mirrors to stick on
the end of lipstick caps. I think I bought them at Drug Emporium
but have been unable to locate them again. All my friends are on
alert to buy out the store if they find them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Carolyn Chandler,
</P>
<P>
   Avondale Estates, Ga,
</P>
<P>
   A: Mirror, mirror on the ... tube. Dazzle Dot makes an adhesive
lipstick mirror that instantly turns your lipstick into a
mini-compact. We found our package (two mirrors, $1.99) at Linens
'N Things, Snellville Pavilion, 2059 Scenic Highway, Snellville
(678-344-7933). Peel off the paper backing, place a mirror on the
end of the cap and _ voila! _ you can see to put on your lipstick.

 &HT;    Working at ultimately staying together _ separately
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Will absence make Ted's heart grow Fonda?
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner and Jane Fonda announced Tuesday they were
separating, even though they were ``committed to the long-term
success'' of their marriage. The move might seem paradoxical _
living apart in order to stay together.
</P>
<P>
   But many marriage therapists say that under the right
conditions, a trial separation can provide a cooling-off period
that allows both partners to see their problems more clearly
instead of letting those difficulties propel them into divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Nord of the Institute for Marital and Family Therapy in
metro Atlanta said couples can increase their chances of staying
together if they agree to participate in joint and individual
therapy sessions during their separation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea behind a separation is not just to come back to
the relationship, but to come back to the relationship a changed
person,'' Nord said. ``It depends on their willingness to want to
change, of course, but an objective third party can certainly help
them do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Paula and Leo Gorelkin are a husband-and-wife team who counsel
married couples at Partners for Personal and Relationship
Empowerment in Tucker, Ga. They tell their patients to use
separations not as vacations, but as opportunities to spend more
time resolving their conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not seem that way at first, but a separation can bring
a couple even closer,'' said Leo, whose wife of 35 years often
finishes his sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for them to step back into their neutral corners,''
said Paula. ``Instead of having them come out fighting, they come
out working harder at their relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrell Dammann, a clinical psychologist at Open House in
Atlanta, said trial separations can work, but there's also an
inherent risk that the bonds developed during the course of the
marriage will disintegrate while the spouses are apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience has been that most people make a decision within
a six-month period, and most times that decision is to get a
divorce,'' Dammann said. ``In a lot of cases, the separation is
just an excuse to delay making a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   A common mistake that separated couples sometimes make is to
split without working out the ground rules that will guide their
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   An obvious example is deciding whether they can date outside the
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't do that, there is a tendency to drift into Lone
Ranger habits,'' said Bill Nichols of Athens, Ga., editor of the
Contemporary and Family Therapy Journal.
</P>
<P>
   While the break-up-to-make-up strategy has become a widely
accepted tool for therapists working with troubled marriages, Carl
Johnson rarely recommends it for couples he sees in his Atlanta
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it can be a bad idea,'' said Johnson, who is also
director for the Georgia Association for Marriage and Family
Therapy. ``If you don't get along with your family, the reflex
reaction is to move as far away as possible. People confuse
physical distance with psychological distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really happens is that you freeze-frame the relationship,
and during the period you're apart, you're not making any
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases he urges couples to reconcile their differences
while they are still living in the same household.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly every decision in a marriage should be negotiated
between both partners,'' he said. ``The only exception is whether
or not they want to stay together. That decision has to be made
inside your own heart.''
</P>

HOSPITALS OVERFLOWING WITH FLU SUFFERERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ While most computers weren't laid low by the Y2K bug,
many human beings have been hit by the flu bug. Since Christmas,
hospitals and walk-in clinics have been bursting at the seams, with
patients streaming in with flu and flu-type symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Six hospitals in Eastern Massachusetts were so full Wednesday
that ambulances had to divert to other hospitals, said Dr. Mark
Pearlmutter, chief of emergency services for St. Elizabeth's
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the worst flu season in the last 10 years,''
said Dr. Richard Zane, director of emergency care at Brigham and
Women's Hospital. About one-third of the patients he saw one day
this week complained of flu-type symptoms, Zane said. Some of it
has just been colds, but the actual flu has hit faster and harder
than usual, and he has seen more pneumonia and gastrointestinal
problems associated with the flu than usual.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Dr. Alfred DeMaria, director of the state
Department of the Public Health's communicable disease bureau, the
state has not hit epidemic levels of the flu. Nor has DeMaria seen
reports of more pneumonia cases than the usual for this time of
year.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, all the tested and cultured flu specimens have been
of the Type A Sydney variety, said Dr. Anita Barry, director of
communicable disease control for the Boston Public Health
Commission. This type was covered by this year's vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Barry said an early indicator of the severity of the flu season
in Boston came in late November and early December when 12 percent
of all deaths were caused by the flu or pneumonia, a higher
percentage than usual. ``It's not too late for the flu shot,''
Barry said.
</P>
<P>
   For the country in general, said Dr. Carolyn Bridges of the
influenza branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in Atlanta, influenza season came earlier than last year, but its
arrival is ``not atypical for this time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the urgent-care center and walk-in pediatric clinic
of the East Boston Neighborhood Health Center saw the highest
number of patients in a 24-hour period ever, according to Dr. James
Taylor, the health center's medical director.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Berestrand Williams, who sees adults and children at the
East Boston center, said that he has seen more episodes of
pneumonia than usual, probably because more patients are coming
down with flu-like symptoms and then developing secondary
infections, such as pneumonia. But, those who got the flu vaccine
earlier are doing well. ``Few of them have come back to my clinic
with flu-like symptoms or secondary penumonia,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Serino, superintendant in chief of the Boston Emergency
Medical Services, said historically, the week between Christmas and
New Year's Day is slow, but this year it was busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually the peak is in February,'' said Serino. ``I hope this
is the peak.'' In the city, only two hospitals at a time are
allowed to be on diversion status, when ambulances have to go to
other hospitals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jonathan Edlow, associate chief of emergency care at Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center, said one reason for the diversions
may be because many hospitals have downsized over the last five
years under the financial pressure of managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Edlow said that typical influenza symptoms have been
abrupt-onset, fevers of 103 to 104 degrees, severe dry hacking
cough, and runny nose. ``Several of my patients said they will feel
OK, then a few hours later, they will feel like they got run over
by a truck,'' Edlow said.
</P>
<P>
   What has surprised many, said Dr. Donna Cooper, staff physician
of Massachusetts General Hospital's medical walk-in clinic, is that
a lot of the people coming in sick are not among the groups _
elders, children, and adults with medical problems such as asthma _
who are advised to get the flu shot. ``This particular bout is
giving healthy people enough trouble for them to stay out of
work,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pearlmutter of St. Elizabeth's said that, along with more
pneumonia, he has also seen more severe bronchitis, and
gastrointestinal bugs, where patients come in with stomach
cramping, diarrhea or dehydration. Pearlmutter said that elders and
smokers are also more prone to develop pneumonia, and some have had
to be admitted to the hospital. ``For some of those reasons, it's
not safe to send those patients home.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Elizabeth Broderick, a geriatrician at Cambridge Hospital
said, said that so far, there has not been an outbreak in the
nursing homes or senior centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hold my breath until the end of February.'' said Broderick.

   CUBA-BOY (Washington) _ The Clinton administration, hoping to
end a deeply emotional diplomatic and political battle over the
fate of Elian Gonzalez, rules that the 6-year-old boy should be
sent back to Cuba to live with his father. ``This little boy, who
has been through so much, belongs with his father,'' said Doris
Meissner, the INS commissioner. But officials said the decision was
made with full awareness that the poignant case could worsen
Washington's relations with Havana at a time when the
administration is attempting to increase contacts with Cuba. By

BRADLEY SOUNDS A POPULIST THEME WITH TAX PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As a professional basketball star three decades
ago, Bill Bradley was shocked at how much time he spent with
lawyers seeking ways to shelter his income from taxes, and at how
team owners benefited from ``loopholes big enough to drive a
Sherman tank through,'' as he put it in his 1976 memoir, ``Life on
the Run.''
</P>
<P>
   His interest in tax fairness carried over into his career in the
Senate, and now into his campaign for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bradley proposed steps to increase tax collections
by $125 billion over a decade by clamping down on corporate tax
shelters and other dodges, ending tax breaks for some special
interests and generally encouraging greater compliance with the tax
code.
</P>
<P>
   It is an idea with the potential to have tremendous popular
appeal. It is grounded in general agreement that abusive tax
shelters cost the government billions of dollars each year. It is
in sync with a similar though less sweeping effort by the Clinton
administration. And it could provide a new pool of money to help
pay for Bradley's plans to increase access to health care and
reduce child poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But in making the proposal, Bradley waded into a political
swamp, where what appears from one perspective to be a rip-off
appears from another to be sound tax policy, where the line between
collecting revenue and raising taxes is fuzzy and where no
politician, including Bradley, can claim to be pure.
</P>
<P>
   ``One person's tax shelter is another person's tax benefit,''
said Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat from Texas who introduced
legislation last year to curb use of shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department has grown more aggressive in the past
few years in cracking down on ever-more complex tax avoidance
strategies developed by accounting firms and lawyers on behalf of
corporate clients. And there have been periodic efforts over the
years to cleanse the tax code of breaks inserted to benefit
particular industries, companies and even individuals.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most ambitious was the 1986 tax bill, which had its
genesis in legislation proposed by Bradley several years earlier.
But members of Congress have always found it much easier to give
lobbyists and constituents a new break than to take one away.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the tax code has been gradually loaded up again
with arcane provisions _ at least one of which, a tax break for
pharmaceutical companies operating in Puerto Rico, was supported in
1992 by Bradley. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Bradley also made a point on Tuesday of reiterating his support
for a tax break for the production of ethanol, a corn-based fuel.
Pledging to retain the ethanol subsidy is almost a right of passage
for candidates in Iowa, whose caucus on Jan. 24 will be the first
real test of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the most effective lobbyists in Washington, who have
oiled the machine of Congress well with campaign contributions,
benefit greatly from keeping the system the way it is,'' Doggett
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dissatisfaction that people have expressed about the
Internal Revenue Service relates as much to the feeling that some
people are not paying their fair share, that they are cheating and
gaming the system, as it does to the particular level of taxes that
any taxpayer pays,'' Doggett said.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem goes beyond the clout of lobbyists. There are
legitimate questions about how to define what constitutes a shelter
and what might be an arcane but wholly legitimate business
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department spent much of last year wrestling with
that distinction as it tried to develop tax shelter legislation
that would even get a hearing from the Republican-controlled
Congress, where measures that could be interpreted as tax increases
tend to languish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, how do you define what's an abuse and how do
you keep legitimate transactions from getting swept up,'' said Mark
A. Weinberger, a principal with the lobbying firm Washington
Counsel, which is representing business groups opposed to broadly
written legislation on tax shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley has avoided that difficult issue of defining what's a
tax abuse or loophole,'' Weinberger said, ``and just articulated
the popular rhetoric of saying he doesn't like tax abuses and
special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   With Bradley under attack from Vice President Al Gore for
proposing domestic policy initiatives that could cost more than the
government can afford, Weinberger said, the Bradley plan seemed
more an attempt to raise revenue than to address in a serious way
the complicated problems of the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to believe he's doing it to blunt the criticism by
the vice president,'' Weinberger said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some tax analysts said they were skeptical that Bradley's plan
would generate anywhere near the promised $125 billion even if it
was enacted. But the Bradley campaign said the plan was realistic,
and that if Bradley became president he would succeed in breaking
the current gridlock over how to handle the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bill Bradley is president, everyone in Washington will know
this is a guy who is committed to tax fairness and the principle of
tax reform,'' said Eric Hauser, Bradley's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, he said, would draw a line between those provisions
with ``broad social and public value,'' and those ``clearly driven
by private interests that are market distorting.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rush Limbaugh said he noticed it about two months
ago. Listeners to his daily radio show were sending in e-mails by
the thousands, asking why there were more commercials on his
three-hour talk-radio program.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I didn't know what they were talking about,''
Limbaugh said. ``I was talking for the same amount of time every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   He may have been speaking for the same amount of time, but his
words were, without his knowledge, being sucked into a temporal
never-never land. A new kind of digital technology was literally
snipping out the silent pockets in between words, shortening the
pauses and generally speeding up the pace of Limbaugh's
speechifying.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, listeners to WABC heard the sped-up version of
Limbaugh's program, causing Limbaugh to complain about it on air.
</P>
<P>
   With no fanfare, the digital program _ called ``Cash'' in the
direct manner of software nomenclature _ has established a foothold
in the radio industry in the last six months. General managers at
about 50 radio stations across the country are using it, to speed
up talk programs so that they can wedge in more commercials. Radio
stations are adding as many as four minutes of commercial time an
hour _ or eight, 30-second commercials. At one point, some stations
added as many as six minutes of commercials, the maximum allowed by
the technology, but eventually pulled back.
</P>
<P>
   While the radio industry has used devices to speed up
programming in the past, this is the first time that time
compression has been used on live programming to expressly make
room for more advertising. The new device has angered radio
denizens like Limbaugh, who says he uses pauses for emphasis much
like an actor raises an eyebrow on stage. He spared no hyperbole
when he spoke in an interview of its potential impact on radio: ``I
think it is potential doom for the radio industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Limbaugh may be accustomed to predicting doom, but in an economy
where advertising dollars are plentiful and radio stations can, as
a result of deregulation, run as many commercials as listeners will
tolerate, some say the radio industry is like a hungry child
confronted with an open cookie jar.
</P>
<P>
   While radio executives say the impact of the Cash technology is
often imperceptible to consumers, advertising executives complain
that there is already too much clutter on the dial, making each
commercial less effective. Other critics point to a larger issue:
that the growth in commercials in recent years, combined with
listeners drifting toward other media, like the Internet, may be
helping to eat away at the radio audience.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Shrinking radio's content reflects the growing impulse to cram
in advertising wherever and whenever possible. Commercials _ which
once punctuated the cultural landscape _ now dominate it, from the
flashing computer screens at the local deli cash register, to the
piped-in advertisements on corporate telephone lines, to airport
baggage carousels and supermarket floors.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that jamming too much commercial time on radio is
one of the first places commercial overloading becomes swiftly
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   James Duncan, president of Duncan's American Radio, a
Cincinnati-based broadcasting industry consulting group, said that
as deregulation has loosened the industry's limits on commercials,
their number has doubled to 20 commercials an hour, from about a
dozen. That typically represents an increase of about 10 minutes an
hour to, in some programs, as much as 30 minutes an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, the total time Americans have spent listening to
radio programming has shrunk by 12 percent, Duncan said. According
to figures from Arbitron, the independent research agency that
tracks radio ratings, time spent listening has declined in the last
decade, to 21 hours 15 minutes a week, from 23 hours 45 minutes a
week _ a decline of 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are throwing way too many commercials at our listeners,''
Duncan said. ``I think stations will slowly realize that there is a
maximum that listeners can stand, and if they don't they will
seriously downgrade their listenership.''
</P>
<P>
   Expanding commercial time has proved too tempting for the
industry, which is experiencing boom times thanks to the healthy
economy but also in part to the fact that the radio industry is now
owned by a small cluster of giants like Clear Channel
Communications, which has a pending deal to buy AMFM; Infinity
Broadcasting, and Capital Cities/ABC Broadcast Group. As the
industry has consolidated, the economics of radio management have
become more efficient, streamlining advertising sales and
centralizing programming.
</P>
<P>
   The Radio Advertising Bureau estimates that radio sales will
have reached $15.5 billion for 1999. Advertising revenue was up 14
percent on the local level and 27 percent on the national level
through October 1999, compared with the same period the previous
year, according to the Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Image, a Silicon Valley technology company, introduced
Cash last spring after its device for television stations _ the
Time Machine, which compresses both audio and visual signals to
make more time for commercials on live programming _ caught the eye
of a radio station owner in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of time compression began to take hold in television
about a decade ago, and has been used to moderately shrink
syndicated programming like talk and game shows. But the
time-compression equipment was not aggressively marketed as devices
to create extra time for commercials until about three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The promotional literature for the Time Machine, for example,
reads in part: ``Use the Time Machine to add commercials to your
program schedule and profits to your bottom line.'' Bill
Hendershot, the president of Prime Image, said that more than 250
television stations _ affiliates from NBC, CBS, ABC, and Fox;
several owned and operated stations, and a handful of cable
networks _ own the Time Machine. The Inspirational Network, a
religious cable network in Charlotte, N.C., has used it to speed up
sermons and religious programming.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Use of time-compression devices on television generally create
less time for extra advertising, so the impact on the bottom line
is proportionally less than for the radio industry.
</P>
<P>
   Because television viewers and executives are much more
sensitive to commercial clutter, the quantity of commercials on
television has not reached the numbers of those on radio.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Cash works on live radio by digitally recording the entire
broadcast. It begins by recording the first couple of minutes of
live radio _ depending on how many commercials the manager wants to
insert _ then replays it, condensing the silent portions throughout
the rest of the broadcast. It is used primarily by local radio
stations who apply it to syndicated programs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one day last month, Philadelphia's WWDB-FM, which
broadcasts Limbaugh's national program every day at noon, sought to
gain close to an extra three minutes of commercial time in one
hour. The engineer inserted a one-minute commercial block at noon,
and Cash recorded Limbaugh during that minute. At 12:01 p.m., the
program began to play Limbaugh's now not-exactly-live broadcast,
and during the next 21 minutes, the digital program eliminated
pockets of silence between Limbaugh's words and also removed what
is known in the trade as ``redundant'' data from within words _ for
example, shortening a long syllable. The station gradually earned
back the one minute lost at the top of the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of Cash is minimized by Phil Boyce, the program
director of New York's WABC-AM who experimented with Cash on
Limbaugh's show in November _ until Limbaugh complained about it on
air, a contretemps reported in The New York Post. ( Boyce said that
he had not yet decided if he would continue to use Cash.) ``Yes,
you can shoehorn more commercials in,'' Boyce said. ``But it really
wouldn't be noticeable with the naked ear unless some station was
using it to its maximum capacity by removing five or six minutes an
hour.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But that is already happening. Dennis Begley, the general
manager of WWDB-FM of Philadelphia, has squeezed as many as six
extra commercial minutes out of an hour of Limbaugh's program,
prompting complaints from listeners. But, he said, the benefits
outweigh the disadvantages. ``When I first heard about this thing,
I knew we had to get it,'' he said, ``because I knew the
money-making potential was ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said because listeners complained, these days he aimed to
squeeze no more than four minutes an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Boyce of WABC, the only New York station to experiment with
Cash, said the station used Cash because there was an unprecedented
demand for commercial inventory.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in a sold-out situation, you look for any way
possible to manage more advertising,'' Boyce said. Because of
sensitivity to listeners and Limbaugh, WABC has suspended its use
of Cash for now.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That feast for radio stations has turned out to be a famine of
sorts for advertisers, who are becoming sensitive to the quantity
of commercials on radio. Jackie Davenport, a vice president and
broadcast supervisor at Lowe Lintas &AMP; Partners Worldwide, an
advertising agency in New York, said the problem of clutter was
much more apparent in radio than in television.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened is that unlike television, where it is
closer-watched how many minutes they will devote to commercial
time, radio will just add more minutes when the demand increases,''
Ms. Davenport said. ``The clutter has gotten out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davenport said advertisers had become wary of getting lost
in a long commercial block, so that not only price but placement
had become part of the negotiating process.
</P>
<P>
   The compression technology has certainly given radio purists
pause _ or maybe a lack thereof. Michael Harrison, the editor in
chief of Talkers, a weekly magazine that chronicles the talk-radio
industry, said that compression reflects trends in both radio and
in the commercial-polluted American culture at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a syndrome of our times,'' Harrison said. ``We have no
patience for anything that might seem superfluous. We're at a time
when we're so caught up in speed and greed that we have no qualms
about bastardizing artistic integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraig T. Kitchin, the president and chief operating officer of
Premiere Radio Networks, the subsidiary of Clear Channel that
distributes ``The Rush Limbaugh Show,'' said he had studied Cash to
see if its speed had any adverse affects on Limbaugh's ratings and
found that it did not. He added that Cash's innovation was
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``In life, everything moves faster now,'' Kitchin said. ``You
get more e-mails, and voice mails than you can keep up with. But
you still have the same number of hours in the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Limbaugh's complaints are not all tied to purist motives.
Limbaugh, who receives a percentage of the advertising revenues
raised during his program, said he was concerned about advertisers'
perception of Cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to listen to a radio program where 30 of every
60 minutes is advertising,'' Limbaugh said. ``And no advertiser
wants to be sandwiched in between six other commercials. But of
course, to the technology nerds, this is a fascinating device.''

MCCAIN DISPUTES WRONGDOING IN USE OF JET, PRESSURING FCC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Senator John McCain told a New Hampshire
audience Wednesday that American government has become ``little
more than a spectacle of selfish ambition,'' and asked for help to
``turn the practice of politics toward a higher plane.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the hours before and after his lunchtime address, McCain
showed how fine and difficult a line he is walking when trying to
reform a political system in which he is also a leading player.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, in a campaign swing through central New Hampshire, spent
part of his time denying that his acceptance of corporate jet
travel and contributions from broadcasting interests, as reported
Wednesday in The Boston Globe, had led him to seek favored
treatment for the donors.
</P>
<P>
   His leading opponent, George W. Bush, suggested that McCain's
actions in the matter had smacked somewhat of hypocrisy, given the
Arizona senator's standing as an outspoken advocate for limiting
special-interest influence in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really important for people who are advocating
reforms to live up to the spirit of reforms they are advocating,''
Bush said, adding that he believes McCain to be an honest man.
</P>
<P>
   McCain acknowledged that he had written a letter to the Federal
Communications Commission on behalf of broadcasting interests that
rented him its corporate jets at a low, but legal, rate, and that
gave $20,000 to his campaign over the past year. But he stressed
that his letter had only demanded that the FCC make a decision
after a two-year delay, and had not suggested how the commissioners
should vote.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the Globe reported Wednesday, McCain's letter, in its
timing and blunt tone, was widely interpreted inside the FCC as
exerting pressure to reach the outcome desired by the broadcasting
conglomerate, Paxson Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC chairman, William E. Kennard, a Democratic appointee,
replied to McCain last month that his intervention was ``highly
unusual,'' and suggested that it might be inappropriate since it
might ``have substantive impacts'' on the FCC's deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was unapologetic Wednesday about putting pressure on the
FCC to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are probably the least responsive agency in Washington,''
he said. ``If I had asked them to act affirmatively or negatively,
there may be some concerns,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not, he said, and ``it's my responsibility as chairman of
the oversight committee to ask them to act.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain conceded that all of his official actions on behalf of
contributors will now be seen as ``under this cloud'' because of
his standing as a critic of special interests.
</P>
<P>
   McCain campaign officials also noted that two Globe reporters
covering McCain had also ridden on the broadcast industry jets with
him, and that they could attest that no lobbying were aboard. The
Globe story did not suggest that lobbying took place on the
flights, which are a common and legal, though disputed, way for
corporate interests to subsidize travel by public officials. (The
Globe pays all travel costs for its employees.)
</P>
<P>
   McCain used the Paxson jet four times, including on the day
before and the day after the Dec. 10 letter to the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was philosophical about the flap, and said it was a sign
that his presidential campaign was gaining credibility as he rose
in the polls. ``With increased traction you get increased
visibility'' and scrutiny from both the press and his opponents, he
said. In a town meeting in Bedford, he brought up the episode as an
illustration of how the pervasive influence of big money ``taints''
politics, and makes Americans suspicious and skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   That was also a theme of a luncheon address to the Boys &AMP; Girls
Club of Manchester, in which McCain deplored ``corrosive cynicism''
in American civic life.
</P>
<P>
   ``For too many Americans, the business of politics has become an
ugly spectacle,'' he said. ``The battle of bucks instead of ideas;
the dishonest attack ads; the smearing of personal reputations; the
lies we call spin _ all have contributed significantly to
disillusioning an entire generation about the value of public
service.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends, please do not think I claim some special virtue
among the candidates. I have failed far, far too often in my public
and private life to be the model of rectitude I try to be to my
children,'' McCain said. ``I cannot say that I am a better man than
my opponents. But I hope you believe that I take my
responsibilities to America seriously enough to honestly endeavor
to rise to the occasion before me.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking with reporters on his campaign bus, McCain used Vice
President Al Gore's attacks on former Senator Bill Bradley as an
example of tactics that exceeded the bounds of fair play, and that
thus demeaned all candidates. McCain vowed that no matter how hot
the political combat became, he would not give in and slash his
foes or distort their positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just isn't worth it,'' McCain said. ``I don't want to be
president that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   But a few hours later McCain was wincing at the rhetoric his
staff had used in a press release pounding the Bush tax plan. The
release tagged Bush for issuing a ``political plan for the 2000
election'' that was ``leaving Social Security in danger'' and using
60 percent of the federal budget surplus to reward the wealthiest
10 percent of Americans, ``like most of his top contributors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I deserve some static on that,'' McCain acknowledged. The
senator plans to detail his tax plan in a speech Tuesday in New
Hampshire.

CUBAN BOY, SYMBOL FOR EXILES, MUST BE RETURNED TO FATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A six-year-old boy who arrived on US shores as a
motherless refugee and became a political symbol for anti-Castro
exiles must be returned to his father in Cuba, immigration
authorities ruled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the choice of keeping Elian Gonzalez with relatives
in Miami, where the boy has been wooed with American toys and
theme-park visits, or returning him to his apparently distraught
father in Havana, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
decided the boy should go home by Jan. 14, INS commissioner Doris
Meissner told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This little boy, who has been through so much, belongs with
his father,'' Meissner told a news conference. ``The core issue
here is the bond between the parent and the child.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision was met with outrage by Cuban-Americans, who said
the youngster will suffer under the repressive communist regime of
Fidel Castro. Lawyers for the boy's family in Miami sent letters of
protest to Attorney General Janet Reno and President Clinton and
said they were prepared to file a court appeal if Reno and Clinton
spurn the Gonzalez family.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Castro demonstrators thronged the street near the local INS
office in Miami Wednesday, demanding that Elian be allowed to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is a sad day for the US Constitution . . . and for the
hopes and dreams of Elian's mother Elizabeth,'' who died with nine
other adults when their boat sank as they attempted to reach
Florida, said Roger Bernstein, representing the Miami Gonzalez
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants the boy to be separated from his father,'' said
Ninoska Perez of the Miami-based Cuban-American National
Foundation. ``But that little boy, by surviving two days on an
inner tube, has earned the right to stay here in freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, the government gave a guarded first response to the
INS ruling, warning against ``excessive optimism'' and predicting
``the Cuban-American mafia and the extreme right in the U.S.
Congress'' would still put up a fight to keep the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner said the INS decision was made after two lengthy
interviews with the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, a hotel
worker in Cardenas, Cuba, who Meissner said is anxious to have
Elian returned to him.
</P>
<P>
   Since the boy is so young, Meissner said, the natural father has
the right to speak for Elian.
</P>
<P>
   There is ``no information'' that Gonzalez, who was divorced from
Elian's mother, is an unfit father, nor that he has been coerced by
the Castro regime into pleading for his son's return, Meissner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer Eig, an attorney for the Gonzalez family in Miami, said
Meissner's assumptions were ``unconstitutional and untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian cannot apply for asylum from persecution by the Fidel
Castro government,'' Eig complained. ``If only his father, who is
under the control of the Fidel Castro regime, can do it for him . .
. that is deeply unfair and untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Meissner gave no reason for the Jan. 14 deadline, and it is
still unclear how Elian would be transported back to Cuba if the
Gonzalez family's appeals are unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   The INS offered three options: that Gonzalez come to pick up his
son, that the family in Miami take him to Cuba, or that a ``third
party'' escort the child to his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez _ perhaps under duress from the Castro regime _ has
indicated he does not want to travel to Miami, and there is ``no
way'' the Miami Gonzalezes will assist in sending Elian back to
Cuba, Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   Having a third party escort Elian frees the INS from the
politically uncomfortable spectacle of having to do the task
itself. The Cuban-American lobby is a locally powerful political
force few politicians want to provoke.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has sought to distance himself from the controversy from
the start. ``I told you when we started this I would do my best to
keep the decision out of politics,'' Clinton told reporters in the
Rose Garden Wednesday. ``We have done that.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Elian is forced to go back to Cuba, ``the Clinton-Gore
administration, specifically (Vice President) Al Gore, will pay a
high price in terms of votes in Florida,'' Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba experts and child custody lawyers said the INS ruling was
appropriate under the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's high time'' the boy was sent back to his birthplace, said
Wayne Smith, a former Clinton administration adviser on Cuba.
``This was a simple child custody case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every state court and every family court in the United States
would award custody to a surviving parent rather than a distant
relative who lives a more prosperous life,'' said David Abraham, a
professor at Miami Law School and expert in custody law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have the Disneylands and the Universal Studios and all
the things that were dangled before the little boy's eyes,''
Abraham added. ``But that's his home.''
</P>
<P>
   With the political implications so strong, it's unlikely the
case of Elian Gonzalez will be closed quickly, said Richard Nuccio,
a former Clinton administration Cuba adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``With two members of Congress representing Elian's family's
constituency, I don't see how Elian could be returned by the
federal government without it going through the court system,''
Nuccio said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NANJING, China _ Liu Jian was an idealistic new lawyer when his
Nanjing firm sent him to a rural town 200 miles away to represent a
local official accused of taking bribes.
</P>
<P>
   Stationed in the town, Binhai, he worked round-the-clock doing
what defense lawyers do to prepare for trial: interviewing
witnesses, examining documents and _ when police would allow _
brainstorming with his client.
</P>
<P>
   But when the court convened on July 13, 1998, almost none of the
37 witnesses he had lined up appeared to testify. The prosecutor
swore and ranted at Liu, calling him a criminal. And at trial's
end, outside Binhai's courthouse, Liu found himself in police
custody, charged with ``illegally obtaining evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Although legal experts around the country declared his
innocence, Liu spent a nightmarish five months in detention,
subjected at times to beatings and daylong interrogations without
food or rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was released on Dec. 11, and I've tried not to have any
contact with the criminal law since,'' said Liu, a thin, serious
man with a downtrodden air, whose son was born and whose mother had
a heart attack while he was in jail. ``I've really lost confidence
in the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, China has tried to dramatically overhaul
its legal system, training thousands of new lawyers and passing
laws that greatly expand their role in criminal cases _ for
example, for the first time giving defendants in detention the
right to a lawyer and allowing lawyers to conduct pretrial
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   But results have been mixed, especially in the country's vast
rural areas, where police, prosecutors and judges often chafe under
the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   And China's young lawyers have been at once a tremendous force
for change and also frequent victims: byproducts of a new legal
system that is far better established on paper than in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law has made great advances, but sometimes thinking has
not,'' said Li Baoyue, a criminal lawyer who also teaches at
Beijing's University of Politics and Law. ``It is going to be a
very difficult road ahead to get these new regulations
implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it is rare for lawyers to end up in prison, defense
lawyers say, it is common for them to suffer a barrage of problems,
insults and lesser slights like these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Police often refuse to let lawyers meet their clients in
private or in a timely manner, despite a law giving them access
within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lawyers are often not provided with legally guaranteed access
to court material, like transcripts of confessions, medical
examinations and witness lists.
</P>
<P>
   _ Intimidation of witnesses by the local police and prosecutors
often leaves lawyers with few people willing to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of these problems, it's sometimes hard to find a
lawyer for criminal cases,'' Li said, adding that the work can be
dangerous. ``Many lawyers are scared they could become implicated
in the case and lose their livelihood.'' Business law is much more
lucrative, and safer.
</P>
<P>
   Gu Yongzhong, a former criminal law specialist in Beijing who
now takes on criminal cases only occasionally, said: ``For the
amount of time it takes to prepare the case, it doesn't pay. And
it's very hard to get a not-guilty verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers agree that the obstacles are far greater in the rural
areas, where the legal training of judges and police is often
poorest. But some problems are more widespread, like the difficulty
in meeting defendants, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   One lawyer said that he had recently spent two weeks trying to
meet a client detained by the Beijing Public Security Bureau, which
repeatedly deflected requests and turned him away at the gates of
the detention center before finally allowing the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It usually take some time to get to see your clients,'' Gu
said. ``The law enforcement agencies are not willing at the start
because they are worried it will interfere with their
investigation. Although it seems to be getting somewhat better
lately.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Unfortunately, experts say, those first days of detention are
when some of the worst police abuses occur _ when defendants are
subjected to aggressive and sometimes brutal interrogation to
obtain confessions.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chinese law forbids torture, and confessions obtained
by torture cannot be used in court, Chinese officials acknowledge
that the practice is still widespread.
</P>
<P>
   The use of ``confession by torture remains unchecked,'' said a
recent commentary in the official China Youth Daily. ``It is
commonplace for citizens to be arbitrarily summoned, forcibly
seized, detained and even detained beyond legal time limits, and
for citizens whose freedom has been restricted to be treated
inhumanely.''
</P>
<P>
   Transcripts of police interrogations with recalcitrant suspects
often show breaks in the questioning marked by the words
``Education takes place,'' defense lawyers say. And when the
session resumes _ voila! _ a confession.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of torture to obtain a confession is something
defendants often raise, but it puts us in a very delicate situation
since we need facts and evidence to back up these claims,'' said
Sun Guoxiang, a prominent defense lawyer in Nanjing who helped
defend Liu. ``But it is very hard to gather evidence because it is
almost impossible to get access to clients at these times.''
</P>
<P>
   In Liu's case, the cultures of law and law enforcement
repeatedly clashed, as Liu reminded his captors of his legal
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Just a high school graduate, Liu became a lawyer through an
arduous self-study law program affiliated with Nanjing University,
while working full time designing furniture. The first professional
from a poor rural family, Liu regarded the law with a touch of awe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a career where I could help people, that had
meaning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was admitted to the bar in 1994, when officials in Beijing
were writing the new Criminal Procedure Code, which took effect in
October 1997. That code allows lawyers to formulate a defense by
conducting independent investigations during what prosecutors call
the ``investigative period,'' a stage that can last weeks if not
months, when a suspect is in detention but has not yet been
formally charged.
</P>
<P>
   But the police in Binhai had other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   On his first trip to Binhai, Liu said, he and a colleague from
his firm were never allowed to see their client, whose wife had
retained the firm. When a meeting was finally permitted on a
subsequent visit, they were given time only to ``exchange a few
words'' _ and these with the head of the county anticorruption
bureau listening.
</P>
<P>
   But a week before the trial, a longer meeting took place _ and
Liu discovered huge discrepancies between the bribery charges
brought by the prosecutors and the story told by the defendant, who
said he had been tortured into confessing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For the next week, Liu frantically _ and aggressively _ sought
out witnesses, many of whom contradicted the police and some of
whom said they had been threatened by local officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our impression wasn't that our client was totally innocent,''
Liu said, ``but we felt that the prosecution needed to provide
better evidence to make the charges stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the realist in him ``kind of expected'' a guilty
verdict because ``the prosecutor had a lot riding on the corruption
case,'' his lawyer side thought he might have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   That hope quickly dissipated once his witnesses failed to appear
_ except the defendant's wife and one nervous man who repeatedly
contradicted himself _ and the court struck down each point he
raised.
</P>
<P>
   Still, during closing arguments, Liu was ``shocked'' to hear the
prosecutor attacking not the defendant, but the defense team. The
prosecutor charged that Liu had broken the law: that he had
``deliberately induced witnesses to give false evidence'' and then
``presented testimony that he knew to be false to the court'' _
charges that Chinese legal experts have loudly protested.
</P>
<P>
   Li of the University of Politics and Law said, ``In certain
cases, when law enforcement bodies don't have a highly developed
legal mentality, they assume lawyers doing their professional work
are doing the bidding of villains.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that there was often tension between the rural police,
few of whom have gone beyond high school, and the better-educated,
relatively high-earning lawyers who enter their turf.
</P>
<P>
   After Liu was detained, he refused to eat for a day, to protest
a jailing he regarded as illegal. He repeatedly reminded the police
about the legal time limit on detention and his right to see a
lawyer, with little effect.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 10 days, he was not even allowed to contact his
own law firm, he said. For the entire five months in custody he was
not permitted to speak to his wife. He learned about the birth of
his son from a prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   In marathon interrogations, the police first urged him to
confess, then, when he demurred, ``reminded'' him that he had
``forced witnesses'' to change their testimony. Liu said they made
him stand for hours or beat him until his mouth filled with blood
when he refused to confirm their version of events. He said they
wrote out a confession for him, which he eventually read to a
camera.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts from Nanjing and Beijing rallied to his defense,
sending lawyers to defend him at his trial, set for October 1998,
and preparing statements declaring his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   He was grateful for their support, but ultimately dared not test
the system, deciding to plead guilty in exchange for a light
sentence, consisting of time served.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the mental pressure I was under, I was forced to
admit to their charges,'' he said. ``I thought, `I'm not going to
receive justice here.' I wanted to get out as soon as possible and
thought then I could set about clearing my name.''
</P>
<P>
   Liu is now appealing the judgment, although lawyers say that
with a videotaped confession he will have a hard time officially
clearing his name. Meantime, his criminal record bars him from
working as a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   It is a frustrating limbo for a man, now only 28, whom the
country's top defense lawyers have declared innocent. Late last
year, a panel of 12 legal experts concluded that while Liu's
actions were ``somewhat irregular'' they ``did not possess the
conditions for a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Liu's ``minor breaches'' were posing questions in a
leading manner and interviewing witnesses alone, said Sun Guoxiang,
his principal defense lawyer, noting that these were mostly a
result of his inexperience. It is standard practice in China for
two lawyers to be present at questioning, although Liu often worked
solo because his firm did not want to station two lawyers in such a
remote area.
</P>
<P>
   And though the case has been devastating for Liu Jian, Sun says
it demonstrates both the incipient power of the legal profession
and how far it has to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand I think he was freed as early as he was
because lawyers are gaining more respect and playing a bigger
role,'' he said. ``On the other, lawyers continue to face
difficulties, which are closely related to the quality of the law
enforcement and judicial services.''

CHINA TO RESUME HIGH-LEVEL MILITARY TIES WITH U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ China has agreed to resume high-level military
contacts with the United States, which it angrily suspended after
U.S. warplanes bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last May,
defense officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy chief of the People's Liberation Army's general
staff, Lt. Gen. Xiong Guangkai, is scheduled to arrive in
Washington on Jan. 24 for two days of talks that senior Pentagon
officials hope will revive regular contacts between the U.S. and
Chinese militaries.
</P>
<P>
   The main goal of the talks will be to arrange a series of
exchanges over the coming year, including visits to China first by
the commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific, Adm. Dennis Blair, and
then by Defense Secretary William Cohen, the officials said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal this year is to have a modest increase'' in military
contacts ``that acknowledges the delicacy of the environment,
politically, and to take careful steps given what has transpired,''
a senior defense official said.
</P>
<P>
   Although U.S. officials insisted that the bombing of the Chinese
embassy during NATO's air war against Yugoslavia was an unfortunate
accident, China rejected the explanation and suspended talks on
trade, human rights and military issues. Three Chinese were killed
and 27 injured in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chinese animosity began to ease after President
Clinton's meeting with President Jiang Zemin in New Zealand in
September and the Clinton administration's agreement in November on
terms for China's entrance to the World Trade Organization. In
December, the United States agreed to pay $28 million in
compensation for the damage to the embassy in Belgrade, clearing a
final hurdle to a resumption of military contacts. It had already
agreed on compensation for the Chinese victims and their families.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has long pressed the People's Liberation Army to
open itself to more high-level military contacts, including port
visits, officer exchanges and even, someday, joint military
exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials say that regular contact between the two
militaries can ease tensions in the region by providing better
insights into each side's strategic thinking and by building
confidence and personal relations among officers that can be called
on in the event of crises.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cohen, who visited China in January 1998, had planned to travel
there again last June only to have the trip canceled. Officials had
hoped Cohen could reschedule the trip as soon as this month, but
they now expect a visit later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the bombing of the embassy, the Pentagon's efforts
to forge a closer relationship with Chinese military leaders, like
the one that has developed with Russian officers, had moved slowly,
reflecting China's wariness over issues like the defense of Taiwan
and the proposed deployment of national and regional missile
defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   A significant resumption of military contacts could depend on
domestic politics in both countries.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's defense budget, Congress imposed a series of
restrictions on Pentagon relations with China's military, in part
because of allegations of Chinese espionage to obtain nuclear
secrets. The restrictions prohibit any contact or exchange that
would give Chinese officers ``inappropriate exposure'' to U.S.
military expertise in everything from logistics to defense against
chemical or biological attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the new restrictions would not prohibit any
of the contacts the Pentagon is now considering, such as a ``table
top,'' or simulated, military exercise involving a relief
operation.
</P>
<P>
   In China, too, many senior civilian and military officials
remain distrustful of U.S. military objectives in Asia. In recent
months, Pentagon officials have sensed a hardening of views toward
the United States in commentaries by Chinese military officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the rationales for more discussions and more
interactions between the United States and China is that at least
the Chinese interlocutors can experience the United States in a
slightly different way than they might pick up in some of their own
propaganda,'' the senior defense official said.

APPLE REACHES FOR STRONGER INTERNET PRESENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Steve Jobs, the architect of Apple Computer
Inc.'s dramatic turnaround, Wednesday said he would stay on at the
company's helm.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected disclosure, made to cheering crowds at the
semiannual Macworld, capped a series of product announcements by
Apple aimed at positioning the company more aggressively for the
Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs, who has been interim chief executive, said he would drop
``interim'' from the title he has held since he returned in 1997 to
help lead a revival of the company he co-founded. The announcement
stunned and delighted thousands who attended Jobs' keynote address
at Macworld.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs also unveiled a series of initiatives that he boldly
predicted will help make Apple ``one of the 10 most profitable
Internet companies.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the key initiatives is a multiyear alliance with
EarthLink Network Inc. of Pasadena, Calif., an Internet service
provider that has 3.5 million users. The deal calls for EarthLink
to become the ``default,'' or built-in ISP on every new Macintosh
computer. Apple will receive a fee for every Macintosh user that
signs up with EarthLink.
</P>
<P>
   To cement the relationship, Apple _ flush with $3 billion in
cash accumulated from its recent turnaround _ has also agreed to
invest $200 million for an equity stake in EarthLink.
</P>
<P>
   When Macintosh users log onto the Internet, Apple is hoping they
will visit the company's Web site _ www.apple.com _ which has been
refurbished to be a gateway to the Internet, similar to Yahoo or
Netscape. The site, which debuted Wednesday, allows visitors to
send electronic greeting cards and read Apple's reviews and ratings
of hundreds, and eventually thousands, of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Macintosh users will be able to send and receive e-mail from the
site, build a personal home page, and store files on the Internet,
all of which are hosted on Apple servers for free.
</P>
<P>
   The site also features ``KidSafe'' software that can be
downloaded without charge. The software lets children visit only
sites that have already received the KidSafe seal of approval.
Currently, 50,000 sites have that approval, and Apple has hired a
team of teachers and librarians to add more sites to the list at a
rate of 10,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   While the reviews and greeting cardsailable to all
visitors, only Macintosh users will be able to access the other
features, including KidSafe, e-mail, the home page builder and the
ability to store personal files on the Internet. These exclusive
functions will ``help draw more customers to the Mac platform,''
said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a consulting
firm in Campbell, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs also announced the next generation of its operating system
_ dubbed MacOS X, with the X denoting the number 10.
</P>
<P>
   The eagerly anticipated OS X software is expected to be
available as an upgrade this summer for 25 million current
Macintosh users, Jobs said. By January 2001, Apple will begin
shipping new Macintosh machines loaded with OS X, Jobs said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from being faster, OS X is designed to be more robust. To
show off OS X's reliability, Jobs ran two programs simultaneously _
a video clip and software called ``Bomb'' that was specifically
designed to crash. While Bomb succeeded in crashing, the video clip
continued. In MacOS 9, the entire computer likely would have been
brought down by one errant program.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have been waiting for this for 10 years,'' a
grinning Jobs said, later adding that OS X ``is our foundation for
the next decade of Mac operating systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple paraded half-dozen software executives on stage to declare
their allegiance to the new operating system. Among the companies
was the all-important Microsoft Corp., which announced new versions
of Internet Explorer, a Web browser currently installed on
Macintosh machines as part of an alliance Jobs forged with
Microsoft in 1997 to help revive Apple.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a new operating system, Apple has redesigned the
Macintosh on-screen ``look and feel.'' Buttons resemble drops of
water, pull-down menus are semitransparent, and windows sport
``shadows'' around the edges, among other design-oriented features.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on design has been a big part of Apple's revival
from the financial brink. Jobs returned to Apple as interim CEO,
taking only a $1 annual salary, and introduced the enormously
successful, hyperstylized iMac personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   Boosted by popularity of the iMac, Apple sold 1.35 million
computers in the last three months of 1999, Jobs said, more than
the company has ever sold in a single quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Jobs will be Apple's permanent CEO, he will continue
to spend one-third of his time as CEO of Pixar Animination Studios
in Richmond, Calif, a film studio he helped to found.
</P>
<P>
   While Jobs' announcements were clearly well received by Macworld
attendees who cheered on cue, many analysts continue to be
skeptical of Apple's future. The company remains a niche player in
the PC industry and its market share has continued to slip.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Enderle, an analyst with Giga Information Group in Santa
Clara, Calif., noted that the keynote was devoid of significant
releases of new Apple hardware.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very compelling talker,'' Enderle said. ``But the
announcements were all about software, and I see that largely as a
distraction from the fact that they didn't have any new hardware. A
key foundation of the company was missing from the discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple shares rose 1 1/2 yesterto 104.

FORTSON NOT BOXED IN BY HIS INJURED FOOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It should come as no surprise that Danny Fortson was
the last Celtic off the practice floor Wednesday. Off days on the
NBA schedule are a luxury for the big power forward.
</P>
<P>
   Fortson has already missed 25 games this season because of a
stress fracture in his right foot in November. In the five games
since his Dec. 26 return, Fortson has played 62 minutes, all off
the bench. That's not enough for Fortson, who was a starter in 38
of 50 games for Denver in 1998-1999. When the Celtics acquired him
in a trade with the Nuggets last summer there were a lot of high
hopes about Fortson being the key to Boston's success on the ``low
box.''
</P>
<P>
   The hopes are still there, says Fortson. Just give him some time
to reach a few of his goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel pressure from this situation,'' said Fortson
after an optional day of practice by the Celtics. ``But on the
other hand, I don't mind putting some pressure on myself. It's all
about playing. And I won't make excuses. I have to go out and play
my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortston says the couple of hours put in Wednesday at Brandeis
in Waltham was more about honing his skills than rehabilitation.
More about moving his 6-foot-7-inch, 260-pound frame around the
basket in a timely fashion to avoid fouls. Remembering the
techniques and advice stressed by coach Rick Pitino and knowing his
teammates are counting on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need this time to build my confidence in playing,'' said
Fortson. ``The toughest things for me is to get into the flow of
the game. I'm a very aggressive player and these new rules will
take some time for me to get used to them. And the only way for me
to learn is to be out there on the court as often as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortson's longest stint so far has been 17 minutes _ with no
pain in his right foot. He understands teammate Antoine Walker is
the key player and first scoring option in the low box. But if he
plays his game, Fortson says the opportunities will come and the
numbers will rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for me to sit and learn, and good to be a part of
the team again,'' said Fortson, who is averaging 4.2 rebounds and
6.0 points. ``The next thing is to go out and help the team gets
some wins. I can see what is going out by just watching the fellows
run plays and do things, listen to what coach is telling us to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Denver, it was a little different. They did a lot more
pick-and-rolls, a lot more standing around. Here, you're constantly
on the move, doing different things, setting screens, getting other
people open. I can play both ways. It's no problem. This is a lot
like my college system at Cincinnati. I'm used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doug Overton, point guard?
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the questions Pitino must answer before Friday
night's game at home against Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Overton was the only pure point guard left for Boston in the
closing minutes of its 96-88 loss to New York Tuesday. Kenny
Anderson (pulled left hamstring) was hurt after scoring 22 points
and Dana Barros (flu) never left Boston. Both are listed as
day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Overton, who filled in for nine minutes in the second half,
understands that if either is healthy, he might not get into a game
at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you have to always be ready when you get in there,'' he
said. ``You prepare yourself because you don't know how long you're
going to play, two minutes or 20. When you get a chance, you have
to go out and play as hard as you can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny is a slasher who can dribble the ball and score. Dana is
so quick and can get the ball back for a 3-pointer. He's great at
scoring. I'm just learning the system and look more to make sure we
move the ball around. That's why I though this was a good situation
for me to be in.''

<P>
   TAKAMATSU, Japan _ The ``ginza,'' or shopping street, of this
quintessential Japanese town on the island of Shikoku looks much
like the ginza of any other moderately sized city here.
</P>
<P>
   Covered to protect shoppers from rain, the thoroughfare is lined
with mom-and-pop stores selling everything from ramen to slippers.
</P>
<P>
   It is also home to one of the most successful Japanese branches
of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., which has placed the biggest, riskiest bet
so far in the effort by foreigners to sell ever-so-wary Japanese on
American-style asset management.
</P>
<P>
   ``In places like Takamatsu, Sendai, Mayabashi, we have really
built some momentum,'' said Ronald Strauss, head of Merrill's
retail operations here. ``If you had asked me a year ago whether
some branch in a place I'd never heard of would be our leader, I
would have laughed. But so much here depends on the branch manager
and his relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the ``thundering herd,'' as Merrill is known, had a
pronounced limp in Japan. Competitors and the news media were
clucking over chairman David Komansky's stunningly frank and gloomy
assessment of the firm's progress in building a retail business
here. Analysts wondered aloud why Merrill had not tackled Japan via
the Internet _ surely a less expensive, less risky route.
</P>
<P>
   But Merrill stuck to its original hunch that an old-fashioned
approach would work best, that a personal touch, a focus on the
whole customer, was far better than the bells and whistles of
electronic trading. And this approach seems to be paying off.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill, to be sure, got off to a rocky start. Losses were
greater and assets far harder to come by than it had expected when
it picked over the bones of the bankrupt Yamaichi Securities firm,
which it used to lay the foundation for its initial network of 33
branches.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's gossip-hungry magazines were filled with stories of mass
defections by unhappy brokers, and Merrill's branches always seemed
to be empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was rather difficult,'' conceded Kenichi Hayakawa, manager
of Merrill's branch in Sendai, Japan's 10th-largest city, about 200
miles north of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   But things have picked up. In April, the Sendai branch became
profitable, he said, and has now garnered more assets than Yamaichi
had collected there in 60 years. ``It's like being in a samurai
battle in which we've won one small castle,'' Hayakawa said
proudly.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Merrill hit a target of 1 trillion yen, or $9.59
billion, in assets, it has more than 60,000 clients, and it was
recently identified as one of the top places Japanese youth would
like to work for.
</P>
<P>
   The pickup in the Japanese stock market certainly helped,
Strauss said, but that is not the main reason for Merrill's
success.
</P>
<P>
   And as Japanese investors ponder where to put some $475 billion
in high-interest-rate deposits that will start maturing in April,
Merrill is perhaps best positioned to capture a good part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``While one may pick apart the initial projections for asset
gathering and break-even time, it is tough to dispute that the firm
is ahead of its U.S. peers in gaining a foothold,'' Joan Solotar,
an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, wrote recently in a
report. .
</P>
<P>
   Why? Precisely because of Merrill's presence in places like
Sendai and Takamatsu, the largest town on Shikoku, the smallest of
Japan's four main islands.
</P>
<P>
   What many skeptics seem to have overlooked is that this is
Japan, home of the world's most cautious investors. They were
burned badly in the stock market almost a decade ago, when the
Nikkei index plunged more than 60 percent in a little over two
years. Basic concepts like asset allocation, compound interest and
diversification are poorly understood here. Merrill brokers can
help explain these concepts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the government has for decades used a variety of
tax and other incentives to encourage saving and discourage
investing, so it seems unlikely that older Japanese, who hold the
bulk of the nation's wealth, would be raring to hop onto the World
Wide Web to invest.
</P>
<P>
   But the elderly do know that with government and private pension
funds vastly underfinanced, they will have to finance their own
retirements, while young families are keenly aware that housing
allowances and tuition credits subsidized by corporations are
things of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped I could live off the interest generated by my
savings, but Japanese interest rates are now at zero,'' said Mirei
Shoji, a 67-year-old customer in Sendai. ``I know stock and other
investments have risks, but they also have rewards, and that's a
chance I have to take.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was her former Yamaichi broker, Yoko Nitta, who brought Mrs.
Shoji to Merrill. ``I didn't know anything about Merrill Lynch, but
I trusted Nitta-san,'' Mrs. Shoji said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, she is pleased. ``When you deal with Japanese brokers,
it's like dealing with a cloud,'' she said. ``They bring you a
pamphlet touting a stock, that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   She waved around a dog-eared copy of a Merrill report on NEC
Corp. ``This is the most wonderful thing about Merrill,'' she said.
``The openness and the information is wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Shoji demonstrates, the skeptics have paid too little
attention to the premium placed on relationships in Japan,
face-to-face ties that deepen with time. Merrill's style of
catering to customers may seem outmoded by American standards, but
in Japan, where the stock market is regarded as little more than a
casino, the personal touch will be needed to lure money out of
government-insured bank accounts and the family chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in making a huge profit,'' said Kensaku
Yano, the 84-year-old founder of a regional supermarket chain that
went public a few years ago. ``I just want a good, trusting
relationship with my broker.''
</P>
<P>
   Yano was one of the first to open an account at Merrill in
Takamatsu. He had had an account at the local Yamaichi branch and
still has accounts at other brokerages as well.
</P>
<P>
   But he gets better treatment at Merrill, he said, adding that
Japanese brokers urge him to trade stocks almost daily to generate
commissions. ``I lost so much money at Nikko Securities because
they put me in such bad stocks that my broker there gave me seven
shares of NTT DoCoMo to try to make up for it,'' Yano said, using
the popular name for NTT Mobile Communications Network Corp.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, those NTT shares did well _ they are now worth
roughly $239,000 _ but he closed his account at Nikko anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Such eyebrow-raising practices are the way most Japanese expect
to do business with brokers, and convincing them that Merrill is
any different has been a tough sell.

NO BACKING DOWN FOR BELICHICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ After a night's reflection, he had no regrets,
no remorse, no apparent alternative, and no clue about the future.
At least none that he was willing to share.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by phone from his Long Island home Wednesday afternoon,
Bill Belichick basically repeated himself. He just did so with a
lot more poise and assurance than he had displayed Tuesday when he
dropped an anvil on the New York Jets by renouncing their head
coaching position 24 hours after he had been automatically promoted
from assistant head coach _ as contractually stipulated _ upon the
retirement of his NFL guru, Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a day to sit back and take it all in, I feel really
good about it,'' said Belichick, a 25-year NFL veteran who finds
himself unemployed _ for the moment, at least _ at the age of 47.
``I would have had to start this job at 9 Wednesday morning, and I
wasn't ready to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, of course, weren't ready for him not to do it, and
they intend to hold Belichick to his contractual obligation, as
sanctioned by commissioner Paul Tagliabue. Beyond that, they were
confounded. After Belichick's unsettling public soul-searching at
the press conference that was supposed to serve as his introduction
as head coach, club president Steve Gutman expressed the opinion
that the resignation announcement reflected a man battling
personal, not professional, conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, said Belichick Wednesday. ``I feel pretty good right
now,'' he reiterated. ``I don't know what that was in reference
to.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in reference to Belichick's incessant insistence that he
was leaving because the ownership situation remains unresolved
seven months after Leon Hess's death, that he doesn't want his
family to endure the tumult they suffered during his lone head
coaching experience, in Cleveland. At the end of Belichick's fifth
year, owner Art Modell pulled up stakes for Baltimore and left his
coach to walk the plank.
</P>
<P>
   Conspiracy theorists maintain that Belichick was motivated this
time not by fear of the unknown, but by a desire for greater
control and cash in the form of the coach/general manager duties
the New England Patriots want to discuss with him _ though they are
prohibited from doing so, along with every other club, by
Tagliabue's edict.
</P>
<P>
   Sticking to his story, Belichick said his contract, which agent
Neil Cornrich is appealing to the NFL, though he has yet to file a
grievance, ``is not really a big concern. It's more about the
situation now'' _ specifically, the prospect of TV tycoon Charles
Dolan or pharmaceutical scion Robert Wood Johnson III as Hess's
successor. ``New people come in, make changes, things get tossed
and turned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's one thing Belichick claimed he hadn't been doing, though
he was characteristically tight-lipped on matters other than the
immediate situation. He refused to discuss his season as a Patriots
assistant (1996) or his head coaching tenure with the Browns
(1991-95), saying, ``I know what the speculation is and I don't
think it's appropriate to speculate on other teams. What happened
concerns the Jets.''
</P>
<P>
   As for whether he thought his shocking turnaround would ruin his
relationship with Parcells, his boss for 14 years, Belichick said,
``You'd have to ask him.'' Belichick hasn't. Parcells was
incommunicado.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells was incommunicado after meeting with the Jets assistant
coaches _ Belichick's would-be staff _ Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the likelihood that his abrupt departure had created
irreparable ill will with his employers of the past three years,
Belichick said, ``I was not ready to coach the club Wednesday. I
tried to be as honest with them as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics wonder about that, but Belichick has one unabashed, if
equally stunned, supporter: his father, Steve.
</P>
<P>
   About to turn 81 Friday and retired for a decade after spending
33 years as a Navy assistant coach, Steve Belichick and his wife,
Jeannette, watched their son's announcement on TV from their home
in Annapolis, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't talked to him for a week,'' said Steve. ``We sat
and watched ESPN all day and night. We saw what they showed. We
were shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steve Belichick is more than willing to take his son at his
word. Speaking from a career football man's perspective, he said,
``Being an NFL coach is the toughest damn job in the country, the
scrutiny you go through.''
</P>
<P>
   More than that, he believes Bill's experience in Cleveland was
traumatizing. Though Modell was considered an indulgent owner,
giving Belichick autonomy regarding football and scouting matters,
the taciturn coach was never embraced. His drafts were indifferent
at best, his team made the playoffs just once in five years, he had
an acrimonious relationship with the Cleveland press, and he was
reviled after benching local icon Bernie Kosar, effectively ending
the veteran quarterback's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he went through with Kosar was bad enough,'' said Steve.
</P>
<P>
   And the Browns' exodus to Baltimore was unendurable.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people, even my wife, don't realize is the severity of
the situation in Cleveland,'' said the elder Belichick. ``It
impacted the hell out of him and his children. He's a very strong
family man, and he won't put his family through anything like that
again.''
</P>
<P>
   While he accepts the prima facie evidence of Tuesday's press
conference, Steve Belichick easily could envision his son returning
to Massachusetts, because since adolescence, Bill has been smitten
by all things New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beats the hell out me why,'' said Steve. ``He grew up in the
South. When he was in junior high, he started going with some
friends to Nantucket. I said, `Where the hell is Nantucket?' ''
</P>
<P>
   He knows now. Bill owns three summer homes on the island _ a
large one for himself, his wife, and three children, flanked by
smaller abodes where the senior Belichicks and Bill's in-laws spend
part of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   But the attraction still seemed whimsical when Bill was a high
school senior and Steve asked him where he wanted to attend
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New England,'' said the son.
</P>
<P>
   ``New England? You don't even know where the hell New England
is,'' sputtered Steve, apparently assuming that Nantucket had
seceded.
</P>
<P>
   But, humoring his only child, Steve took him on a tour of the
region's institutions of higher learning _ Vermont and Williams and
Amherst and Boston College and Harvard and Yale and Brown. Finally,
Bill made his decision: He wanted to attend a year of prep school.
Steve couldn't for the life of him fathom why; his son's college
board scores were almost off the charts and further grooming for
college seemed superfluous. But a postgraduate year it was _ at
Phillips Academy in Andover, where one of Bill's schoolmates was
John Hess, son of the Jets owner.
</P>
<P>
   And when Bill finally settled on a college, he didn't stray far,
attending that football factory, Wesleyan University in Middletown,
Conn. He majored in economics, but in the second semester of his
senior year, Bill told his father he wanted to follow in his
footsteps along the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   He took a path that brought him two Super Bowl rings as
Parcells's chief adviser with the New York Giants before the
unfortunate Cleveland experience. Then came an idyllic reunion with
Parcells on the Patriots, who made it to the 1997 Super Bowl before
the head coach bolted to the Jets and his top aide followed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Belichick's relationship with Robert Kraft was the
anthithesis of the prickly union between Parcells and the Patriots
owner, who wanted to retain him at the time. And the Belichicks
savored their handsome home in Weston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He very much enjoyed the Patriots,'' said Belichick's father.
``Of course, getting out of Cleveland, he may well have enjoyed
coaching in Mexico City.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyperbole aside, New England doesn't occupy the sole
geographical tender spot in the phlegmatic Belichick's heart. He
relished his time with the Giants because of the lure of New York
City, according to Steve, and his son's family is equally
comfortable in its current location.
</P>
<P>
   So abdicating the day after his elevation by the Jets seemed
illogical unless there was an underlying rationale. Steve Belichick
understands the suspicions, but he also understands his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were real hungry for a job _ the average guy would jump
at the chance to coach in New York,'' said Steve. ``But the average
guy doesn't know what Bill went through in Cleveland. He wants to
have a situation where he has a little control of what's going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearances aside, Belichick senior believes his son was in
complete control Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was nervous,'' acknowledged Steve. ``It's not his strong
point, getting up there and talking.''
</P>
<P>
   But he scoffs at Gutman's theory concerning subliminal demons.
</P>
<P>
   ``That day hasn't been or that day will not arrive,'' Steve
Belichick emphatically assured the doubters, ``when Bill
experiences inner turmoil.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if he did, it certainly didn't seem to linger
overnight.

 TAKAMATSU, Japan: tough sell.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The typical office of a Japanese brokerage resembles an
off-track betting parlor, with clusters of older men sitting around
chain-smoking and watching a big screen flashing stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Asset management is an alien concept, with a heavy reliance on
``churning,'' moving clients in and out of stocks rapidly, whether
it makes sense or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical Japanese client has gotten an impression that
investing is sitting around and watching the board, buying a stock
one day, selling it the next, maybe making money and maybe losing a
lot,'' said Hidekazu Yoshimoto, manager of Merrill's Takamatsu
branch.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, though, Merrill wants clients' assets to grow,
since bigger assets mean bigger fees. That requires brokers to have
a certain understanding of clients' financial profiles, how much
they already have invested in other securities, whether or not they
have mortgages, what their goals and aspirations are.
</P>
<P>
   In privacy-mad Japan, getting that kind of information is a
challenge. ``It's difficult to drop in on a client and say, `So,
what have you got in the way of assets?''' Yoshimoto said.
</P>
<P>
   Many potential clients thought that Merrill wanted to know too
much, that its fledgling brokers were too insistent on obtaining
information, and it cost Merrill business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clients are still very accustomed to the ways of traditional
Japanese securities firms,'' Yoshimoto said. ``When they receive a
call from a broker, they expect to hear about new products, but
we're telling them about new services and ways they can manage
their money to build value. I think it was a bit of a severe
culture shock.''
</P>
<P>
   One client was so skeptical when Yoshimoto told him Merrill had
abolished the flashing screen from its branches that he drove
halfway around Shikoku Island to see for himself. Satisfied, he
deposited 100 million yen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of clients we've signed up have never had
accounts at a securities firm before,'' Yoshimoto said. ``They're
looking at how low interest rates are and worrying about the
future, when they'll have to pay for retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Yamaichi brokers who joined Merrill have also had to
adapt: to managing assets rather than pushing stocks; to a pay
system based increasingly on performance; to new responsibility,
and even to a new freedom. Many have left, grumbling, but others,
particularly women, have embraced the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can say no to no-good products,'' said Seiko Takahashi, a
financial consultant at Merrill's Sendai branch who had worked part
time at Yamaichi. ``We can honestly say what we think. It's a great
feeling, a feeling like you're clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Her advice would have saved one of her more reckless clients,
Soichiro Miura, quite a bit of money, had he listened. ``I told him
not to purchase Sansui,'' she said. ``I said no three times, and
when he overrode me the fourth time, I told him, well, if you want
to throw your money into the sewer, go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   He did. ``I lost a lot of money,'' Miura said. ``But next time,
maybe I'll listen more carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Miura, a dentist, is a typical Japanese investor. He has dabbled
in futures and options and more exotic investments and lost plenty.
He has even tried his hand at online trading. ``I bought a PC in
1998,'' he said. ``I didn't know what to do with it, but my friend
was interested in stocks and trading stocks on line. I got so
submerged in trading on line and all the information you can get on
line that I couldn't go to sleep, so I had to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   He regards equity investing as gambling, he said, but he was
attracted to Merrill by its pledge to help him accumulate assets.
He met with Mrs. Takahashi and liked what he heard. She supplies
him with quarterly reports on companies, faxes him updates, sends
him Merrill's research and calls him when the market makes any big
move.
</P>
<P>

CUBAN BOY, SYMBOL FOR EXILES, MUST BE RETURNED TO FATHER 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A six-year-old boy who arrived on US shores as a
motherless refugee and became a political symbol for anti-Castro
exiles must be returned to his father in Cuba, immigration
authorities ruled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the choice of keeping Elian Gonzalez with relatives
in Miami, where the boy has been wooed with American toys and
theme-park visits, or returning him to his apparently distraught
father in Havana, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
decided the boy should go home by Jan. 14, INS commissioner Doris
Meissner told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This little boy, who has been through so much, belongs with
his father,'' Meissner told a news conference. ``The core issue
here is the bond between the parent and the child.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision was met with outrage by Cuban-Americans, who said
the youngster will suffer under the repressive communist regime of
Fidel Castro. Lawyers for the boy's family in Miami sent letters of
protest to Attorney General Janet Reno and President Clinton and
said they were prepared to file a court appeal if Reno and Clinton
spurn the Gonzalez family.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Castro demonstrators thronged the street near the local INS
office in Miami Wednesday, demanding that Elian be allowed to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is a sad day for the US Constitution . . . and for the
hopes and dreams of Elian's mother Elizabeth,'' who died with nine
other adults when their boat sank as they attempted to reach
Florida, said Roger Bernstein, representing the Miami Gonzalez
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants the boy to be separated from his father,'' said
Ninoska Perez of the Miami-based Cuban-American National
Foundation. ``But that little boy, by surviving two days on an
inner tube, has earned the right to stay here in freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, the government gave a guarded first response to the
INS ruling, warning against ``excessive optimism'' and predicting
``the Cuban-American mafia and the extreme right in the U.S.
Congress'' would still put up a fight to keep the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner said the INS decision was made after two lengthy
interviews with the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, a hotel
worker in Cardenas, Cuba, who Meissner said is anxious to have
Elian returned to him.
</P>
<P>
   Since the boy is so young, Meissner said, the natural father has
the right to speak for Elian.
</P>
<P>
   There is ``no information'' that Gonzalez, who was divorced from
Elian's mother, is an unfit father, nor that he has been coerced by
the Castro regime into pleading for his son's return, Meissner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer Eig, an attorney for the Gonzalez family in Miami, said
Meissner's assumptions were ``unconstitutional and untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian cannot apply for asylum from persecution by the Fidel
Castro government,'' Eig complained. ``If only his father, who is
under the control of the Fidel Castro regime, can do it for him . .
. that is deeply unfair and untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Meissner gave no reason for the Jan. 14 deadline, and it is
still unclear how Elian would be transported back to Cuba if the
Gonzalez family's appeals are unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   The INS offered three options: that Gonzalez come to pick up his
son, that the family in Miami take him to Cuba, or that a ``third
party'' escort the child to his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez _ perhaps under duress from the Castro regime _ has
indicated he does not want to travel to Miami, and there is ``no
way'' the Miami Gonzalezes will assist in sending Elian back to
Cuba, Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   Having a third party escort Elian frees the INS from the
politically uncomfortable spectacle of having to do the task
itself. The Cuban-American lobby is a locally powerful political
force few politicians want to provoke.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has sought to distance himself from the controversy from
the start. ``I told you when we started this I would do my best to
keep the decision out of politics,'' Clinton told reporters in the
Rose Garden Wednesday. ``We have done that.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Elian is forced to go back to Cuba, ``the Clinton-Gore
administration, specifically (Vice President) Al Gore, will pay a
high price in terms of votes in Florida,'' Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba experts and child custody lawyers said the INS ruling was
appropriate under the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's high time'' the boy was sent back to his birthplace, said
Wayne Smith, a former Clinton administration adviser on Cuba.
``This was a simple child custody case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every state court and every family court in the United States
would award custody to a surviving parent rather than a distant
relative who lives a more prosperous life,'' said David Abraham, a
professor at Miami Law School and expert in custody law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have the Disneylands and the Universal Studios and all
the things that were dangled before the little boy's eyes,''
Abraham added. ``But that's his home.''
</P>
<P>
   With the political implications so strong, it's unlikely the
case of Elian Gonzalez will be closed quickly, said Richard Nuccio,
a former Clinton administration Cuba adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``With two members of Congress representing Elian's family's
constituency, I don't see how Elian could be returned by the
federal government without it going through the court system,''
Nuccio said.

HARVARD PILGRIM OFFICIALS SAY PLAN SIMPLY GOT TOO BIG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Attempting to explain how New England's flagship HMO
sailed itself right onto the financial shoals, Harvard Pilgrim
Health Plan officials Wednesday likened their mistake to an ocean
liner steering a degree or two off-course _ with a broken compass.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson, they said, is that bigger is not better in health
care _ a conclusion that repudiates a 1990s-era scramble for
endless growth in health plans and ever-bigger networks of medical
care providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We created complexity for ourselves on both sides,'' Harvard
Pilgrim chief executive Charles Baker said in an interview. ``In
the end, the simpler your organization in this business, the better
your chances to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   The startling news Wednesday that the 1.3 million-member HMO has
been placed in court-ordered receivership, rendering its future
uncertain, unleashed a flood of anxiety about the region's, and
even the nation's, health care system.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers worried about whether their HMO, the largest and
oldest in New England, would continue to be there for them.
Massachusetts hospitals, owed hundreds of millions of dollars by
Harvard Pilgrim, warned they were in no position to shoulder the
burden of the HMO's turnaround. Academics spun gloomy scenarios.
Presidential candidates weighed in. The New Hampshire insurance
commissioner advised Harvard Pilgrim subscribers in her state to
shop for other health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim executives sought to calm the fears with
assurances that subscribers ``will continue to receive care and
coverage.'' Governor Cellucci disparaged panicky talk of a health
care crisis, preferring the phrase, ``a national uncertainty in
health care.''
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety stemmed from Harvard Pilgrim accountants' discovery
on Monday, the first business day of the year 2000, that the HMO
had accumulated close to $60 million in unnoticed debt in 1999.
Combined with $109 million in previously projected losses and
another $9.5 million write-off of debt from Harvard Pilgrim's
bankrupt Rhode Island operations, the year-end operating losses may
total $177 million.
</P>
<P>
   Monday evening Baker informed Massachusetts insurance
commissioner Linda Ruthardt of the disquieting discovery, and asked
for a meeting the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   As Baker and his lieutenants were meeting with Ruthardt and her
staff on Beacon Hill Tuesday morning, no one else in the HMO knew
what was about to happen. In fact, several hundred Harvard Pilgrim
staffers were packed into a previously scheduled celebration of
their efforts in turning around the beleaguered HMO's financial
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Not only had 1999 operating losses ballooned far beyond
projections, but Baker and his colleagues told state officials that
the HMO's so-called ``statutory reserves'' _ the amount of liquid
assets that can be called upon to make up for operating losses _
could plummet to minus-$100 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers set off a rapid series of emergency measures: A
Supreme Judicial Court order putting Harvard Pilgrim in
receivership so clamoring creditors couldn't sink it, and a
cancellation of bond issues totalling hundreds of millions of
dollars that was planned to put the Harvard Pilgrim ship on an even
keel.
</P>
<P>
   Closing on a sale of $120 million in Harvard Pilgrim bonds, plus
an unspecified but substantial portion of another $90 million
planned bond issue, was scheduled for next Tuesday. The Harvard
Pilgrim accounting errors were discovered while accountants were
preparing final papers for the bond sales.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ciolek, executive director of the Massachusetts Health
and Educational Facilities Authority, which was sponsoring the
Harvard Pilgrim bond sale, said buyers had been signed up for the
bonds, despite the HMO's undesirable credit rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a situation where there's a material misstatement of the
numbers, you cannot in good conscience go forward,'' Ciolek said
Wednesday. ``But I don't think this deal is completely dead yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday Baker and other Harvard Pilgrim officials soberly
tried to explain how the HMO had accumulated close to $60 million
in unnoticed debt last year. Most of it, they said, was due to
underestimates of how much the health plan was spending
month-to-month on medical care.
</P>
<P>
   The rest was due to the HMO's erroneous assumption about the lag
between the time medical services are rendered to Harvard Pilgrim
subscribers and the date on which they are billed and paid _ an
interval that lengthened last year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what types of medical expenses were larger than expected,
Baker said nothing stands out. The HMO's disastrous miscalculations
``involved very small errors in very big numbers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place processes $200 million in medical expenses a
month,'' Baker added. ``So if you make a one percent mistake in the
way you're reporting your incurred medical expenses, you're talking
about $24 million over a 12-month period. You need to make sure you
get the numbers exactly right.''
</P>
<P>
   Some questioned Wednesday whether the erroneous 1999 assumptions
have already been built into Harvard Pilgrim's 2000 budget,
rendering questionable its projections that the HMO would sharply
reduce its operating losses by this year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on that now,'' Baker said. ``I don't believe the
impact on the 2000 budget will be that material because we had made
some conservative assumptions about medical expenses in 2000. The
bottom line is there is some impact, but it will be nominal.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim officials say two major factors drove the HMO to
its present state:
</P>
<P>
   _ Failure to integrate and simplify its computer systems,
financial management, insurance offerings, and contracts with
health care providers when the former Harvard Community Health Plan
engaged in a series of mergers and acquisitions beginning in 1986
and culminating in its merger with Pilgrim Health Care five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, cost trends were not viewed clearly and premiums
were not set at an adequate level to cover the costs,'' said Alan
Raymond, the HMO's spokesman. ``I don't know if we know when the
lines crossed, but it was probably in 1997 sometime.''
</P>
<P>
   _ An aggressive strategy of pursuing subscriber growth, within
Massachusetts and beyond, often cutting premiums below costs to win
customers from other insurers and expand market share.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't make up in volume what you're losing on each member
that you enroll,'' Raymond said. ``Whether it was the
aggressiveness of the growth strategy or that medical trends were
not detected soon enough that led to premiums being too low and
substantial losses as a result, I don't know that anyone could say
for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said Harvard Pilgrim made its own mistakes, but that its
current plight stands as an epitaph for an era when US policymakers
at the national and state level embraced the marketplace and
untrammeled competition as the solution to spiraling health care
costs, following the collapse of President Clinton's health care
plan in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Baker was a prominent exponent of market
solutions in health care as a cabinet official in the Weld and
Cellucci administrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say the marketplace paradigm failed, or played itself
out,'' said Michael Miller, policy director of the Massachusetts
consumer advocacy group Health Care for All. ``If we can't let
these organizations fail _ and I don't think we should let Harvard
Pilgrim fail _ then isn't there an argument for regulating them in
the public interest?''
</P>
<P>
   Ciolek, from his vantage point as a capital-raiser for health
care institutions, seemed to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commonwealth's health care system is in complete
disarray,'' he said. ``There is hardly an element that is in good
shape. If one result'' of the Harvard Pilgrim receivership ``is a
growing awareness that there has to be a much more active
involvement of the commonwealth in an industry that provides
hundreds of thousands of jobs and health care services, I think
that might turn out to be a good thing.''

   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HANK-GREENBERG-FILM (Undated) _ ``The Life and Times of Hank
Greenberg,'' a new documentary by Aviva Kempner, of the great
Detroit Tigers slugger. Aviva Kempner and her brother, Jonathan,
knew of Greenberg from their father, Harold, who left Lithuania for
Pittsburgh in 1925 and settled in Detroit. To Harold Kempner,
baseball was a ritual of American assimilation and Greenberg a
symbol. By Richard Sandomir. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LUCIE-AUBRAC-VIDEO (Undated) _ In 1943 in Lyon, France, at the
height of the Nazi occupation, a man jailed for buying sugar and
noodles on the black market gets a note from his wife. ``A third
night without you in a big, hopelessly cold bed,'' it reads.
Nothing like a little Gallic news from home to rally a man.
Unfortunately, Raymond (Daniel Auteuil) is suspected by the state
attorney of belonging to the Resistance, which means he won't be
curling up with Lucie (Carole Bouquet) for quite a while, if ever.
It is at this point that we begin to appreciate the differences
between a thriller from the French director Claude Berri, a student
of the intensely personal in ``Jean de Florette'' and ``Manon of
the Spring,'' and the standard commotion on American screens. By
Peter M. Nichols. (Moved).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FEDERAL-THEATER-PROJECT (New York) _ Hallie Flanagan
(1890-1969), who headed the Federal Theater Project in its brave
and troubled existence, deserves better. The movie ``Cradle Will
Rock,'' treats her deservedly as a heroine of America's one effort
to create what she envisioned as a free, adult, uncensored theater.
But in trying to reproduce the commotions of the 1930s, the film
director, Tim Robbins, captured by nostalgia for the left,
diminishes her accomplishment. By Walter Goodman. (Moved).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WRONG-MOUNTAIN-THEATER (New York) _ David Hirson's second play,
``Wrong Mountain,'' will open on Thursday at Eugene O'Neill
Theater. His first play ``La Bete,'' set in 17th-century France,
opened at the same theater on Feb. 10, 1991, and very shortly
became one of the most famous flops in Broadway history. ``Wrong
Mountain,'' directed by Richard Jones, who also directed ``La
Bete,'' makes demands on the audience to see in the lives of
artists, reflections of their own existential problems. This time
Hirson's play has a contemporary setting, and it is written in
nonrhyming prose, the story of Henry Dennett, 60, an embittered,
unappreciated poet who, infuriated by the presumption of his
ex-wife's new boyfriend, a popular playwright named Guy Halperin,
makes a bet that he can write a play and have it produced. By Bruce
Weber. (Moved). Photo.  &QL;

<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MARILYN-HORNE-MUSIC (New York) _ Marilyn Horne has been worried
about the song recital for some time. As an art form the song
recital has been languishing, she says, which is why seven years
ago she set up a foundation to do something about it. Ms. Horne
speaks of the problem with considerable authority. Besides being
one of the great operatic mezzo-sopranos in history, she has been
an devoted recitalist. She lost count of total number of recitals
she has given when the tally topped 1,300 a few years back. By
Anthony Tommasini. (Moved). Photo.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSTRIDGE-MUSIC (Undated) _ Not since Peter Pears faded from the
spotlight in the 1970s has an English tenor garnered more attention
than Ian Bostridge. Suddenly, this redoubtable 35-year-old seems
everywhere on CD, capturing the interest of music lovers throughout
Europe and America. And though some mavens have demurred, the hype
has been buttressed by albums remarkable for both artistic quality
and repertorial variety. By David Mermelstein. (Moved).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   20TH-CENTURY-MUSIC (Undated) _ The 20th century was, in musical
terms, a noisy one. I don't mean loud or even discordant, the
customary complaints of audiences encountering new music, whether
Igor Stravinsky's ``Rite of Spring,'' John Coltrane's ``Ascension''
or Jimi Hendrix's Woodstock rendition of the national anthem. I'm
referring, rather, to the way that 20th-century composers have
embraced sounds _ environmental, industrial, often random _ and
thereby laid siege to inherited notions of musical order. If last
century's avant-garde taught us anything, it is that such
disturbances can be the stuff of art. By Adam Shatz. (Moved).  &QL;

<P>
   ENSOR-ART(Brussels, Belguim) _ By the time James Ensor
celebrated his 30th birthday, in 1890, he was already an
exceptional painter. Equally comfortable with portraits, still
lifes, domestic interiors and seascapes, he had learned what he
wanted from his French Impressionist contemporaries and was now
going his own way. Yet, when he died in 1949, aged 89, he was a
relatively marginal figure, regarded as something of an eccentric
by his fellow Belgians and known abroad principally for the
sinister masked figures and skeletons that peopled many of his
paintings, drawings and etchings. But talented he was, above all in
his early years, as quickly becomes apparent in a major
retrospective of his work, organized by the Royal Museums of Fine
Arts of Belgium and on display at the Museum of Ancient Art in
Brussels through Feb. 13. By Alan Riding. (Moved).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MCCLEERY-BIRDS-ART (Undated) _ Dr. James M. McCleery, a
collector of stamps and coins since childhood, redirected his focus
in 1963 to buying decorative bird carvings and, later, to acquiring
vintage American decoys. His carved birds will be auctioned at
Sotheby's in New York. The 450 lots of decoys and 180 lots of
duck-calling instruments, traps, shell boxes, prints and baskets
will be auctioned on Jan. 22 and 23. The sale is expected to total
$5 million to $6 million. By Rita Reif. (Moved).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   METROPOLITAN-MUSEUM (New York) _ If asked to say what you love
about the Metropolitan Museum of Art, you might think of mummies or
shining armor or old-master paintings in curly gold frames. You
might even think of the grand central staircase, which, when you
descend it, makes you feel like an affluent if doomed character in
a turn-of-the-last-century Edith Wharton novel. But you probably
wouldn't think of contemporary art. Virtually since it opened in
1870, the Met has been accused of snubbing the art of the present.
By Deborah Solomon. (Moved).  &QL;

   TV-ELEANOR-ROOSEVELT (Undated) _ Monday at 9 p.m., PBS
inaugurates the 12th season of the ``American Experience'' series

the woman who was widely considered among the finest politicians of
the 20th century. By Kathryn Shattuck. (Moved).  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Revving up its pursuit of stock fraud on the Internet, the
Securities and Exchange Commission charged one of the Web's
best-known stock pickers with four counts of fraud, alleging on
Wednesday that he enriched himself at his customers' expense, lied
about his past returns and secretly accepted payment in exchange
for recommending one company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   The case, against Yun Soo Oh Park, known to his stock trading
disciples as Tokyo Joe, is the most aggressive regulatory action to
date against a Web guru. With his salty tongue, fiery temper and
bull market swagger, Park found the Internet a perfect medium.
</P>
<P>
   He describes his stock trading technique on his Web site this
way: ``We go for instant gratification. We believe that every stock
has a Unabomer lurking to take it down. We take our profit and move
on.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to the SEC's civil complaint, Park profited
perhaps more regularly than his disciples.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Lee Sorkin, Park's lawyer, sees a battle shaping up over his
client's right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to defend against the charges,'' he said. ``I would
have hoped that the SEC would have dealt with these types of issues
such as free speech and the exchange of information over the
Internet through regulation and not litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of Park's prominence on the Web and the nature of the
SEC charges, the case will be watched closely by securities
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new case in a new area in which old principles of
the law need to be applied,'' said Floyd Abrams, a partner at
Cahill Gordon &AMP; Reindel in New York and an expert in First
Amendment law. ``The position of the SEC is not ridiculous and
cannot be blown away by hoisting a First Amendment banner, but the
case does raise a serious First Amendment issue involving the
continued availability of the Web as a place where people can speak
broadly in an uninhibited manner about topics including the stock
market.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Internet reshaping the way investors buy and sell
stocks, regulators say the case shows that their fraud-fighting
arsenal remains powerful even in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the Internet has provided a new medium to commit fraud,
it has also revolutionized the ability of regulators to respond
quickly and effectively,'' said Richard H. Walker, director of
enforcement at the SEC. ``Fraud on the Internet happens in plain
view. For the first time we are able to spot fraud as it unfolds
from behind our desktop computers.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the civil suit, filed in U.S. District Court in
Chicago, Park violated securities laws on numerous occasions
between June 1998 and July 1999. He repeatedly recommended stocks
and advised his almost 4,000 customers to hold for several days or
until the shares reached a specific target price.
</P>
<P>
   As the hordes rushed to buy the stock, pushing up the price with
their orders, Park would sell his shares, even if they had not
reached his target price, according to the complaint. By not
disclosing that he was selling his shares as he was telling others
to buy, a technique known as scalping, regulators say Park
committed securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the SEC said, Park accepted 100,000 shares of DCGR
International Holdings Inc., a cigar maker and owner of an Italian
style delicatessen in Boca Raton, Fla., in exchange for
recommending it to his followers in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Because Park did not advise his customers that he had received
stock in exchange for his recommendation, he defrauded them,
regulators say. Furthermore, Park sold his shares for a gain after
urging his customers to buy the stock, according to the complaint.
DCGR was trading around $4 when Park recommended it; the shares
recently traded at 1 cent.
</P>
<P>
   Although Park has not registered as an investment adviser with
the SEC, the complaint alleges that he serves as an adviser to his
large following and is therefore subject to the same standards. By
recommending stocks to his members as he was selling and by
accepting compensation to promote a stock without disclosing it,
Park violated the Investment Advisers Act, according to regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Park did post a disclaimer on his Web site stating that he ``may
have positions in some of the stocks mentioned on this Web site or
in e-mails and is under no obligation to disclose, publicly or
privately, when it is selling any stock that has been mentioned.''
But because Park was in fact an investment adviser, the SEC said he
should have disclosed that he was selling.
</P>
<P>
   Securities regulators also allege that Park overstated by as
much as 2,000 percent his past returns to customers and prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lists trades that he did not make, overstates his actual
trades, depicting them as more profitable, and leaves out of his
advertising losing trades,'' said Tim L. Warren, associate regional
director in the SEC's Midwest regional office in Chicago, referring
to the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Park, 50, founded his Internet site, called Societe Anonyme,
almost two years ago and operates it out of his home in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   When news of the fraud charges against Park splashed onto the
Tokyo Joe Web site, many subscribers yawned. ``Anybody can sue
anybody'' posted one participant. Park, who logged off from the
chat room at 9:45 Wednesday morning saying he was returning to New
York from a vacation in the Caribbean, did not return a phone call
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Suing an unregistered individual for fraud under the Investment
Advisers Act is unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis D. Lowenfels, a securities lawyer in New York, said, ``A
recent ruling in a case before the District of Columbia Circuit
Court appears to support the commission's position. That case held
that the SEC could bar an adviser convicted of securities fraud
from the business even though he was not registered.''
</P>
<P>
   Park, who was born in South Korea, has told previous
interviewers that he was raised in Seoul and ran away to Mexico as
a teen-ager. According to reports in Money and thestreet.com, he
landed in jail for entering the country illegally and then returned
to Korea, where he got his law degree.
</P>
<P>
   He worked as a corporate lawyer for a time, then quit and
emigrated to the United States. He started in Seattle as a
condominium salesman but wound up working in a gas station. He and
his wife and daughter came to New York where he became a
restaurateur with a string of burrito restaurants.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Park's Internet adventure, according to past interviews, began
in 1995 when he discovered chat rooms devoted to investing. In
1997, he started posting his own stock picks on Silicon Investor,
one of the largest stock chat sites on the Web. A year later, after
attracting a sizable following, he set up his own Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Today on Silicon Investor, there are four threads devoted to
Tokyo Joe's stock picks. Through these threads, Park reaches many
more investors and has the clout to push his recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC's complaint against Park comes just as he was attempting
to expand his empire. His Web site states that Tokyo Joe is
investing in a new brokerage firm, SAT Trading Inc., for Societe
Anonyme, Tokyojoe Trading, that is expected to begin operations
early this year. The firm is intended to provide a way for people
who want to trade in and out of stocks rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   But the SEC has not received a brokerage application from SAT
Trading, according to an official there. The firm would need
regulatory approval to begin operations.
</P>
<P>
   In its complaint, the SEC identified five companies whose shares
Park traded while recommending them to his customers. They are
Vialink Co., Immune Response Corp., Alphanet Solutions Inc.,
Videonics Inc. and K2 Designs Inc. In all cases, Park's
recommendations caused the shares in the small, obscure companies
to spike in price and trading volume, then drop again. None of the
companies has been charged with wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   On January 20, 1999, for example, Park bought 20,000 shares of
Alphanet Solutions Inc., according to the complaint. The stock
closed at $5.50. The next day, when he recommended it to
subscribers, 454,200 shares exchanged hands, more than six times
the typical daily volume, and the stock rose to $5.75. Within 15
minutes of his buy recommendation, the SEC said, Park placed a sell
order and got out of the stock. Within a week, the stock had lost
20 percent of its value.
</P>
<P>
   Profane and abusive to subscribers who got on his nerves, Park
charges as much as $200 a month for access to his Web site and
regular e-mails of his stock picks.
</P>
<P>
   His Web site also contains numerous testimonials from
subscribers who say they are considerably richer for their
association with him. One message from an unidentified subscriber
posted in October said: ``Just letting you know that your picks
paid for 1/2 of a '99 Carrera. Thanx and big bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   A subscriber who asked not to be identified said that Park made
an unusual plea last Monday to subscribers, asking them to submit
as many testimonials as they could describing how much money they
had made.
</P>
<P>
   Another long-time subscriber seems to be losing some faith in
Park's picks. ``I take the recommendations more with a grain of
salt,'' this person said. ``I believe they used to be more pure _
they were more focused and better researched.''

TIME TO GET REAL AND CHANGE THAT BATTERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: When I bought my computer in 1994, the clock
was so accurate that I used to set my watch by it. A few weeks ago,
I noticed my clock was a few minutes off. This variance has now
gotten so bad that when I boot up each morning, my clock and date
will be as much as 48 hours late. _ Clock Watcher
</P>
<P>
   Dear Watcher: If your PC has been around since 1994, I'm
surprised the whole thing isn't falling apart. A computer of that
vintage can have all sorts of things go wrong: The steam turbine
bearings could burn out, the mainspring might go ``sproinng,'' and
even the hand crank could break off if the gearbox freezes.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing you might check is the clock battery. If I recall
correctly, yours is made of strips of metal suspended in a series
of acid-filled bell jars, connected by heavy-gauge wires. It's
probably worn out after all these years, so it can't hurt to get a
replacement, which you can get at just about any computer store.
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to pop the top on the PC, find the old battery, then
make the switch, but that's relatively easy, especially if you're
one of the three or four computer owners in this country who hasn't
thrown away the manual. One precaution: Get into the PC's setup
program and write down all the stuff you find there in the event
that unhooking the old battery flushes your computer's identity
down the drain.
</P>
<P>
   I've never owned a computer with a real-time clock that didn't
stink, so I'm surprised that yours worked as well as it did. If the
battery doesn't fix things, get a time synchronizer from a
shareware site like www.tucows.com. These dealies go out on the
Internet and check the time at someplace official like the U.S.
Naval Observatory, then set your system clock. I'm assuming, of
course, that your Samuel Morse-autographed modem is still sending
out those dots and dashes.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: What are the pros and cons of leaving the
computer on all day as opposed to shutting it down? I am on and off
the Internet three or four times a day. What should I do? _ Chicken
or Egg
</P>
<P>
   Dear Egg: Stop spending so much time on the Internet and go
outside for some fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   Don't try to figure out who's right in this argument, because
it's been going on since some caveperson turned on the first
computer shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared. You leave the
thing on, and the moving parts will wear out as the accumulated
heat slowly fries things. You turn it on each time you sit down to
work, and the sudden surges of power will eventually kill things.
In real life, by the time any major damage is done either way, your
computer will be so obsolete you ought to replace it. Unless you're
the guy in the first question, that is.
</P>
<P>
   I turn mine off on those rare occasions when I haven't passed
out at the keyboard after a three-day Quake death match, but the
only reason I do is that I have a continuous connection to the
Internet with a nonchanging address, and I'm slightly paranoid
about all those nasty things I used to say about hackers. If you
use a dial-up account, you don't have that problem.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: My regular telephone broke, and I wanted to use
the phone dialer in Win98. It dials OK and the call goes out OK,
but I don't hear the person's voice on my speakers. _ Mr. Watson's
Nightmare
</P>
<P>
   Dear Nightmare: Uh, the dialer only dials the number. You can't
actually use it to talk to other people. Got 10 bucks? Go buy a
phone.
</P>
<P>
   (Dr. Emilio Bombay is ordinarily much meaner than that. He let
that last guy off entirely too easily. Something must be wrong.

WORKING CONDITIONS IMPROVED IN 1900S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Was that a great century, or what?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the 20th century was very, very good to most U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   You can argue that worker bee income didn't grow commensurate
with corporate profits and CEO pay. You can note that wages lag for
women and minorities. You can point to layoffs that ruined lives.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, though, the 1900s were a worker's fairy godmother.
Her magic wand:
</P>
<P>
   Zapped 15 hours from the average workweek. In 1909, U.S. workers
spent 50 hours a week on the job. Today, the Bureau of Labor
Statistics puts the typical workweek at about 35 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Set a minimum wage. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 made 25
cents an hour the mandatory minimum wage. Since then, the wage
floor has risen incrementally and now is $5.15. Market conditions
have pushed entry-level wages higher in many industries and
locations.
</P>
<P>
   Made the workplace safer. We chafe under OSHA paperwork, but
regulatory agencies and responsible businesses have reduced
work-related casualties. Seventy years ago, 38 out of 100,000
workers were killed at work; today, the rate is four in 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Plumped up a financial cushion for retirement. The Social
Security Act of 1935 began paying benefits in 1940. Now, 95 percent
of U.S. jobs pay into the fund. Its future is controversial, but it
has kept millions of seniors from having to work until they died.
</P>
<P>
   Protected benefits promised to employees. The Employment
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 gave federal oversight to
private-sector employee benefit plans such as health insurance and
retirement funds. ERISA also created individual retirement accounts
to give workers without pension plans a way to save for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Saw an explosion of private pension plans. American Express Co.
created the first such fund in 1875, but the concept didn't catch
fire until the 1900s. According to a Hewitt Associates report on
the century's workplace improvements, 87 million employees now are
enrolled in 693,000 private pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced anti-discrimination laws that improved job access for
women and minorities. Overall, women and blacks still earn just
three-fourths of white men's income, but, according to the Cato
Institute, pay parity is close (98 cents to $1) for those in the
same jobs with the same characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Delivered immeasurable technological innovations that made work
and home lives more productive and easy. Leisure hours nearly
doubled for the typical worker from the beginning of the century to
the end.
</P>
<P>
   Filled a cornucopia of benefits options. Flexible benefit plans,
401(k) deferred compensation plans, employee stock ownership
programs and stock bonus plans improved many workers' financial
condition. Similarly, flex time, telecommuting, job sharing and
compressed workweeks allowed some workers to make quality-of-life
choices.
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly an exhaustive list of the century's work-related
pros or cons, but there's no question the lot of the U.S. worker is
much improved. Work is easier now.

SURROUNDED, REBELS IN CHECHEN CAPITAL FIGHT BACK FIERCELY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOZDOK, Russia _ Encircled by Russian forces and subjected to
constant bombardment, Chechen rebels in Grozny have begun to lash
back, forcing furious firefights on the outskirt of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel officials asserted Wednesday that they had left their
hiding places in Grozny and seized the village of Alkhan-Kala, on
the southwestern outskirts of the Chechen capital, according to
Russian press reports.
</P>
<P>
   While the rebels presented this as a victory, Russian commanders
cited the breakout as a sign of desperation. They confirmed that
the rebels had infiltrated the village, but insisted that they held
only a few buildings and had been blocked from escaping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rebel commanders are planning to seize major settlements to
boost the moral of their fighters and to show that Russia is not
capable of completing its counter-terrorist operation,'' the
Russian military said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Similar clashes have occurred elsewhere around Grozny as the
militants have sought to break free from the besieged city and
their enclaves in Chechnya's southern highlands. Whether they are a
sign of defiance or desperation, the skirmishes suggest that the
fight for Grozny is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week, Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, the deputy chief of
the Russian general staff, said the fall of Grozny would occur
within days. Instead, Russia's drive for the capital has turned
into a battle of attrition.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Vitaly Glytov, a 20-year-old welder who is serving as a sergeant
in Russia's 74th Brigade, encountered one of the roving bands of
rebels Sunday near the village of Chechen-Aul, six miles southeast
of Grozny. His platoon was ordered to stop a group of 20 militants
spotted trying to break out of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were moving through the forest and shooting at everything
we saw,'' he said in an interview. ``They were about 16 years old,
but they fought well. We are seeing more and more younger guys at
the front while the older guys stay in the back.''
</P>
<P>
   After exchanging automatic fire with the Russian forces, the
militants began to pull back. Fearing an ambush, the Russian
platoon was reluctant to pursue them. So it also began to retreat.
</P>
<P>
   As Glytov began to withdraw, a bullet ripped through his side
and exited his back. The bullet was specially designed to tumble
through the air and cause the maximum injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was turning to go back when I was hit,'' Glytov said at the
military hospital in Mozdok. ``I saw the young guy who shot me as I
fell down.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Glytov could not feel his legs. So his fellow soldiers
put him on a blanket and carried him out. Since then, the sensation
in his limbs has returned. But he still has trouble raising his
right hand and his back feels as if it is bearing a heavy weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother knows that I am in Chechnya, but I have not told her
I was wounded,'' he said. ``I would like to return to my unit and
finish this up.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Defeating the rebels in Grozny is likely to take some time.
Russian officials estimated that there are as many as 2,000 rebels
in the city. They include not only Chechens but also mercenaries
from Ukraine, the Baltic states and even Russia, Russian soldiers
say.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Nikolai Tararasyuk, 20, said his unit had captured a female
sniper from St. Petersburg and a former biathlon athlete who had
joined the rebels for money.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the fighting in Grozny is said to be taking place in the
Oktyabrsky district, in the southern part of the city where most of
the rebels are hiding out. There are also pockets of resistance in
the Staropromyslovsky district in northwest Grozny, which the
Russians claim they control.
</P>
<P>
   And recently the fighting has spilled over into the suburbs of
the city. The attack on Alkhan-Kala took place several days ago
during a dense fog. Russian armored personnel carriers rushed to
counter the breakout. Wednesday night, a Russian spokesman said the
military could not shell the militants in the town without
endangering the civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have cited this and other attacks as a turning point
in the war, insisting that the Russians are taking heavy
casualties. ``The Mujahedeen have moved forward,'' Mumadi Saidayev,
the chief of operations for the rebels, was quoted as saying in
Russian press reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians said the rebels have mounted a propaganda
offensive, saying they still have the city in a stranglehold and
have made advances in southern Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to verify either side's claims since the
Russian military has not taken reporters to Chechnya for three
days. Russian officials acknowledged that the casualties were
running high. The official Russian toll for the last 24 hours was
eight dead and 25 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials insisted they were not planning any major
changes in tactics to cope with the rebel counterattacks. After
meeting with Acting President Vladimir Putin, Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev sought to reassure the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is going according to plan,'' he said.

INS DECISION TO RETURN CUBAN BOY TO FATHER SPARKS PROTESTS IN
MIAMI 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Outraging Cuban exiles and touching off protests in
Miami, U.S. immigration officials announced Wednesday that Elian
Gonzalez, a 6-year-old Cuban boy rescued off the Florida coast
after surviving a boat sinking, should be sent home to his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``This little boy, who has been through so much, belongs with
his father,'' said Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service. ``We urge everyone involved to
understand, respect and uphold the bond between parent and child
and the laws of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Meissner set a Jan. 14 deadline for Elian's return to Cuba, but
lawyers for his relatives in Miami immediately sent letters to the
White House and Attorney General Janet Reno, asking the Clinton
administration to reverse the decision. They also have threatened
to take the case to state and federal courts in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton, who has promised to keep politics out of
the debate, said the INS ``followed the law and the procedures and
made the decision that they made after an exhaustive review of the
facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been staying with his great uncle and other relatives
in Miami since he was plucked from the sea Nov. 25 by fishermen who
found him clinging to an inner tube. His mother and stepfather had
drowned along with nine others fleeing their communist homeland in
an overloaded boat.
</P>
<P>
   While Elian's Miami family has fought to keep him in the United
States, his father, Juan Gonzalez, and his grandparents in Cuba
have demanded his return.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban President Fidel Castro has accused Elian's relatives and
other Cuban-Americans of brainwashing the child and bribing him
with toys and a trip to Disney World in events that were heavily
covered by the media. He staged massive demonstrations on the
island, bringing hundreds of thousands of Cubans into the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner said that while the case has posed many political and
emotional issues, the only question for INS officials was who has
the authority to speak for the child, who is too young to decide
for himself where he wants to live.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban adults who reach the United States are routinely granted
political asylum, and many Cuban exiles insist that Elian's
mother's dream of bringing her child to a free country also should
be honored.
</P>
<P>
   The INS commissioner disagreed, saying that because Elian's
mother is dead, the only other appropriate person to speak on his
behalf is his father. After conducting two interviews with Elian's
father, Meissner said, INS officials were convinced that he was not
being coerced by the Castro government.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made it very clear during both of these meetings that he
wants Elian returned to him as soon as possible,'' she said. ``INS
believes that he is expressing his true wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that Juan Gonzalez, while divorced from Elian's
mother, had produced photographs and other documentation showing
that he had been actively involved in Elian's upbringing and had a
strong bond with the child.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner asked Elian's Miami relatives, who have lived in the
United States since the 1960s, to cooperate with INS officials to
return the boy to his father. She said there would be no need to
take Elian into INS custody if his father would accept an offer of
a visa to fly to Miami to collect his son, or if one of Elian's
American relatives or a third party, such as a church official,
would agree to escort the boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami family picked him up early Wednesday from school,
where he has started first grade, and took him to an undisclosed
location to avoid the media and demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the family, said Elian cares
for his father, ``but he would like his father to be here with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The family's lawyers said they would welcome Juan Gonzalez's
input on his son's fate _ if he comes to the United States, where
they can be assured he is not speaking under duress.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said it is prepared to expedite the
application for a non-immigrant visa if Gonzalez decides he wants
to travel to the United States to be reunited with his son. So far,
Gonzalez has not requested a visa, and it is unclear whether the
Cuban government would allow him to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee,
also said he would personally pay for Elian's entire family to come
to Miami, ``where the boy's future can be decided on free soil.''
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
renewed his vow to sponsor a bill later this month aimed at giving
Elian U.S. citizenship. Two Florida lawmakers made the same pledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless Elian's father, and indeed his entire family in Cuba,
are out of Castro's reach, we cannot possibly know what they really
want for Elian,'' Helms said. ``We do know this: Elian's mother
gave her life so he could grow up in freedom in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's press secretary, Joe Lockhart, said there are
``certain obvious benefits'' to growing up free, and many people
around the world envy Americans' freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think there are also many who understand the sanctity of
family bonds and how important those are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, anti-Castro activists demonstrated outside the INS
offices in Miami and threatened to form a human chain around the
Little Havana home where Elian has been living if authorities seek
to remove him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very worried about Elian Gonzalez's future in Cuba,''
said Mariela Ferretti, spokeswoman for the Cuban-American National
Foundation in Miami. ``Some people have this picture of Elian
walking into the sunset with his father, and we really believe that
is not going to be the case. Castro has pinned this child's picture
onto his lapel and claimed him as his. His father has all but lost
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all,'' she said, ``he has had a taste of freedom, and
once you have that, it is very difficult to forget.''

DOW GAINS 124 POINTS, ENDING SLIDE, AS BOND PRICES FALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices halted their early-year slide on
Wednesday but finished little better than mixed after the Nasdaq
composite index pulled out of a big hole only to fade late in the
day.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq ended the session down 24.15 points, or 0.6 percent,
to 3,877.54. The Dow Jones industrial average, however, held on to
much of its gain and ended up 124.72 points, or 1.1 percent, to
11,122.65, recovering about one-quarter of its steep decline during
the first two trading days of the year. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index rose 2.69 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,402.11.
</P>
<P>
   Investors once again cashed in profits that they had hesitated
taking during 1999, which would have resulted in taxes due this
April instead of next year. But analysts also pointed to a
substantial switching of money out of technology stocks and into
those more closely tied to the performance of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``More of it is just plain old-fashioned rebalancing'' as
professional and other investors moved to restore portfolios to
more normal configurations, said David G. Dietze, president of
Point View Financial Services in Summit, N.J. ``Anyone who's been
involved with technology is way out of line with their
benchmarks.''
</P>
<P>
   An expected increase in interest rates has been a serious weight
on stocks, but the market's respectable performance Wednesday came
despite a decline in Treasury prices after a government report on
factory orders for November was stronger than expected. The price
of the benchmark 30-year issue fell a full point, to 93 2/32. Its
yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price,
climbed to 6.62 percent from 6.54 percent Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it appeared that a bond rally on Tuesday was
little more than a flight to safety from stocks and said rates
could climb again if a report on the December job market on Friday
showed too much growth for the Federal Reserve, which remains
vigilant for signs of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike early in 1999, when investors took a fancy to
cyclical stocks, Wednesday's action was not seen as the prelude to
a big or extended run-up in such stocks or as serious
disenchantment with technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view this as very much a correction in a group that went up
too far too fast, especially in the fourth quarter of last year,''
said Mary Farrell, senior investment strategist at PaineWebber.
``This is just one of those indiscriminate sell-offs'' in an
inherently volatile sector.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the third consecutive day, the Nasdaq swung more than 100
points.
</P>
<P>
   After plunging a record 229.46 points, or 5.6 percent, on
Tuesday, the Nasdaq fell nearly 167 points, or 4.27 percent, in
early trading on Wednesday, but the market staged a comeback, even
poking briefly into positive territory, before falling back to
finish with its modest loss. Volume was 1.73 billion shares, second
only to the record 1.78 billion on Dec. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest losers were BMC Software, which tumbled 27
7/16, to 49 9/16, after it warned for a second time of lower
profits, and Amazon.com, which slumped 12 3/16, to 69}, after
announcing sales gains that disappointed some analysts and plans to
take heavy write-offs of inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo dropped 32{, to 410{, and Qualcomm, which split recently,
fell 5|, to 156 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was also heavy on the New York Stock Exchange, where
1.09 billion shares changed hands, even more than the 1.01 billion
in Tuesday's slide. Winners outnumbered losers by 1,786 to 1,367 as
28 made new 52-weeks highs and 113 made new lows.
</P>
<P>
   The market's performance follows the historical pattern, said
Donald M. Selkin, chief equity strategist at Joseph Gunnar &AMP; Co. He
pointed to three of the Dow's biggest point declines _ in October
1987, October 1997 and August 1998 _ and said that on each occasion
it started the next day lower and then rallied smartly during the
same session.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, recommended by Banc of America Securities, accounted for
nearly one-quarter of the Dow's advance, rising 6 3/16, to 118\,
before slipping back in after-hours trading. Alcoa, the best
performer in the index last year, jumped 4 11/16, to 86, and Exxon
Mobil was ahead 3 15/16, to 80}.
</P>
<P>
   Utility stocks, which pay relatively large dividends and tend to
be seen as havens in rough markets, posted hefty gains. Con Edison
was up 1 9/16, to 35}, and Duke Energy gained 2, to 51. The Dow
Jones utility average climbed 3.81 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, stocks fell sharply in most major markets. The
principal indexes slumped 7.18 percent in Hong Kong, 2.42 percent
in Tokyo, 3.39 percent in Paris, 1.95 percent in London, 1.29
percent in Frankfurt and 1.01 percent in Toronto. The Bovespa in
Brazil, however, advanced 2.49 percent, and the Bolsa in Mexico
gained 1.33 percent.

LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR DEFENDS USE OF AIDES FOR PERSONAL CHORES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL REZENDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift says she will continue
to rely on State House aides to perform personal chores for her,
insisting she did nothing wrong by requesting they babysit her
infant daughter, pick up her dry cleaning, and run other errands.
</P>
<P>
   Swift also defended her use of a state police helicopter to fly
from Boston to her family's North Adams home before the
Thanksgiving holiday as ``entirely within state police protocol.''
She said she took the helicopter instead of a car because her
daughter had pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have stated on numerous occasions that I face many of the
same challenges as other working parents but I also have some
differences because of my schedule,'' Swift said Wednesday. ``There
are times when I can't call in sick, when I can't just not be
available.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe reported Wednesday that two State House aides
helped Swift move from an apartment in Boston's North End to a less
expensive apartment in Northbridge last fall. Wednesday, the
administration gave reporters copies of payroll records showing the
staffers took vacation days to help with the move, and Swift
repeated her assertion that the workers took the time voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   But the revelations about Swift's use of government workers for
her personal and family needs touched off controversy, with critics
saying she is taking advantage of her powerful position and may be
misusing taxpayers' money.
</P>
<P>
   Mark White, executive director of the state Democratic Party,
called on Governor Paul Cellucci to investigate whether state
employees have improperly run errands for Swift during work hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cellucci admninistration is out of touch with the working
families of Massachusetts,'' White said. ``The average mother or
father can't call upon public employees to assist with baby-sitting
and personal errands.''
</P>
<P>
   White said Swift's behavior was more egregious than that of
former Massachussetts Port Authority director Peter Blute, who was
forced to resign last summer after a ``booze cruise'' on which
Blute used a Massport-chartered boat to party with a lobbyist and
young, swimsuit-clad women.
</P>
<P>
   Ken White, executive director of Common Cause of Massachusetts,
said the baby-sitting raised potential ethical questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in a position of power and responsibility ... what
seems innocent to you can ... seem an imposition to others,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful that the lieutenant governor has formed such
close relationships with the people she works with, but that does
not justify stretching those relationships beyond the bounds of
good sense and appropriate ethical action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Swift, however, said no one has been forced to help her with
chores. During the past year, she has on dozens of occasions used a
state worker to watch over her 14-month-old daughter, Elizabeth, in
her office during busy times in the workday. She has also asked for
staffers to watch the girl at home.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about staffers who have privately complained of feeling
unfairly pressed into caring for Elizabeth, Swift said: ``I would
be stunned if there was anyone who was feeling pressure to spend
time with her and care for her. I don't think that's the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Swift said most staffers are eager to spend time with her
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's adorable and engaging and she's learned to blow
kisses,'' Swift said.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci unequivocally defended Swift, asserting that her dual
role as mother and ``co-governor'' often requires her to make
unusual transportation and child care arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the lieutenant governor's judgment,'' Cellucci said.
``The very public nature of her job, the fact that she is my
partner and the co-governor of this state, creates some interesting
situations. I will admit that.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Swift acknowledged she relied on
administrative aide Sarah Dohoney and advance man Brian Lages to
move her to Northbridge. She said Wednesday they offered to pitch
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``They genuinely volunteered,'' said Swift, 34. ``I guarantee
that they were using vacation time and it was time they were
entitled to...It was very appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Swift's husband, Charles Hunt III, often drops Elizabeth off at
the State House for visits with her mom. That was the case
Wednesday when, after refusing reporters' requests for a press
conference, Swift scheduled a series of unusual one-on-one
10-minute interviews with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Swift's daughter was in the room for interviews with two
television news crews, and later appeared in the news segments.
</P>
<P>
   In her interview with the Globe, Swift said it was concern for
her daughter that prompted her to request a state police helicopter
for a November flight from Boston to North Adams, just before the
Thanksgiving holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth, Swift said, was home in North Adams with pneumonia at
a time when it was impossible for Swift to cancel a Boston
appearance at a transportation summit at Logan Airport held for New
England governors.
</P>
<P>
   Swift also said that, in general, both she and Cellucci rarely
make use of the state helicopters. ``I used it twice in the entire
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's press secretary, John Birtwell, said Cellucci also
has used a state police helicopter twice since taking office a year
ago. Swift and Cellucci said their use of the helicopters fall
within state police protocol, which permit ``government
executives'' to request use of the aircraft for any reason.
</P>
<P>
   In her defense Wednesday, Swift fell back her role as a mother
and lieutenant governor, saying staffers occasionally volunteer to
perform personal errands for her to ``help her hold it all
together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue,'' she added, ``to make sure we don't abuse the
privilges of this office and the taxpayer-funded reources of this
office. I'm confident that hasn't happened.''

FDA REVISES RULE ON DIET SUPPLEMENTS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The makers of vitamins, herbs and dietary
supplements may market products for natural conditions such as
morning sickness, hot flashes and memory loss in aging without
proving they are safe or effective, the Food and Drug
Administration announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which reverses an earlier proposal, marks the
latest in a series of legal and regulatory victories for the
dietary supplement business, which has been growing since Congress
passed a law in 1994 that severely restricted the FDA's authority
to regulate it.
</P>
<P>
   The move enraged and startled consumer advocates, who said it
would weaken patient protections. ``This is a snake-oil
exemption,'' complained Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of the Public
Citizen's Health Research Group in Washington. ``It's a complete
cave-in to the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   But agency officials said the new rule, which will take effect
30 days from Thursday, is an important part of their 10-year
strategy to increase consumer confidence in the safety, composition
and labeling of vitamins, herbs and other nutritional aids that
have become an integral part of the lives of millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a free-for-all,'' said Peggy Dotzel, the associate
acting commissioner for policy at the FDA. ``What the agency is
doing is faithfully carrying out the intent of Congress in passing
the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The law is the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act,
which distinguishes between products that claim to ``affect the
structure or function of the body'' and those that claim to
prevent, treat or cure disease. The law allows supplement
manufacturers to sell products without FDA approval _ and therefore
without the rigorous safety and efficacy review that is required of
drugs _ as long as they make only structure or function claims, and
not claims related to disease.
</P>
<P>
   But the law was not specific. So the FDA decided it needed a new
regulation to clarify its authority, and to delineate which claims
fall into which category.
</P>
<P>
   The rule put forth Wednesday was first proposed nearly two years
ago, in April 1998. At the time, the agency said that while natural
states like aging, pregnancy, menopause and adolescence were not
diseases, they could be associated with abnormal conditions _ like
morning sickness or premenstrual syndrome _ that are diseases.
Products aimed at those conditions, then would have required FDA
approval.
</P>
<P>
   But after reviewing thousands of public comments from industry
representatives, consumers and others, Ms. Dotzel said, ``the
agency was convinced that these, in fact, are not diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are normal, common conditions that are associated with
the different stages of life.'' Ms. Dotzel continued. ``So claims
about these conditions are not disease claims.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the rule states that uncommon or serious conditions
associated with these life stages will still be treated as
diseases. So a company may market a dietary supplement for
teen-agers who have acne, but not for acne so severe that the
symptoms include cysts.
</P>
<P>
   Industry representatives said they had not had time to review
the new rule, which is 281 pages long, and could not comment on it
in detail. But Corinne Russell, a spokeswoman for the Consumer
Healthcare Products Association, a trade group representing 80
manufacturers of over-the-counter drugs and dietary supplements,
said her organization was ``cautiously optimistic'' about the way
the regulation had narrowed the definition of what is a disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the proposed rule was way too broad,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The final rule precludes manufacturers from making what the FDA
describes as express disease claims, or those that are implied. For
instance, manufacturers cannot state that a product ``prevents
osteoporosis,'' or even that it ``prevents bone fragility in
post-menopausal women,'' without obtaining FDA approval. But a
company could say that its product ``maintains a healthy
circulatory system,'' or that it promotes relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   But one academic expert said Wednesday that it was a tricky
business to draw distinctions between diseases and a natural life
passages.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are going to make a distinction between diseases and
normal states, they are on a slippery slope,'' said Dr. Richard A.
Friedman, director of the psychopharmacology clinic at the Weill
Medical College of Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, there is no lab test for dementia, so a
person who takes ginko, the herb, for memory loss due to aging may
in fact be in the early stages of Alzheimer's Disease.
</P>
<P>
   And Friedman cautioned that just because a product is natural
does not mean it is necessarily safe; he and others were especially
worried that, under the FDA's interpretation of the law, a pregnant
women might endanger her fetus by taking an herbal product for
morning sickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make any difference whether a product is synthetic
or found in a plant,'' he said. ``It can be just as potent
biologically.''
</P>
<P>
   The final rule precludes manufacturers from making what the FDA
describes as express disease claims, or those that are implied. For
instance, manufacturers cannot state that a product ``prevents
osteoporosis,'' or even that it ``prevents bone fragility in
post-menopausal women,'' without obtaining FDA approval. But a
company could say that its product ``maintains a healthy
circulatory system,'' or that it promotes relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said the F.D.A. had little choice but to act as it
did. ``FDA has not done well in this area,'' said Robert G. Pinco,
a food and drug lawyer who, in the 1970s, ran the agency's division
for regulating over-the-counter drugs. ``Every time they have gone
into court to try to limit one of these claims, they have lost.
It's because Congress has really changed the paradigm.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration, hoping to end a deeply
emotional diplomatic and political battle over the fate of Elian
Gonzalez, ruled Wednesday that the 6-year-old boy should be sent
back to Cuba to live with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``This little boy, who has been through so much, belongs with
his father,'' said Doris Meissner, the commissioner of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said the decision was made with full awareness
that a ruling that would keep the boy in the United States could
worsen Washington's relations with Havana at a time when the
administration is attempting to increase contacts with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   One official said that it had been clear for some time inside
the administration that the immigration service was moving to side
with the father, based on a principle of ruling in favor of family
reunification. The official said there was wide agreement that,
therefore, there was no need for the administration to interfere
with the process since a decision to return the boy to Cuba would
avoid new and unwelcome antagonisms with Havana.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton on Wednesday said he supported the ruling,
which he portrayed as a thoroughly nonpolitical decision made
solely by midlevel officials on the facts and the law. ``I told you
when we started this that I would do my best to keep this decision
out of politics,'' he said. ``We have done that and not been
involved in it.''
</P>
<P>
   But senior administration officials acknowledged that the issue
of Elian Gonzalez and its ramifications for U.S.-Cuba relations had
been discussed at the highest levels of the government.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was among 13 people who tried to sail from Cuba to the
Florida coast on a 17-foot aluminum boat. When the boat capsized,
Elian's mother and stepfather along with eight others drowned. The
boy and two survivors were rescued Nov. 25 after spending two days
clinging to an inner tube. Since then, Elian has been the central
object in a tug-of-war between his father in Cuba and relatives in
Miami. The fight has involved Fidel Castro and Florida's
anti-Castro Cuban community, and the issue has been debated by
several U.S. presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The two leading Republican presidential candidates, Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, as well as the
chairman of the Republican National Committee, were quick to
denounce the ruling. Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley, both vying for the Democratic presidential nomination,
declined to criticize the INS's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meissner said that Elian should be reunited with his father
by Jan. 14. In her decision Wednesday, she ruled that the father,
rather than the Miami relatives who have cared for the boy since
his rescue, spoke for the boy in immigration matters. The father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has made clear he wants Elian returned to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meissner said that the decision was made after immigration
officials conducted two wide-ranging interviews in Cuba with
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   She said Gonzalez had provided vivid and extensive details of
his relationship with Elian that show ``the nature of the bond they
share as father and son.'' In addition, she said that Gonzalez
provided family photographs and medical and school records that
show he has continued to participate closely in Elian's life after
his divorce from the boy's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Returning Elian to his father is ``the right decision legally,
it's the right decision morally,'' Ms. Meissner said. ``Both U.S.
and international law recognize the unique relationship between
parent and child and family reunification has long been a
cornerstone of both immigration law and INS practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the decision clears the way for Elian to go back to
Cuba, it remains far from clear when or how that might happen.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meissner acknowledged that there were three possibilities:
the father could come here to collect Elian, the Florida relatives
could bring him to Cuba or some third party could be used to escort
the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's relatives in Miami, who have resisted sending Elian
back to Cuba, saying he has a chance for a better life here,
Wednesday repeated their intentions to try and keep him in the
United States as several hundred anti-Castro Cuban-Americans
demonstrated in Miami to protest the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meissner, in her comments Wednesday, tried to persuade
Elian's relatives in Miami to accept her ruling. She urged people
to ``respect the bond between parent and child and respect the laws
of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   But her exhortations appeared to have had little effect.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday in Miami, three lawyers representing the relatives who
are taking care of the boy said they would ask Attorney General
Janet Reno to overrule Ms. Meissner's decision _ and if that
failed, they would also ask a federal court to overturn it.
</P>
<P>
   They did not detail the legal grounds on which they would seek a
court ruling, but one of the lawyers, Roger Bernstein, said that
the INS decision was unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of unaccompanied minors come to this country every
year without their parents from countries fleeing persecution,'' he
said. ``Each and every one of them is entitled to a hearing when
they express a credible fear of being returned to their homeland.
This is particularly true in cases where aliens are fleeing from
countries where human rights are systematically violated such as
Cuba.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An official at the Cuban Foreign Ministry in Havana reached
Wednesday night by telephone said that the government had no
comment regarding the ruling. The Cuban Interests Section in
Washington said its spokesman, Luis Fernandez, would not have any
comment until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, about 300 people gathered in front of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service building chanting ``Viva Cuba Libre'' to
protest the decision to return Elian to Cuba. Another 200
protesters gathered outside the Miami home where Elian has been
staying.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ileano Ros-Lehtinen, a Miami Republican who represents a
large Cuban-American district, complained to the crowd that the
Clinton administration decided the issue in favor of the father in
order to improve relations with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   She also voiced a common complaint among Cuban-Americans: that
the decision to send Elian to Cuba was based on interviews with the
father that could not be trusted because he is in Cuba and
necessarily has to say what President Castro wants him to say.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meissner, in her news conference Wednesday, said that
immigration service officials were convinced that in his
interviews, the father was ``expressing his true wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government has been keen to have the father come to the
United States to retrieve his son. James P. Rubin, the State
Department spokesman, Wednesday repeated that Washington would
expedite a special visa to allow him to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have said that if Gonzales came here they believe the
sight of the father reunited with the son would help defuse some of
the opposition and that it would eliminate suspicion that Gonzales
was being coerced by authorities in Havana into asking for Elian to
be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning in Iowa, said that he believed the INS had
made a mistake. He said that Elian's father should come to the
United States, ``and he ought to get a taste of freedom in American
and then ought to make a decision about what's best for his boy. I
don't trust Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, campaigning in New Hampshire, repeated his position that
it was wrong to send Elian back to Cuba because his mother died
while trying to bring him to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rosshirt, a spokesman for Gore, said the vice president
would not comment on the INS decision because it could wind up in
the courts. But Rosshirt said that Gore felt that ``this child
should never have been put in a position where the choice is
between his freedom and his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, campaigning in New Hampshire, said Wednesday that he
was not going to second-guess the immigration service.

MARKET PLACE: AMAZON STOCK FALLS ON HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED LOSSES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not too long ago, investors liked consistency and
companies that did what they said they would do. But when it comes
to Internet companies, investors are driven by the momentum of
deals, strategic alliances and carefully manufactured surprises.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is Amazon.Com, which continues to solidify
itself not only as the biggest online store but as one of the
country's biggest mail-order retailers.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the company told Wall Street that its losses would
widen in the fourth quarter because it expected a rapidly growing
but competitive holiday market and that it was increasing its
investment in inventory and marketing to maintain its share.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the company said it would report a 157 percent sales
increase, to $650 million, handily beating the $550 million that
Wall Street analysts had expected. But the company also said its
losses would rise, too, and investors reacted to the disclosure by
knocking $4 billion off the company's market value. Amazon's
shares, already down 28 percent from their $113 high on Dec. 9,
fell by $12.1875, to $69.75, leaving the company valued at $24
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a broad sell-off in the stocks of electronic commerce
companies in recent days, some investors apparently were
disappointed that Amazon's sales were not as high as the most
exuberant ``whispers'' among traders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very good number but not spectacular,'' said Henry
Blodget, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, in a report to clients.
``Based on some of the higher-end numbers, which ranged from $630
million to $750 million, we believe this number may disappoint some
investors who had aggressive expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's sales increase was a little slower than its performance
in the first nine months of the year, when its revenue grew by 170
percent, to $964 million. Moreover, Amazon appears to be losing
share in the overall Internet marketplace. Visa, the credit card
consortium, said sales at Internet merchants rose by 179 percent
for the last two months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon attributed the increase in quarterly loss to excess
inventory, especially toys and electronics, that it would have to
mark down and sell at a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consistent with our strategy, we went all-out to make sure we
delivered for our customers this holiday season,'' Warren Jenson,
Amazon's chief financial officer, said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   None of that was a surprise. Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chairman, has
consistently said the company did not intend to make a profit while
it was expanding rapidly to create the online store that sells
virtually anything.
</P>
<P>
   For the holiday season, it tripled its marketing budget to $90
million, plastering the airwaves with merry-go-rounds of balding
lounge singers crooning about the company's toy selection. It set
aside money to cover problems with its four huge new automated
warehouses by upgrading orders to express shipping even when the
customers had only paid for standard deliveries. It built up its
inventory _ ``tons and tons of toys'' as the commercials rang _ to
avoid disappointing customers.
</P>
<P>
   The frantic pace of the last two months largely suggests that
Amazon was right in most of those bets. While Amazon had its share
of shipping problems, disappointing customers with delayed orders
and other mistakes, it appears to have had far fewer problems than
many of its competitors. Toysrus.com fell so far behind it had to
send many of its customers $100 gift certificates on Dec. 23 so
they could go to stores _ with often-depleted stocks _ to buy toys
in time for Christmas. Etoys, the most successful toy-only
retailer, sold more of some popular products than it had in stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want Amazon to manage their inventory better, but in
the long run, what they did is a positive because they didn't upset
many customers,'' said Anthony Noto, an analyst with Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising blitz may not have been necessary. Early returns
suggest that the Internet sites that spent the most on advertising
were not rewarded with the most traffic. Nonetheless, Amazon was
far and away the most visited site on the Internet, according to
most studies. A survey of online shoppers by Ernst &AMP; Young found
that 42 percent made a purchase at Amazon, more than double eToys,
at 20 percent, and Toysrus.com, at 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Noto estimated that even given Amazon's television campaign, its
expense rate of $20 to $22 to acquire each of its 3.6 million new
customers in the quarter was less than the $27 it spent in the
previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon indicated that its new businesses, including tools, toys
and electronics, accounted for more than half its sales, but it did
not break out revenue by category or estimate the profitability of
its various business lines.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Kiggen, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, said
that one reason Amazon's stock was so volatile was that the company
shed so little light on the dynamics of its financial statements.
If the company could show that it makes money on its more mature
business lines, he said, investors would be more willing to accept
losses on the new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see if they are making money on books, and how,'' he
said. Still, Kiggen said he believed that Amazon would make money
as it reached critical mass and found more ways to draw revenues
from its customers. One early example was its $150 million deal for
a credit card with Next Card.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case against Amazon reminds me of the case against America
Online a few years ago,'' he said. ``Everyone said they were
spending too much money, but once they got to a certain size, it
didn't matter.''

FACING BOYCOTT, NBC AGREES TO CREATE MORE JOBS FOR MINORITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Acknowledging that talented minority members had most
likely been denied opportunities in writing, producing and
directing, NBC president Bob Wright announced an agreement
Wednesday aimed at generating jobs for them both at the network and
on shows it broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, with a coalition led by the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, ends the association's
threat to ask black and other minority viewers to boycott NBC
programs.
</P>
<P>
   NAACP president Kweisi Mfume called the accord a ``model for
emulation'' in talks with the three other major broadcast networks.
In fact, a list of understandings with ABC, many similar to those
announced by NBC, was finished Wednesday and awaiting only the
signatures of the association's representatives. Mfume said he
expected agreements with other networks within the next 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with NBC provides for internships, scholarship
programs and a guarantee that the network will increase its
purchases from minority-owned suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, NBC will pay for a minority writer to be added to
the staff of every new network show that wins a second year on the
air. That means it will be supplying and paying for writers on
shows it gets from other studios, like Warner Brothers or
Paramount. One chief executive of a television production studio,
who insisted on anonymity, said he had some concerns about such an
approach, because ``it might get to be a little like having the
boss' son on your staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sassa, the president of NBC West Coast, said that by
hiring minority writers on second-year shows, the network hoped to
groom them to become executive producers and creators of
programming.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement follows by some six months Mfume's attack on the
networks for the new prime-time schedules they announced last
spring. He called those schedules a ``virtual whitewash,'' with few
shows having any leading black or other minority characters.
</P>
<P>
   Mfume has since met with executives of every network. Wednesday
he said the criticism had ``sounded some alarms throughout the
industry'' and that if more minority members were in a position to
create programming and decide what gets on the air, then greater
diversity of casts would follow.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mfume described his negotiations with NBC as ``intense and
tough.'' The result was a ``memorandum of understanding'' between
the network and the NAACP that both he and Wright signed.
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood in February, Wright, Mfume and Sassa will supervise
what they called ``an intensive all-day seminar'' involving all
current and prospective producers of NBC shows. The purpose, the
executives said, is to emphasize the network's commitment to
diversity and to solicit ideas on how it can be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has also committed to doubling its purchases from
minority-owned businesses over the next 18 months. In addition, it
will provide 6 minority fellowships for graduate studies, support
18 positions at its television stations and throughout the network
for students from the Emma L. Bowen Foundation for Minority
Interests in Media, and guarantee that a ``substantial number'' of
the more than 90 young people hired each year as NBC pages are
minority members.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said NBC was committing a substantial amount of money to
the effort, though he did not specify a figure.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the agreement was an indication that the network
had most likely passed up minority talent in the past, he said,
``My guess is yes.'' He said that too few black members of the
Writers Guild had found positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trickle-down effect has not produced nearly the
representation you'd expect,'' Wright said. ``That struck me when I
went into this. There's something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The main reason NBC decided to act, he said, is that doing so
made good business sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is becoming more fragmented,'' he said. ``We don't
win with fragmentation _ we lose. We have to get out there with
more compelling, broad-based material.''

SPORTS COLUMN: PETER WARRICK CAUGHT IN AN MVP ACT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS_ Now we know why Bobby Bowden kept Peter Warrick on
the Florida State team: Warrick is a phenomenal wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick and Michael Vick, Virginia Tech's outstanding freshman
quarterback, put on one of the most compelling performances in the
history of the Sugar Bowl in a game being played for the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida State's 46-29 victory, Warrick set the Sugar Bowl
record for points scored (20). He caught touchdown passes of 64 and
43 yards; he ran a punt back 59 yards for a touchdown; he caught a
2-point conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Vick tied the Florida State defense in knots with his running,
which accounted for 97 yards, and passing, which accounted for 225
yards more. He threw a 49-yard touchdown pass and scored on a
3-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   But Warrick emerged as the star, and the game's most valuable
player.
</P>
<P>
   His performance culminated a season that saw him humbled on a
national scale, beginning on Oct. 7, when Warrick and a teammate,
Laveranues Coles, were arrested on a charge of felony grand theft
for paying $21.40 for $412.38 worth of clothing at a department
store in Tallahassee, Fla. Coles was thrown off the team. Warrick
was suspended for two games and reinstated after he pleaded guilty
to a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   After starting the season as one of the Heisman Trophy
favorites, Warrick failed to get enough votes to be among the
finalists in December.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by the fourth quarter on Tuesday night, a staccato chant of
``Peter Warrick'' resonated throughout the Superdome. Was it a
concession to winning at all costs, or the signature of
forgiveness?
</P>
<P>
   Warrick returned to Florida State for his senior year with the
idea of winning a national championship and graduating. He achieved
both goals. Next stop: the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Now the million-dollar question becomes what will become of
Peter Warrick? How will he handle the pro sports culture of
opulence, in which survival often depends on strong character and
common sense? With no paternal Bobby Bowden to bail him out, no one
to shield him, no one to cover for an errant decision, everything
rests on Warrick's ability to make good judgments. This has not
been his forte, and notoriety only seems to cloud the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Bowden described Warrick, from Bradenton, Fla., as
the sort of wide-eyed country kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the big reason Pete came back last year he was wary
about going into the big-time life,'' he said. ``I don't think Pete
was eager to go to New York or Los Angeles or St. Louis or New
Orleans or wherever he's going to have to go to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's from a small town down there in Florida and he's got a
small town in Tallahassee. If you watch him closely, do you see how
naive he is? He's a small-town young man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that happened to him might be the best thing that
ever happened to him,'' Bowden said about Warrick's arrest. ``Maybe
he learned such a great lesson that when he gets in these other
towns where temptation is everywhere, maybe he's learned to say
no.''
</P>
<P>
   You wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the third quarter, Florida State was leading by 28-23
and driving for the knockout punch. Chris Weinke completed a
12-yard pass to Warrick, who tried to outmaneuver Ronyell Whitaker,
a Virginia Tech defensive back. As Warrick went out of bounds, the
two players exchanged shoves. All the official saw was Warrick
shoving Whitaker. Florida State was penalized 15 yards for a
personal foul. On the next play, Weinke's pass was intercepted.
Seven plays later, Vick lead Tech into the end zone for a 29-28
Tech lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm standing on the sideline thinking, `That was stupid, what
I did,''' Warrick said. ``I just got mad and frustrated when I
caught the ball and went out of bounds. He hit me in my face; I
retaliated and hit him back in his face. But you know how that
goes. They always catch the person that throws the second punch.''
</P>
<P>
   That's precisely the point of Warrick's three-month ordeal:
committing the act is one thing, getting caught is another. Warrick
was caught in the department store three months ago and nearly
ruined his career. He was caught on Tuesday and could have cost his
team the game and the national title.
</P>
<P>
   Each time his athletic ability has saved the day. In October,
Bowden took Warrick back. On Tuesday, Florida State answered
Virginia Tech's challenge with a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick had a great performance on Tuesday. Maybe that should
set the tone for his new year and new career. &QL;

CUBAN-AMERICANS IN MIAMI PROTEST DECISION ON ELIAN 
</HEADLINE>
 (With CUBA-BOY) 
(nk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ As word filtered out that Elian Gonzalez would be
returned to his father in Cuba, hundreds of Cuban exiles protested
in the streets here Wednesday, chanting, ``Let him stay,'' and
``Freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The emotional display followed the decision Wednesday by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service to send back the 6-year-old
boy, who was rescued in Florida waters in November while trying to
reach the United States. His mother, stepfather and eight others
drowned when the boat carrying them capsized.
</P>
<P>
   While the immigration service cast its decision as a way to
reunite the boy with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, angry
protesters saw Fidel Castro's long shadow behind the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Fidel's got his arm around him, there's no way he can be
acting honestly,'' said Gustavo Roca, one of the protesters outside
the immigration service building.
</P>
<P>
   Georgina Cid, one of Elian's cousins in Miami, recalled
telephone conversations with Gonzalez and said she was convinced
that this was not what he really wanted for his son. ``When we talk
to him, it's not really him,'' she said. ``He doesn't speak from
his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Saul Sanchez, leader of the Democracy Movement, urged the
Cuban-American community to come together in support of Elian's
right to stay in the United States, and called on protesters to
block roads and disrupt traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are enraged,'' Sanchez said. ``If we have to go to jail, we
will. If they come arrest me for civil disobedience, let them
arrest me.''
</P>
<P>
   At the house where the boy was staying with relatives in Miami's
Little Havana, 200 protesters gathered to offer their support to
the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``This boy cannot become a trophy for Fidel,'' said Jorge Mas
Santos, chairman of the Cuban-American National Foundation. ``This
is a very emotional community at this time. It's not just a matter
of this child but of thousands of Cubans.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's relatives here held a news conference Wednesday
afternoon, questioning why the boy was being sent back against
their wishes. ``Why aren't we given the opportunity at this point
to speak for him?'' asked Marisleysis Gonzalez, Elian's cousin.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the boy's lawyers sent a letter to Attorney General
Janet Reno and Doris Meissner, commissioner of the immigration
service, arguing that Gonzalez was acting under pressure from
Cuba's Communist government. They asked that the boy be granted an
interview for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   One of Elian's lawyers, Spencer Eig, said Washington officials
told him that they had determined that Gonzalez was not under
political duress and that only he could speak for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Washington, Ms. Meissner said she did
not doubt that Gonzalez was expressing his true feelings. ``We have
extensive details on the closeness of the relationship between the
father and the child,'' she said. ``We need to observe and uphold
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyers argued that the immigration service had acted
against its own policies by meeting secretly with the father in
Cuba and not hearing their argument in favor of political asylum.
They said they would appeal the decision and seek a temporary
restraining order to prevent the immigration service from taking
the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters said that those who accompanied Elian on the trip to
the United States should not have lost their lives only for him to
now lose his freedom. ``The sacrifice of a mother for the freedom
of her child should be respected,'' read one of the signs the
protesters carried.

MEXICO EXPELS 2 AMERICANS AND QUESTIONS GROUP VISITING REBEL
VILLAGE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Argentina, France, Italy, Portugal, Colo., Calif., Ill.)   By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico has ordered Kerry Appel, 48, a coffee
importer from Colorado who attended a New Years' celebration in a
rebel-controlled village in southern Chiapas state, to leave the
country immediately. The order, issued on Tuesday, bars Appel from
visiting here for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Another American who spent New Years' in Chiapas was
interrogated and given a week to leave. The authorities identified
him as Greg Ruggeiro, 25, an editor from Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Appel and Ruggeiro were among 40 American, Argentine, French,
Italian and Portuguese tourists, sympathizers of the indigenous
Zapatista rebels in Chiapas, who attended the same celebration in
Chiapas. Immigration authorities have called in most for
questioning. Appel and Ruggeiro's were the first expulsion orders.
But human rights lawyers who are following the situation said they
expected that other foreigners might be ordered out in coming days.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the immigration office in San Cristobal de las Casas
in Chiapas was packed with foreigners, some accompanied by lawyers,
waiting to be interrogated.
</P>
<P>
   At least 79 foreign tourists were ordered out of Mexico last
year after trips to Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   Appel was previously ordered to leave Mexico after a visit to
Chiapas in January 1996, but he had not been barred from returning.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration Commissioner Alejandro Carrillo Castro told
reporters here on Tuesday night that Appel had violated the law by
traveling to Mexico late last month with just a tourist visa,
ignoring the terms of the previous deportation order, which
required him to request a special visa from the Mexican consulate
in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Appel asserted in an interview Wednesday, however, that Mexican
authorities had never shown him the previous order and had
repeatedly assured him after the deportation in January 1996 that
he faced no special travel restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   He said his Mexican lawyer was appealing the new order. A
Chicagoan, Tom Hansen, who was expelled from Chiapas in 1998, won a
legal victory last year when the Mexican Supreme Court ruled his
expulsion illegal. But authorities have refused to allow Hansen to
return, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Appel said he established his coffee importing business in
Denber, the Human Bean Co., in 1996. He purchases coffee from
Chiapas cooperatives run by indigenous farmers and markets the
beans, as well as native weavings and video documentaries that he
has produced about Chiapas through an Internet Web site,
www.thehumanbean.com.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Appel videotaped an interview with the rebel leader,
Subcomandante Marcos, in which the masked Zapatista denounced
globalization and portrayed President Ernesto Zedillo as a salesman
who was auctioning off Mexico's economy and indigenous peoples to
foreign investors. In an introduction to that interview, which is
on the Web site, Appel described his deportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told that I had no business discussing economic, social
or political subjects with the indigenous peoples of Mexico,''
Appel wrote. ``I was told by the Mexican government that if I
wanted to see Indians, I could see them in the markets or the
museums. Then they kicked me out of Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Appel and the 40 other foreign tourists spent New Year's Eve in
Oventic, a village in the Chiapas highlands where American
sympathizers of the Zapatistas have been trying to build a
secondary school. Peter Brown, a teacher from Los Angeles who had
coordinated the construction, was expelled from Mexico in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   During the Oventic celebration, for the new year and the sixth
anniversary of the outbreak of the Zapatista insurgency, Appel
talked, played basketball and danced with the Indians, but did not
offer political advice, he said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain, who has made fixing the corrosive
influence of money in politics the cornerstone of his campaign,
twice demanded in recent weeks that regulatory agency take action
in a matter that would ultimately benefit a major contributor to
his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Once in November and again last month, McCain wrote letters to
the Federal Communications Commission seeking a speedy vote on a
complicated swap of television station licenses in Pittsburgh. The
swap would enable the contributor, Paxson Communications, to buy
one of the stations in the only big market where it lacks one.
</P>
<P>
   Mcain sent the letters after he and his aides had met with and
received more than $20,000 in contributions from executives for the
company and lobbyists. The head of the company, Lowell Paxson, who
also lent McCain his corporate jet four times last year, had
scheduled a fund-raiser for McCain in Florida for this weekend, but
canceled it at the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday McCain's letters became part of the presidential
campaign after an article about them was published in The Boston
Globe. Opponents of the station transfer charged that, when it
comes to the influence of money in politics, McCain says one thing
and does another.
</P>
<P>
   The letters did not tell the commissioners how to vote on the
license transfers, which had been in a regulatory abyss for more
than two years as community groups and the stations fought over the
matter and enlisted a variety of lawmakers to lobby on their
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the letters prompted an unusual response from the
chairman of the FCC suggesting that they were inappropriate. And
other officials said the tone of the letters made it clear to them
that McCain wanted the deal approved, even if he did not say so
explicitly.
</P>
<P>
   The letters are among dozens of inquiries sent to the FCC from
McCain over the years concerning regulatory matters, many of which
were disclosed in response to a Freedom of Information Act request
by The New York Times. The letters show that in a number of other
instances, McCain's requests to the agency involved companies that
were campaign contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respectfully request that the commission act on these
applications at its regularly scheduled monthly meeting in December
if it has not acted on them in the interim,'' McCain wrote on Nov.
17, in the Paxson case. ``If in your judgment the commission cannot
meet this request, please advise me of this fact in writing with a
specific and complete explanation, no later than Nov. 18.'' After
learning that the commission still had not acted, McCain wrote
again on Dec. 10, demanding that the commissioners explain why they
had not voted.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, McCain portrayed his action as routine and
insisted that he had done nothing wrong. He even brought up the
matter himself at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire on Wednesday
morning and used it as an example of how the campaign finance
system causes actions by politicians to be viewed with suspicion, a
theme he repeated several times during the day. ``Everything we do
is under a cloud of suspicion,'' he said at one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Mr. Paxson, but I know lots of people who come to me
and say that they are not being treated fairly by the
bureaucracy,'' he said. ``But we are all tainted, because there is
so much money washing around. That's an argument for campaign
finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All citizens deserve their government to work,'' he added. ``I
think it's entirely appropriate for me to say, `Will you make a
decision after two years?' It wasn't that complex.'' He also
criticized the FCC, saying it had ``the worst reputation of any of
the bureaucracies and at the same time they're the most
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, McCain's campaign distributed letters that McCain sent to
regulators over the years complaining of inaction.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's chief rival, George W. Bush, did not use the disclosure
to criticize McCain head-on, although he suggested that the
senator's action did not comport with his views on reforming the
campaign finance system. ``I think somebody who makes campaign
finance an issue has got to be consistent, and walk the walk,''
Bush said at a New Hampshire campaign appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers said they were surprised that McCain would make
requests over specific matters considering that his political
career faced its greatest challenge more than a decade ago after he
intervened with federal regulators on behalf another campaign
contributor, Charles Keating, an Arizona executive whose savings
and loan failed at a cost to taxpayers of $2 billion. A Senate
ethics investigation ultimately concluded that McCain had
``exercised poor judgment,'' but violated no ethics rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is hypocritical on the issue of money and
politics,'' said Jerold M. Starr, the co-chairman of the Save
Pittsburgh Public Television Campaign, which has been trying to
block the transfer of the public television station.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a clear case of him responding to special pleadings of
monied interests and it is harmful to the public interests of this
community,'' Starr said. ``We lose a valued public television
station that was the only truly public station in this community,
and $17 or $18 million dollars gets turned over to a conservative
evangelical station that embodies the opposite of the principles of
public television.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr and others filed an ethics complaint with the FCC
contending that the companies and McCain broke the rules by failing
to provide all interested parties with copies of his letters. The
letters first surfaced in Pittsburgh newspapers last month.

IN NO HURRY, ISRAEL-SYRIA TALKS EDGE TOWARD SPECIFICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. _ On the third day of talks, Israeli and
Syrian officials Wednesday slowly began tackling specific questions
of how they might normalize relations.
</P>
<P>
   They also took up security arrangements, with an eye to
persuading Israeli voters to approve a return of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Enhanced U.S. military guarantees to Israel in case of attack
are among the topics, a senior Clinton administration official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Such guarantees would represent a significant deepening of the
informal understanding now in place, but they would stop short of a
formal treaty, that official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first serious, businesslike day,'' said State
Department spokesman James Rubin on Wednesday afternoon. Later, he
said U.S. officials were frustrated that the talks were moving
slowly and that few new ideas had been offered. He called the
negotiations ``a creaky machine that needs to be geared up,'' and
suggested that President Clinton might return Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the four committees set up to discuss specific issues met
for the first time Wednesday, to deal with bilateral relations and
security. Two others will be meeting in the near future, Rubin
said. One is to draw new borders, and the other is to take up the
related issue of Syria's access to water, especially the Sea of
Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the tight news blackout, almost all information is
coming from U.S. officials who are being extraordinarily careful
not to divulge specific details of the talks. The Israeli and
Syrian delegations are confined to a hotel and conference center
and have been stripped of their cell phones. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The slow pace raised speculation that this round of talks will
continue into next week. There have been periodic reports that
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa might return to their home countries over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and al-Sharaa had no plans for a face-to-face meeting
Wednesday. On Tuesday, they met for an hour with President Clinton.
But they are sharing the same floor of the Clarion Hotel in
Shepherdstown, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright shuttled
between them Wednesday, meeting Barak for lunch and Shara later.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings were the first time that the committees, each with
delegates from Israel, Syria and the United States, began to
discuss substantive issues.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But in a measure of how hard-fought the issues are, Israel and
Syria still jockeyed a bit on the question of what some of the
committees are called.
</P>
<P>
   One, for example, was termed by Rubin the committee on Normal
Peaceful Relations. That is a loaded term for the Syrians, who have
made clear that they do not want to normalize diplomatic relations
to the point where an Israeli flag might fly over an embassy in
Damascus, or that Israeli businesses would operate freely in Syria.
</P>
<P>
   There have been similar disagreements about what the State
Department calls the Security Committee. That panel is presumably
to discuss what security measures _ troop pullbacks, early warning
systems and similar steps _ would compensate Israel for the loss of
the Golan Heights buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
   But Syrian officials have been using phrases like the
``reciprocal and equal security arrangements committee,''
suggesting that they may be seeking more than just a restoration of
the Golan Heights, which it lost in the Arab-Israeli war of 1967.
</P>
<P>
   The security arrangements hinge to some degree on what
intelligence both countries could receive from a monitoring station
on the Golan Heights that might be staffed by Americans, perhaps
with Israeli and Syrian observers. But the arrangements may also
take the form of U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has begun informal discussions with Israel
over the provision of AWACS surveillance planes, missiles and other
upgraded military systems to make a return of the area more
acceptable to the Israeli public. Israeli press reports suggest
that Barak wants an aid package that could be valued at more than
$17 billion, a figure that would probably face considerable hurdles
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He would also like more formal assurances of how the United
States would go to Israel's aid in times of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Although that idea has come up many times before, Israeli
leaders are split about the wisdom of such a treaty, suggesting
that it could restrict Israel's options and its ability to sell
arms to countries like China, sales that regularly prompt
objections in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also reports, inside and outside Shepherdstown,
that Syria might also receive some aid to build up its security
forces, though presumably on a smaller scale and of less
sophistication than help to Israel. Any military aid to Syria would
face opposition in Congress. And even within the Clinton
administration, some officials said they believed that the White
House could not provide aid to a country that it has long accused
of harboring and aiding terrorists.

DUELING AGENDAS HERALD FIGHT FOR CONTROL OF CONGRESS
</HEADLINE>
  (Capitol Hill Memo column)  
(rk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The battle for control of Congress officially began
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At opposite ends of Pennsylvania Avenue _ on Capitol Hill and at
the White House _ Democrats and Republicans sketched out competing
legislative visions that will dominate the congressional calendar
and campaigns this election year.
</P>
<P>
   Two dozen House Republicans commemorated the fifth anniversary
of taking control of Congress by releasing a glossy brochure
heralding what they said were their accomplishments, among them a
balanced budget, welfare reform and a stronger military.
</P>
<P>
   What they did not say was just as striking. Republicans
mentioned the Contract With America only once in an hourlong news
conference. A 2 1-2 minute video shown to reporters featured
smiling children and even the Rev. Martin Luther King, but not Newt
Gingrich. The former speaker led Republicans out of their 40 years
in the political wilderness as the minority party, but his
scorched-earth tactics led to surprising losses in the 1998
elections and his messy divorce has deeply embarrassed many former
acolytes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Moses has been airbrushed out of the Bible,'' said
Marshall Wittmann, director of congressional affairs at the
Heritage Association, a conservative advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   At a White House news conference, President Clinton and the
Democratic leaders, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Sen. Tom
Daschle of South Dakota, took their share of the credit for the
nation's booming economy, soaring surpluses and lowest unemployment
figures in 30 years _ no doubt recurring themes this election
season.
</P>
<P>
   The three leaders emerged from a private meeting to announce
what they described as a united agenda that would include school
reconstruction money, targeted tax cuts, reforms in Medicare and
Social Security, a patients bill of rights, an increase in the
minimum wage and hate crimes legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced a beefed-up effort to rebuild the nation's
deteriorating school buildings. He said he would reintroduce a $3.7
billion federal tax relief program to help local school districts
float construction bonds backed by the federal government. The
initiative was blocked by congressional Republicans in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year can be a year of action,'' Gephardt said, ``not a
year of stalemate, not a year of standing still, not a year of
waiting for the election to come.''
</P>
<P>
   But election years are notorious for producing little
legislation of significance, and it is unclear this year will be
any different.
</P>
<P>
   The best hope may be for compromises on a minimum wage and a
patients' bill of rights. After that, the prospects dim
considerably for any meaningful effort to deal with Social
Security, Medicare or gun control, because both sides are likely to
be more concerned about using those issues to draw the lines in the
election debate.
</P>
<P>
   Under another theory, Clinton and congressional Republicans
could set aside their mutual animosity to hammer out some
legislative accomplishments. For opposite reasons, of course.
Clinton wants to burnish his legacy, while Republicans are eager to
produce enough accomplishments to earn voters' support in November.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democratic and Republican strategists discount that
strategy as counter to Clinton's chief goal of keeping a Democrat
in the White House, preferably Vice President Al Gore, and
regaining control of the House and maybe even the Senate. Democrats
relish the chance to run against a ``do-nothing'' Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Republicans, the primary objective is to do as little harm
as possible and get out of town early,'' said Wittmann. ``For
Democrats, it's to prevent any achievements and keep them in as
long as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the backdrop of Wednesday's dueling political events caught
the mood of the respective camps and foreshadowed what is likely to
be a running Washington melodrama this year.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans held their news conference in a dowdy
third-floor room at the Capitol Hill Club, a Republican redoubt.
After the event, Republicans began a two-day retreat to discuss
their legislative agenda. Sixty-three lawmakers, less than
one-third of the conference, volunteered to fly in during the
recess to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Gephardt and Daschle spoke to reporters at the White
House with the congressional math giving Democrats reason for hope.
House Republicans outnumber Democrats, 222-212, with one
independent usually voting with the Democrats., leaving them within
a net change of five seats of reclaiming the House. Republicans
have 21 open seats to defend; Democrats only six. In the Senate,
Democrats face a much tougher challenge, with Republicans
outnumbering Democrats, 55-45.
</P>
<P>
   So the focus is clearly on the House. Despite repeated
assurances Wednesday from Rep. J.C. Watts, an Oklahoma Republican
who organized this week's events, that Republicans would go the
offensive, the prevailing mood among many rank-and-file Republicans
seems to be simply to hang on to power.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jennifer B. Dunn, R-Wash., who served two years in the
minority before 1994, told reporters Wednesday, ``We don't ever
want that to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Republicans' revolutionary days of 1995 and the
Contract With America, tempered by the government shutdowns and
losses at the ballot box, have given way to cold-eyed pragmatism
and political survival.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Wednesday for the House Republican legislative
priorities, Watts ticked off a tax cut, the size of which would not
be determined for two or three mks, and vague pledges to
remove more American soldiers from food stamp rolls and to return
more control of education to local officials. An important refrain
Wednesday in the brochure and the news conference was something
they would not do: dip into the Social Security surplus. ``The
Republicans have been forced to a defensive strategy,'' said John
J. Pitney, a congressional scholar at Claremont McKenna College in
California. ``Given the narrowness of their majority, it's tough
for them to enact a strong Republican agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   One area where Democrats are vulnerable is trade. Votes on
landmark trade bills related to China's entry into the World Trade
Organization will likely be put off until June or later, Republican
lawmakers say, partly to push an issue that divides Democrats as
close to the November elections as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, congressional Republicans seem likely to end up
following the lead of their presidential nominee, even it means
adjusting their own priorities. Gov. George W. Bush, the party's
front-runner in national polls, has distanced himself from House
Republicans, some of whom have come across as partisan ideologues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our agenda ought to reflect the fundamental platform of our
most likely presidential nominee,'' said Rep. John Kasich, an Ohio
Republican who backs Bush. ``To muddle a message or not do much
would be a mistake.''

THE COMEBACK CURMUDGEON? PARCELLS SAYS NO . 
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Parcells said Thursday that he would not return as the
Jets' coach, even though Bill Belichick suddenly quit Tuesday, just
one day after being named Parcells' successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pretty adamant about not doing that,'' Parcells said.
``What I said the other day is what it's going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells made the statement even though the players want him
back, the coaches want him back and the fans want him back, too, at
least judging by the response at the last regular-season game on
Sunday when they shouted, ``One more year!'' For all anyone knows,
the new owner _ whoever that will be _ will spend more than $600
million to buy the team and will probably want him back, too.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells was reached in his office between meetings Wednesday
and would only comment briefly on the club and his future. But he
reiterated his statement of Monday, when he stepped down after
running the Jets for three years, insisting that he would not coach
football again.
</P>
<P>
   However, Parcells said, ``I'm on the job.'' He is still the
team's chief football operations officer, and in that capacity, he
said, he would be trying to find and hire a new coach.
</P>
<P>
   But a highly placed club official said Wednesday that no
coaching move would take place until the new ownership was in
place. Apparently, that will not happen until the trustees of the
estate of Leon Hess meet next week to approve one of the team's two
suitors. Then that potential owner would have to be approved at a
league meeting in New York on Jan. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells remained in command of the operations by holding a
meeting Wednesday of all his coaches at the Jets' training complex
in Hempstead, N.Y., where he told them of his plans to continue
searching for another coach.
</P>
<P>
   Among the potential replacements are two coaches from Parcells'
Jets staff _ his longtime friend Dan Henning, and Al Groh, who
coached with Parcells with the Giants and the Patriots. Parcells
has repeatedly praised the job Henning did with the quarterbacks
Vinny Testaverde and Ray Lucas. Highly praised coordinators from
around the league who might be attractive include Dom Capers of
Jacksonville and Gary Kubiak of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick was at home Wednesday, repeating his contention that
the only reason he had stepped down one day into his tenure was
because of the uncertainties surrounding the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you can answer this for me,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``Who's going to own the Jets? What's Steve Gutman's
role in this? What's Bill Parcells' role in this? Maybe someone
else has the answers. I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutman, the club president, has contended that those questions
were addressed 10 months ago in a meeting with the late Leon Hess,
and that Belichick had understood the answers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Belichick acknowledged Wednesday that in his news conference
Tuesday he was ``a little long winded in the beginning. What I was
trying to do was answer some questions and give a little
background.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his coaching future, Belichick said: ``I haven't
thought about it at all. All I can deal with is the situation
that's at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   He is widely believed to be interested in moving to the New
England Patriots. But when asked about that possibility or his
potential role there, he said ``I don't know anything about that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about that,'' he said of his resignation. ``This
is about my situation with the Jets, and it's not tied to anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also turmoil at the Patriots' headquarters. The
Patriots dismissed Pete Carroll on Monday, and within an hour a
club vice president sent a fax to the Jets asking for permission to
interview Belichick to be the team's coach and general manager. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That set in motion a chain of events that led to Belichick's
resignation, his lawyer threatening a grievance against the Jets
for not allowing him to interview with New England, and Jets'
front-office people muttering about New England tampering with
Belichick before he was named head coach. But as of late Wednesday,
the league had received neither a grievance from Belichick against
the Jets, nor one from the Jets against the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The league has already upheld the Jets' right, according to the
contract, to forbid another club from talking to or hiring
Belichick, setting the stage for a a replay of the 1997 face-off
when the Jets and the Patriots dueled for weeks over Parcells'
services.
</P>
<P>
   National Football League Commissioner Paul Tagliabue eventually
helped broker a deal between the two teams that allowed Parcells to
move to the Jets in return for draft choices sent to the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Now it seems that the Jets are expecting the same from New
England; if the Patriots want to sign Belichick they will probably
have to work out a deal with the Jets. ``If someone else wants Bill
Belichick, I'm pretty sure they're going to have to pay,'' said the
Jets' highly placed official.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, New England went about its business as if Belichick
would not be available. Wednesday, the Patriots interviewed the
Raiders' defensive coordinator, Willie Shaw, for the head coaching
post. They were expected to interview the Ravens' offensive
coordinator, Marvin Lewis, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Jets, offensive tackle Jason Fabini, used the words
``bizarre'' and ``weird'' many times in describing the events of
Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled Parcells telling the entire team he was stepping
down, that Belichick would replace him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was weird that after Coach Parcells retired, that
Coach Belichick didn't at least address the team,'' Fabini said.
``After Parcells said what he had to say and left the room, there
was a lull of 10 or 15 seconds. We're waiting for Coach Belichick
to come in and address us, and tell us something, which was sort of
weird, you know. After a while, we just got up and left.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Fabini was in the trainer's room watching
television and what he thought was going to be Belichick's first
public comment as the new coach. Instead, Belichick resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Jumbo,'' said Fabini, speaking of teammate Jumbo
Elliott. ``He didn't know what was going on. He thought I was lying
to him. I said, `John, have you turned on the TV at all?'''

TITLE MATCH GAME STRADDLES COLLEGE FOOTBALL'S PAST AND FUTURE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ The last college football season of the 20th
century followed a compelling script right down to its potent final
act: a national title matchup that should bury any notion that the
game needs a playoff system.
</P>
<P>
   Two undefeated teams _ one a perennial power, the other an
upstart from the hills _ were left to play in the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   When the hitting was done Tuesday night, the power, Florida
State, had withstood the upstart, Virginia Tech, 46-29, in a game
that straddled the past and the future of the college game.
</P>
<P>
   For those who remember Knute and Bear, there was an old coach,
the 70-year-old Bobby Bowden, completing his first undefeated
season with the obligatory shoulder ride from members of a 12-0
team that had done what no other had done before it. The team
finished the season where it had started it: ranked No. 1 in both
the coaches' and news media polls.
</P>
<P>
   For those trying to predict what the Four Horsemen and the
Galloping Ghosts of the next 100 years might look like, there was
Virginia Tech's 19-year-old quarterback, Michael Vick. A mere
freshman, he already appears blessed with computer-enhanced running
and passing skills overwhelmingly perfect for this high-speed
digital age.
</P>
<P>
   More time-tested melodramas also played out on the artificial
turf in the Sugar Bowl title game. Florida State's Peter Warrick
acted out a redemptive story line and encapsulated his difficult
year on the game's final score.
</P>
<P>
   With Florida State leading, 39-29, Warrick went into the huddle
and asked, ``Y'all want me to finish them?''
</P>
<P>
   He did just that by running under a 43-yard pass, juggling it as
the Hokies' Malcolm Tatum interfered with him, but still managed to
hold on for his second touchdown catch of the game to go with a
59-yard touchdown on a punt return. Moments later, Warrick's
brashness dissolved when he knelt on the Florida State sideline and
cried.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in the title game at the Fiesta Bowl, Warrick caught
only one pass as the Seminoles lost to Tennessee. Then, when he
decided to pass up the big money of the National Football League
and return for his senior year, Warrick was hailed as representing
everything that was right about college football. But by midseason,
he became an icon for what was wrong with college football when he
was arrested for a department store scam in which he and a teammate
paid $21.40 for more than $412.38 of designer clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick served a two-game suspension, pleaded guilty to a
misdemeanor and watched the Heisman Trophy and most other
high-profile post-season awards slip through his fingers. All year
he reminded himself of why he had returned to school: to graduate
and win a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 18, he earned a degree in political science. Tuesday
night, he was named most valuable player of the Sugar Bowl and his
team was crowned the national champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way it was supposed to end,'' Warrick said.
</P>
<P>
   In the other locker room, the Hokies did what losers in big
games usually do, what Florida State did last year: they wept.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a pretty good cry in there a few minutes ago,''
Virginia Tech Coach Frank Beamer said.
</P>
<P>
   By turning a 28-7 deficit into a 29-28 lead late in the third
quarter, the Hokies may have reduced critics of the Bowl
Championship Series to tears. As Virginia Tech earned its way here
by winning week after week, the chorus for a college playoff once
more got louder.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints? The Hokies played a weak schedule. They were
from a second-tier conference, the Big East. The BCS formula, which
calculates the polls, computer rankings and strength of schedule,
was too complicated. But behind Vick, who threw for 225 yards and
ran for another 97, Virginia Tech showed why it belonged in the
title game.
</P>
<P>
   The Hokies were talented. They were tenacious. They lined up
without their second-leading receiver, Ricky Hall, who dislocated
his wrist last week. They lost their 1,000-yard rusher, Shyrone
Stith, after 68 first-half yards, to an ankle sprain. His
replacement, Andre Kendrick, rumbled for another 69 yards. They
pushed Florida State hard.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, the BCS attained its goal of
matching the two best teams in the nation, because it understands
that in a short, intense season, every Saturday is a playoff game.
Both the oldest and the youngest players on the field understood
this, as well as they understood that Virginia Tech is a budding
power on a rapidly shifting college landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be back in this game again,'' said Bowden, who knows
something about building programs after 13 straight years of 10 or
more victories in a season and two national titles.
</P>
<P>
   Vick agreed. ``It was a great season,'' he said. ``If I could go
back I wouldn't change nothing. When we came back you saw the heart
of our team and how much we wanted to win. We'll get here again.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a good bet that future title games will have even more
fresh faces. Along with the usual suspects, Nebraska (No. 2 in the
New York Times computer ranking, No. 3 in the A.P. poll) and
Michigan (No. 3 in The Times' ranking and No. 5 A.P.), other
upstarts cracked the top 10: Wisconsin (No. 8 in The Times and No.
4 A.P.), Kansas State (No. 7 in The Times, No. 6 A.P.) and the only
other undefeated team in the nation, Marshall, finished No. 10 in
both polls.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden understands better than most how hard it is to be
perfect. In his 34 years, he has coached 10 teams that have
finished the season with one loss.
</P>
<P>
   For the 24 years he has coached at Florida State, Bowden has
kept an empty picture frame on his desk waiting for a photograph of
his first undefeated team. Now he has it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a milestone,'' Bowden said. ``I could've gone the rest of
my life and not had it happen.''  &QL;

 &HT;    Top Bush strategist says McCain victory unlikely
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Three weeks before the voting begins, the top
strategist for Gov. George W. Bush's presidential campaign says
there is no way that Arizona Sen. John McCain can win the GOP
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove also believes that McCain's strategy, targeted at four
states, is fatally flawed. Bush would be flogged in the media if he
had plotted anything less than a nationwide strategy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is that Bush is entering the 2000
election season in a stronger position than any candidate in the
history of an open presidential race on the Republican side,'' said
Rove, citing Gallup Poll numbers giving Bush a 46-point nationwide
lead over McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Rove's confident comments come as McCain has begun chipping away
at the most important thing Bush has had going for him _ an aura of
inevitability fueled by record-breaking fund-raising and poll
numbers. Rove's comments could be an attempt to smother McCain's
momentum but they also could backfire if Bush supporters become
overconfident less than three weeks before voting begins.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who is skipping Iowa's season-opening Jan. 24 caucuses
and Delaware's Feb. 8 primary, has a lot riding on the Feb. 1 New
Hampshire and Feb. 19 South Carolina primaries. McCain is counting
on wins there leading to follow-up victories in Arizona and
Michigan on Feb. 22. Such a strategy has been used with varied
success by lesser-known or lesser-funded candidates who seek to use
early, regional successes to build credible candidacies. It helped
Jimmy Carter win the presidency in 1976 and Michael Dukakis win the
Democratic nomination in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky said the four-state strategy is
working for the senator. He pointed to a report Wednesday in the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer that the Bush campaign plans to spend as
much as $2 million on television ads there to guarantee a victory
in the days leading up to the crucial March 7 California contest.
The report quoted Bush Washington consultant John Meyers saying,
``I've been told we're the firewall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the McCain strategy is working because Bush's
firewall keeps sliding further and further back,'' Opinsky said
Wednesday. ``Soon, it may be in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove, generally considered the chief strategist of Bush's
campaign, says he is not impressed with McCain's game plan, even if
he somehow pulls it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're prepared to fight everywhere, to contest the nomination
in every single state,'' Rove said. ``In Iowa, McCain is not
fighting. There are 13 early contests and the best that they can
say is that they hope to do well in four of them. We hope to do
well in 13.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The question will be, over the course of the primary season,
who is able to compete nationally and has a broader base of support
in the Republican Party?'' Rove said. ``The answer is George W.
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there is any way that McCain can win the nomination,
Rove offered a definitive ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Bush is the candidate whose message has drawn a record
amount of support among Republicans across the country,'' said
Rove, whose man has raised more than $67 million _ compared to
McCain's $15.6 million _ and obliterated the fund-raising records.
</P>
<P>
   Rove believes the race is effectively over if Bush wins South
Carolina, though it will be up to McCain and magazine publisher
Steve Forbes to define defeat and figure out when to fold.
</P>
<P>
   Rove also criticized McCain's decision to skip Iowa. ``The first
contest out of the box he is not a participant in. That's their
problem,'' Rove said. ``Bush is the front-runner and the
front-runner has a responsibility to run everywhere. Imagine what
the response would be if the front-runner said, `Well, I'm too weak
to compete in Iowa and Delaware, and don't count on me to be a real
force in North Dakota or Virginia or Washington state, and don't
expect me to organize in 35 or 40 states of the country. I'm really
focused on four states.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a staple of the Bush campaign has been almost daily
releases touting growing organizations in every state.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign believes it has a solid back-up strategy if
McCain somehow wins New Hampshire and South Carolina, where the
most recent polls show McCain gaining ground, but Bush maintaining
a solid lead. Bush advisers hope to exploit McCain's lackluster
support in his home state of Arizona, where polls show a tight
battle, a scenario that doesn't bode well for the native son.
Regardless of the outcome, Bush may be positioning himself to
declare victory in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Bush advisers also note that McCain still is not on the ballot
in New York, a crucial state that requires petition signatures in
each of 31 congressional districts, and contend that Forbes has
been unsuccessful in using his personal fortune to soften up Bush
for the lesser-funded McCain.
</P>
<P>
   While Rove practically proclaimed victory from his office in
Austin, Bush and McCain escalated their battle Wednesday in New
Hampshire over tax cuts, a sign that the Bush campaign is taking
McCain seriously. Bush has said on the stump that he knows he faces
a tough fight from McCain in the first-in-the-nation primary,
though he also said he believes he'll have the nomination wrapped
up by mid-March. Mark Sherman of Cox News Service and Jena Heath of
the Austin American-Statesman Washington staff contributed to this
report.

 &HT;    Cuban boy's return home to happen soon, INS says
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old boy who lost his mother
on a perilous voyage from Cuba and then became the center of an
international tug-of-war, should be returned to his father in Cuba,
federal immigration officials announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This little boy who has been through so much belongs with his
father,'' Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris
Meissner said in Washington, D.C. ``It is the right decision
legally; it is the right decision morally.''
</P>
<P>
   But the move immediately touched off a fiery round in the battle
that erupted shortly after Elian was plucked from stormy seas off
Miami on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   While angry Cuban exile protesters gathered outside the Little
Havana home where Elian has been living with relatives here, the
boy's Miami relatives vowed to go to court to try to halt his
return to the Communist island.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want is the chance to explain the family's point of
view,'' said a tearful Marisleysis Gonzalez, Elian's cousin. ``His
mother risked her life for him to win his liberty, and I hope this
country will at least give us the opportunity to speak for him.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, broadcasters broke into regular programming on Cuban
state television to announce the decision, warning the Cuban people
not to be too optimistic yet. There was no immediate reaction from
Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, or from Cuban leader Fidel
Castro.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D.C., President Clinton praised what he called a
tough decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you when we started this that I would do my best to
keep this decision out of politics,'' Clinton said. ``We have done
that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of Wednesday's swirling mix of politics and
emotion, Elian attended a Miami elementary school. Relatives, after
being told of the announcement by INS officials, hustled him off to
an undisclosed location.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this point, he doesn't know what's going on,'' his cousin
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dramatic announcement, the boy's immediate fate was
still somewhat uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   While Meissner gave a Jan. 14 deadline for the Elian's return to
Cuba, she left open exactly how the transfer will take place. U.S.
immigration officials will give Elian's father a special visa to
come to Miami to get him or will allow a third party, perhaps a
religious organization, to take the boy to Cuba, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our hope that with the knowledge of today's decision,
the Miami relatives will agree to cooperate and work together with
either Elian's father or a third party to facilitate Elian's return
to his father,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, reports said Elian's father has requested the
National Council of Churches bring the boy back to Cuba.
Representatives of the group met with the father in Cuba earlier
this week and offered to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials do not anticipate forcibly removing Elian
from his Miami relatives, Meissner said. It is also an image
Clinton administration officials desperately want to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   But the family clearly seemed reluctant to give up the fight,
and leaders of Miami's volatile exile community promised protests
that might spread across the city and disrupt traffic in coming
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want is to paralyze the legal process,'' said Ramon
Sanchez, a leader of the anti-Castro Democracy Movement in Miami.
``We hope we don't have to get to the point of paralyzing the city,
but we have that ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives said they sent letters after
Meissner's announcement to Clinton and U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno requesting an asylum hearing for the boy. If there is no
favorable response, they will file a federal lawsuit asking for an
injunction to halt Elian's return to Cuba. Several legal scholars,
however, said the family has little hope of prevailing in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not the slightest hint of unfitness of the father,''
said University of Miami law Professor David Abraham, an
immigration expert.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Elian's father reportedly maintained a close, loving
relationship with the boy, even after he and Elian's mother
divorced. Family photos show them in loving embraces, and neighbors
said Juan Miguel Gonzalez has been heartbroken at his son's ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   The father has said he was unaware Elian's mother, Elizabeth,
was planning to flee Cuba. She and nine others drowned when their
17-foot aluminum boat capsized in the Caribbean. Elian was rescued
after clinging to an inner tube for two days.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives say the father should come to Miami to
present his facts in a court of law, but Gonzalez has told
reporters he is reluctant to make the trip because he fears he
might be attacked.
</P>
<P>
   The case has been one of the most dramatic examples of the
poisonous relations between Miami's Cuban exiles and the Castro
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should he go back to Cuba?'' said Alex Ramirez de
Arellano, who stood outside the home of Elian's relatives
Wednesday. ``If he goes, he'll be eating dog food with no future.''
</P>
<P>
   But another Miami Cuban who lives near the Gonzalez home said
she believes blood is thicker than politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shouldn't be a political problem,'' Tanay Alonso said.
``I'm Cuban, but I'm a parent. If something should happen to my
husband, I'd want my kids to be with me.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW ORLEANS _ Peter Warrick should have won the Heisman Trophy and
the Biletnikoff Award. But a brush with the law cost him what would
have been a monthlong trek across the country to pick up a
collection of trophies and plaques proclaiming him the best college
football player in the country.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At every stop along the way, he would surely have given the
obligatory speech saying how he would trade each honor for a
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been similar to the speech he gave after the
Florida State Seminoles earned the school's second national title
with a 46-29 win over Virginia Tech in the Sugar Bowl on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means so much more,'' Warrick said. ``I came back to
school for two reasons: to graduate and to win the national title.
I've done both. Now I'm ready for the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   That was evident Tuesday. In the fourth quarter, with the Hokies
on the ropes and Florida State having just taken over the ball at
the Virginia Tech 43-yard line, Warrick asked his offensive linemen
if they wanted him to put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   They answered in the affirmative, and as if on cue from Florida
State fans, who had just begun chanting his name, Warrick put the
score out of reach with a diving, fingertip catch for a touchdown
over Ronyell Whitaker, who was flagged for interference on the
play.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick's grab was one of a host of thrilling plays in the Bowl
Championship Series title game that brought a close to the 1999
season, albeit four days into the new year.
</P>
<P>
   The game wrapped up an unusual season in that Florida State
became the first school to be ranked No. 1 in the preseason poll,
which began in 1950, and hold that top spot the entire season. The
Seminoles added a national crown to the one they won in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In the final Associated Press poll, the Seminoles (12-0)
garnered all 70 first-place votes. Virginia Tech (11-1) edged out
Nebraska (11-1) for second.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin, which beat Stanford in the Rose Bowl behind Heisman
Trophy winner Ron Dayne, finished fourth. Michigan, Kansas State,
Michigan State, Alabama, Tennessee and Marshall rounded out the top
10.
</P>
<P>
   Texas and Texas A&AMP;M, which took sound bowl whippings, finished
No. 21 and No. 23, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The season that started as early as any ever had in August ended
as late as any had in January with the highest-scoring Sugar Bowl
on record. In a rock-'em-sock-'em game, each team had four plays
cover 40 yards or more, with Warrick and Virginia Tech quarterback
Michael Vick trading blows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be wild, but not that wild,'' said Virginia
Tech cornerback Ike Charlton, who chipped in a 46-yard punt return
to set up a Tech score.
</P>
<P>
   While Warrick may have had his golden moment _ six catches for
163 yards and two scores, a 59-yard punt return for another score
and the Sugar Bowl Most Valuable Player honor _ and ridden off into
the sunset, his head coach said that will not be the case for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where does a 70-year-old man ride off into the sunset?'' FSU
coach Bobby Bowden asked Wednesday morning. ``Is there some saloon
somewhere I don't know about?''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden has fielded questions on his possible retirement since
the season began, but he steadfastly denies he has given it any
contemplation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still enjoy recruiting, I enjoy working with these young
guys, I enjoy winning, I enjoy setting a game plan to try to beat
the other team
</P>
<P>
   and I like the paycheck,'' Bowden said. ``My wife especially
likes the paycheck. There's just no desire for me to get out, you
know. So many people retire and die.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, who took his first head coaching job at Samford in 1959,
said that although some of his former players are now in their 60s,
he still feels the same excitement before a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the same way the night before this one as I did South
Georgia College vs. Middle Georgia College in 1955,'' Bowden said.
``I was just as excited, wanted to win just as much and couldn't
sleep any better then than I was able to (the night before) playing
for the national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   His excitement peaked Tuesday as his team finished off a 12-0
season, his first unbeaten year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had lost, boy, I would have caught heck,'' Bowden said.
``But this one was more special than the first. That one was a
relief _ you know, will he ever win one? This one was an
accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he promised to strut for at least a week before getting
back to work, it didn't take Bowden long to start thinking about
how good next year's Seminoles could be. At present, they lose only
four starters on each side of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, junior All-America kicker Sebastian Janikowski has
already said he will leave early for the NFL, and it is expected
27-year-old quarterback Chris Weinke will do likewise, although
Bowden is doing his best to convince him to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I benefit from it, but I believe he may do better
and be in a better draft position if he comes back here and plays
every snap for 12 games,'' said Bowden, who believes there is a
50-50 chance of Weinke's returning.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden has had continuity on his coaching staff for some time,
but assistant head coach Chuck Amato, who has been at Florida State
for 18 seasons, is a candidate for the vacant head coaching
position at North Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest loss by far, however, will be Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we could have gone unbeaten this season and
won that game against Virginia Tech without him,'' Bowden said.
``You'd like to think someone else would have stepped up and made
the plays, but you can't say that. He does too many things better
than anyone else can.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ Sen. Edward Kennedy provided a jolt of energy
for Vice President Al Gore on Wednesday, delivering a spirited
endorsement that put a decidedly liberal face on the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   From the campaign's point of view, Kennedy proved so
inspirational that Gore plans to take the Massachusetts senator
with him to Iowa on Friday for events before his debate on Saturday
with former Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy appeared with Gore twice on Wednesday, first at a school
in the Dorchester section of Boston, then at a center for the
elderly here in New Hampshire, where Gore and Bradley are in a dead
heat in polls leading to the Feb. 1 primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome the opportunity to come back to our neighboring
state of New Hampshire to give my wholehearted, enthusiastic,
unequivocal support to an old friend, a great vice president and
the next president of the United States, Al Gore,'' Kennedy said at
a news conference here. The event drew more than 75 members of the
press, the largest crowd since Gore announced his candidacy in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Gore's father, the late Albert Gore Sr., a longtime
senator from Tennessee, Kennedy said: ``The Gore family represents
the best in public service. There is no family that has given more
to the public interest of our country than the Gores of
Tennessee.''
</P>
<P>
   The connections between the two leading liberal families go way
back. Gore's father was a prominent defender of Kennedy after a
young woman drowned in Kennedy's car at Chappaquiddick in 1969. And
Kennedy held a major fund-raiser for Al Gore Sr.'s unsuccessful
re-election bid in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   In fact the Kennedy connection was used against Gore's father,
whom Republicans branded ``the third senator from Massachusetts''
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have similar thoughts this year. ``This will play
great for us in the general,'' Bill Pascoe, a spokesman for the
Republican National Committee, said of the endorsement. ``For Gore
to be reaching that far left really is an indication of the
desperation of his campaign, and it will serve him poorly in the
general election.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign feels so sure-footed about Kennedy's national
popularity that Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman, said he had no
qualms if Republicans tried to tag Gore with the liberal label.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kennedy is very, very popular with progressive Democrats,
organized labor, women's groups, people who support raising the
minimum wage,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern raised by the Kennedy endorsement was that it
would underscore Gore as the candidate of the establishment just as
voters go to the polls in New Hampshire, a state with a maverick
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy confronted that concern head on with a fiery response,
saying that he had fought for several issues, including raising the
minimum wage and improving health and education, that were central
to working families.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to use a label of being part of the establishment,
and fighting for those matters day in and day out on the floor of
the United States Senate, I'm glad to take that kind of label,''
the senator bellowed as several Gore supporters cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's passionate defense of his role left Gore somewhat
speechless, and simultaneously highlighted the possibility that
Gore could appear diminished next to the larger-than-life senator.
</P>
<P>
   Gore seemed to sense this as he stepped to the microphone. ``I'm
very proud to, uh, have his endorsement,'' he said in a mock
monotone before giving up completely.

 &HT;    At-home workers: OSHA may dump old rules
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hoping to squelch fears over federal regulations on
at-home workers, U.S. Labor Secretary Alexis Herman on Wednesday
downplayed an agency letter to a Texas company on employers'
responsibility for the safety and health of telecommuters and
others who work from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Herman called for a national dialogue on new rules to
update 30-year-old regulations intended to protect employees. She
plans to meet as soon as next week with business and union leaders
to begin work on policies that will reflect the nation's changing
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the changing nature of work in the 21st century, we need
new rules for the road,'' Herman said Wednesday. ``What are the
right policies going forward in the future?''
</P>
<P>
   What's still unclear is whether Herman's action changed
employers' liability for at-home workers' safety.
</P>
<P>
   Herman cautioned in a written statement, ``Employers have the
responsibility for making sure that all employees work in safe and
healthful conditions'' _ even at home.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy stems from a Nov. 15 letter from the Labor
Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration in
response to a Texas employer's request for guidelines on dealing
with at-home workers. That letter touched off a debate over
governmental intrusion in the workplace and sparked fear that it
would curtail telecommuting.
</P>
<P>
   Herman said the letter was not intended as a new policy
statement. ``The letter has caused widespread confusion and
unintended consequences,'' Herman said. ``Therefore, I'm
withdrawing the letter.''
</P>
<P>
   One workplace expert said the controversy may be a good step in
opening a discussion of what role government should play in
governing the safety and health of workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to use outmoded ways of thinking about the
workplace and guidelines that were set up for another era and apply
them and have them slow down changes like telecommuting, which are
benefiting workers,'' said John Challenger, chief executive of
Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Herman said the OSHA regulations were intended to protect
workers against dangerous work sites, including homes. Of the
agency's usual 35,000 inspections annually, fewer than 10 are in
homes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Business and employee groups hailed Herman's retreat as a good
move.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the reasonable thing to do,'' said Bert Fridlin, Georgia
director of the National Federation of Independent Business.

FLORIDA OPENS DRIVE TO SPEED DEATH PENALTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SARA RIMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ As state lawmakers began meeting on
Wednesday in a special session to replace execution by the electric
chair with execution by lethal injection, one thing became clear:
the real debate lies not in that issue but in an accompanying
proposal to speed up the appeals process so death row inmates can
be executed more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The special session of the Legislature, convened by Gov. Jeb
Bush, comes after two highly publicized incidents in which a
malfunctioning chair resulted in particularly gruesome deaths,
raising philosophical questions about protections against cruel and
unusual punishment and Florida's ability to competently carry out
executions.
</P>
<P>
   But while legislators appeared ready to adopt a new method of
execution, they became locked in heated debate over a companion
proposal by the governor that would speed up the state's appeal
process for death row inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan would pattern the appeals process in Florida after
the one overseen by his brother, George W. Bush, in Texas, where
more people have been executed than in any other state in history.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's goal_ to reduce the time between sentencing and execution
from an average of 12 years in Florida to five _ has prompted a
remarkable outpouring from all sides of the issue. Wednesday's
session featured powerful statements from advocacy groups and
moving testimony from a wrongly imprisoned death row inmate.
</P>
<P>
   The high stakes politics were heightened by a remark by Brad
Thomas, the governor's top policy adviser on the death penalty.
``What I hope is that we become more like Texas. Bring in the
witnesses, put them on a gurney, and let's rock and roll,'' Thomas
told the St. Petersburg Times.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Thomas declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature is expected to vote on the issue this week. Even
the brevity of the session has raised concern among some lawmakers
who expressed reluctance to approve a complicated appeals bill in a
three-day special session.
</P>
<P>
   `` I think everybody should recognize if this thing blows up,
once again Florida's very, very poor track record on the death
penalty is going to show up again,'' said State Sen. Ron Klein,
D-Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Kendrick Meek, D-Miami, a former state trooper who is
in favor of the death penalty, characterized the session as
``microwave policy making,'' and accused his colleagues of bowing
to political pressure from the governor. ``Some of us need to go
see the wizard to get some courage around here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has also prompted opposition from legal experts
around the country, ranging from the American Bar Association and
death penalty lawyers to a retired Florida Supreme Court justice
and former prosecutor, who say the governor and some members of the
Republican-dominated legislature are trying to rewrite the state's
death penalty statutes virtually overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about an area of the law that beyond dispute is
both the most awesome in terms of its consequences and the most
complex as a procedural matter,'' said Elizabeth Semel, the
director of the American Bar Association's Death Penalty
Representation Project in Washington. ``You don't give full and
adequate consideration to the entire system of post conviction
review in the course of three days.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, 361 men and four women reside on Florida's Death Row. Since
1974, 20 death row inmates have been freed because of doubts about
their guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said that a speedier appeals process would ``reduce the
immoral delays that cause so much trauma to victims and cost
Florida's taxpayers millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   As Wednesday's session began, he reminded lawmakers that Florida
lags behind other states in its ability to impose the death
penalty, and said he was tired of what he described as the press
portraying ``that the people that believe in making the death
penalty more effective are somehow callous and cold.''
</P>
<P>
   The state is third in the number of executions behind Texas and
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who testified against changes in the appeals process
was Freddie Pitts, 55, a black man who was wrongly convicted, along
with another black man, Wilbert Lee, of the murder of two white gas
station attendants in Florida's Panhandle in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts and Lee spent 12 years in prison, more than nine of those
years on death row. They were both released in 1975, given full,
unconditional pardons by then-governor Reuben Askew after another
man confessed to the murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent nine-and-a-half years on Death Row, and I'm glad I'm
off,'' Pitts told the legislators. ``Had this law been in effect
when I was on Death Row, I would've been dead a long time ago.''
Pitts was calm and polite during his brief statement, but
elaborating on his feelings afterward, he said, ``I think they're a
bunch of ignorant, backwoods, redneck clowns bent on vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   There was little debate about the proposal to eliminate the
electric chair in favor of lethal injection, a move legal experts
say the Legislature was all but forced but to consider after the
U.S. Supreme Court agreed in November to review whether the state's
use of the electric chair amounts to cruel and unusual punishment.
The court's action brought executions in Florida to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   Of 38 states with capital punishment, only four require death by
electrocution. The Supreme Court agreed to the review after flames
erupted from the headpiece of one inmate and another condemned man
suffered a nosebleed in the electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents are concerned that imposing time or numerical limits
on appeals would lead to the execution of innocent inmates. Others
questioned the constitutionality of such limits as an intrusion on
the powers of the judicial branch.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Bob Butterworth, a Democrat, had raised
questions about the legislation designed to limit death case
appeals. But he threw his support behind the bill after the Senate
Criminal Justice Committee amended the legislation to allow inmates
to raise claims of innocence based on the discovery of new
evidence, regardless of time limits imposed by the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Butterworth, whose office represents the state in the appeal of
death cases, said the legislation ``is helping me do my job.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The bills to be considered during the special session also
include time limits on the filing of appeals and a dual-track
system to simultaneously file appeals instead of waiting until one
is done to file another.
</P>
<P>
   The last man to be executed in Florida, Allen Lee Davis, bled
all over himself when he was put to death July 8. Photographs of
his corpse with a contorted face contributed to a public outcry.
</P>
<P>
   In the current system, a convicted murder first has a chance to
file a direct appeal, which includes an examination of everything
in the record, transcripts, documents, evidence introduced at
court, prosecutors' arguments and judges' rulings. Then, if the
inmate loses the direct appeal, he has the chance to initiate a
second round of appeal _ the collateral appeal _ which involves
reinvestigating the entire case from scratch. This provides the
opportunity to unearth new evidence, to find witnesses who were
overlooked or who might recant, to examine the competence of the
defense lawyer, and to try to learn whether prosecutors withheld
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida inmates win a high percentage of their direct
appeals, making the second stage unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   This legislation requires that the first and second round of
appeals be filed at the same time. Often, years pass before the
second round is filed.
</P>
<P>
   Speeding up this process will add to the burdens of Florida's
already overburdened criminal justice system, and, according to
critics, willt make it more difficult for inmates who are not
guilty to prove their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it takes a certain amount of time to do one of these
cases,'' Ms. Semel said, referring to the second stage of a capital
appeal. ``They take hundreds if not thousands of hours of attorney
time to do them adequately.''
</P>
<P>
   Already Florida has problems _ huge numbers of cases, a shortage
of lawyers, years of not adequately funding the system of
representation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal to speed up the appeals process has been
criticized by editorial writers around the state, including The
Miami Herald, the St. Petersburg Times, the Fort Lauderdale
Sun-Sentinel and the Palm Beach Post.
</P>
<P>
   Also voicing opposition have been several retired Florida
Supreme Court justices, including Gerald Kogan who, as a
prosecutor, tried many capital cases and formerly favored the death
penalty. The Florida Supreme Court has been praised by lawyers for
its conscientious review of capital cases. Last year the court
reversed 76 percent of the capital cases it heard on direct
appeals, sending some back for new trial because of errors and
imposing a sentence of life in prison instead of death in others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that the system is flawed, that judges and lawyers
make mistakes,'' said Chris Spaulding, an assistant public defender
in Miami who has handled many death penalty appeals. ``This
legislation is trying to speed up the process without addressing
the fundamental errors that are being committed.''
</P>
<P>
   If the proposal is passed by the Legislature this week, and sent
to Gov. Bush for approval, it will most certainly result in
numerous legal challenges, legal experts say. ``It's a death
penalty lawyer's relief act,'' said Steve Hanlon, a partner in the
state's largest law firm, Holland &AMP; Knight, in Tallahassee. ``It
will tie up death penalty cases in litigation for years.''

<P>
   DETROIT _ Automakers sold 16.89 million cars and trucks in the
United States last year, exceeding a record set in 1986 by more
than 800,000 vehicles, according to sales results released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The strong sales, up 5.2 percent from the previous record 13
years earlier, helped many automakers earn what are expected to be
record profits.
</P>
<P>
   Despite increased sales, however, both Ford and DaimlerChrysler
lost market share over the course of the year. General Motors eked
out a small gain over its results in the previous year, which had
been plagued by a lengthy strike, but failed to meet its own target
for market share, and finished 1999 with less than 30 percent for
the auto market for the first time since the 1920's.
</P>
<P>
   The big gainers were European-based automakers, led by
Volkswagen, and South Korean companies selling relatively
inexpensive cars, mostly to people who previously drove used cars.
</P>
<P>
   Purchasers spent freely in all ranges of the market, encouraged
by the long-running economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an extraordinary year,'' said Diane Swonk, chief
economist at Bank One Corp. ``As good as it was, it still was one
of the most brutally competitive markets.''

   Auto stocks were mixed in trading Wednesday. General Motors
closed unchanged at $71.625. Ford shares edged up 18.75 cents, to
$50.8125, and DaimlerChrysler gained 62.5 cents, to $74.875.
</P>
<P>
   Auto executives and economists predicted strong sales again this
year. ``A strong economy, confident consumers and innovative
products were the major factors driving our record-breaking sales
and earnings in 1999,'' said Robert Rewey, a Ford group vice
president. ``The good news is these factors are alive and well as
we kick off 2000.''

<P>
   General Motors said Wednesday that its December sales rose 6.2
percent, with car sales down 7.2 percent and the sales of pickup
trucks, minivans and sport utility vehicles up 21.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked very hard to profitably improve our mix this
year,'' said Roy Roberts, GM's group vice president for North
American vehicle sales, service and marketing. Last year,
high-profit trucks made up 49.3 percent of GM's sales, up from 46.7
percent in 1998. ``We said we'd improve mix, we did, and we will
continue to improve our mix in this highly competitive
marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   For the year, GM's car sales rose 5.5 percent, its truck sales
increased 12.8 percent and its overall sales rose 8.9 percent. That
was enough to nudge its market share to 29.45 percent, just above
the 29.4 percent share for 1998, when a strike shut down the
company for two months. But last year's 29.45 percent market share
was well below the 31.29 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   GM also predicted that industrywide sales this year would be
strong, even though the company does not expect to match 1999's
level.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said its December sales rose 3.2 percent, with cars 17.6
percent higher and sales of pickup trucks, minivans and sport
utility vehicles down 5.3 percent. That rounded out a year in which
Ford's car sales rose 9.4 percent and its truck sales rose 4
percent, for an overall gain of 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because the auto market was so strong, Ford's increase was not
sufficient to keep pace with industry sales, which rose 8.7 percent
over all. Total car sales for the industry were up 6.9 percent and
truck sales up 10.7 percent. As a result, Ford's market share fell
to 24.4 percent for the year from 25.5 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler also saw its market share drop, to 16.75 percent
last year from 17.25 percent in 1998. Sales rose 2 percent in
December.
</P>
<P>
   The decreasing market shares have led automakers to scrap for
customers by offering rebates, discount loans and cheap leases,
which in turn have helped keep sales high. On Tuesday, GM announced
it would offer discounts on almost all its cars and trucks, and
DaimlerChrysler said it might accept the coupons on its vehicles.
Ford was still considering its options Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Auto stock analysts said GM's move amounted to the first shot
across the bow in a price war. ``Clearly, the big competitors are
going to respond to GM's action and GM will respond to that
action,'' said John A. Casesa of Merrill Lynch. ``And we could see
some pretty heavy incentives by the spring selling season,
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's figures also showed that the Toyota Camry was again
the most popular car in the United States last year, with sales of
448,162. The Honda Accord was not far behind, with sales of
404,192, and the Ford Taurus was third, with sales of 368,327.
Outselling them all by a big margin were a couple of pickup trucks:
the Ford F-series pickups, with sales of 869,001, and the Chevrolet
Silverado, with sales of 636,150.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean automakers gained customers in 1999. Daewoo won 0.2
percent of the U.S. market in its first year selling cars here.
Hyundai saw its share rise from 0.58 percent in 1998 to 0.97
percent last and the share of Kia rose to 0.8 percent from 0.53
percent. Volkswagen, the biggest European gainer, saw its market
share rise to 2.26 percent last year from 1.72 percent in 1998. BMW
rose to 1.09 percent of the market from 0.98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some other large automakers struggled with market share. Toyota
declined to 8.73 percent from 8.76 percent last year, and Honda's
share fell to 6.38 percent from 6.5 percent.

 &HT;    EarthLink in deal with Apple to be Mac ISP
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ EarthLink Network, soon to be an Atlanta company, has
formed a partnership with Apple Computer to provide Internet access
to Mac users.
</P>
<P>
   Apple will invest $200 million in the Pasadena, Calif.-based
company slated to merge this month with MindSpring Enterprises of
Atlanta. Apple will get a seat on the EarthLink board plus a profit
each time an Apple customer signs up with EarthLink. The
announcement was made at the annual MacWorld expo.
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink will become the exclusive Internet service provider in
Apple's Internet software included with all Macintosh computers
sold in the United States. Once the merger is complete, the
EarthLink-MindSpring duo will be based in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``EarthLink and Apple share a passion for providing the
highest-quality Internet access to Macintosh users, and together
we're going to do it better than anyone else,'' said Apple Chief
Executive Officer Steve Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't given out any subscriber numbers related to how
many new members this deal will bring to us,'' said Kirsten
Hamling, EarthLink vice president of investor relations and
corporate communications.
</P>
<P>
   She added it was in the interest of both the companies to pair
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple announced their Internet strategy today, and we are a
big player in that space,'' she said. ``We think Apple has some of
the best products out there for the consumer. It's a great way to
get on the Internet and it's a great advantage for us to be Apple's
default ISP. When you boot up the computer, it asks you if you have
Internet access, and if you don't it hooks you up to EarthLink.''
</P>
<P>
   ``EarthLink has always done a lot of support for Apple in the
past, and the original Mac was one of EarthLink's first
platforms,'' said Jeff Sadler, an analyst with FAC Equities in
Boston. ``This is obviously a big package deal for them. It
certainly provides another venue for customer acquisition.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler said the benefits for Apple are acquiring a
well-respected Internet provider that the company can roll out to
all Mac users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple seems to have made a decision that it isn't going to
create its own ISP,'' Sadler said. ``And it wants to be closer to
its users, similar to the relationships Dell and Gateway have with
their users.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Apple having a seat on the EarthLink board, Sadler was
less sure what that will mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may depend on Apple's next-generation efforts on the
Web,'' he said. ``It's not about the oversight of a $200 million
investment. Apple may be trying to do some unique things with the
Web, and EarthLink may be a good testing ground for that. There's
obviously something more there than meets the eye.''

ECONOMIST NOW SAYS HIS GRIM Y2K RECESSION FORECAST WAS WRONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is best to offer regrets quickly and keep them short, and
that is what Edward Yardeni did this week.
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni, the chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, had
predicted that Year 2000 computer problems would cause a recession
this year by disrupting global supply chains, collapsing earnings
expectations for thousands of companies and popping the stock
market bubble.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the new year has arrived without notable computer
flaws, he has junked that forecast.
</P>
<P>
   In a short note posted on his web site Tuesday, Yardeni said,
``I concede that I was wrong about a Y2K global downturn.'' And, in
an interview Wednesday, he said he was joining the consensus crowd
with a forecast of robust economic growth this year.
</P>
<P>
   Though he made headlines with his Year 2000 forecast, Yardeni
was criticized by his rivals, some of whom dismissed his prediction
as absurd. But they also noted that on Wall Street one of the sure
ways to sell your views is to move to the extreme, which Yardeni
surely did.
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni said he wished he had listened to the people, even as
recently as November, who said that the advent of 2000 would be
uneventful where computers were concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``My regret is that there were some pretty credible people out
there saying that there wasn't going to be a problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed himself for being too focused on Year 2000 problems.
``I think I was too close to the issue,'' he said. ``I was focusing
on the weak links. What I failed to do was to realize there were
fewer and fewer of them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For example, he said his own November poll of the information
technology workers who were fixing the computer systems showed that
some 90 percent were optimistic about the outlook. But Yardeni said
that he put more weight on the answer to another question: when
those workers rewriting programs would finish their work. Fifty-six
percent said that they would need the last three months of the year
to finish, up from 43 percent in September and just 16 percent in
June.
</P>
<P>
   ``That swayed me,'' he said, as did reports from foreign
ministries and the State Department that said countries like
Russia, China and Italy, still faced problems.
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni, who has not finished the revision of his economic
forecast for this year, could provide only an outline. He said he
was going to join the consensus with a forecast of a 3.5 percent to
4 percent rise in the gross domestic product. He said he would be
below the consensus on inflation, predicting a 1 percent to 1.5
percent rise in the Consumer Price Index.
</P>
<P>
   Until the turn of the new year, Yardeni had forecast three
quarters of decline for the year, which would be a recession. His
old forecast had declines at an annual rate in the gross domestic
product, after adjustment for inflation, of 4.5 percent in the
first quarter, 3 percent in the second, 1 percent in the third and
a rise of 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That performance would have produced a decline in average growth
for this year of 0.1 percent compared with 1999, well below the 3.5
percent to 4 percent growth he is now forecasting. The reason the
annual decline is so much smaller than the quarterly figures in the
old forecast is that they are calculated at an annual rate for one
quarter but do not continue for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
   Does he regret having made the forecast? ``Looking back,'' he
said in his Web site note, ``I don't regret my efforts to raise
awareness. I believe that Y2K was a big problem. Hopefully, in the
next few weeks we will find that it has been mostly fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   He did acknowledge, however, that his bad forecast could hurt
him. ``It currently does,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think investors I deal with know that I think a lot outside
the box and that can lead to some good forecasts,'' he said. ``This
one was a crummy one.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``on Wall Street, we rarely look back.''  &QL;

PENGUIN PUTNAM CEO QUITS TO TAKE OVER AOL'S INTERNATIONAL
DIVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael Lynton, the executive who traded Hollywood
movies for New York book publishing, shifted industries again
Wednesday to become president of the international division of
America Online.
</P>
<P>
   After more than three years as the chief executive of Pearson's
book publishing arm, Penguin Putnam Group, Lynton, 40, said
Wednesday that he was leaving to explore his fascination with the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's evolving at such a rapid pace,'' he said. ``It's so much
a new media and becoming such a part of our lives that I would like
to be part of that evolution _ not to say that books are less
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynton will work in New York for America Online, but his
territory will include Europe, Asia and South America.
</P>
<P>
   There had been rumors for almost a year that Lynton had been
searching for a position with an Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   Lynton said that negotiations with AOL president Robert Pittman
had come together in the last few weeks. But he said a number of
Internet companies had approached him in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Before Lynton was picked in 1996 to head the Penguin Group, he
was president of Hollywood Pictures studio for Walt Disney Co. and
before that a senior vice president for publishing at Disney.
</P>
<P>
   At Penguin Group, Lynton acted more as a manager and ceded much
of the publishing responsibilities to Phyllis Grann, the company
president who had been head of the Putnam Berkley Group when it was
purchased by Penguin in 1996. Putnam executives so dominated
Penguin Putnam that there was a standing joke in the industry that
Penguin had been ``Putnamized.''
</P>
<P>
   With Lynton's departure, Pearson, the British media
conglomerate, announced a shuffle in its hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Penguin chief operating officer David Wan will replace Lynton,
but with the title of president instead of chief executive. Pearson
also promoted Ms. Grann and gave her an additional title: chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Wan, 45, is a former president of Simon &AMP; Schuster's school
publishing business, which was acquired by Pearson in 1998. In his
new role, he will preside over Penguin's business operations,
including financial performance and strategic development.
</P>
<P>
   An immediate goal, he said, is to ``expand the power and reach
of the Penguin brand and capitalize on the technology revolution
that is transforming the way books are produced and sold.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the company is pursuing several opportunities but
declined to be more specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there have been a lot of changes that have occurred in
publishing over all,'' Wan said, ``and Penguin has taken on a
number of initiatives.''

 &HT;    GORE, BRADLEY SHARPEN TONE IN FIRST 2000 DEBATE
 &HT;    540&AMP;adds.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.H. _ Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley sharpened their attacks on each other in a debate Wednesday
night that promises an increasingly hostile contest for the 2000
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong debate on a stage at the University of New
Hampshire was the first time the two candidates had faced each
other in several weeks. It kicked off an intense four-week period
leading to the nation's first presidential primary here Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The debate had barely begun when Bradley accused Gore of
deliberately distorting his health care proposals. Gore responded
that those proposals would leave many people in New Hampshire
``high and dry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a longtime champion of improved race relations, said
the vice president ``offended me'' by claiming his health care
proposals would hurt African-Americans and Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   Gore held aloft a card listing federal employee health plans
that he said would be unaffordable under Bradley's proposal and
contended many low-income people ``would be left out, left high and
dry.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore paraphrased Harry Truman: ``I'm not giving him hell. I'm
just telling the truth and they thinks it's hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the debate, Bradley continued his portrayal of Gore
as a creature of Washington, at one point offering to explain to
him ``how the private sector works.''
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested that Gore's remarks sounded like they came
from ``the bunker'' that the White House became during the
impeachment trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in turn, repeated his criticisms of Bradley _ that he quit
the Senate in 1996 rather than fight the Republican-led Congress
and that the former New Jersey senator views the presidency as an
intellectual exercise rather than a ``fight for all the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate grew even more pointed when the two candidates, after
fielding a series of questions from a panel of journalists, were
allowed to pose questions to each other in a format moderated by
ABC's Peter Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley asked Gore about his reluctance to support the licensing
of all guns. The vice president recounted the administration's
successes in banning assault weapons and closing gun show sales
loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley said Gore was reluctant to do more on the gun issue
because he feels it is ``too difficult to do.'' He suggested that
true leadership requires doing more than simply what first appears
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's question for Bradley focused on three key votes in his
Senate career: support for President Reagan's proposed budget cuts
in 1981, opposition to military force against Iraq's President
Saddam Hussein in 1990, and opposition to welfare reforms in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gore suggested that all three votes were ``mistakes'' and tried
to prod Bradley into such an admission. But the former senator said
that he still would not vote otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bradley did acknowledge one error: his 1987 vote
against confirmation of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, a
key figure in the unprecedented economic growth over the last
decade. ``Now that was a mistake,'' Bradley said to laughter from
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The only new policy area raised in the debate stemmed from a
question by Jennings about whether either candidate would use a
``litmus test'' on gay rights in appointing members to the military
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he would not appoint anyone to those posts unless they
supported his plans to allow gays to serve in the military.
Bradley, who also supports gays in the military, said he would
expect any military officer to obey orders from the president, the
nation's commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   Even the occasional humor had a bite to it. For example, when
Bradley said Gore's description of himself as an underdog in New
Hampshire's primary ``brings tears to my eyes,'' Gore retorted, ``I
hope my upset victory brings tears to your eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   And later, after Gore described Bradley as ``a genuinely good
man,'' Bradley replied, ``I agree. I think I'm a genuinely good
man.'' He did not extend a similar compliment to the vice
president, however.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, there were no questions about education, a hot
topic in New Hampshire. But both candidates fielded questions about
campaign finance reform, U.S. relations with Russia and China and
Clinton's extramarital relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the Democratic Party ``pressed the limits'' in its
fund raising in 1996, although he insisted that no laws were
broken. He also said he ``served the national interest well'' in
supporting Clinton during the impeachment trial. He insisted that
there had been major achievements in relations with Russia,
including new leadership ``committed to reform.'' And he said the
United States must ``demand the respect for human rights and
religious freedom'' from China.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said a president who lies ``undermines his own authority
and squanders the people's trust.'' He said politics is ``a noble
profession,'' despite public cynicism about it. He criticized the
Clinton administration's Russian policy as ``a missed opportunity''
and said the administration's failure to condemn the war in
Chechnya was ``politically irresponsible and morally reckless.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary is Feb. 1, less than
four weeks away, and Iowa's caucus, the first presidential voting
of 2000, is Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   The debate took place on the campus of the University of New
Hampshire, the same site of Thursday night debate of the six
contenders for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Bradley appeared at a rally of hundreds of
abortion rights activists, who assailed Gore's record as a
congressman from Tennessee nearly two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not need fair-weather friends,'' said Concord attorney
and Planned Parenthood member Lucy Karl.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who retired from the Senate in 1996, always voted with
abortion rights activists during his 18-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, as a House member from 1977 to 1985, voted with the
National Right to Life Committee 84 percent of the time _ including
votes against Medicaid coverage of abortion and for amending the
1984 Civil Rights Act to protect ''unborn children from the moment
of conception.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Gore went into Wednesday night's debate with a
very important endorsement _ that of Sen. Ted Kennedy, the leading
liberal voice of the Democratic Party and the head of its most
influential family.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, a party elder from neighboring Massachusetts, sought to
dispel the repeated suggestion from Bradley supporters that Gore
cannot be elected in the November general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respectfully disagree'' with Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., Kennedy said in his endorsement of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan endorsed Bradley last September, saying ``there's
nothing the matter with Mr. Gore, except he cannot win.'' Since
then, Bradley partisans have made the same argument.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's endorsement also sent an important signal to liberals
that Gore, despite his Southern moderate political heritage and
``New Democrat'' allegiances, is faithful to the party's
progressive heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy hailed the vice president as a proven leader on such
issues as education, health care, gun control, workers' rights and
the environment.

 &HT;    Bowden's 2nd title is sweeter
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Bobby Bowden is asked often why he remains in
coaching at age 70 instead of enjoying a comfortable retirement
with his 21 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   He stays in college football in order to enjoy moments like
Tuesday night's Sugar Bowl. Bowden's No. 1 Florida State Seminoles
beat No. 2 Virginia Tech 46-29 for his second national championship
and his first perfect season (12-0) in a coaching career that spans
more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It keeps you young,'' Bowden said Wednesday morning, just
hours after enjoying a celebration with his children and
grandchildren at the team hotel. ``I'm just as excited now as I was
when I started at South Georgia College in 1955. When I'm not
excited anymore, that's when I'll know to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State became the first team since The Associated Press
preseason poll began in 1950 to begin a season at No. 1 and stay on
top all season. ``We talked about that after we were named No. 1 in
August,'' Bowden said. ``I told our guys I thought we had the team
that could do it. But hanging on for that many games is another
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State was definitely hanging on in the third quarter of
Tuesday night's game, played before a crowd of 79,280, the largest
ever to see a football game at the Louisiana Superdome. After
Florida State led 28-7 in the first half, the brilliance of
Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Vick rallied the Hokies to a
29-28 lead with 2:13 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point I was thinking that the game might be slipping
away from us,'' Bowden said. ``And you wonder what your kids are
going to do, because they are the ones who have to make it
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State regrouped for an 85-yard touchdown drive to regain
the lead. Then, after a 32-yard field goal from Sebastian
Janikowski, All-America receiver Peter Warrick delivered the
knockout punch with a 43-yard touchdown catch from Chris Weinke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I learned more about my team last night than I ever
knew,'' Bowden said. ``What they did showed what kind of kids they
are. It really showed what they are made of.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick had the final college game that every player dreams
about. He caught touchdown passes of 43 and 64 yards and returned a
punt 59 yards for another score. His legal problems in October
helped cost him the Heisman Trophy and the Biletnikoff Award, but
he leaves Florida State with a degree and the MVP trophy in the
national title game.
</P>
<P>
   The championship takes Bowden to a higher level in his career.
Only two other active coaches, Joe Paterno of Penn State and Dennis
Erickson, now of Oregon State, have won two national titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first national championship (in 1993) was more of a
relief, to tell you the truth,'' Bowden said. ``This one feels like
more of an accomplishment. I think I'm going to enjoy this one a
lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   By Bowden's estimate, he will enjoy this national championship
``for about a week _ then we'll start talking about next season.''
</P>
<P>
   And next season looks pretty bright for the Seminoles, who have
posted 13 consecutive seasons of 10 wins or more. The key will be
the upcoming decision by junior quarterback Chris Weinke.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke, who threw for 329 yards and four touchdowns in Tuesday's
game, will turn 28 on July 31. The former pro baseball player could
jump to the NFL or come back to school and try to win another
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Chris comes back, we've got a chance to be pretty good
again,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty of the top 44 players in Tuesday's game could return next
fall. The Seminoles will miss Warrick, but they have a lot of
talent at receiver. The defense loses two great tackles in Corey
Simon and Jerry Johnson, but Florida State has talent behind them.
</P>
<P>
   If Weinke leaves, neither junior Marcus Outzen nor sophomore
Jared Jones has the arm to run the Florida State offense.
</P>
<P>
   But those questions can wait, at least a week, said Bowden, who
says he will have some fun with this championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``My speeches this spring are going to be a lot better than they
were last year,'' he said. ``And I imagine the golf will be a
little more fun, too.''

 McCAIN WANTS A `HIGHER PLANE,' BUT IS ACCUSED OF TAKING THE LOW(See also MCCAIN-FCC) 
(rk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Sen. John McCain urged presidential
candidates Wednesday to ``help turn the practice of politics toward
a higher plane.'' But his own campaign was soon accused by aides to
Gov. George W. Bush of practicing negative politics.
</P>
<P>
   McCain set down his challenge in a broad speech about
citizenship. Mentioning only Bush, the Republican front-runner, and
Vice President Al Gore by name, McCain said, ``let us lead by
example.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We should refrain from attacking each other,'' McCain
challenged the presidential contenders of both parties, ``directly
or through surrogates, with the negative advertising that has
disgusted the nation, and pledge ourselves to a high standard of
accuracy in discussions of our own agendas and those of our
opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke as the fight for the Republican nomination was
intensifying. McCain also found himself on the defensive over
charges that he had intervened with the Federal Communications
Commission to urge it to resolve a matter of interest to a
contributor. He insisted his actions had been ``entirely
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, McCain told voters: ``Judge us not by the
promises we make, the stories we tell, nor the ads we run. Measure
us, by all means, by the policies and proposals we lay forth for
your consideration. But judge us as well by the example we set; by
the way we conduct our campaigns; by the way we personally practice
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the same campaign stop, with McCain and Bush in an
escalating battle over tax cuts and Social Security, the senator's
aides distributed a ``backgrounder'' on the issues that seemed
jarringly at odds with his call for a different kind of politics.
</P>
<P>
   It was titled ``McCain's Mature Vision for America's Future vs.
Bush's Political Plan for the 2000 Election.'' McCain said later
that the flier should not have used that title. ``I just think it's
a cheap shot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides promptly went on the offensive and criticized the
entire flier as a ``woeful misrepresentation'' of Bush's positions.
``It's the same type of attack politics that the Democrats are
engaging in,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush, pointing
to the flier's contention that Bush's tax cut plan would use the
entire federal surplus and leave ``Social Security in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   He also took issue with its reference to Bush's tax cut proposal
as a ``Pioneer tax cut'' plan that would use 60 percent of the
surplus to give tax cuts to the top 10 percent of wage earners. The
Pioneers are Bush's top fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are attack terms,'' Fleischer said. ``That's what's
wrong with politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said that he would not dip into the part of the surplus
generated by Social Security revenue _ about $2 trillion over the
next decade _ for tax cuts. He would then use a large part of the
non-Social Security surplus to pay for his plan to cut taxes by
$483 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain has argued that if the economy does not perform
according to projections, the surplus could shrink and Bush's tax
cut could eat into the Social Security surplus or require an
increase in the Social Security payroll tax. ``If the projections
for the next 10 to 20 years don't hold true _ and you don't get the
surplus, and we've already cut taxes _ then you have to raid the
Social Security trust fund and have to raise payroll taxes,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Murphy, a political strategist for McCain said, ``All the
hysteria from the Bush campaign sounds like Clinton-type
defensiveness to me.'' Murphy said that the Bush camp had been
attacking McCain's tax cut plan for days. On Tuesday Bush charged
that McCain's tax cut proposals would provide less tax relief for
certain middle-class families than his own would.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
KAPALUA, Hawaii _ This is how crazy the Tiger Woods moveable feast
has gotten: After he devoured four consecutive victories to close
out the 1999 season, it will be bigger news when golf's best player
loses his next tournament than when he wins his next one.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's tough to gauge what has risen faster, the expectations for
Woods or the pressures placed on him to perform. In a new
millennium with new issues and even some new players, the 2000 PGA
Tour begins today with the same show dominating everybody's
thoughts as the one that became so intriguing in the last half of
'99. Woods isn't the main theme of the PGA Tour this year. He's the
only theme. Nothing else comes close.
</P>
<P>
   He will begin the Mercedes Championships today at Kapalua's
Plantation Course aiming for his fifth consecutive PGA Tour
victory. He won the last four tournaments he played in '99, and in
the seven weeks since last season ended, the unthinkable has
happened.
</P>
<P>
   People _ even Woods _ are starting to wonder if Byron Nelson's
historic record of 11 consecutive victories in 1945 might be within
range. If not now, maybe someday in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you could say it's untouchable or
unattainable,'' Woods said Wednesday. ``What I can say is that if a
player gets on a roll like he did, I don't care what era you're in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can someone do it? Yeah, I believe someone can do it, no doubt
about it. You need luck, yes. A lot of luck. I'm sure he (Nelson)
didn't win every tournament. I'm sure somebody probably gave him a
tournament or two here and there, which you're probably going to
need to have happen (to challenge Nelson's streak).''
</P>
<P>
   And so, Woods leads golf into 2000 with boundless hopes. But he
also is grounded by the knowledge that golf never is easy, no
matter how he may make it look at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always have been a big believer that you never arrive, but
it's a wonderful journey,'' Woods said, paraphrasing a line that
has been spoken by Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon for years. ``Even
the greatest player that ever played the game, (Jack) Nicklaus,
would say he's always working on something new.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never say, `This is my limit.' If you put limitations on
it, then you can't get any better.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's where Woods finds himself _ on a rocket ship up the
chart of legends to see how far he can go.
</P>
<P>
   The interesting part about it is that many of his peers don't
expect any backsliding to take place. Not for a long time, at
least.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll see Tiger play like he did in 1999 a lot of
times over the next 10 years,'' said The Woodlands' Jeff Maggert.
``He's very motivated. It's not a tap-in that he'll be that good
for that long. There are a lot of good players out here who will be
trying to keep him from doing it. But he's going to play very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got that confidence that he can do whatever Watson or
Nicklaus or Norman or Nick Price did and continue to do it over a
long period of time. But as we all know, it's easy to go into a
slump for five or six months at a time out here.''
</P>
<P>
   It'll be a surprise if Woods does. And even if he goes a month
or two or longer without winning, one thing he has done is put the
focus back on the number of ``W's'' in a player's portfolio, rather
than the number of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Tiger has done is bring back the importance of winning,''
Houstonian Steve Elkington said. ``For a while, everybody in the
media was writing that so-and-so is a great player, and he might
have been. But he hadn't even won a tournament yet. We kind of got
away from putting the emphasis on winning, and Tiger is bringing
that back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players are rewarded by how much effort they put into the
game, and I don't see anyone putting more effort into it than
Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   What Woods has done over the past seven months is nothing short
of incredible. He played 10 official PGA Tour events from June
through November. All he did was win seven times and finish third
once and seventh once. He tied for 37th at the International, which
uses a different scoring system than normal tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Woods ended up winning $6,616,585, $3 million more than his
nearest pursuer, David Duval.
</P>
<P>
   His four victories in a row started at the NEC Invitational and
continued through the National Car Rental Classic, the Tour
Championship and the American Express Championship. He also won the
World Cup of Golf with Mark O'Meara, with Woods winning the
medalist honor.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has had this sort of successful run since Sam Snead won
11 times in 1950. Ben Hogan was the last to win more than four
tournaments in a row, winning five straight in 1953, even though
the British Open at that time was not considered an official event
in the U.S. Hogan also won six in a row in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Woods admits he tries not to use 1999 as a measuring stick. But
it's hard not to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I accomplished a lot of goals, even exceeded
some,'' he said. ``I also didn't capitalize on some things I
thought I should have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether I've raised the bar too high, I don't know. I just
know I'm going to try to continue to improve and try to get
better.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's bad news for those chasing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased with the way I'm hitting the golf ball, the
way I'm rolling the rock, my overall short game,'' Woods said
Wednesday. ``Everything has gotten a little bit better.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh. That spells trouble for the other 29 players who will be
trying to stop Woods' run this week at the Mercedes. The tournament
is strictly for players who won a PGA Tour event in 1999. The only
'99 winners not at Kapalua are Jose Maria Olazabal, who won the
Masters but is taking extra time off in the winter, and the late
Payne Stewart, who won the U.S. Open and AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, many of golf's best and brightest players are
in the field.
</P>
<P>
   If anybody is taking dead aim at Woods, it is Duval. Though he
understates his position, the former world No. 1 has a hunger to
regain the status, even though it would require a dazzling streak
of wins to overhaul Woods any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to become a better player, and I want to improve,''
Duval said. ``I feel like to win the tournaments I want to win,
those things are going to have to happen. If it's to beat Tiger,
then so be it. If it's to beat somebody else, so be it. But I feel
that's kind of what I need to do to get to that next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Which just so happens to be a level with which he was familiar
for several weeks before Woods' outrageous run began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always thought I can improve and be better as a
player,'' Duval said. ``When he (Woods) is playing well, you have
to improve. That's a nice challenge, one I look forward to. I think
I've met the challenge in the past, and I think I can meet it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   And Duval has one more motivation going into 2000 _ he still
can't count a major championship among his 11 victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel like you have to play well that week and you have
to get good breaks,'' he said. ``But if you're asking me if I'm
going to try to focus more around them (the majors), yes. I am
going to try to be that much more prepared when those weeks start.
I'm not saying I didn't feel like I was in the past. But I'm going
to try a little bit more to get ready. And in the end, you still
have to play well and get some breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods suspects Duval still has a chance of making headway in the
battle for golf's supreme ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did from the end of '97, all of '98 and the beginning
of '99 was very impressive,'' Woods said. ``He was playing better
than anybody else in golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval, as is his nature, is maintaining a steady attitude even
though it appears Woods has lapped him in the race for the title of
world's best golfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like I played the first half of last year,'' he
said. ``You look at it and realize that, hey, if you want to beat
him, you have to play better and get better. You continually have
to evolve and improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just so happens that he's leading the pack right now. I was
leading early last year and somebody else before that. It's a
progression.''
</P>
<P>
   But the magnitude of Woods' success has left everybody numb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won 10 tournaments in the '90s, which is a lot,'' said
Elkington. ``Not many people did that. But Tiger almost did it in
one year (winning eight in '99).
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on is Tiger is just showing everybody how much
better he is than everybody else. His technique is finally sound.
And he's just that much better now.''
</P>
<P>
   Elkington believes the shot Woods hit at the Tour Championship
in Houston in the first round when he smashed a rock into his ball,
which had come to rest against the rock, shows how much confidence
Woods has.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks he's untouchable,'' Elkington said. ``He's thinking,
`There's nothing that can hurt me.' That's where he's at mentally.
And he's got patience, too. What hurt Duval last year was that he
lost his patience a little in the middle and the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Added tour veteran Olin Browne: ``Tiger is doing something that
a lot of people thought couldn't be done, and that's challenge Jack
Nicklaus' records. Tiger is waking up a lot of people. I don't
think he needs to send any messages. He's already sent them. Tiger
is on a mission. He wants to leave his mark. And he already has.
Now, it's a matter of whether he can continue it and go on to
challenge Nicklaus, and I think it's obvious that that's what he
has set out to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods has said many times that's the yardstick by which he wants
to measure his career when he's done. What we tend to overlook is
that he only turned 24 last week.
</P>
<P>
   But as we tee off into a new millennium, Woods knows the coming
decade is a lot like most of the tournaments in which he plays: his
to win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does feel like it's almost time to start playing again,''
Woods said. ``I had a nice break, about a month, where I got some
rest, and now I feel like I'm almost ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost ready to make some more history, perhaps.

SHAW IMPRESSES PATRIOTS OWNER KRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Defensive coordinators Willie Shaw (Oakland) and Marvin
Lewis (Baltimore) lead the Patriots' list of candidates for head
coach _ if the team is unable to reach an agreement to sign ex-Jets
coach Bill Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw had what sources say was ``a very impressive'' interview at
owner Robert Kraft's Boston office Wednesday. The interviewers
included executive vice president Jonathan Kraft, senior vice
president Andy Wasynczuk, and vice president of player personnel
Bobby Grier.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, 54, also dined with Grier Wednesday night before leaving
for the West Coast this morning. If the Patriots weren't so
enamored with Belichick, Shaw could emerge as a top candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 41, who presides over a talented Ravens' defense, is due
in Boston Thursday. He will meet with the same four Patriots
officials Thursday night and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Both coaches are represented by Atlanta-based agent Ray
Anderson, who coincidentally represents safety Lawyer Milloy.
</P>
<P>
   While neither seems to be a favorite to get the job, Anderson
said, ``The Patriots are serious about both of them or they
wouldn't have wasted our time. I've never known the Patriots to be
disingenuous on matters like these. (Shaw and Lewis) are among the
handful of coaching candidates the Patriots are considering at the
present.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw was told of the team's plans for its new stadium and of the
team's defensive talent. He was asked questions on how he handles
personnel, particularly those players who need more attention (e.g.
Terry Glenn). That seems to be a key point as it appears the
Patriots won't move Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots appear willing to pay whatever compensation
necessary for Belichick because they don't believe there's a
comparable candidate. The compensation package could amount to four
draft picks, based on the Jets' signing of Bill Parcells in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are awaiting a ruling from the league on the
validity of Belichick's contract with the Jets, following his
resignation Tuesday, and what compensation would be necessary to
free him. The Patriots are also exploring talks with other
candidates, including former Kansas City coach Marty
Schottenheimer, who said through a friend on Tuesday that he was
not interested in coaching in 2000. The Patriots have contacted
Chiefs general manager Carl Peterson for permission to speak to
Schottenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are also interested in chatting with St. Louis
offensive coordinator Mike Martz and Jacksonville defensive
coordinator Dom Capers when their respective seasons are over.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Patriots are exploring college options. The
short list includes Miami's Butch Davis, Wisconsin's Barry Alvarez,
and a third coach whose name was not readily available. The
Patriots would seem to have interest in Florida's Steve Spurrier,
who was reportedly talking to Green Bay officials.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez, who is also being sought by the Packers, grades very
highly among Patriots officials, though there has not been a move
to bring him in for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   One Patriots source said the team was concentrating on the NFL
coordinators first, and may eventually move on to the college
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   One interesting point is that Grier seems very much involved in
the interview process, and the selection of who is and isn't
interviewed _ though he did not appear to be involved in contacting
the Jets to offer Belichick the job of Patriots coach and general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Grier is also going through his normal postseason review of team
personnel. However, there are strong reports that the Patriots are
either thinking of, or have contacted, former Redskins personnel
director Charlie Casserly.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots received even more competition in the coaching
derby Wednesday when New Orleans fired Mike Ditka and his staff.
The Patriots are now competing with the Saints, Packers, and Jets
for a limited coaching pool.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka said in his press conference that he would not coach
again. He would not appear to be the type of coach the Patriots
would seek. With Ditka out, Patriots defensive coordinator Steve
Sidwell, a longtime Saints defensive coordinator and popular figure
in the area, could become a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   A Patriots source indicated that the team is still considering
Sidwell, but it appears unlikely he would be tabbed for the top
job.
</P>
<P>
   Also unlikely is former Boston College coach Jack Bicknell, who
would be a popular local choice. Bicknell, who coached Doug
Flutie's magical years at Boston College, will be starting his
eighth season as coach of the successful Barcelona Dragons of NFL
Europe. Bicknell is an offensive specialist who would likely be
able to turn the Patriots' offense around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been contacted,'' said Bicknell, whose last big find
was Seattle quarterback Jon Kitna. ``There's no question I feel I
could do a good job there and straighten out the offense. I've
always a chance to coach in the NFL and the Patriots.''

A: That turns out to be a complicated question. I don't know of
anyone offering free e-mail for people who don't have Internet
access, but a number of companies offer free Internet access,
including e-mail. If you could get hooked up with one of those, you
could simply ignore the Web and the rest of the Internet, if e-mail
is really all you want.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, as you've discovered, the most prominent free
Internet services _ AltaVista, Juno, Kmart's Bluelight.com,
NetZero, WorldSpy, etc. _ all require Windows. They install special
software on users' machines to display the ads that support their
services, and so far they haven't bothered to develop Mac versions.
NetZero says it's planning a Mac version ``at a later date,'' but
it's not ready yet.
</P>
<P>
   I did find a couple of free ISPs that already support the Mac:
Freewwweb (www.freewwweb.com) and Freei.net (www.freei.net). The
problem in your case is that both say they work only with Power
Macs _ Macs with PowerPC processors _ and your 636 doesn't fall
into that category.
</P>
<P>
   If any reader knows of a free ISP e-mail program that will work
on a pre-Power Mac, drop me a note, and I'll pass the word along.
Otherwise, the only alternatives I can see are to sign up with a
commercial ISP or to spring for a new Mac.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; System Folder Cleanup
</P>
<P>
   Q: My System Folder is overflowing with obscure extensions and
other odds and ends. I'd like to clean it up, to save disk space
and memory and reduce the odds of conflicts and crashes, but I'm
afraid of throwing away things my Mac might actually need. Can you
recommend a good source of information about such files?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: That one's much easier. A good place to start is in Apple's
Extensions Manager control panel. If an item you're thinking of
throwing away is listed there, select it and click on the triangle
labeled ``Show more information'' at the bottom of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, especially about files that don't show up
in the Extensions Manager, pick up a copy of one of my very
favorite utilities, Casady &AMP; Greene's Conflict Catcher 8 ($79.95
retail, $69.95 from www.casadyg.com; demo version free). The price
might seem steep just for the extra information, but the program
also provides a variety of other tools to help you manage your
System Folder.
</P>
<P>
   If that's still not enough data for you, there are at least two
very thorough databases about system files old and new, from both
Apple and third parties: Teng Chou Ming's appropriately named
Extension Overload ($10 shareware from www.mir.com.my/cmteng/ and
Dan Frakes' InformINIT ($15 shareware from
mc04.equinox.net/informinit/MPP.html). At the latter address,
you'll also find a link to Frakes' Mac Pruning Pages, which he
bills as ``the indispensable guide to what's dispensable on your
Mac.''
</P>
<P>
   One suggestion: No matter how much information you collect, it's
a good idea to set aside the files you propose to get rid of for a
month or two before you actually trash them. Put them in a special
folder outside the System Folder, or move them to the Trash but
don't empty it. That way, you can be sure you won't need them ...
until the day after you finally delete them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Confusing Web Addresses
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: At least half the URLs you print in your column don't work.
Could you please be more careful to avoid typos?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: I make my share of mistakes, but I learned years ago never to
type a URL for publication _ I always copy and paste them directly
from my browser's address field, so typos probably aren't the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   If you're having trouble with URLs from the column, I have a
different theory: Long URLs often spread across two or more lines
in a narrow newspaper column. When you copy such an address from an
online version of the column, the Mac will often insert extraneous
characters where the lines break. Get rid of them and the URLs
should work fine.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Time to Hook Up DSL
</P>
<P>
   Q: After waiting for years, in vain, for TCI/AT&AMP;T to offer
high-speed Internet cable access in my area, I'm thinking of trying
DSL. Do you recommend it for the Mac?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely. I've been using DSL at home, with both Macs and
PCs, for more than a year now, and I'm delighted with it. There are
just three catches: You have to live less than about three miles
from a telephone-company switching office (although that limit will
be extended over the next couple of years); you need a Mac with a
built-in Ethernet connector (standard in every Mac model made in
recent years) or a slot where you can add an Ethernet card; and
there's been a dearth of information about what's involved in
getting Macs online via DSL. (Some ignorant ISPs even think it
requires a PC!)
</P>
<P>
   I can't help with the first two problems, but as of this week
there's a great new Web site designed precisely to deal with the
information problem. It's called the MacDSL Center, and you'll find
it at &QL; 
www.macdsl.netopia.com.
</P>
<P>
   One of the site's sponsors is Netopia Inc., which makes, among
other things, DSL equipment, and not surprisingly, much of the
information focuses on that company's products. Nothing against
Netopia but many other companies also make DSL devices that work
fine with the Mac. For more information on that score, see the
special report on Internet access routers at &QL; 
www.macintouch.com/accessrouters.html.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIP OF THE MONTH
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  As easy as the Mac is for experienced users, it can still be
pretty intimidating for novices. Books such as ``The Little Mac
Book'' by Robin Williams (no, not that Robin Williams) can help,
but there's no substitute for face-to-face contact and a chance to
ask questions. That's why I'm still a big fan of user groups. In
the Bay Area, the Diablo Valley Mac Users Group will be conducting
its annual all-day workshop for new Mac users on January Jan.  &LR; 22
from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. at St. Mark's Lutheran Church Hall in Walnut
Creek. The cost is $45, which includes a box lunch and one year's
family membership in the group. I haven't been, but the program
looks solid. For more details, see DVMUG.org or call (925)
938-4544.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Mac Q&AMP;A runs the first Thursday of each month. Send questions to
Henry Norr at mac &LR; sfgate.com. Please specify what Mac model and
what version of the Mac OS you're using.

 Newest Technology Homeward Bound  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
For the majority of consumers, the concept of a
computer-controlled, network-wired home filled with devices like a
refrigerator that can sense when milk sours is still in the realm
of far-off science fiction.
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; But at this year's Consumer Electronics Show starting here
today, electronics and technology companies will showcase a host of
new devices they hope will actually give consumers reasons to bring
home-networking home by later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Milpitas startup 2Wire Inc. will display
``residential gateways,'' the home version of the corporate
computer hub that can link high-speed DSL or cable Internet lines
to two or more computers as well as audio, video and security
systems or other home appliances.
</P>
<P>
   And RioPort Inc. of San Jose, which a year ago ignited a digital
music revolution with its portable Rio MP3 player, will unveil a
home audio system that can play and store music downloaded from the
Internet without a desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll see a real tsunami of home-networking products
this year,'' said Jeff Thermond, vice president of the
home-networking division of Broadcom Corp. of Irvine (Orange
County). Consumers want to have multiple PCs in their homes that
can share a connection to the Internet, he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90,000 people, the majority of them buyers for
electronics stores, are expected for the annual four-day show,
which is hyped as the ``Super Bowl of electronics.'' Sponsored by
the Consumer Electronics Association, the show features more than
1,500 exhibitors spread out over 1.1 million square feet of space
at the Las Vegas Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   CES showcases every manner of new high-tech digital device,
including cameras, recordable DVDs, wireless phones and palm-size
devices, most designed to be interconnected so that consumers will
use them throughout their homes, at work and in their cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, the technology of the microchip is getting
powerful enough and small enough to put into many types of devices
and get them all connected,'' said Craig Mundie, vice president of
consumer strategy for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Chipmaking giant Intel Corp. of Santa Clara will be showing off
new Web-enabled telephones that won't be tied to the PC, or
Microsoft. Intel has decided to use the free Linux operating
system, which is seen as a threat to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Panasonic announced a new phone that provides ``one-button''
access to calls placed over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The era of a totally wired, digital home may still be one
generation away from being commonplace, said Rob Enderle, a
technology analyst for the Giga Information Group. By then, the
Generation Y crowd who have come to expect digital products and
Internet access as part of life, will start to buy homes and raise
families of their own, Enderle said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the meantime, the demand for home-networking equipment
and products will increase, especially as more homeowners get wired
for high-speed Internet access through DSL phone or cable modem
service.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee Research Group forecasts the number of U.S.
households with their own computer networks will increase from
660,000 in 1999 to 9.5 million in 2003, creating a $1.4 billion
market for home-networking hardware. The driving force should be
that 30 percent of homes with PCs will have two or more in the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the number of homes that now have more than one TV and
cable,'' said Broadcom's Thermond, whose company is trying to
market chips and software for use in a variety of consumer
products. ``How many only hook up one TV to cable? Research shows
that's less than 20 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Enderle said the CES will be a ``coming out party'' for the
home-network hub device. The 2Wire HomePortal, for example, allows
multiple PCs and other Web devices to share an Internet connection
_ without having to link all the devices with wires.
</P>
<P>
   At $500 a unit, the HomePortal is expensive. But 2Wire President
Brian Hinman hopes to sell the boxes to DSL providers, which would
in turn offer them to consumers at a discount or for free to entice
them to sign up for DSL service.
</P>
<P>
   The gateways then would make it easier for consumers to set up
other devices coming soon to market, such as high-definition
televisions and digital video devices that can download streaming
video off the Internet, Enderle said.
</P>
<P>
   Thermond conceded that the promise of a lucrative home digital
market has produced ideas and products that consumers may not
accept, like the washing machine that can link to the Internet and
e-mail its owner when the wash load has too much soap.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us in the home-networking business tend to get their
noses up against the glass a little too closely,'' Thermond said.
``CES is about consumers and keeping in mind, do they really give a
darn?''

 S.F. Move to Save DHL Cash  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Few companies would think of moving to San Francisco as a
cost-saving move. But when the alternative is paying sky-high rents
in Silicon Valley, San Francisco looks like a bargain.
<P>
   That's the conclusion DHL Airways reached after its landlord
sought to jack up the company's rent for its Redwood Shores
headquarters by 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The markup prompted DHL, the U.S. arm of shipping firm DHL
Worldwide Express, to move its 550 employees from their current
base next door to Oracle's shiny headquarters to a new home at 50
California St. in San Francisco's Financial District by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   And DHL isn't alone. Other Silicon Valley companies are turning
to San Francisco as a base for at least part of their operations.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade Group, the Menlo Park online broker, plans to move some
of its operations to nearly 150,000 square feet South of Market,
and sources say both San Jose's Cisco Systems and Santa Clara's
3Com Corp. have been nosing around the local real estate market in
search of commercial space.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where the talent is,'' said Bill Walsh, senior vice
president of real estate firm CB Richard Ellis in San Francisco.
``Companies on the Peninsula are looking here because this is where
all the workers live, and they don't like driving south for their
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavy traffic on the Peninsula was a factor in DHL's decision to
relocate. The company knew that its employees were growing fed up
with the commute to and from the office.
</P>
<P>
   But for DHL, switching from Redwood Shores to San Francisco was
ultimately a financial decision. San Francisco, amazingly, was
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real estate market in Redwood Shores is very hot,'' said
Catherine Morrison, DHL's director of corporate real estate. ``It's
expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources say commercial rental costs in the Redwood Shores area
can run as high as $55 per square foot.
</P>
<P>
   DHL figures moving to San Francisco will save it more than 30
percent in rental costs the first year, and more than 70 percent by
the end of its new 10-year lease.
</P>
<P>
   DHL will occupy five floors at 50 California, not far from the
Ferry Building. It will also have a ground-level space for an
express delivery center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at everything between Redwood Shores and the city,''
Morrison said. ``We ran the numbers every which way we could. This
was the most attractive package.''
</P>
<P>
   While she declined to say how much DHL will pay per square foot
at its new home, a source at the Shorenstein Co., which manages the
California Street building, placed the rent at between $45 and $50
a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's on the low side'' of rental costs in the area, said
Barry Bramm, vice president of San Francisco's TRI Commercial/Oncor
International, one of the largest commercial real estate firms in
Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Despite DHL's success in securing a sweetheart deal, Bramm noted
that prime commercial space in San Francisco is still hard to come
by. ``There's probably 1 foot available for every 2 feet of tenants
looking for space,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report by CB Richard Ellis, about 40 percent of
more than 7 million square feet sought by tenants last year was
technology-related. The average cost per square foot for commercial
space in downtown San Francisco is now around $50.
</P>
<P>
   This is roughly the same average rate on the Peninsula, but some
of the tonier neighborhoods can command even higher rental charges.
</P>
<P>
   One of the priciest addresses in the Bay Area is Sand Hill Road
in Menlo Park, where a number of prominent venture capitalists have
their offices.
</P>
<P>
   But with more tech workers settling in San Francisco, Silicon
Valley companies realize they need to reduce the Peninsula's
notorious commutes to attract the best people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real phenomenon,'' said David Wall, executive vice
president of Fremont Properties in San Francisco. ``But this is
where the employees are.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the back-to-the-city movement, insurance giant Aon
Corp. said yesterday that it will consolidate many of its Bay Area
operations on seven floors of the new 29-story office tower rising
at 199 Fremont St.
</P>
<P>
   The building, which isn't scheduled to open until June, is
already 93 percent preleased.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is rushing to secure space in the city. Chevron
Corp. said last month that it pocketed $189 million by selling its
headquarters buildings in the Financial District.
</P>
<P>
   Most of its employees are moving instead to the East Bay.

 Steve Jobs Returns to the Core at Apple  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; After 21/2 years as Apple's interim CEO, Steve Jobs has finally
dropped the ``interim'' from his title.
<P>
   But he liked the ``i'' in his old title so much, he told a
cheering crowd at the opening of the Macworld Expo at the Moscone
Center yesterday, that he has decided to keep it. From now on, he
said, he'll be iCEO.
</P>
<P>
   As in iMac and iBook, the company's hot-selling desktop and
portable models, ``i'' is for Internet, and Jobs followed up on
that theme by announcing a series of new free services on Apple's
already heavily traveled Web site.
</P>
<P>
   He also showed off a slick new user interface for the company's
next-generation operating system, which he said will go on sale
this summer, and previewed new marketing campaigns focused on
``desktop movies,'' Apple's term for digital video.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs said the resurgent company sold 1.35 million Macs in the
last three months of 1999 _ more than in any other quarter in its
history.
</P>
<P>
   Pending Apple's quarterly financial report, due in two weeks, he
disclosed no financial results from the quarter's operations, but
did boast that a $12.5 million investment Apple made in August in
Akamai, a Massachusetts company that provides high-speed servers
for streaming video and e-commerce, is now worth more than $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Apple has invested $200 million in EarthLink, the
nation's second-largest Internet service provider, and will make it
the first choice for new Mac customers seeking an ISP. The service
won't carry an Apple brand, but Apple will receive a share of the
revenue from each new Mac user signing up with EarthLink.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list of new services, called iTools, at Apple's Web
site is one called KidSafe, which is designed to keep children from
venturing into inappropriate areas of the Internet. Instead of
attempting to identify and block access to objectionable sites _
the approach used by so-called filtering software _ the Apple
solution limits children to sites approved by a panel of teachers
and librarians.
</P>
<P>
   Other new services at the site include e-mail accounts and
personal Web sites (with a mac.com address), online Web-page design
tools and 20 megabytes of free disk space on secure Apple servers
for each registered user.
</P>
<P>
   Similar features, also free, are already available to both Mac
and Windows users through a variety of other Web sites. But Apple's
services will be more smoothly integrated with the Mac OS.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs called this integration between the Apple servers and
users' desktops ``taking unfair advantage of owning the client
OS.'' The downside is that the iTools work only with Mac OS 9, the
current version of the company's operating system, which has been
on the market only since October.
</P>
<P>
   A few new services at the Apple site will be available to users
of earlier versions of the Mac OS and other operating systems, too.
They include iCards, an electronic greeting-card service, and
iReviews, where Apple will review useful Web sites, organized into
15 categories, and invite users to post their own comments and
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few months, Jobs said, much of Apple's marketing
will focus on desktop movies _ ``a killer application if ever there
was one.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's celebrated ``Think Different'' advertising
campaign will be revived, this time featuring cinema legends such
as Charlie Chaplin, Frank Capra, Stanley Kubrick and Francis
Coppola. And Apple will launch TV ads _ previewed for the Expo
crowd _ featuring digital home movies that an Apple vice president
made of his young children and their hamster and collie.
</P>
<P>
   The longest section of Jobs' 2-hour, 20-minute presentation was
devoted to Mac OS X (pronounced OS 10), which features a look Jobs
called ``liquid.'' (One of the design goals, he said, was that
``when you saw it, you'd want to lick it.'') For the new system,
Apple has redesigned the Finder, its desktop file-management
application, adding new icons and a search field to every window.
</P>
<P>
   Apple declined to set a price for the new operating system but
said it would release it for sale this summer and begin
preinstalling it on all new Macs a year from now. While the new OS
is supposed to run nearly all existing Mac applications, executives
from such companies as Adobe, Macromedia, Microsoft, Palm and Quark
took the stage to promise new versions of their products to take
full advantage of the new Apple software.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs' presentation was marred by several technical glitches.
When Marketing Vice President Phil Schiller attempted to
demonstrate Quake III Arena running on Mac OS X, the popular action
game from Id Software froze. And when Jobs attempted to show how
easy it is to customize greeting cards at Apple's iCards site, he
was repeatedly denied access on the grounds that he had left his
browser idle too long.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's stock rose $1.50 to close at $104 yesterday.

 &HT;    A look at the Falcons' needs
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Falcons last season were one of the worst teams in
the NFL at running the ball and stopping the run.
</P>
<P>
   So is it a surprise that coach Dan Reeves said, ``I think
cornerback, wide receiver are two (positions) that we really need
to look at (in the offseason)''?
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   By playing once-and-future safety Ronnie Bradford out of
position at cornerback because 1997 first-round draft choice
Michael Booker couldn't win a starting job, the entire defense was
affected.
</P>
<P>
   Safeties had to cheat toward helping Bradford, and blitzing was
riskier when he didn't have help, but almost necessary to protect a
secondary hard-pressed to maintain coverage more than three
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, second-year wide receiver Tim Dwight is developing
rapidly, and Terance Mathis had 81 catches for 1,016 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But Dwight is 5-foot-8, Mathis 5-10, and quarterback Chris
Chandler covets a wide receiver with size.
</P>
<P>
   Without a first-round draft choice after trading it to Baltimore
last April, the chances of getting an immediate impact player in
the draft are more remote than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Enter free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the Falcons need:
</P>
<P>
   OFFENSE: LINE
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons need to decide if Greg Bishop ($2.4 million cap
charge next season) is a starting guard, a starting tackle, or
gone. That's too much money to sit.
</P>
<P>
   Right tackle Ephraim Salaam will be re-signed, but shouldn't be
surprised if the team brings in a more powerful run blocker. He was
better last year as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's Jon Runyan will be a free agent, but the Titans
probably will keep him. Detroit's Juan Roque, who'll be a free
agent, isn't as quick as Salaam, and he's injury-prone.
</P>
<P>
   A new face is needed in at least one of the three middle spots,
and it had better be somebody with push, like Buffalo's Ruben Brown
or Jacksonville's Ben Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   Guard-center Calvin Collins, who will be a restricted free
agent, played well late in the season and may be tendered a
one-year contract worth more than $1 million. It might take that
much to keep other teams from signing him.
</P>
<P>
   WIDE RECEIVER
</P>
<P>
   Mathis and Dwight will return, and rookie Eugene Baker and
second-year pro Jammi German will be back, at least for training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Calloway's lack of speed and special teamer Ronnie Harris'
lack of size will cost them roster spots.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta needs a wide receiver with size.
</P>
<P>
   Possibilities: Minnesota is going to part ways with Jake Reed, a
6-3 native of Covington, Ga. Baltimore's Justin Armour, the 6-4
veteran who caught the 54-yard pass that beat Bradford and the
Falcons in overtime in October, will be unrestricted.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Curtis Conway (6-0), a deep threat, will be
unrestricted, but often is hurt. Seattle's Joey Galloway is the top
free agent, but out of shape and expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina's Muhsin Muhammed (6-2) may not return to Charlotte
since the Panthers re-signed Patrick Jeffers. If Derrick Mayes
(6-0) could be convinced not to re-up in Seattle, he'd be nice, and
a lot cheaper than Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Jerry Rice. The 49ers might not keep him, but they won't
trade him to an NFC West team. If he does become a free agent, he
supposedly doesn't like Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   QUARTERBACK
</P>
<P>
   Backup is the issue. The Falcons are interested in Tampa Bay's
Eric Zeier, and he's interested in them. Be surprised if that
doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   RUNNING BACK
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Anderson's return to health would make any line look
better, but Reeves admits the team needs better backups.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Hanspard did not recover well from the knee surgery, but
he'll return next year, at least for a tryout.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Oxendine fumbles too much, and is no guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Greg Hill, Oakland's Napolean Kaufman, and
Jacksonville's James Stewart are among many possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   TIGHT END
</P>
<P>
   Starter O.J. Santiago is likely to depart via restricted free
agency or trade, but the Falcons will need one less tight end next
season if they add the wide receiver Reeves talks about.
</P>
<P>
   They're not going to sit Mathis, Dwight or the new guy just to
keep playing two tight ends.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSE: SECONDARY
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Ray Buchanan is frequently asked to cover one-on-one
while a safety helps Bradford on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been begging for a cornerback for so long,'' Buchanan
said. ``Other teams have caught on to what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Booker, Reeves' first draft choice in 1997, hasn't worked out.
With a $1.82 million salary cap charge next season, he could be an
offseason casualty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected him to be starting,'' Reeves said. ``Any chance
that he had was lost in the (right thigh) injuries that took him so
long to get over (beginning Aug. 7). It was the same type of injury
he had before.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that package is a part of your ability to play. Are you
always going to have those nagging types of injuries?''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons made a run last offseason at cornerback Ashley
Ambrose and might get to again. His tricked-up contract in New
Orleans calls for a salary of something like $5 million, and he's
about to be cut.
</P>
<P>
   Giants corner Phillipi Sparks, who played under Reeves, is big,
but hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Free safety is a need, as free agent Eugene Robinson, 36,
probably won't be asked to return, and it's no sure thing Bradford
can start there, nor do coaches show a lot of confidence in
second-year pro Omar Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Free safeties George Teague of Dallas, cut by Atlanta before
Reeves arrived, and Percy Ellsworth of the Giants are intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   LINEBACKERS
</P>
<P>
   Strong-side linebacker Henri Crockett will be a restricted free
agent. Middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle will be unrestricted.
</P>
<P>
   Crockett may be the middle linebacker of the future, or it could
be rookie Jeff Kelly, who played well in limited action.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve Craig Sauer, who will be unrestricted, may be good
enough to start in the NFL. Reserve Ruffin Hamilton probably won't
be back.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE LINE
</P>
<P>
   Tackle Travis Hall is the only starter under contract, although
the extension given reserve tackle Ed Jasper last fall makes him a
candidate to start next season in Shane Dronett's spot.
</P>
<P>
   End Patrick Kerney, last year's first-round choice, will almost
certainly start at one end spot, but with starters Chuck Smith and
Lester Archambeau about to become free agents, two or three ends
are needed.
</P>
<P>
   Backup Pellom McDaniels might not be back.
</P>
<P>
   Current indications are Smith won't return, and talks cooled
long ago with Archambeau and Dronett.
</P>
<P>
   One of the market's top young and versatile defensive ends will
be former Georgia star Phillip Daniels in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   KICKERS
</P>
<P>
   Kicker Morten Andersen made 15 of 17 after missing his first
four field goal tries of the season, but he'll be 40 next season,
and with a cap charge of more than $1 million he's no lock to
return. Punter Dan Stryzinski's kicks are rarely returned, but he
kicks short.
</P>
<P>
   COACHES
</P>
<P>
   The most secure staff members appear to be defensive line coach
Bill Kollar and secondary coach Ron Meeks. They could be coveted
elsewhere, too.
</P>
<P>
   The organization needs people in the coaching staff, scouting
staff and front office to stand up once in a while and argue with
Reeves.

BOTH BRADLEY AND GORE ENDORSE GAYS SERVING OPENLY IN MILITARY   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DURHAM, N.H. _ Vice President Al Gore and his Democratic
opponent, Bill Bradley, said Wednesday night that if they were
elected president they would require their appointees to the Joint
Chiefs of Staff allow homosexuals to serve openly in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Although both candidates had previously opposed the Clinton
administration's don't ask, don't tell policy, their comments
Wednesday night, in the fourth debate of the primary campaign, were
a strikingly forceful embrace of a ``litmus test'' for military
leaders on the issue of gay rights and are bound to come under
attack by the Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that he wanted to make the same sweeping changes
toward allowing gays to serve openly in the military that President
Harry Truman made toward integrating the armed forces. ``I think
that would require those who wanted to serve on the Joint Chiefs to
be in agreement with that policy,'' Gore said. ``I would insist
before appointing anybody to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that that
individual support my policy, and yes, I would make that a
requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore drew a distinction between applying a litmus test to
Supreme Court justices and in the military, saying this was ``not
interfering with an independent judicial decision.'' He added: ``As
commander-in-chief, a president is giving orders, in effect, or he
is the superior of the officers that are reporting to the
commander-in-chief in the chain of command.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said simply that the commander-in-chief issues orders
and soldiers follow them. He said that while many in the armed
forces probably did not agree with President Clinton on numerous
military matters, ``my sense is that when you're president of the
United States, military people are loyal to their
commander-in-chief whatever the policy of the commander-in-chief
calls for the country, and that's what I'd expect them to do if I'm
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   A litmus test that the candidates supported is almost certain to
spark a renewed controversy in the military, where many high
ranking officers strongly oppose allowing gay people to serve
openly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself originally pledged to allow gays to serve
openly, but backed away from the plan after a near revolt by the
joint chiefs early in his presidency. The result was the current
don't ask, don't tell policy, which Bradley and Gore say is a
failure.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their agreement on gays in the military, the debate
Wednesday night was punctuated by edgy exchanges as Gore and
Bradley picked at details of each others' past votes and present
proposals
</P>
<P>
   Bradley portrayed the vice president as having been so trapped
in a ``Washington bunker'' fighting for the administration's
political survival that he has lost ambition to fight for ambitious
health care and gun control proposals. Gore said his rival was
living in an ivory tower and lacked the political know-how to get
things done. That exchange set the tone for the hour-long debate
held here on the campus of the University of New Hampshire near the
eastern edge of this state.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the harshest remark came from Bradley after he was asked
when Gore had ever taken one of his quotes or votes out of context.
``The one that was most particularly offensive to me was when he
said in this campaign that I was going to hurt African-Americans,
Latinos with the health care program I have offered,'' Bradley
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say to me - who's had the deep commitment to the issue of
racial unity in this country since I started in politics that I
would go out and hurt African-Americans and Latinos, consciously,
as part of a policy, I think really offended me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore defended his comments, saying, ``We, you know, Harry
Truman said in 1948 I'm not giving him hell. I'm just telling the
truth and he thinks it's hell.'' He said he simply had explained
that ``poor people are disproportionately likely to be minorities''
and would be affected the most by Bradley's replacement of Medicaid
with an alternative program.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could come up with something Bradley said about him
out of context, Gore, searching for an answer, replied, ``I'd have
to think. I haven't made a point of responding to that. I don't - I
won't accused him of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley appeared particularly aggressive in this debate, and was
more willing to take issue with Gore than he had in the past. But
he also gave an air of being relaxed and displayed an easy humor.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, for instance, Gore insisted that he respected his
rival. ``I respect Bill, I really do,'' he said. ``I'm not just
saying that as a ploy. I think he's a genuinely good person.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by the moderator and ABC News anchor Peter Jennings if he
agreed with Gore, Bradley drew laughs when he replied, ``I agree
with what he said, yeah. I think I'm a genuinely good person.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Steven Handel stood on top of a mountain of
garbage, 150 feet above Richmond Creek, and imagined woodlands and
meadows rambling over the Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest landfill in the world,'' said Handel, a
plant ecologist at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J. ``But
you have to have vision. Imagine this as a developing oak forest.
Or a stand of red cedars, or a wildflower meadow. With 3,000 acres,
we could bring back some plants which are locally uncommon.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe make it a park four times the size of Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, New York City's Sanitation Department hired
Handel to research the possibilities of reclaiming this vast mound
of garbage _ where the city's waste has been dumped for 60 years _
to restore native habitats, like coastal plain woodlands and
grassland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not some romantic, `Let's bring back the forest primeval that
Henry Hudson saw,''' Handel said. ``But, `What is possible here?'''
</P>
<P>
   The natural resources group of the Parks and Recreation
Department has restored the salt marshes along the channels and
creeks. Handel and his students are concentrating on what native
plants might thrive on the mounds of trash.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, barges used to bring as much as 27,000 tons of
garbage a day here; now they bring about 6,000 tons. And sanitation
engineers are racing to reduce that stream to zero by Dec. 31,
2001, the city's deadline for the closing of the Fresh Kills
landfill.
</P>
<P>
   Handel and his students demonstrated the potential of
restoration ecology _ the study of rehabilitating devastated
ecosystems _ for the Hacksensack Meadowlands Development
Commission, on 16 acres of the old Kearney, N.J., landfill, as a
pilot for revegetating degraded areas along the New Jersey
Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   And with 6,000 landfills across the country all eventually faced
with the problem of what to do after closing, Handel is in the
forefront of a rapidly growing field in ecology.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to think that you had to go to a wild place like
Costa Rica to do something important in ecology,'' said Handel, who
grew up in the honky-tonk, sandy reaches of Far Rockaway, Queens.
``But now ecologists realize we have to go where people live, to
protect the water, the air.'' His scientist's eye flickered at
something up on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look! There's a redtail.'' The bird floated over the thick
grass of an old covered mound of trash. ``Probably chasing voles.''
It's amazing what does survive here, but it's nothing like the
original landscape, when a tidal creek flowed against the terminal
moraine, full of oaks, tulip trees, beech and maples.
</P>
<P>
   But still, on a good day, the estuaries are full of skimmers and
egrets.
</P>
<P>
   And what a view of Gotham! To the north, the World Trade Center
towers shimmered in the haze, the Bayonne Bridge arched over the
water to New Jersey. To the west, tugs pulled 600-ton garbage
barges from Arthur Kill to Fresh Kill, the Dutch names for the
tidal estuaries that meander through Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   There's a powerful beauty to this wasteland. Hydraulic cranes
with huge toothed buckets chomp waste from barges docked on the
edge of the creeks and drop it onto loading stations, where
front-end loaders lift it onto monstrous trucks. From our vantage
point, atop an old mound capped years ago, the scene was
incongruously peaceful. Seagulls fluttered over the garbage barges.
It didn't even smell.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of care taken by the sanitation crew,'' Handel
said, pointing out the booms stretching into the water to keep
trash from straying into the harbor and the fences circling the
tops of the active mounds to corral windblown litter.
</P>
<P>
   Giant perforated pipes stuck into the mounds capture methane
from decomposing garbage and funnel it to a boxy-looking recovery
plant near the West Shore Expressway, where it is cleaned and sold
to Brooklyn Union Gas Co. (Think of it: you may have garbage
heating your house.) We looked down on neat windrows of leaves and
chipped wood quietly composting, piles of concrete and asphalt
being crushed into building materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the kids I bring up here say they'll never look at garbage
the same way again,'' Handel said. Two experiments, one financed by
the city with $250,000, and the other with $430,000 from the
National Science Foundation, are trying to answer key questions
about how plants colonize degraded habitats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The engineers who designed this had one thing in mind,'' he
said. ``To not let the soil erode. So they planted perennial
grasses, mowed it and walked away.'' Such areas, costly to mow,
provide a pretty sterile habitat for diverse plants and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Handel first experimented with planting clusters of 50 different
trees and shrubs up the face of two covered garbage mounds. Some,
like wild black cherry and arrowroot, died because they couldn't
take the wind and dry, sterile soil.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``So we tried hackberry, gray dogwood and sumac, which can
tolerate drought,'' he said. ``And those did beautifully.'' But a
covered landfill's tough turf does not attract enough birds and
insects to disperse seeds.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1993, Handel and three other ecologists _ Joan Ehrenfeld
of Rutgers, Jennifer Mattei of Sacred Heart University in
Connecticut and George Robinson of the State University at Albany _
began a more extensive, National Science Foundation-financed study.
They planted 20 clusters of trees and shrubs on a landfill slope
close to the West Shore Expressway. Each cluster had the same seven
species, but some had more plants than others.
</P>
<P>
   Would fewer birds and bees come to the smaller clusters of
plants? How high would shrubs have to be for fruit-eating birds to
perch, defecating thousands of seeds to the ground below? How far
do such clusters have to be from the oak or maple forest remnants
on the island to benefit from creatures and wind carrying seeds out
of these living gene pools?
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to jump-start the succession of plants that occur
naturally in abandoned fields. But initial plantings produced
almost no offspring, and there was very little germination of new
species, except for invasive types like ailanthus and multiflora
rose. Theorizing that the thick grass cover discouraged
germination, the ecologists cleared a patch of grass next to each
cluster last August, to see what would take root on the bare
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know seeds came in by the thousands last fall,'' Handel
said. ``So we'll see what comes up this spring. We want to convince
the city to plant different grasses.''
</P>
<P>
   The soil has to change, too. ``It's not good enough to support a
diverse woodland,'' he said. ``That's why the first plantings
died.'' About three or four feet of compost would be ideal.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Gleason, the city's director of landfill engineering,
understands the need for different vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Native grasses reinforce the soil better,'' he said. ``They're
more drought-tolerant, and they enhance other habitat
development.''
</P>
<P>
   What Gleason and other landfill engineers are most concerned
about is protecting environmental controls, like the methane gas
pipes and ground water protection systems. ``Open land is worth a
lot of money, but you can't build big commercial buildings or
industrial facilities here,'' he said. ``The options are limited,
so that helps protect the environmental engineering. And vegetation
can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   City planners say it is premature to comment on the possible
uses for Fresh Kills, but Parks Commissioner Henry Stern is already
conjuring visions of the city's largest park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it could be a Garden of Eden, a natural wilderness,''
Stern said. ``Another could be a forest primeval. Then you could
have active uses, like baseball, soccer, tennis. There's room for a
golf course. It's a golden opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Up on the mound, Handel sniffed the wind and grinned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine a little marina down on the creek with rowboats,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably a good thing Handel didn't leave New York for
Costa Rica. The urban wilderness needs him more.

TECHNOLOGY MAY HELP EASE AIR TRAFFIC CHOKE POINTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is so congested at airports these days that planes coming
from the West Coast to New York often start lining up around
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   And it is only going to get worse. While more than 650 million
commercial passengers flew last year, that number is expected to
grow to 1 billion by 2015, the Federal Aviation Administration
predicts.
</P>
<P>
   With gridlock only a breath away, a handful of technologies have
emerged that proponents say will increase the capacity of strained
airports and reduce delays at squeeze points in the air traffic
control system.
</P>
<P>
   Right now air traffic controllers locate planes with radar and
guide them by voice communication _ safely but relatively slowly _
to increase the space between planes or hold them back at the first
sign of a problem.
</P>
<P>
   While the computer support available to controllers is limited
now, satellite, computer and communications technologies may lend a
hand in the future. New software may help adjust traffic as planes
approach the airport and calculate flight trajectories to give more
warning of possible problems. One of the most powerful systems,
based on Global Positioning System technology, may one day
supplement or even replace radar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Possibly you can get more aircraft through the pipeline,''
said Richard J. Lay, a Federal Aviation Administration program
manager who is evaluating the GPS-based technology. ``When the
whole system goes to pot because of one little choke point, this
technology is designed to keep planes going at a certain speed and
not have tie-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology Lay is evaluating tells pilots in their cockpits
the exact position, speed and altitude of nearby aircraft,
information that can now be picked up only by the controllers in
their control centers and airport towers.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Speelman, director of business development at UPS Aviation
Technologies, a subsidiary of United Parcel Service that
manufactures the technology, said that with global positioning
technology, each airplane would broadcast its position to other
planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of radar having to paint all the airplanes to get
their location,'' he said, ``each aircraft will have a lighted sign
saying here's where I am and here's where I am going.''
</P>
<P>
   The system, called ADS-B (for Automatic Dependent
Surveillance-Broadcast), works this way: The aircraft pilots know
their own positions from their GPS receivers, which use precise
timing signals emitted by a network of satellites. The planes can
broadcast that information from cockpit to cockpit, letting nearby
aircraft know exactly where they are, and they can also send the
information to ground systems.
</P>
<P>
   ADS-B can be more accurate than radar. It updates every second,
while radar information is relayed only after a complete sweep or
two of the area surveyed, which often takes up to six seconds, and
unlike radar, it works at low altitudes and can be used to track
planes on runways.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the system may prove particularly useful on the ground,
and not just for planes. It would be a simple matter to equip fuel
trucks and other vehicles that operate on runways and taxiways with
a GPS receiver and a low-power transmitter to broadcast the data.
Controllers would then be able to monitor all the traffic on the
ground, even when visibility is poor.
</P>
<P>
   ADS-B was tested by the aviation agency in 1999 in the Ohio
Valley, and the tests went well, Lay said. Further tests will get
under way soon with 132 planes in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Another innovative development being tested by the FAA is
software that predicts where planes will be in 10 or 20 minutes,
something that turns out to be very hard to estimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's surprisingly difficult to predict when, for instance, a
cross-country flight will actually show up,'' said R. John Hansman,
a professor in the department of aeronautics and astronautics at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and director of the
international center for air transportation there. ``If you look at
the times for a year of flights from Los Angeles to New York,
there's 20 to 30 minutes' variability, depending on, say, how
strong the tailwind is.''
</P>
<P>
   The new software, known as conflict probe technology, predicts
the aircraft's trajectory, allowing time for controllers to make
necessary changes and avoid backups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mathematical representation of where the aircraft is
going to be,'' said James A. Kingsbury, an air traffic control
engineer who helped derive the original computer algorithms for a
conflict probe developed by Mitre, which is based in Bedford,
Mass., and McLean, Va., and manages a research center for the
federal aviation agency. A prototype of the probe is in use at FAA
traffic control centers in Indianapolis and Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Current systems take present positions of aircraft and predict
two to three minutes ahead,'' Kingsbury said. ``Conflict probe
extends that look ahead to 12 to 20 minutes and warns controllers
of impending separation violations.''
</P>
<P>
   Digitized communication between pilots and ground controllers is
also expected to speed the flow of traffic. Right now, such
communication is almost entirely by voice; digital communication
will mean that text and graphics will be sent straight to the
cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Graphical information to the cockpit is important,'' Hansman
said. ``Presently you can get better weather information in your
hotel room by turning on the cable TV than you can in the
cockpit.''
</P>
<P>
   Another tool is being developed by NASA under the direction of
Dr. Heinz Erzberger, a senior scientist at the Ames Research
Center. Erzberger is the chief designer of an air traffic control
system called CTAS (pronounced CEE-tass).
</P>
<P>
   The software has a traffic management system, ``software that
helps controllers push the right amount of traffic through the
system _ neither more nor less,'' Erzberger said. CTAS also has
final-approach spacing software that helps controllers order the
flow of traffic so aircraft get to the correct runway in the best
order.
</P>
<P>
   A CTAS prototype is at work at the Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport. Contractors are adapting the technology to
other airports, although Erzberger said the process would be slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a surprisingly complicated and lengthy process to
transfer software technology from a government lab to industry,''
he said, ``so it's going to be another three to four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the innovations to ease airport congestion have been
prompted by the goal of moving toward what is called free flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, free flight meant having all sorts of ways an
aircraft could maneuver freely, rather than following fixed
routes,'' Erzberger explained. Pilots were going to have more
freedom to pick their own routes and more cockpit technology to
proceed safely. ``It's become a rallying cry for the industry to
make improvements in the air traffic control system, improvements
we all agree are sorely needed.''

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
It will be Lima Time in Houston for another three years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Astros signed flamboyant righthander Jose Lima to a
three-year contract worth a guaranteed $18.75 million Wednesday.
The value of the deal could escalate to $21 million if Lima
achieves certain performance bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   By agreeing to a contract, the Astros avoided salary arbitration
with Lima, who was 21-10 with a 3.58 ERA in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Lima was only the third pitcher in franchise history to win 21
games, joining Mike Hampton (22 in 1999) and Joe Niekro (21 in
1979). The 28-year-old Dominican, who is 37-18 since becoming a
starter in 1998, has exceeded all expectations since the Astros
acquired him from Detroit in a blockbuster trade in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the great success stories in all of baseball over
the last couple of years,'' Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker
said. ``Let's just say Jose's name wasn't in bold print when we
made the trade to bring him over here. He was somewhat of an
unknown. Many people had already written him off.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Lima is among the boldest personalities in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than any player I've been around, Jose has a genuine
belief in himself, and self-confidence is a great element to being
successful in this business,'' Hunsicker said. ``A lot of people
are not successful because they don't have that strength, that
inner confidence. Jose certainly exhibits that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima's confidence _ and his rapidly improving pitching skills _
has made him very wealthy. He will make base salaries of $4.75
million in 2000, $5.75 million in 2001 and $8.25 million in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``This contract symbolizes that we're looking for Jose to be one
of the anchors of our pitching staff, not only for this year but
for the years to come,'' Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   Lima and Shane Reynolds will be the front men in an otherwise
inexperienced rotation that also includes Chris Holt, Scott Elarton
and Octavio Dotel. Hunsicker is trying to add a veteran starter as
insurance in case Elarton is not ready to go because of recent
shoulder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Lima was on the outside looking in, not to mention
a step from the waiver wire. On more than one occasion during
Wednesday's news conference, his infamous 1998 spring training
outing against Kansas City was mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Lima allow nine runs in two innings against the
Royals, the Astros' brain trust wondered if he fit into their
plans.
</P>
<P>
   They decided to demote Lima to the bullpen, but when injuries
forced him back into the rotation, Lima vowed never to relinquish
the spot. And he hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us hit a spot in our lives where we can either move up
or move down,'' Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. said. ``Jose chose
to move up, and I think he's proven that to everyone in baseball
over the last two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima won 16 games in 1998 and made good on his prediction of a
20-win season in 1999, when he made the All-Star team for the first
time. His 1999 accomplishments included 27 of 35 starts in which he
allowed three runs or fewer, and an eight-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched three complete games and walked just 44 batters in
246 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exciting day for me,'' Lima said. ``I'm the
happiest man on earth today. I hope this isn't the last contract I
sign with the Astros. I'd like to finish my career here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming to Houston was the best thing that ever happened to me.
I knew that if I ever got a chance, I was going to prove people
wrong. I believe in myself more than anyone. When I take the mound,
I think I'm the best. I'm not going to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why change anything? I'm going to do my dance, I'm going to
wear my rally cap, and if you don't like it you can take the day
off. I'm just out there trying to win ballgames. That's why they're
paying me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won 21 games last year; why not go for 22 (in 2000)? I want
to win at least one more than last year. If I stay healthy and go
deep into games, it's going to be another great year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are banking on it; Wednesday's agreement is proof of
that.

CLINTONS MOVE IN TO A HOME OF THEIR OWN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: W.Va.)   By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton moved into the first
home of her own in 17 years Wednesday night, a constantly
photographed Dutch colonial in the heart of Westchester County that
is to be her base during her U.S. Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, President Clinton, did not carry her over the
threshold, but he did change his plans at the last minute to stay
overnight with the first lady on the couple's first evening at 15
Old House Lane. The president's mother-in-law, Dorothy Rodham,
stayed, too.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said the
Clintons' plans at their $1.7 million, 111-year-old home included
unpacking and eating a dinner delivered by a friend, Jill Iscol of
Pound Ridge, N.Y. Lockhart would not say what they ate or what the
house looked like inside, but he described the Clintons as ``very
excited'' about the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we try to look at public figures in a way different
than we look at ourselves,'' Lockhart said at a White House news
briefing on Wednesday. ``They're going to do exactly what you did
when you moved into your house and what everybody else does when
they move into a house.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Mrs. Clinton will be running against Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani in what is almost certain to be the most competitive
Senate race in the country, she distinguished herself from her
opponent and the loquacious New York candidates of Senate races
past by saying nothing to reporters gathered outside her new home
in 30-degree weather. The president also did not speak to the news
media.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton had been scheduled to arrive at her new home by
herself Wednesday afternoon for unpacking, but by midmorning the
White House announced that she would wait for the president to
accompany her later in the day. Aides to the president said he
hastily arranged the New York trip Tuesday night after it became
clear that he was not needed Wednesday at the Middle East peace
talks in Shepherdstown, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to balance the fact that he's got quite an important
job with very demanding responsibilities and the fact, like I think
every American can understand, it's quite an exciting event to move
into a house,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton's advisers admitted that they did not like the
prospect of the first lady's arriving at the Clintons' new house
alone, which they feared would have sent a sad message: that she
was on a solitary journey in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons and Mrs. Rodham arrived at Westchester County
Airport shortly after 6 p.m. on Air Force One and were immediately
driven by motorcade _ but without flashing lights, in keeping with
Mrs. Clinton's lower-key style when she campaigns in New York _ to
the cul-de-sac of Old House Lane. They were to leave the house
around 10 a.m. Thursday morning.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain, who has made fixing the corrosive
influence of money in politics the cornerstone of his campaign,
twice demanded in recent weeks that regulatory agency take action
in a matter that would ultimately benefit a major contributor to
his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Once in November and again last month, McCain wrote letters to
the Federal Communications Commission seeking a speedy va
complicated swap of television station licenses in Pittsburgh. The
swap would enable the contributor, Paxson Communications, to buy
one of the stations in the only big market where it lacks one.
</P>
<P>
   Mcain sent the letters after he and his aides had met with and
received more than $20,000 in contributions from executives for the
company and lobbyists. The head of the company, Lowell Paxson, who
also lent McCain his corporate jet four times last year, had
scheduled a fund-raiser for McCain in Florida for this weekend, but
canceled it at the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday McCain's letters became part of the presidential
campaign after an article about them was published in The Boston
Globe. Opponents of the station transfer charged that, when it
comes to the influence of money in politics, McCain says one thing
and does another.
</P>
<P>
   The letters did not tell the commissioners how to vote on the
license transfers, which had been in a regulatory abyss for more
than two years as community groups and the stations fought over the
matter and enlisted a variety of lawmakers to lobby on their
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the letters prompted an unusual response from the
chairman of the FCC suggesting that they were inappropriate. And
other officials said the tone of the letters made it clear to them
that McCain wanted the deal approved, even if he did not say so
explicitly.
</P>
<P>
   The letters are among dozens of inquiries sent to the FCC from
McCain over the years concerning regulatory matters, many of which
were disclosed in response to a Freedom of Information Act request
by The New York Times. The letters show that in a number of other
instances, McCain's requests to the agency involved companies that
were campaign contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respectfully request that the commission act on these
applications at its regularly scheduled monthly meeting in December
if it has not acted on them in the interim,'' McCain wrote on Nov.
17, in the Paxson case. ``If in your judgment the commission cannot
meet this request, please advise me of this fact in writing with a
specific and complete explanation, no later than Nov. 18.'' After
learning that the commission still had not acted, McCain wrote
again on Dec. 10, demanding that the commissioners explain why they
had not voted.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, McCain portrayed his action as routine and
insisted that he had done nothing wrong. He even brought up the
matter himself at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire on Wednesday
morning and used it as an example of how the campaign finance
system causes actions by politicians to be viewed with suspicion, a
theme he repeated several times during the day. ``Everything we do
is under a cloud of suspicion,'' he said at one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Mr. Paxson, but I know lots of people who come to me
and say that they are not being treated fairly by the
bureaucracy,'' he said. ``But we are all tainted, because there is
so much money washing around. That's an argument for campaign
finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All citizens deserve their government to work,'' he added. ``I
think it's entirely appropriate for me to say, `Will you make a
decision after two years?' It wasn't that complex.'' He also
criticized the FCC, saying it had ``the worst reputation of any of
the bureaucracies and at the same time they're the most
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, McCain's campaign distributed letters that McCain sent to
regulators over the years complaining of inaction.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's chief rival, George W. Bush, did not use the disclosure
to criticize McCain head-on, although he suggested that the
senator's action did not comport with his views on reforming the
campaign finance system. ``I think somebody who makes campaign
finance an issue has got to be consistent, and walk the walk,''
Bush said at a New Hampshire campaign appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers said they were surprised that McCain would make
requests over specific matters considering that his political
career faced its greatest challenge more than a decade ago after he
intervened with federal regulators on behalf another campaign
contributor, Charles Keating, an Arizona executive whose savings
and loan failed at a cost to taxpayers of $2 billion. A Senate
ethics investigation ultimately concluded that McCain had
``exercised poor judgment,'' but violated no ethics rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is hypocritical on the issue of money and
politics,'' said Jerold M. Starr, the co-chairman of the Save
Pittsburgh Public Television Campaign, which has been trying to
block the transfer of the public television station.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a clear case of him responding to special pleadings of
monied interests and it is harmful to the public interests of this
community,'' Starr said. ``We lose a valued public television
station that was the only truly public station in this community,
and $17 or $18 million dollars gets turned over to a conservative
evangelical station that embodies the opposite of the principles of
public television.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr and others filed an ethics complaint with the FCC
contending that the companies and McCain broke the rules by failing
to provide all interested parties with copies of his letters. The
letters first surfaced in Pittsburgh newspapers last month.

 DURHAM, N.H. : good person.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By contrast, Gore seemed calmer than in his earlier performances
as he fielded questions from Jennings, but still did not shrink
from aggressively criticizing Bradley's record. He was particularly
persistent in upbraiding the former senator from New Jersey for
what he depicted as mistaken votes, such as supporting President
Reagan's budget cuts. '
</P>
<P>
   ``We passed tough welfare reform, which I think has worked _ you
voted against it,'' Gore said. ``I voted against those budget cuts;
you voted for them. I voted, as I said a moment ago, for the
resolution to use military force to push Saddam Hussein out of
Kuwait; you voted against it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he did not regret any of those votes. ``In `81, if
everybody in the Congress had voted as I had voted,'' he said, ``we
would not have had the deficit of the 1990s. As a result of that we
would have had more economic growth.'' He said he was still not
convinced that the welfare reform effort was working _ or that it
would have been wrong to try sanctions before using force against
Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   In espousing his positions, Bradley sought to depict the vice
president as thinking like a Washington insider _ and afraid to try
ambitious proposals. ``When I hear you talk, Al, it reminds me of a
Washington bunker,'' Bradley said. ``I can understand why you're in
the bunker because of Gingrich, there were fundraising scandals,
the impeachment problem. I think the major objective of the last
several years in the White House has been political survival.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that,'' he continued. ``But the reality is the
Democratic Party should be thinking big things, with big
ambitions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore portrayed Bradley as hopelessly out of touch with the
realities of Washington. Asked by Jennings if Bradley had adequate
experience to be president, Gore said, ``That's going to be for the
voters to decide. I don't want to make a judgment about his
experience or ability.''

PUTIN GAINS SUPPORT AS DATE IS CONFIRMED FOR ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
  (CLARIFIES that Yeltsin will be spending holiday in Holy Land and
adding airport he landed at in 2nd graf after optional trim)

 By CELESTINE BOHLEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A truncated presidential campaign opened in Russia
Wednesday, after the parliament's upper house confirmed March 26 as
the day when voters will choose a successor to Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood that their choice will be acting President
Vladimir Putin, Yeltsin's chosen heir, became even greater
Wednesday when a group of powerful regional governors dropped their
allegiance to his potential rival, former Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, and swung on board the Putin bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Another candidate, Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the liberal
Yabloko party, Wednesday broke a four-day silence and announced his
intention to run for president. But in an interview on a Moscow
radio station, he admitted his chances were slight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything stays the same, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin
will win,'' said Yavlinsky, who said he was running both for the
sake of democratic principles and for the sake of his own
electorate, which, according to results in the December
parliamentary elections, now represents 6 percent of Russian
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a political maverick with a record of
supporting the Kremlin in tight spots, has already declared his
candidacy, and Thursday, the Communist party leader, Gennady
Zyuganov is expected to announce that he, too, will join the
lopsided race. A final word from Primakov _ a favorite for the
presidency just six months ago _ is not expected until next week.
</P>
<P>
   But as Russia's governors filed out of the extraordinary session
of the Council of Federation Wednesday afternoon, several confirmed
the view that Putin's candidacy is at this point virtually
unstoppable. ``There are no forces that can stand against Putin
today,'' said Dmitry Ayatskov, governor of the Saratov region.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, several governors noted, no one wants to see succession
by acclamation. ``If there are no rivals, then there is no
democracy, and if there is no democracy, then what was the point of
demolishing the country,'' asked Vasily Starodubtsev, the Communist
governor of Tula province, in an interview on NTV, a
privately-owned television network.
</P>
<P>
   Now both acting president and prime minister, Putin, 47,
Wednesday called for a different kind of Russian election campaign,
one that is ``utterly clean, without any mudslinging and aimed at
one thing _ creating equal conditions for all participants,'' he
said. ``This will not only bring the most positive results, but
will also help consolidate society.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's presidential chances were given their biggest boost in
the Dec. 19 parliamentary elections where two pro-government
parties did surprisingly well, benefiting from a an ugly media war
waged on their behalf on two government-controlled television
stations.
</P>
<P>
   After a four-day holiday that began Dec. 31, the day of
Yeltsin's surprise resignation, several Russian newspapers resumed
publication Wednesday, providing new detail on the timing of his
decision, and generally giving him a fond farewell.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Kommersant, applauding the Kremlin for its ``New
Year's show,'' said that Yeltsin first told Putin of his decision
on Dec. 22 _ the same date given by Putin in a television interview
that aired Tuesday night. On Dec. 29, the paper said, Yeltsin
informed his chief of staff, Aleksandr Voloshin, of his decision.
Joined by a former chief of staff, Valentin Yumashev, the three sat
down at Yeltsin's country house to write the television
announcement that was broadcast at noon Friday.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kommersant, the broadcast was not made until early
Friday morning, and the tape was taken to the television
broadcasting center only a half hour before airtime. When Yeltsin
and a small entourage sat down together for an informal lunch to
watch the broadcast, they discovered there was no television in the
dining room, and had to send Voloshin scurrying through Kremlin
offices to find one.
</P>
<P>
   Kommersant Wednesday also published a rare interview with one of
Yeltsin's daughters, Tatyana Dyachenko, in which she said she and
her mother, Naina Yeltsin, were only informed of the resignation on
the morning of Dec. 31, as the president was getting ready to film
the broadcast. ``When he hold us at home on the morning of the 31st
that he had decided to retire, Mama didn't quite understand that he
meant now, today,'' said Mrs. Dyachenko.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dyahcenko, 39, was relieved of her Kremlin job as the
president's ``image maker'' by Putin on Monday. But some political
observers say that her influence as a member of a small group of
Kremlin insiders _ including Voloshin, who has been reappointed
Kremlin chief of staff by Putin _ will probably continue, at least
until the March 26 election.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Russian newspapers, which have typically mocked Yeltsin for much
of his last term, Wednesday gave him a positive send-off, digging
up photographs for their front pages that were unusually
flattering. Headlines applauded him for a grand exit, and even
those skeptical of his motives congratulated him on rigging a
succession worthy of a czar.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, now a quasi-private citizen who has been granted a full
range of retirement benefits and privileges, flew from Moscow
Wednesday to Ben-Gurion Internation- al Airport to begin a vacation
in the Holy Land, where he will celebrate Russian Orthodox
Christmas with his wife and Aleksy II, patriarch of the Russian
Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   In a decree that provides Yeltsin with immunity against
prosecution, Putin also guaranteed financial security for the
Yeltsin family, providing them with security, cars, a government
country house, communications and, for the former president, even a
Kremlin office. Already, two top Kremlin staff members, relieved of
their old jobs by Putin, have gone to work on Yeltsin's private
staff which will also include the former presidential spokesman,
Dmitry Yakushkin.
</P>
<P>
   In her interview Wednesday, Ms. Dyachenko said her father plans
to travel abroad and to set up his own foundation _ similar to one
set up by former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev when he
resigned eight years ago. She said she plans to work there as well.
</P>
<P>
   At a departure ceremony at a Moscow airport Wednesday, where
Yeltsin and his wife were seen off by a high-level delegation that
included the ministers of Foreign Affairs and Defense, the former
president, in remarks to journalists, made a point of noting that
his status remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you feel?'' he was asked. ``I feel like Russia's first
president,'' said Yeltsin, before turning on his heels and setting
off for his plane.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki proposed a series of
initiatives Wednesday intended to strengthen the state's
educational system, including tuition subsidies for college
students who pledge to teach in public schools and other plans to
improve those schools that he said too often fail to live up to
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In his sixth annual address to the Legislature, Pataki also
listed several environmental proposals, calling for the creation of
a research institute to study the ecology of the Hudson River as
well as an expansion of the state's main program for cleaning up
toxic waste sites to include less dangerously polluted properties.
</P>
<P>
   From education to the environment to health care, Pataki's
stated goals signaled a shift in his priorities, especially since
he had devoted much of his first term to pursuing a brand of fiscal
conservatism that focused on halting what he contended were years
of excessive spending in Albany. Although he committed no new major
state spending for his proposals, the new direction seemed an
effort to dispel the notion that he was inflexible about social
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, who in 1995 became the state's first Republican governor
in 20 years, renewed his call for several measures that he had
failed to push through the Legislature in previous years, including
an end to parole for all violent felons, tougher penalties for
people convicted of sex crimes and giving teachers the right to
expel disruptive students from their classrooms. He also proposed a
set of new tax cuts, many of them intended to revive the state's
economically struggling upstate region and some of its urban
centers under a Main Streets program.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Toward the beginning of his hourlong speech, the governor took a
few humorous jabs, one at his former lieutenant governor, Betsy
McCaughey Ross, and another at Hillary Rodham Clinton's quest for a
U.S. Senate seat. He reminisced about his first annual address,
saying it ``seems like just yesterday that I stood, or that Betsy
and I stood up here'' _ eliciting laughter from lawmakers and aides
in referring to the gaffe by Ms. McCaughey Ross when she stood
through his entire speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we've succeeded to such an amazing extent that people
from all around the country are recognizing that New York is the
place to be,'' he continued. ``Why, even people from Hope, Ark.,
understand that New York is the best state to live in.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He used the latter part of his address to dwell on some of the
accomplishments of his first term: reducing taxes, eliminating
government regulation, cutting the welfare rolls to their lowest
levels ever and fighting crime. The governor told lawmakers that
those policies had helped turn the state around, and he urged them
to work with him to do more of the same as the state entered the
2000s.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Pataki's focus on education that drew the most
sustained applause and the loudest cheers from Democrats and
Republicans alike in the State Capitol's ornate Assembly chamber.
The response suggested that all sides sense that education is a
primary concern of voters in a year when members of both houses
prepare for their re-election campaigns.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``A new New York must begin with a renewed commitment to our
children's education,'' Pataki said from the dais, where he was
flanked by most of the top elected officials in the state,
including the leaders of both the state Senate and state Assembly,
as well as Lt. Gov. Mary Donohue, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer
and Comptroller H. Carl McCall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a long history of educational excellence to be proud
of,'' he continued. ``But today, although many of our schools still
excel, some students are forced to settle for less. Too many of our
children are victims of the most insidious enemy of excellence: low
expectation. We must refocus their sights, and ours, on academic
excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Pataki's education initiative is his proposal
to cover the tuition costs for any student attending a public
college in New York, provided he or she agrees to teach for four
years in public schools that are facing a shortage of teachers. The
program would provide students a scholarship of up to $3,400 a
year, and would also let them use the money at any private
university or college.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki administration estimates that the proposal would cost
the state about $25 million annually, and would help it attract as
many as 50,000 new teachers into the state's public school system
over the next 10 years. The proposal comes at a time when New York
City faces its worst teacher shortage ever: during the next five
years, the city's public school system will lose more than half of
its 78,000 teachers as an unusually high number of them, 54,000,
reach age 55 and become eligible for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to attract the best teachers of tomorrow to work in
our neediest schools,'' the governor said. ``Each year, thousands
of new graduates are produced by New York's fine colleges. But many
don't go into teaching, and often our most disadvantaged schools
don't get the benefit of the best new teachers. We can change
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech drew effusive praise from Pataki's fellow
Republicans, who frequently broke into applause as he spoke. ``It
truly had something in it that would benefit every New Yorker _
man, woman, child _ and every aspect of life,'' said Senate
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, an upstate Republican. ``It truly
builds on the success of the last five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic lawmakers also expressed support for the speech,
while leveling a few barbs at Pataki, saying he was supporting the
new proposals because his early education policies had proved to be
unpopular among New York's largely moderate electorate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has moved from the radical right wing to espouse
many of the principles that we have been talking about for the last
four years,'' said Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat from
Manhattan. ``I think we have proved that the people respond to the
issues that he talked about, issues of education, of health care,
of higher education and of job creation and getting New York state
into the national economic expansion. I think the governor has
finally heard the message and he is responding.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki also proposed a new initiative intended to encourage
college students to perform volunteer work in the state's
struggling inner-city schools, like tutoring children enrolled in
summer programs. In return, the college students would earn college
credits.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also proposed creating a tuition assistance program
to help the state's 9,000 uncertified teachers cover the cost of
college courses they must complete before being eligible to be
fully licensed as a teacher in New York. And he proposed that they
be allowed five years, instead of two, to get a master's degree for
completing certification requirements. There was no cost estimate
for the governor's proposals to relax those requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's plan would also let professionals from other
fields teach without having to meet the educational requirements
that a person must now fulfill to become a licensed teacher in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, Colin Powell can't teach in the New York schools
that he grew up in,'' the governor said. ``Billy Joel is not
qualified to teach piano to kids on Long Island. Eileen Collins can
pilot the space shuttle, but she can't teach science in Elmira, her
hometown. More importantly, thousands of less famous New Yorkers _
engineers, chemists, journalists _ could be great teachers as well.
Let's open the teacher qualification process so that people with
valuable life experiences can share them with our children.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal received tempered support from the powerful
teachers' union. Randi Weingarten, president of the United
Federation of Teachers, said she was pleasantly surprised at the
governor's proposal to provide scholarships to students who agree
to teach after graduating, as well as his plan to provide financial
assistance to unlicensed teachers who need to go back to school.
</P>
<P>
   But she was wary of his proposal to establish alternative
certification standards for obtaining a teaching license in New
York, saying she needed to review the specifics.

SPLIT UP KC SCHOOL DISTRICT, REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS PROPOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL SENTELL and KIT WAGAR  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ The Kansas City School District is riddled
with so many problems that it should be split into smaller
districts, Missouri House Republicans said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The school district also needs an inspector general to trim
waste and abuse, mentoring programs to improve the performance of
principals and teachers, and other sweeping changes, House
Republicans said.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise package, which faces major hurdles, was the biggest
development on the first day of the General Assembly's 2000
session. Most of the proposals would require legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan dismissed the idea of dividing the
Kansas City School District, which lost its state accreditation
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The governor believes the action would be premature because the
state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education is working
to improve the Kansas City district, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are making a strong effort to guide the Kansas City
district and they need to be given some time to make some
changes,'' said Jerry Nachtigal, Carnahan's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   David Smith, director of communications for the district, also
rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that with a new superintendent we have a very
strong plan in place and will be successful in raising our
achievement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office and other Democrats said that the plan
stemmed from election-year posturing.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan and other Democratic leaders have said that the state's
$6.7 billion tobacco settlement will be the key issue of the
session, which ends May 12.
</P>
<P>
   But House Republicans, citing dismal test scores and other
problems, said that problems in the Kansas City and St. Louis
school districts constitute a crisis and repeatedly demanded that
Carnahan deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly we have an urban education crisis in our state that
must be dealt with and dealt with immediately,'' said House
Republican leader Delbert Scott of Lowry City.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said Carnahan led support for a $310 million education tax
increase in 1993 and should ``show some leadership'' to improve
management of the Kansas City and St. Louis districts now.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan's office said the governor's legislative package, which
he unveils to a joint session on Jan. 19, will include
recommendations on the Kansas City and St. Louis school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats control the House 86-76 with one independent, which
means Republican bills on the Kansas City School District, and any
other issue, face major obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP plan and repeated challenges for Carnahan to act are
especially volatile because the governor is challenging Republican
U.S. Sen. John Ashcroft this year. Carnahan's stance on the plan,
any debate on the issue and the condition of the Kansas City and
St. Louis school districts could all be issues in the Senate
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft was in Kansas City on Wednesday, speaking at a school
on his proposals for improving failing schools through changes in
federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   In their key recommendation, House Republicans called on
Carnahan to name a commission to divide the Kansas City School
District into five or 10 smaller districts.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Shields, a St. Joseph Republican, said experts told
lawmakers studying desegregation in 1998 that small school
districts are more efficient and accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``What became apparent to us is it is impossible to operate
school districts with 35,000 kids and 45,000 kids,'' Shields told
reporters. The Kansas City district has about 30,000
schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Shields said he envisions pie-shaped districts that could be
drawn to ensure racial diversity. Shields said the current district
would continue only as a taxing authority and that each of the
newer districts or subdistricts would be independent.
</P>
<P>
   Shields said the Kansas City district could be divided into
districts with about 3,000 students each, including a high school,
two middle schools and four or five elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation approved two years ago gives Carnahan the authority
to name a commission now to split up the district, Republicans
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Carnahan's office labeled the proposal rash and questioned
the timing of the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might point out that for seven years Mel Carnahan has made
education a top priority and House Republicans and their leadership
have been fighting him every step of the way,'' spokesman Nachtigal
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the governor's office is ``a little skeptical of an
election-year conversion'' to highlight education issues.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Temple, executive director of the state Democratic Party,
labeled the proposal a ``shameful political tactic'' designed to
aid Ashcroft's bid for a second term.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also urged the governor to name an inspector general
to review financial and managerial matters in the Kansas City
district. Doing so, they said, would help prevent controversies
such as the recent credit-card dispute that led to the resignation
of school board member Connie Clark.
</P>
<P>
   GOP House members said mentoring programs for teachers and
principals would help the district and that similar ones have
worked in North Carolina and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The package also calls for ``opportunity scholarships'' for
district students to use in suburban or charter schools, and new
powers for troubled schools to dismiss ineffective teachers and
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Senate President Pro Tem Ed Quick of Liberty said the
plan was mostly warmed-over GOP rhetoric. Some of the ideas might
be workable with further study, he said, but he warned that many of
the ideas would encourage the district's best students to leave.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain, who has made fixing the corrosive
influence of money in politics the cornerstone of his campaign,
twice demanded in recent weeks that regulatory agency take action
in a matter that would ultimately benefit a major contributor to
his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Once in November and again last month, McCain wrote letters to
the Federal Communications Commission seeking a speedy vote on a
complicated swap of television station licenses in Pittsburgh. The
swap would enable the contributor, Paxson Communications, to buy
one of the stations in the only big market where it lacks one.
</P>
<P>
   McCain sent the letters after he and his aides had met with and
received more than $20,000 in contributions from executives for the
company and lobbyists. The head of the company, Lowell Paxson, who
also lent McCain his corporate jet four times last year, had
scheduled a fund-raiser for McCain in Florida for this weekend, but
canceled it at the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday McCain's letters became part of the presidential
campaign after an article about them was published in The Boston
Globe. Opponents of the station transfer charged that, when it
comes to the influence of money in politics, McCain says one thing
and does another.
</P>
<P>
   The letters did not tell the commissioners how to vote on the
license transfers, which had been in a regulatory abyss for more
than two years as community groups and the stations fought over the
matter and enlisted a variety of lawmakers to lobby on their
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the letters prompted an unusual response from the
chairman of the FCC suggesting that they were inappropriate. And
other officials said the tone of the letters made it clear to them
that McCain wanted the deal approved, even if he did not say so
explicitly.
</P>
<P>
   The letters are among dozens of inquiries sent to the FCC from
McCain over the years concerning regulatory matters, many of which
were disclosed in response to a Freedom of Information Act request
by The New York Times. The letters show that in a number of other
instances, McCain's requests to the agency involved companies that
were campaign contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respectfully request that the commission act on these
applications at its regularly scheduled monthly meeting in December
if it has not acted on them in the interim,'' McCain wrote on Nov.
17, in the Paxson case. ``If in your judgment the commission cannot
meet this request, please advise me of this fact in writing with a
specific and complete explanation, no later than Nov. 18.'' After
learning that the commission still had not acted, McCain wrote
again on Dec. 10, demanding that the commissioners explain why they
had not voted.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, McCain portrayed his action as routine and
insisted that he had done nothing wrong. He even brought up the
matter himself at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire on Wednesday
morning and used it as an example of how the campaign finance
system causes actions by politicians to be viewed with suspicion, a
theme he repeated several times during the day. ``Everything we do
is under a cloud of suspicion,'' he said at one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Paxson, but I know lots of people who come to me and
say that they are not being treated fairly by the bureaucracy,'' he
said. ``But we are all tainted, because there is so much money
washing around. That's an argument for campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All citizens deserve their government to work,'' he added. ``I
think it's entirely appropriate for me to say, `Will you make a
decision after two years?' It wasn't that complex.'' He also
criticized the FCC, saying it had ``the worst reputation of any of
the bureaucracies and at the same time they're the most
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, McCain's campaign distributed letters that McCain sent to
regulators over the years complaining of inaction.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's chief rival, George W. Bush, did not use the disclosure
to criticize McCain head-on, although he suggested that the
senator's action did not comport with his views on reforming the
campaign finance system. ``I think somebody who makes campaign
finance an issue has got to be consistent, and walk the walk,''
Bush said at a New Hampshire campaign appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the station license transfer were more blunt,
saying that his request is one of several examples of how he has
used his position as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee,
which has oversight responsibility for the Federal Communications
Commission, to advance the interests of friends and political
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   They also expressed surprise that McCain would make requests
over specific matters considering that his political career faced
its greatest challenge more than a decade ago after he intervened
with federal regulators on behalf another campaign contributor,
Charles Keating, an Arizona executive whose savings and loan failed
at a cost to taxpayers of $2 billion. A Senate ethics investigation
ultimately concluded that McCain had ``exercised poor judgment,''
but violated no ethics rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is hypocritical on the issue of money and
politics,'' said Jerold M. Starr, the co-chairman of the Save
Pittsburgh Public Television Campaign, which has been trying to
block the transfer of the public television station.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a clear case of him responding to special pleadings of
monied interests and it is harmful to the public interests of this
community,'' Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The proposed transfers would eliminate one of the two public
television stations in Pittsburgh as part of a three-way television
station swap valued at $35 million that would ultimately benefit a
religious station and Paxson's broadcasting company. Pittsburgh is
the only television market in the top 20 where Paxson
Communications does not have a station.
</P>
<P>
   Starr and others filed an ethics complaint with the FCC
contending that the companies and McCain broke the rules by failing
to provide all interested parties with copies of his letters. The
letters first surfaced in Pittsburgh newspapers last month.
</P>
<P>
   The letters on the Pittsburgh licenses were among many McCain
has sent to the Federal Communications Commission over the years
urging the agency to complete action in particular cases. Some
letters were written after he or his staff was lobbied by industry
executives and their lawyers, and while they were careful to avoid
taking a formal position, many demanded that the agency complete
its work on a particular case, and signaled to officials that the
senator would like the matter approved.
</P>
<P>
   When, for instance, an Arizona-based broadcasting company was
having regulatory trouble in 1998 selling four small radio stations
it owned in California, McCain wrote the FCC commissioner asking
why it was taking so long. The commission's review had threatened
to derail financing for the deal. Shortly after the letter was
sent, the commission backed down and approved the transfer.
</P>
<P>
   And when two large regional Bell telephone companies, including
one headed by a major McCain fund-raiser, faced sharp questions
about their proposed merger, McCain sent a letter with two other
senators complaining that the agency was applying too strict a
standard of review. One of the two companies involved, Ameritech,
was led by Richard Notebaert, a friend and leading fund-raiser for
the McCain campaign. The FCC ultimately approved that deal as well,
imposing stringent conditions on SBC Communications before
permitting it to purchase Ameritech.
</P>
<P>
   A review of 2,000 pages of correspondences from McCain and his
staff shows that he and his staff have often forwarded complaints
from constituents and others from outside Arizona without taking
any position, following the practice of most lawmakers. Many of
those were not contributors, and many of the issues involved ranged
from broadcast applications to consumer complaints about telephone
bills.
</P>
<P>
   But in the vast majority of those particular regulatory matters
where McCain himself sent a letter, the interested parties had
contributed to his presidential or Senate campaigns. The letters
typically have a boilerplate sentence that says that McCain is not
speaking on behalf of any particular party and that the letter
should be treated in conformity with the rules.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Pittsburgh stations, the McCain letters
evoked unusual complaints of interference from the commission
chairman, William E. Kennard, who responded on Dec. 14 that the
correspondence ``comes at a sensitive time in the deliberative
process'' and ``could have procedural and substantive impacts on
the Commission's deliberations and, thus, on the due process rights
of the parties.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioners who approved the transfer were two Republicans
and a Democrat, Susan Ness, who was been known for some time as the
swing vote and whose nomination for a second term is now before the
Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ness said in an interview today that the rules prohibited
her from talking about her deliberations in the Pittsburgh case and
that as a matter of policy, she has declined to discuss her pending
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always vote in my decisions based on the law and the facts
before us and anyone who knows my record knows that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson, whose company has his headquarters in West Palm Beach,
Fla., said in an interview that he was disappointed by the McCain
letters because they did not clearly take a position on the merits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you I'm excited about what McCain did,'' he said.
``We went to every member on the House and Senate side to get
people to write and tell the FCC to get off its duff.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxson said he had given money to many politicians, and was
involved in one fund-raiser in Florida that was the largest ever
for Democrats in that state. ``I'm a political person. Why? Because
I happen to be in a business that politics is very heavily involved
in.''

 McCAIN'S LETTER TO FCC AND THE COMMISSION'S REPLIES 
 (With MCCAIN-FCC) 
(rk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are a letter dated Dec. 10, 1999, from Sen. John
McCain to William E. Kennard, the chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission, and excerpts from the replies of Kennard
and Commissioner Gloria Tristani:
</P>
<P>
   McCain's Letter:
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 17, I wrote you expressing concern over the protracted
pendency of the pending applications for assignment of licenses of
WQEX-TV and WPCB-TV, Pittsburgh, Pa. I requested that the
commission take final action on these applications at its open
meeting in December, if it had not acted on them in the intention
pursuant to the notation voting process. I enclose a copy of this
letter for your reference.
</P>
<P>
   I have in hand a copy of the public notice setting out the
agenda for the commission's open meeting on Dec. 15. These
applications are not listed for consideration. Nor has my public
notice yet been issued indicating that the commission has taken
final action on these applications pursuant to the notation voting
process.
</P>
<P>
   In light of these considerations, I respectfully request that
each member of the commission advise me, in writing no later than
close of business on Tuesday, Dec. 14, 1999, whether you have
already acted upon these applications in the course of the notation
voting process. If your answer to the latter question is no, please
state further whether you will, or will not, be prepared to act on
these applications at the open meeting on Dec. 15. If your answer
to both of the proceeding questions is no, please explain why.
</P>
<P>
   The sole purpose of this request is to secure final action on a
matter that has now been pending for over two years. I emphasize
that my purpose is not to suggest in any way how you should vote _
merely that you vote. In order to assure that no oral ex parte
communications on the merits of these applications take place, I
will not entertain any oral responses of any kind to this letter.
</P>
<P>
   This letter is not written to obtain favorable disposition of
any matter on behalf of any party to any proceeding before the
commission. Please treat this letter in compliance with all
applicable substantive and procedural rules.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard's Reply:
</P>
<P>
   As you know, this application raises important and very
difficult policy issues. I wholeheartedly agree that prompter
commission action on this matter would have been preferable.
</P>
<P>
   Your letter, however, comes at a sensitive time in the
deliberative process as the individual commissioners finalize their
views and their votes on this matter. I must respectfully note that
it is highly unusual for the commissioners to be asked to publicly
announce their voting status on a matter that is still pending. I
am concerned that inquiries concerning the individual deliberations
of each commissioner could have procedural and substantive impacts
on the commission's deliberations and, thus, on the due process
rights of the parties.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tristani's Reply:
</P>
<P>
   Respectfully, I cannot comply with your request. In order to
preserve the integrity of our processes, it is my practice not to
publicly disclose whether I have voted or when I will be voting on
items in restricted proceedings prior to their adoption by the full
commission.

GATEWAY SAYS EARNINGS WILL FALL BELOW ANALYSTS' EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Gateway Inc. announced after the market's close Wednesday that
its earnings would fall well below Wall Street estimates, sending
its shares into a dive as steep as 18 percent in after-hours
trading.
</P>
<P>
   The company attributed the setback to supply shortages and to
companies' delaying purchases because of year 2000 fears. Gateway
executives were particularly and pointedly critical of their key
supplier, the Intel Corp., the dominant producer of microprocessor
chips.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharply worded statement, the company described Intel's
shipments of chips and computer boards as ``severely constrained,
spotty and unreliable, particularly in our consumer sweet spot''
for machines in the ``$999 to $1,299 price range.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with industry analysts, Jeffrey Weitzen,
the s president and chief executive of Gateway, termed the last
three months of 1999 a ``particularly aggravating quarter.'' And he
vowed the company would no longer be so dependent on a single
supplier, saying Gateway would announce additional supply
arrangements in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Only last year, Gateway switched away from buying some
microprocessors from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and relied on
Intel alone for microprocessors, the electronic brains of
computers, and came to rely more on Intel-made mother boards, the
fundamental circuit boards that hold the processor, clusters of
microchips, the memory and the expansion slots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel had a series of issues itself, and we are particularly
dependent on them for chips and chip sets,'' Weitzen said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his apparent anger at Intel, he replied, ``My
irritation is as much with us as with the people who helped get us
into the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel had acknowledged in November that chip supplies might be
tight. A spokesman said Wednesday that the company could not
comment because of restrictions on making statements prior to
releasing quarterly earnings, which are due on Jan. 13. Gateway
made the announcement after the close of trading. Earlier, the
company's shares closed down 69 cents, at $62.25 . But in
after-hours trading, Gateway shares fell as low as $51. Intel
shares, which gained 69 cents to close at $83.63 for the day, fell
as low as $81.125 in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway said that the chip shortages reduced its revenue in the
fourth quarter by between $200 million and $250 million. Revenue
was cut another $100 million to $150 million as a result of
government and corporate buyers that held off year-end purchases
because of a freeze before the year 2000 rollover, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Gateway said that it expected its revenue for the
quarter to be about $2.45 billion, a 6 percent increase over the
same period a year earlier. The impact on earnings was to reduce
per-share profit to 37 cents. That was about 7 cents below the
consensus estimate of Wall Street analysts, which had already
recently been lowered by 5 cents a share to account for expenses
incurred in a new marketing partnership with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway, according to analysts, was particularly hard-hit
because the consumer market accounts for so much of its sales,
especially in the year-end holiday sales season. And the spotty
shipments from Intel were in chip lines crucial to high-demand
consumer PCs _ its Celeron 400 megahertz and P3 450 megahertz
Pentium processors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personal computer demand in the fourth quarter turned out to
be higher than expected a few months earlier, and Gateway geared up
for high volume but Intel wasn't able to deliver,'' said David Wu,
an analyst for ABN Amro Securities.
</P>
<P>
   To explain how much the shortages hurt consumer sales, John
Todd, Gateway's chief financial officer, noted that in the previous
quarter sales of PCs priced in the $999-1,299 range represented
about 55 percent of the machines Gateway shipped. But in the fourth
quarter, machines in that popular price range accounted for less
than 40 percent of Gateway's shipments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not have the most attractive offerings in these price
points,'' Weitzen said. ``And customers had other options in the
marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Gateway executives said they did not anticipate that the
fourth-quarter problems would continue into 2000. They said the
company's sales and earnings for the first quarter of 2000 were
expected to be in line with analysts' forecasts: revenue of $2.45
billion and profit of 41 cents a share.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
During most of the regular season, last year's NFC Championship
Game disappointment was the last thing on the Minnesota Vikings'
minds.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They were too concerned with trying to overcome a 2-4 start,
simply hoping another playoff berth was in their future.
</P>
<P>
   But everything has fallen into place lately. Not only did the
Viking wrap up another postseason spot, they did it with an
impressive 8-2 spurt down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be 16-0 _ the hell with eight games out of 10,''
receiver Randy Moss said. ``We can't really be satisfied with what
we've done so far. Everybody's goal is the Super Bowl. If we don't
get there, it will be a big disappointment for the second year in a
row.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, last year is once again haunting the Vikings' locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're more focused this year than last year,'' Moss
said. ``When Atlanta came in here, there was a lot of hype. Even
though we didn't say it, I think we bought into the hype. Now,
we're just talking about getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Vikings breezed through the regular season, with the
exception of one slipup against Tampa Bay. It wasn't just the 15-1
record but the way it was compiled that had Minnesota feeling
invulnerable. The Vikings outscored their opponents by an average
of 37-19 per game. They went undefeated in the second half of the
season, with only one game decided by a touchdown or less.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, quarterback Randall Cunningham was heading to the
Pro Bowl, and the Vikings were ready to hang the NFC Central title
banner with three games left to play. They wrapped up home-field
advantage throughout the postseason with one week remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But it's been quite a different season this time around. This
year, Cunningham was benched, and his team wasn't completely out of
its hole until clinching a playoff berth less than two weeks ago.
It took a win on Sunday to earn a first-round home game against
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   And so much for those horribly lopsided games. Of the Vikings'
10 victories this season, seven were by eight points or fewer. In
six of those, they had to come from behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you're 2-4 and lose the division games that we lost,
there's only two ways to go,'' defensive coordinator Foge Fazio
said. ``You can either come out fighting like hell, or pack it in
and say the hell with it. Because you know you can't afford to lose
too many more games after going 2-4. There really wasn't much room
for error. This team had to play through a lot of things to get
where we are now.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why they feel they're better than that 15-1 team from
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're a tougher football team,'' offensive line coach
Mike Tice said. ``We're tougher physically than we were last year,
and we're tougher mentally. And I think the mental aspect is really
going to pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   The savior this season has been quarterback Jeff George, who was
handed the ropes midway through the Vikings-Detroit game in Week 6.
The Vikings were 2-3 at the time, and even George's second-half
heroics couldn't erase a 19-0 deficit that became Minnesota's
fourth loss in six weeks. Cunningham had thrown nine interceptions
and only eight touchdown passes in those six games.
</P>
<P>
   George completed 10 of 12 attempts for 214 yards and two
touchdowns in the second half of that Lions game. The job was his
for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that was going wrong was not Randall Cunningham's
fault,'' Vikings coach Dennis Green said. ``We felt we had to make
a move to get a chance to regroup. We had not had really good
offensive production, even in training camp. We were not getting
the points up. We were just off.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is hard to believe with the receiving tandem of Cris
Carter and Moss. Moss got off to a slow start but still finished
with 80 catches for an NFC-best 1,413 yards and 11 touchdowns. And
Carter, a 13-year veteran, seems to get better with age. He had 90
catches for 1,241 yards, the second most prolific season in his
career. And his 13 TDs led NFC receivers.
</P>
<P>
   With those targets, George finished with the third-best
quarterback rating in the NFC. He completed 58.1 percent of his
attempts for 2,816 yards and 23 touchdowns. He had a rating of
94.2.
</P>
<P>
   But while Moss' final numbers are nothing to be sneezed at, it's
been a tough season for the second-year pro. He has dropped passes,
fumbled and had his attitude questioned by Minnesota owner Red
McCombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wasn't into my game recently,'' Moss said a couple of
weeks ago. ``I was moping around. I was always wondering if we were
going to get the ball to me. I really don't want to say bored. I
think I'm just being too relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   But not for the big games, Moss said. And there have been
plenty. When the Vikings needed to beat Detroit this past Sunday to
ensure a home game, Moss made five catches for 155 yards. He set a
club record this season with seven 100-yard receiving games. And in
his two career games against Dallas, he's caught nine balls for 254
yards and five touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like big games,'' Moss explained.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's weakness has been its defense, most notably its
secondary, which includes cornerbacks Kenny Wright, a rookie, and
Robert Tate, a converted wide receiver, and second-year starting
safety Anthony Bass. The Vikings are 30th of 31 teams in pass
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't worry about that,'' Bass said. ``This is the NFL, and
people are going to come after us every week because we're young.
We can't let those guys or their game plan scare us.''
</P>
<P>
   That's been the attitude around the locker room ever since the
2-4 start. The Vikings have been determined to take one game at a
time, gaining confidence with each win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Character probably shows up more in adverse circumstances,''
running back Leroy Hoard said. ``You know, when we were 15-1 and
blowing everybody out, you can't talk too much about character. But
being 2-4 and then coming back? That says a lot for our team.''
</P>
<P>
   What they hope it says is that this team has learned from the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to see,'' Carter said. ``We'll have to wait until
we get through this year's playoffs, and then we'll find out what
we learned.''

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Damon Huard should start at quarterback for the Dolphins ahead of
Dan Marino in Sunday's playoff game at the Kingdome between Miami
and Seattle.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six months ago, such a comment would have been ludicrous at best
and blasphemous at worst. But more than a few people are saying it
_ or whispering it _ from South Florida to the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Marino has completed more passes and thrown for more touchdowns
than any other quarterback in NFL history. His place in the Hall of
Fame is secure, but his place this weekend is in question.
</P>
<P>
   The Marino of 1999 has not been the Marino NFL fans have admired
for so many years. Consider a few statistical comparisons between
the legend and the newcomer:
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins are 1-5 since Marino returned from a neck injury
Thanksgiving Day. His quarterback rating (69.1) is the second-worst
among starting quarterbacks. He finished the regular season with 12
touchdown passes and 16 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   When he replaced Marino on Oct. 17, Huard led the Dolphins to
four wins in five games, including an impressive 31-30 comeback
victory at New England. He has thrown for eight touchdowns and only
four interceptions while completing 58 percent of his passes (125
of 216) for 1,288 yards.
</P>
<P>
   In last weekend's loss at Washington in the regular-season
finale, Marino played poorly in the first half, completing 11 of 24
passes for 118 yards and one interception. Huard was 18-for-29 for
162 yards in relief, including a TD pass.
</P>
<P>
   But Miami coach Jimmy Johnson announced Marino will start
against Seattle. Benching one of the greatest quarterbacks ever to
play the game in what could be his last playoff opportunity is not
a decision any coach wants to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me say this right now: Dan is our starting quarterback,''
Johnson said. ``Let's put the soap opera on the back burner for a
week. Just one week. Let's ask these guys questions about Seattle.
They would be a lot happier if you did.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino, 38 and about to start his 17th playoff game, knows some
people are saying Father Time has caught up with him and that he
should retire. But he disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not done,'' Marino said. ``The people who know football
understand that. This is my job, and I take great pride in what I
do. To hear people say I'm finished, well, I don't let that kind of
criticism bother me. I'm past that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Dolphins fans remain firmly in Marino's corner, believing
their hero should have one last chance to win a Super Bowl, no
matter how remote the chances are for a 9-7 team that backed into
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The real question is whether this is Marino's last chance. He
has made no announcement about retiring, and he seems to be leaning
toward playing one more season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been answering this question, and I'm tired of answering
it,'' Marino said. ``You never know when your last game is going to
be. I've been saying that for the last month every time I've been
asked the question. Who knows what the future holds?''
</P>
<P>
   All of Miami's woes this season can't be blamed on Marino. The
secondary has been porous at times, the offensive line has not
lived up to expectations, and the running game has been almost
nonexistent in some games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to take a long look at our offense to try to cut
down on our turnovers,'' Johnson said. ``Dan and I talked about
this a long time this week. We're looking at the things Dan is most
comfortable using, and that's what we're going to concentrate on.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino continues to have pain from a disk injury in his neck
that some people believe has affected his throwing. Sources say he
may have surgery when the season ends.
</P>
<P>
   The fans want Marino to return, but they don't seem too keen on
Johnson's staying. Johnson has given not-so-subtle hints throughout
the season that Marino is the root of the team's problems.
</P>
<P>
   If Marino retires, Johnson may coach another year. If Marino
stays, sources say Johnson is likely to call it quits.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga said he wants to be involved in
any decision Marino makes. Huizenga made an unusual gesture last
week when he flew Marino's family to Washington _ just in case it
was Marino's final game.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Fry, a columnist who regularly covers the Dolphins for
the St. Petersburg Times, took the controversial step this week of
writing that Marino should be benched and Huard should start if
Miami hopes to have any chance to defeating the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Huard, a University of Washington product, is going home this
weekend. He hopes to play in front of family and friends against
the team he grew up cheering for and even worked for as a
front-office employee in the past. He also will be on the opposite
sideline from his brother, Brock Huard, a backup quarterback for
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny the road life takes you down sometimes,'' Damon
Huard said. ``It's been an interesting journey. This game means a
lot to me. I have such a close association with the Seahawks, and I
know a lot of people there. I have a lot of ties.''
</P>
<P>
   It would seem the perfect situation for Damon Huard to shine,
but it will be Marino's show as the veteran tries to prove he still
has the skills that made him one of the game's best passers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damon hasn't played much in the last couple of months,''
Johnson said. ``He has some success, but I think it's best for us
to go with Dan right now. I think Dan is our best chance to win. I
would anticipate that we will stay with him throughout the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Huard has managed to stay above the controversy and continues to
be fully supportive of Marino.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned a lot from Dan, and it's been great being his
understudy,'' Huard said. ``It also has been great for me to get
out there and play. This year has had its highs and lows, but
that's the nature of this business. What we've got to do now is
rally around Dan in the playoffs and make this thing happen.''

EX-GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS, BACK IN NEW YORK, TALKS OF A 2ND
STATEHOUSE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Is it something in the water?
</P>
<P>
   On the same day that Hillary Rodham Clinton was moving from
Washington to Chappaqua, N.Y., in preparation for a run for the
U.S. Senate, William F. Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts,
was moving from Cambridge to the Upper East Side of Manhattan,
presenting himself as a possible Republican candidate for governor
of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Weld, speaking from his law firm's office in Boston, said his
interest in public service remained strong, even after being
governor of Massachusetts from 1991 to 1997 and conducting a
prolonged but failed battle to win confirmation from fellow
Republicans in the Senate as ambassador to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Weld, displaying a clear command of the intricacies of New York
election law, said that he needed to be a state resident for five
years before he could seek the governorship, and that his residency
clock began ticking Wednesday. ``We're living in the Apple,'' Weld
announced, referring to New York City. ``We're actually moving in
today, the same day as Mrs. Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The former governor of Massachusetts would be eligible to run
for governor of New York in 2006. He suggested that he would hold
off only if a more established Republican, like Gov. George Pataki
or Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, was in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't run against either Pataki or Giuliani, but of all
the possible future public activities, I think governor of New York
is the most appealing to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new New York resident hastened to add that he, unlike, say,
Mrs. Clinton, was a native. He was born in Smithtown on Long
Island, he noted, and lived in the state until he was 20, when he
left to go to Harvard for what turned out to be a 34-year absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a carpetbagger in Massachusetts,'' Weld said. ``I'm a
native New Yorker who spends a lot of time upstate.''
</P>
<P>
   As Weld noted, any political career in New York for him is at
least five years away, and the shape of the field by then is far
from clear. Pataki has indicated that he may seek a third term in
2002, though his communications director, Zenia Mucha, gasped when
asked what he might do when the 2006 gubernatorial race comes. ``A
fourth term?'' she responded. ``The governor hasn't made a decision
on a third term, much less a fourth term.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning Weld's disclosure to her boss' advantage, Ms. Mucha
added, ``We're glad to see that New York is doing so phenomenally
well that people are returning to their roots and moving back in.''
</P>
<P>
   Weld said he was drawn by the possibility of being the governor
of two states. ``I think New York is a sufficiently larger
operation than Massachusetts, so I would have a learning curve,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My governing passion in life is fear of boredom,'' he said.
``I generally don't do the same thing more than four or five years
in a row.''

BLUE CROSS REACHES OUT TO DOCTORS IN EFFORT TO SETTLE DIFFERENCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH and PAUL WENSKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In an effort to keep doctors in its health
plans, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City is seeking advice
from physicians to resolve the divisive issue of who decides
whether care is medically necessary _ insurers or doctors.
</P>
<P>
   That issue has been a source of ongoing tension between
physicians and Blue Cross, the area's largest health insurer, with
about 775,000 members in 32 counties. Many physicians still have
not signed contracts with Blue Cross despite a January deadline.
The insurer would not say exactly how many had not signed.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments over medical necessity, and who should make the
decisions, can take many forms and may pose major ramifications for
health-care consumers.
</P>
<P>
   As a hypothetical example, say a patient has cancer and the
patient's physician recommends a certain treatment. The patient's
insurance company says it will not pay for that type of treatment
but will pay for another treatment. Not only are the physician and
insurance company at odds, but the patient also may feel that he is
being denied the best form of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In a Jan. 3 letter to its participating physicians, Blue Cross
said it was assembling a Medical Necessity Advisory Committee to
review existing Blue Cross policies. The letter said committee
recommendations could prompt policy changes by the second quarter
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will consist of 10 members plus three ex-officio
members, almost all of them physicians. Meetings are scheduled for
Jan. 21, Feb. 4, Feb. 18 and March 3.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross officials said they are committed to resolving
differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever comes out of these meetings, we're bound to,'' said
physician Frank DiTirro, a Blue Cross senior vice president and the
insurer's chief medical officer.
</P>
<P>
   Some local physicians applauded the formation of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may finally settle the medical necessity issue we're all
concerned about in the contracts,'' said Rebecca Gaughan,
president-elect of the Medical Society of Johnson and Wyandotte
Counties, who is a member of the new advisory committee and hasn't
signed the contract. ``This is what we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Buie, a past president of the Metropolitan Medical Society
of Greater Kansas City and also a committee member, said, ``We're
hopeful this will improve communications with Blue Cross. You need
ongoing discussions with physicians to avoid a meltdown.''
</P>
<P>
   A meltdown seemed possible late last year when, in a rare show
of protest, at least 1,000 physicians declined to sign or delayed
signing contracts with Blue Cross.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Blue Cross responded to the revolt by sending
contract amendments to all 3,200 physicians in its health-plan
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the contract amendments was a guarantee that
payments to physicians would not decline for one year. In addition,
Blue Cross said it was open to discussions on whether physicians or
insurers should decide what constitutes medically necessary care.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross spokeswoman Jean Peat said on Tuesday that hundreds
of additional physicians had signed the new agreement, but she
declined to give a specific number.
</P>
<P>
   Peat said Blue Cross was issuing cancellation notices this month
to physicians who have not signed. She said physicians who receive
such notices will have between 90 and 120 days to reconsider and
sign the contracts. They will remain in the Blue Cross network
until the end of that period, working under the terms of the
expired contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That allows the negotiation process to move forward with
physicians without an interruption of services to their patients,''
Peat said.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Blue Cross' announcement of its new advisory
panel, as it tries to induce physicians to sign contracts, was met
by skepticism among some health-care officials.

JOHNSON REVISES OFFER TO BUY JETS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Wood Johnson IV, a finalist in the bidding to buy the New
York Jets, revised his offer Wednesday, pulling at least even with
the offer from the other finalist, Charles F. Dolan, said two
people involved with the sale process.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Dolan have now made bids in the range of $615
million to $625 million, the people involved in the sale said.
</P>
<P>
   The financial differences between them appear to be so small
that choosing the winner could center on which bidder has a better
chance of being approved by a three-quarters vote of National
Football League owners.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known if Dolan would counter Johnson, or how how much
longer Goldman, Sachs, which is handling the sale for the estate of
Leon Hess, will keep the process going.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson's increased offer, which came after he returned from
a Hawaiian vacation, demonstrates that the sale of the team has not
been detoured by the turmoil that began Monday when Bill Parcells
retired as head coach. His designated successor, Bill Belichick,
resigned the next day, citing uncertainties about the future owner.
</P>
<P>
   A winning bid may be chosen early next week by Goldman, Sachs
and the Hess estate, a few weeks later than had been anticipated.
The selection would then have to be voted on by the NFL's finance
committee, possibly at a meeting set for next Tuesday, and then by
the full ownership on Jan. 18.
</P>
<P>
   The finance committee postponed a conference call scheduled for
Wednesday to discuss the Jets' sale because there was not enough
information to assess.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England
Patriots, who appears interested in hiring Belichick as the head
coach and general manager, is chairman of the finance committee.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that Belichick's surprise resignation did not delay
the sale of the team, said the people involved with the process, is
that his seemingly rash decision and rambling demeanor at his news
conference on Tuesday suggested to the suitors that he might have
been ill-suited to take over for Parcells. Belichick's departure
also ensured that Parcells, the chief football operations officer,
would not choose a new coach without consulting whoever wins the
right to purchase the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson would probably have an easier time gaining NFL approval
than Dolan. A wealthy investor, philanthropist and Republican
fund-raiser, Johnson is little known to the NFL owners, and has not
lobbied for votes.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has no baggage, unlike Dolan, whose Cablevision holdings
_ including cable TV systems, sports and entertainment networks,
Madison Square Garden, the Knicks, the Rangers and the Liberty _
concern the league enough to require him to separate his corporate
and personal assets. That would bar Garden executives from running
the Jets or from mingling the Jets with the Knicks or Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL bars corporate ownership, although many owners use their
corporate wealth to buy teams as personal investments.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Tisch, the co-owner of the Giants, said of Dolan: ``He's a
man of great integrity. Whatever he signs, he'll live up to.''
</P>
<P>
   Tisch said he saw no problem in having Dave Checketts, the
president of the Garden, run the Jets. ``If he wants to use his
assets to improve his team,'' Tisch said of Dolan, ``I don't object
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Dolan supporter, Art Modell, the owner of the Baltimore
Ravens, said, ``I can't fathom what Cablevision, or a cable system,
or the Garden, has to do with the Jets.''
</P>
<P>
   In the only previous test of Dolan's appeal to owners _ his
joint bid with his brother, Lawrence, to buy the expansion
Cleveland Browns in 1998 _ he received seven votes to Al Lerner's
22. On a subsequent ballot, the pro-Dolan votes shifted to Lerner. &QL;

BLUE CROSS REACHES OUT TO DOCTORS IN EFFORT TO SETTLE DIFFERENCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH and PAUL WENSKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ...some health-care officials.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hellman, the new president of the Metropolitan Medical
Society of Greater Kansas City, said the committee's open-ended
agenda appears to fall short of a commitment ``that medical
necessity will no longer come under the control of Blue Cross.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Holloway, director of government relations for the Missouri
State Medical Association in Jefferson City, said that a ``cynic
might believe that Blue Cross was doing this to get the press off
its back and to get physicians to sign the contracts in the
meantime.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Slaughter, executive director of the Kansas Medical
Society in Topeka, Kan., said that many physicians ``will want to
see the proof in the pudding.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some national health-care officials appear to be
impressed by the efforts to work out health coverage differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has the potential for significant improvement,''
said Richard F. Corlin, speaker of the American Medical
Association's House of Delegates. Last year, Corlin testified
before Congress on the need for physicians to be in charge of
determining medical necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Corlin said he wasn't aware of another committee in the nation
as ``specifically focused'' on the issue of medical necessity.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA has proposed a definition of medical necessity that uses
a ``prudent physician'' standard that is consistent with
``generally accepted standards of medical practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend that many health insurers place too much
emphasis on costs when defining medical necessity.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of medical necessity is prompting debate nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Miller, with Blue Shield of California, said his plan
instituted a Medical Policy and Technology Assessment Committee
that addresses medical necessity policies in a public forum.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Leamon, spokeswoman for the Blue Cross and Blue Shield
Association in Chicago, said her group continually seeks the input
of national health provider organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's very important to communicate with the
physicians, to make sure we are meeting the needs of consumers and
providing the highest level of care possible,'' Leamon said.
</P>
<P>
   Health-care officials and consumer advocates say a long-term
resolution to the dispute would be the creation of outside peer
review groups.
</P>
<P>
   Hellman said, ``there should be an independent review.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levin, director of the New York-based Center for Medical
Consumers, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prefer a totally external system where the reviewing
doctors have no relationship to the particular plan or to any of
the other parties,'' Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kansas and Missouri offer external review procedures for
such disputes in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross formerly had physician advisory committees that met
regularly with insurance officials on a wide range of medical and
procedural issues. But those committees were discontinued five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   DiTirro said Blue Cross already uses independent groups of
physicians to decide medical necessity questions in certain cases.
</P>
<P>
   And he said Blue Cross is open to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is off the table in these meetings,'' DiTirro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be taking e-mails, phone, any kind of message from the
medical community at large for consideration in our deliberation
process.''

SECURITY IS UNUSUALLY HEAVY FOR PATAKI'S SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ For 28 years, state Sen. Frank Padavan has passed
through the glass archway to the Capitol building to take his place
for the governor's annual speech to the Legislature. But Wednesday,
his way was blocked by a uniformed state police officer, who
politely but firmly asked to see some identification.
</P>
<P>
   The startled senator paused as the officer added gingerly, ``Are
you a senator?''
</P>
<P>
   As Padavan nodded, the officer stepped back. ``Sorry, I didn't
recognize you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something new,'' Padavan, a Queens Republican, said a
moment later with bemusement. ``Usually, you walk right in. This is
really a public building.''
</P>
<P>
   The normally disorderly flow of government workers, lobbyists
and spectators through the Capitol slowed to nearly a trickle as
hundreds of state and city police officers increased security.
Tours were canceled, at least two entrances were closed off and
nearly everyone was asked for an ID card or a pass.
</P>
<P>
   The heightened security, officials said, came largely in
response to a spirited rally Wednesday by more than 6,000
government workers at the Empire State Plaza across the street from
the Capitol building. The workers represented two unions, the Civil
Service Employees Association and the New York State Public
Employees Federation, which have been negotiating with state
officials for new contracts since the previous ones expired in
April.
</P>
<P>
   For some lawmakers, the extra security brought the disconcerting
sense of wandering by mistake into, say, City Hall in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the clampdown in City Hall, and I was saddened to see
the same thing happen in the Capitol,'' said Sen. Thomas Duane, a
Democrat who represents Lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Although stringent security has become commonplace in City Hall
during Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's administration, the state Capitol
has largely remained an open forum. Only part of the second floor,
where the governor has his office, is normally closed to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good God, it looks like a police state,'' exclaimed Sen. Suzi
Oppenheimer, a Westchester County Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, some protesters gathered on the Capitol lawn in
hopes of getting close enough to be heard by lawmakers. But at no
point did their voices intrude on the hushed Assembly chamber where
the governor was speaking.

NEW YORK EXPERTS TAKING WIDER ROLE IN TERROR INQUIRY
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: N.Y., Wash.) 
(nk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno summoned top
prosecutors and law enforcement officials from New York and Seattle
on Wednesday to a strategy meeting on terrorism. This follows last
month's arrest of a man trying to enter the United States from
Canada carrying explosives and timers, government officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the meeting, several officials said that it
appeared certain that federal prosecutors and FBI agents in New
York would play a significantly broader role in the terrorism
inquiry, a sign that the Justice Department could shift the
responsibility for the case from Seattle to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in New York are regarded in law enforcement
circles as more aggressive and experienced than any other
prosecutors in the country in their efforts to bring suspects to
trial in cases of overseas terrorism directed at the United States,
like the World Trade Center bombing and the attacks on American
embassies in East Africa in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, prosecutors in New York are regarded as the country's
top experts in overseas terror groups, like the loose network
inspired by the Islamic terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden. The shift
of the case to the New York office suggested that investigators
would expand their inquiry outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was held in Reno's conference room in the sixth
floor of the Justice Department. Among those in attendance were
Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in New York, and Katrina C.
Pflaumer, the U.S. attorney in Seattle, as well as other senior law
enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Reno did not formally grant White's office a larger role, but
several officials said that by not specifically giving the Seattle
office the lead role, it seemed likely that the New York office
would gradually assume more responsibility for the case that began
in Seattle with the Dec. 14 arrest of Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian who
had been living in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the investigation has broadened with the arrest of
associates of Ressam in New York, Boston and Seattle. The officials
said that more arrests were likely as the investigation continued
in the United States, Canada and other countries, including France,
where some Algerian terror groups have taken root.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that they were still uncertain of the exact
nature of the plot, although they were increasingly confident that
Ressam and his associates were planning a bombing. Officials said
the precise timing and the location of the possible attack were
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Though law enforcement officials said that the motives for the
plan were murky, they increasingly believe that Ressam and his
associates are part of a group of loosely allied Islamic militants
who have declared the United States to be their enemy.

LEADING FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES FORM LOBBYING GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the banking, securities and insurance industries have
finally stopped battling over how to change Depression-era laws
that separated their businesses, they are going to give cooperation
a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executives of 19 of the country's biggest
financial-services companies have banded together to form a
lobbying group, the Financial Services Forum. Each of the companies
will be represented by two executives, including its chief
executive, said Philip Purcell, the chairman of Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter &AMP; Co., one of the founding members.
</P>
<P>
   Purcell said the idea for the group grew out of the protracted
negotiations over financial-services reform legislation that
culminated last fall in the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act of
1933. Banks, investment banks and insurers had stalemated over
changes each of them wanted before they reached a compromise last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each industry spent 15 years trying to get a competitive
advantage over the others through financial-services reform
legislation,'' Purcell said in an interview Wednesday. ``Coming out
of that, we decided we ought to try to look at public-policy issues
from the perspective of the whole financial-services industry and
our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Purcell declined to outline the group's agenda because its
members have met just once and it has not yet hired a staff for the
office it plans to open in Washington. Others familiar with the
Financial Services Forum said that among the major issues it might
take up are consumer privacy and access to foreign markets,
including China.
</P>
<P>
   Among the group's members are the Chase Manhattan Corp.,
Citigroup, Bank of America, the American Express Co. and insurers
American International Group and Prudential. Along with Morgan
Stanley, Wall Street firms in the group are Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.,
Goldman Sachs Group and J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Purcell said the group does not intend to supplant any of the
myriad financial-services lobbying organizations that already exist
in Washington. It will differ from them by having a small roster of
top executives of the biggest and most diverse financial companies,
he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I would hope that the perspective of this organization
influences those groups,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bartlett, the president of the Financial Services
Roundtable in Washington, said he welcomed the new group, despite
what appears to be an overlapping purpose. Bartlett's group, which
lobbied Congress on the reform legislation, changed its name from
the Bankers Roundtable last year and changed its bylaws to admit
officials of insurance companies and other financial firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have too many CEOs and companies involved in public
policy than too few,'' Bartlett said. About a third of his group's
100 members are represented by the new group, he said, adding that
he met yesterday with Purcell and believed that the groups could
work together without conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fairly crowded field, I guess,'' said Charlotte Birch,
a spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association in Washington.
``There are clearly issues that we have in common, such as the
privacy issue and Social Security reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Birch said the ABA, which represents banks of all sizes from
throughout the country, is a member of a coalition of
financial-services lobbying groups called the Financial Services
Coordinating Council.
</P>
<P>
   Its members include Wall Street's main trade organization, the
Securities Industry Association, and the mutual-fund industry trade
organization, the Investment Co. Institute. Other members of the
council are the American Council of Life Insurers and the American
Insurance Association.

THERE'S JUST A FEW LIKE NORTHRIDGE'S JERRO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Frozena Jerro might as well have been stepping
onto a beach of bikini-clad sunbathers in her birthday suit for how
exposed she felt.
</P>
<P>
   She had stepped inside San Jose Arena, but it felt as if she had
walked into the wrong restroom.
</P>
<P>
   Jerro, the second-year head coach of the Cal State Northridge
women's basketball team, glanced around at a gathering of Division
I head coaches during the Women's Final Four last year and wondered
where were all the other African-American women.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look around and it's just kind of noticeable that there
aren't a lot of people like you,'' said Jerro, whose team opens its
conference season tonight at Northern Arizona. ``It kind of makes
you think a little.''
</P>
<P>
   It's sad but true. So few African-American females are
overseeing major college basketball programs they don't require
their own meeting room; a freight elevator would do just fine.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange County Register recently did a head count of 29
Division I conferences (encompassing 291 schools) and found 17
African-American women overseeing women's basketball programs.
Jerro and Co. fill roughly six percent of the available head
coaching jobs despite nearly 35 percent of the Division I players
are African-American.
</P>
<P>
   If those figures don't paint the problem starkly enough, there's
this: In the Big Sky, Jerro is the only African-American female
head coach in any sport. Picture Jerro as a lone tumbleweed
bouncing along the prairie and you've got a good idea of how the
wind blows throughout the conference.
</P>
<P>
   It'd be our pleasure to report that enlightenment pushed CSUN,
and hence, the Big Sky, ahead of the Big West conference that is
poised to adopt the Matadors and boasts not one African-American
female head coach.
</P>
<P>
   However, to be perfectly frank, expediency was the force behind
Jerro's promotion.
</P>
<P>
   When Michael Abraham was arrested on campus last year before the
start of his fourth season and charged with drug trafficking,
Abraham's shell-shocked players, awarded the responsibility of
picking his replacement, chose Jerro, a second-year assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunity, when it came knocking, was so bruised and bloodied
Jerro hardly recognized it at first. But given how seldom it visits
her neighborhood, the 28-year-old was grateful to see opportunity
at all.
</P>
<P>
   She nursed the Matadors back to where the program was even
healthier than before, and in doing so made certain her promotion
stuck. She guided the team to a record of 21-8 by following the
blueprint her coach at Arizona State, Maura McHugh, had outlined
for her years earlier:
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of you who want to go into coaching,'' Jerro remembered
McHugh saying, ``are going to have to work doubly hard and be very,
very prepared to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerro did and she was.
</P>
<P>
   There was just one thing for which McHugh hadn't prepared her.
When the Matadors were on the road last year, hotel reservations
clerks, bellmen and bus drivers tended to make a beeline for
trainer Steve Moreno, the only male in the traveling party,
naturally assuming he was the head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times I was the last one they'd come to,'' Jerro
said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   It got to be a running joke, a fast-break faux pas. Short of
wearing a whistle for a necklace or a T-shirt that says, ``I'm the
coach, Stupid,'' a smile seemed the best accessory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate people have those type of preconceived
ideas,'' Jerro said. ``It doesn't discourage me. People are just
programmed that way.''
</P>
<P>
   If Y2K glitches can be eliminated in computers, then why not in
humans?
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Peck was the first African-American female hired as an
assistant women's coach at Tennessee. She coached Purdue to last
year's NCAA title before taking over the Orlando WNBA entry.
</P>
<P>
   Peck's success in San Jose figured to open the door a little
wider for African-American women in the collegiate coaching ranks.
Instead, those fortunate enough to get a foot in the door wound up
mostly with jammed toes. Of the 33 Division I head-coaching
positions filled after Purdue's triumph, three went to
African-American women.
</P>
<P>
   Peck, reached by telephone in Orlando on Wednesday, articulated
the weighted burden of trailblazers everywhere when she said,
``Personally, I look at it like it's my job to do the best I can to
help my team be as successful as possible and (also) so other
African-American women will be given an opportunity to get a good
job.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a long road and you have to be awfully strong, to carry a
whole segment of the population on your back without stumbling.
Those who manage to do it are very special indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Peck sees the Frozena Jerros of the coaching sorority making a
difference in college basketball's suburbs and hopes they won't be
overlooked when the top-tier jobs open up at places such as, say,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the smaller schools you have to work twice as hard to be
average,'' Peck said.
</P>
<P>
   And that's after working twice as hard to be hired.

EFFICIENT ROAD BIKES ARE LATEST GOOD DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LANGTON  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you're in the market for a bicycle these days,
the choices are seemingly endless. Do you go with a mountain bike?
How about a comfort bike? A cross-bike? At least there's only one
choice when it comes to road bikes... or is there?
</P>
<P>
   Bikes made purely for riding on the road have, over the last few
years, become one of the best deals in cycling. Because road bikes
don't have to endure the kind of abuse to which mountain bikes are
subjected _ nor do they have to perform more than one task _ even
inexpensive two-wheelers do what they are designed to do with flair
and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, road bikes are the least dimensional of all the
bikes available today. Skinny tires, uncompromisingly stiff frames,
uncomfortable rider compartments and a lack of suspension
contribute to the reason why road bikes represent only about 5
percent of all bicycles sold in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cheap mountain bike has replaced the cheap road bike, like
the old Schwinn Varsity. If you're going to ride the road, you have
to be pretty committed,'' said Woody Beck, owner of the Bike Wrench
in Canoga Park. ``But with the advent of triple chainrings and as
many as 27 speeds, you've got gears aplenty to ride all types of
hills.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for road warriors who won't settle for anything less
than comfort over the long hauls _ specifically in the saddle _
their cycles of preference are taking on some no-to-road-bike-like
features.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the rise of comfort components and the utilization of
mountain bike hardware, one can pick up a bike that will skim along
the blacktop yet won't make you feel like you've just spent eight
hours on a medieval torture device.
</P>
<P>
   For years the ``touring'' bike has been a small sub-segment of
the road bike category. Slightly relaxed frame geometry for more
stable handling and three chainrings _ for wide-range gearing like
that of a mountain bike _ gave long-distance riders the ability to
stay in the saddle day after day with more stability and less
fatigue. Touring bikes also typically have cantilever brakes, a
feature that exists because riders are usually carrying camping
equipment and require more stopping power due to the heavier loads.
</P>
<P>
   With manufacturers looking for a way to increase road-bike
sales, they are now dropping the price of touring bikes (around
$500) and adding features not usually found on road bikes. Thanks
to the blurring of lines between the mountain bike and road bike,
the latter now has suspension and ergonomic shifting systems that
make road riding more comfortable and much safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, when I first started riding road bikes, the
shifters were down on the frame, so, whenever I wanted to shift
gears, I had to take my hand off the handlebar,'' said Fred Eckles,
55, of Newbury Park. ``But, now, with the integrated shift
lever/brake lever, I really never lose contact with the handlebar.
Plus, my shifts are much more precise.''
</P>
<P>
   As is usually the case with bicycles, the enthusiast market
dictates manufacturing trends. Original equipment components that
make ordinary road bicycles comfort cruisers, or ``sport touring''
bikes, include suspension seatposts and forks, adjustable stems for
a less leaned-over riding position and wider tires for better shock
absorption and more confident cornering.
</P>
<P>
   Riding long distances is not the only thing road bikes are all
about. They are still the fastest thing going, making them the
easiest bikes to pedal thanks to high-pressure tires and
light-weight frames. And, unlike with mountain biking, the
opportunities are endless and easy to access.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely see this as a trend for the standard issue road
bike of the future. People want a bike that's efficient but that
can still pass the guys on mountain bikes,'' said Griffis. &QL;

 By By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Almost one month after he pledged to do whatever was ``necessary to
re-establish the Saints as a winning franchise,'' New Orleans owner
Tom Benson conducted one of the most expensive housecleanings in
NFL history.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fed up and frustrated with the Saints' 3-13 record _
second-worst to Cleveland's 2-14 _ Benson on Wednesday fired coach
Mike Ditka, all of the team's assistant coaches, general manager
Bill Kuharich and senior vice president Terry O'Neil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was necessary to clear the slate in order for us to begin
the same process that we used in 1986, a process that produced Jim
Finks as president and general manager,'' Benson said, referring to
the late Saints executive who hired Jim Mora as coach and oversaw
the team's greatest success. ``This was a difficult decision, but I
promised that we would do whatever it takes to re-establish a
winning franchise, and these are the moves I consider necessary to
begin that process.''
</P>
<P>
   In his three seasons as the Saints' coach, Ditka was 15-33. He
had two years left on a contract that averaged $2 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry it didn't work out,'' said Ditka, 60, who disclosed
that he has no plans to coach again. ``I understand it. We were
3-13. We've got to be realists.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuharich, who also served as the team president, signed an
extension in August through 2003. At an average annual salary of
about $500,000, Kuharich should get about $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, in this business, if you don't win enough
games, there are going to be days like this,'' said Kuharich, who
spent 14 years with the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil, a former network television executive and Ditka's close
friend, was the Saints' salary-cap expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Ditka is one of the greatest football people ever,''
Benson said. ``Bill rose through the ranks here to become president
of the company. Both men were tremendous contributors to our
community, and both gave a lot back to our club and our city.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson vowed to ``find the right individual to take us where our
organization and our fans want to be. Our goal is winning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saints have gone seven seasons without a winning record.
Benson thought Ditka was the coach to light a fire that had been
out since Mora resigned in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka came out of retirement to accept Benson's offer to take
over the Saints. They finished 6-10 in his first two seasons, but
they regressed this season after a tumultuous offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Benson announced the largest ticket price increase in franchise
history, which caused fans and the media to blast him for weeks.
Then, he allowed Kuharich and Ditka to pull off an unprecedented
trade that allowed them to draft running back Ricky Williams, the
Heisman Trophy winner from the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints traded all of their 1999 draft choices and first- and
third-round picks in 2000 to move up in the first round to get
Williams. It was the first time in history a team had dealt an
entire draft to acquire one player.
</P>
<P>
   The Williams trade didn't pay immediate dividends, because he
was injured for much of the season. Injuries at other positions,
particularly at quarterback, where four players started, hurt the
offense as well.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries contributed to the team's regression. They were 6-23
over the last 29 games, including an NFL-high 12-game losing streak
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully understand (Benson's decision),'' said Ditka, who is a
member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. ``You bring in Ricky
Williams and have such high expectations, and then it doesn't work
out, you expect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditka's behavior was erratic this season. He made obscene
gestures to fans at the Superdome. He made strange comments, lashed
out at reporters and went ballistic on the sideline. At one point,
Ditka said he was going to quit and then changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Those close to him said he never seemed happy until the Saints
upset the Cowboys in quarterback Jake Delhomme's first start.
</P>
<P>
   But the Saints followed that victory with a 45-13 loss to
Carolina _ the worst defeat of Ditka's career, which included 11
seasons and one Super Bowl victory with the Chicago Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Benson said the search for replacements for Ditka and Kuharich
would begin immediately.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Benson made his announcement, there were reports in
New Orleans that former Washington Redskins general manager Charley
Casserly would be a leading contender to take over the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities could be Seattle executive vice president of
football operations Randy Mueller, Chicago personnel director Mark
Hatley, former Indianapolis general manager Bill Tobin, Tampa Bay
personnel director Jerry Angelo and Green Bay personnel director
Ted Thompson.

BRADLEY, GORE SLING ACCUSATIONS IN N.H. DEBATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.H. _ Democratic presidential candidates Al Gore and
Bill Bradley sparred over the issue of leadership in a spirited
debate Wednesday in which Bradley portrayed the vice president as
living in a ``Washington bunker'' that made him too timid to pursue
bold ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley are locked in a tight battle in New Hampshire,
which holds the nation's first primary Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The debate came as a new Iowa poll showed Bradley dramatically
narrowing the gap with Gore in the state where caucuses Jan. 24
kick off the nomination process. A survey of 300 Iowa Democratic
voters Monday and Tuesday found Gore leading 45 percent to 32
percent _ meaning the vice president's 28 percentage point lead in
a similar November survey had been more than halved.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had been counting on a strong victory in Iowa to strengthen
his weaker hand in New Hampshire. A narrow victory in Iowa would do
little to improve Gore's position in New Hampshire, and a loss in
Iowa would be a serious, and possibly fatal, injury to his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The face-off at the University of New Hampshire underscored the
increasing animosity between the Democrats as they sniped over past
accusations and continued their ongoing feud over who has the
better health-care proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Both men focused largely on the question of what makes a true
leader, with Bradley several times accusing Gore of being a
Washington insider who was not willing to champion ideas that might
generate political heat.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley asked Gore why he did not back his ambitious gun-control
proposal, which includes registration of all handguns.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president responded that although he did not oppose
such a regulation he did not believe it was politically feasible
given the sentiments in Congress. Gore said he had fought
successfully for a number of gun proposals, such as banning assault
weapons, that were approved during the Clinton years.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley dismissed Gore's response as a sign of weakness, not the
pragmatism Gore apparently hoped to portray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where would we be today if Franklin Roosevelt said Social
Security is too difficult to do. Or if Lyndon Johnson said
Medicare's too difficult,'' Bradley said. ``I mean, the essence of
leadership is taking something that is difficult and making it
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   After Gore criticized Bradley for proposing a financially
unrealistic health-care plan, the former senator shot back that
Gore was responding with the defensiveness of someone who had been
in Washington too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds me of a Washington bunker,'' Bradley said. He said
Gore has spent much of the past seven years fighting for political
survival, considering the Republican Congress, the 1996
fund-raising scandal and impeachment. But he added ``the Democratic
Party shouldn't be in the bunker with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore portrayed himself as a fighter who stayed in Washington and
took on Newt Gingrich, while Bradley left the Senate in 1996,
disillusioned with government.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley countered that his sentiments were in tune with the
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been talking to a lot of people in the country. And quite
frankly they believe a lot of people in Washington stay too long
and fight too much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore suggested that Bradley was not interested in dealing with
the daily grind of being president and the pragmatic aspects of
governing .
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidency is not an academic exercise ... It has to be a
daily fight,'' he said. Gore also accused Bradley of not admitting
to mistakes, which the vice president said was a necessary
ingredient of governing.
</P>
<P>
   Gore listed three of Bradley's votes he said were mistakes: his
vote against welfare reform, against authorizing troops for the
Gulf War and voting for Reagan budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said those votes were not mistakes. He acknowledged that
in retrospect, it was wrong to vote against confirming Alan
Greenspan to lead the Federal Reserve Board when he was first
nominated.
</P>
<P>
   Gore acknowledged he erred during the 1996 presidential
campaign, including making questionable fund-raising phone calls
from his office.
</P>
<P>
   The new polling numbers in Iowa were news the embattled Gore
camp did not need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, (Bradley's) message must be resonating among the
Democrats,'' said Craig Tufty, director of the Iowa Project 2000,
which conducted the survey for four television stations that
broadcast in Iowa. Tufty said Bradley, who in the earlier survey
could not claim an edge with any demographic group, now leads among
men likely to attend the caucus and young voters ages 18-34.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's best hope in the new Iowa survey data was that he
maintains a 57 percent to 43 percent lead among the most intensely
loyal Democrats, those who said they were ``very sure'' or
``somewhat sure'' they would attend the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   The survey has a 5.45 percentage point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike past forums, the vice president did not try to distance
himself from President Clinton, claiming that the current economic
prosperity was based on budget and tax decisions made by both he
and the president early in the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of the seven years I have served in shaping this
economy policy, in reducing the welfare roles, in helping the
president bring about peace in various regions of the world, in
reducing crime rates for seven years,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his defense of the president during the Monica
Lewinsky scandal, Gore responded that he was speaking out against
an unwarranted partisan move to remove the president from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should not have been removed from office for that
offense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also cited Harry Truman as his model when
asked how he would handle the issue of gays in the military. Just
as Truman had ordered the racial integration of the military, Gore
said he would appoint military leaders who would eliminate the
current ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy and allow gays to serve
openly.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley agreed that he too would appoint members of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff who would let gays serve openly.

BOTH BRADLEY AND GORE ENDORSE GAYS SERVING OPENLY IN MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs to add additional information about other primaries and
quotes from Gore saying the presidency is not a seminar.) 
(DW) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.H. _ Vice President Al Gore and his Democratic
opponent, Bill Bradley, said Wednesday night that if they were
elected president, they would require their appointees to the Joint
Chiefs of Staff to fully support allowing homosexuals to serve
openly in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Although both candidates had previously opposed the Clinton
administration's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy their comments
Wednesday night, in the fourth Democratic debate of the primary
campaign, were a strikingly forceful embrace of gay rights and were
bound to come under attack by the Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Their comments came in response to a question of whether they
would support a ``litmus test'' on gays in the military in
nominating members of the Joint Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two candidates, Gore was the more expansive, saying he
wanted to make the same sweeping changes toward allowing
homosexuals to serve openly in the military that President Harry S.
Truman had made toward racially integrating the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that would require those who wanted to serve on the
Joint Chiefs to be in agreement with that policy,'' Gore said. ``I
would insist before appointing anybody to the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, that that individual support my policy, and yes, I would
make that a requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore drew a distinction between applying a litmus test to
Supreme Court justices and military officials, saying this was
``not interfering with an independent judicial decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said simply that the commander in chief issued orders
and soldiers followed them. He said that while many in the armed
forces probably did not agree with President Clinton on some
military matters, ``My sense is that when you're president of the
United States, military people are loyal to their commander in
chief whatever the policy of the commander in chief calls for the
country, and that's what I'd expect them to do if I'm president of
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   A litmus test that the candidates supported is almost certain to
spark a renewed controversy in the military, where many
high-ranking officers strongly oppose allowing gay men and lesbians
to serve openly.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton had originally pledged to allow homosexuals to
serve openly, but backed away from the plan after a near revolt by
Gen. Colin L. Powell and other members of the Joint Chiefs early in
his presidency. A result was the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy,
which Bradley and Gore say is a failure.
</P>
<P>
   The comments Wednesday night about homosexuals in the military
underscored the degree to which Gore and Bradley are intent on
courting the liberal base of their party. In fact, earlier in the
debate, neither candidate objected to being described as a liberal
_ a label that Democrats, including Bill Clinton, have eschewed in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberal, progressive, whatever,'' Bradley said. ``I'll accept
whatever label you want because that's who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who earlier in the day was endorsed by Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy of Massachusetts, said, ``I really don't care what kind of
label people apply to those positions and views.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the candidates' agreement on homosexuals in the
military, the debate Wednesday night was punctuated by edgy
exchanges as Gore and Bradley picked at each other's past votes and
present proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley portrayed the vice president as having been so trapped
in a ``Washington bunker'' fighting for the administration's
political survival that he had lost the ambition to fight for
proposals on health care and gun control. Gore said his rival was
living in an ivory tower and lacked the political know-how to get
things done.
</P>
<P>
   That exchange set the tone for the hourlong debate held here on
the campus of the University of New Hampshire near the eastern edge
of this state.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the harshest remark came from Bradley after he was asked
when Gore had ever taken one of his quotes or votes out of context.
``The one that was most particularly offensive to me was when he
said in this campaign that I was going to hurt African-Americans,
Latinos with the health care program I have offered,'' Bradley
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say to me, who's had the deep commitment to the issue of
racial unity in this country since I started in politics, that I
would go out and hurt African-Americans and Latinos, consciously,
as part of a policy, I think really offended me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore defended his comments, saying, ``Well, you know, Harry
Truman said in 1948 `I'm not giving him hell. I'm just telling the
truth and he thinks it's hell.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he simply had explained that ``poor people are
disproportionately likely to be minorities'' and would be affected
the most by Bradley's replacement of Medicaid with an alternative
program.
</P>
<P>
   Both contenders were trying to score points with a precious few
weeks before the Feb. 1 primary here. Polls in this state show that
Gore and Bradley are within shouting distance of each other.
</P>
<P>
   The face-off here, the first in 2000, opened a flurry of debates
among the White House hopefuls. Republicans will debate here on
Thursday and in South Carolina on Friday. On Saturday, Gore and
Bradley will debate in Iowa. The Republican candidates will appear
at a forum here on Sunday and then at a debate in Michigan on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Wednesday night if he could come up with something Bradley
had said about him out of context, Gore, searching for an answer,
replied, ``I'd have to think. I haven't made a point of responding
to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley appeared particularly aggressive in this debate and was
more willing to take issue with Gore than he had been in the past.
But he also had an air of being relaxed and displayed an easy
humor.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, for instance, Gore insisted that he respected his
rival. ``I respect Bill, I really do,'' he said. ``I'm not just
saying that as a ploy. I think he's a genuinely good person.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Peter Jennings, the moderator and ABC News anchor, if
he agreed with Gore, Bradley drew laughs when he replied, ``I agree
with what he said, yeah. I think I'm a genuinely good person.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore seemed calmer than in his earlier performances as he
fielded questions from Jennings, but still did not shrink from
aggressively criticizing Bradley's record. He was particularly
persistent in upbraiding the former senator from New Jersey for
what he depicted as mistaken votes, such as supporting President
Ronald Reagan's budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We passed tough welfare reform, which I think has worked; you
voted against it,'' Gore said. ``I voted against those budget cuts;
you voted for them. I voted, as I said a moment ago, for the
resolution to use military force to push Saddam Hussein out of
Kuwait; you voted against it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he did not regret any of those votes. ``In '81, if
everybody in the Congress had voted as I had voted,'' he said, ``we
would not have had the deficit of the 1990s. As a result of that we
would have had more economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he was still not convinced that the welfare reform
effort was working or that it would have been wrong to try
sanctions before using force against Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In espousing his positions, Bradley sought to depict the vice
president as thinking like a Washington insider, and afraid to try
ambitious proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hear you talk, Al, it reminds me of a Washington
bunker,'' Bradley said. ``I can understand why you're in the bunker
because of Gingrich, there were fund-raising scandals, the
impeachment problem. I think the major objective of the last
several years in the White House has been political survival.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that,'' Bradley continued. ``But the reality is
the Democratic Party should be thinking big things, with big
ambitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore portrayed Bradley as hopelessly out of touch with the
realities of Washington. ``I believe that the presidency is not an
academic exercise,'' Gore said. ``It's not an extended seminar on
theory. It has to be a daily fight for the best interests of the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The country can ill afford big mistakes by a
president who stumbles into something that could be avoided with
the kind of judgment and experience that our people ought to have
the right to expect in any president.''

5,000 new teachers who work in designated areas where there is a
shortage of certified teachers. Additional money would be made
available to help teachers with temporary licenses get permanent
certification.
</P>
<P>
   TAX CUTS: Would provide $700 million in new tax cuts and
economic development initiatives for a total of $2.3 billion in tax
cuts for the fiscal year 2000-2001.
</P>
<P>
   ENERGY TAX ELIMINATION: Would phase out a tax on energy that
raises about $500 million annually from residential and business
consumers. The tax would be eliminated first for industrial and
manufacturing businesses to enable them to compete with businesses
in regions with lower energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   LOW-COST POWER: Would expand a program that provides low-cost
power to businesses across upstate New York in exchange for their
creating and keeping jobs in the region. The program would provide
an estimated $20 million in savings to businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERPRISE ZONE: Would create a high-technology enterprise zone
in upstate counties where employment growth is below the state
average. Technology companies that relocate or expand there would
be eligible for a package of incentives that would include tax
credits.

 McCAIN'S NEW YORK PETITION DRIVE SPUTTERS TO FINISH LINE  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With 36 hours to go before the deadline for filing
petitions to get presidential candidates on the primary ballot in
New York state, the tallies plastered on the walls of John McCain's
local headquarters told a grim tale: the Arizona senator, it
seemed, would fail to collect enough signatures to be listed in
more than half of the state's 31 congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign staff members, ears glued to their telephones, sat
curled over desks in their small office across the street from
Staten Island Borough Hall, running down lists of registered
Republican voters they hoped would put their signatures on
petitions to get McCain on the ballot for the March 7 presidential
primary. Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari, who is
chairman of the McCain campaign in New York, was also there on the
phone, appealing for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough campaign,'' Molinari told one voter in the 11th
Congressional District in Brooklyn. ``And John McCain is a great
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   With the voice on the other end apparently in agreement,
Molinari promised that volunteers would be knocking on the door
within a half-hour, eager to collect another Republican signature
in time for tonight's midnight filing deadline. ``Maybe you have
some neighbors?'' he added hopefully before hanging up.
</P>
<P>
   Despite modest changes in recent years, New York's election laws
are among the most arcane in the nation, involving a tangle of
technical requirements that many candidates say cannot be met
without spending an extraordinary amount of money. Steve Forbes,
for example, spent about $750,000 to get on the New York ballot,
according to his campaign manager, Bill Dal Col. Forbes filed his
petitions Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Forbes sued to get on the New York ballot and won. The
overall effort, including legal fees, cost about $1.8 million. In
December, McCain filed a federal suit in Brooklyn to force the
state Republican Party to put his name on the primary ballot. The
suit accuses state party leaders of using a hornet's nest of rules
to make it almost impossible for anyone but the party's favorite
candidate to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the lawsuit pending, Molinari and a band of
volunteers are making a last-ditch effort to gather signatures on
two types of petitions, one to get McCain on the statewide ballot,
the second to ensure that he has delegates in each of the state's
congressional districts. Without enough signatures from each
district, a Republican candidate cannot win delegates to the
party's national convention regardless of the results in the
popular vote.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An added complication is that campaign volunteers are permitted
to collect signatures only in their home districts, unless the
volunteer is a notary public or a commissioner of deeds. And even
after petitions are gathered, the signatures are often challenged
in court by front-runners, resulting in legal fights. Slight
mistakes can often result in signatures' being invalidated.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of qualifying McCain's delegates in the 11th
Congressional District, Andrew Pistor, an 18-year-old college
student, and Albert DeLillo, an aide to Molinari _ and, more
important, a notary public _ drove to Borough Park, Brooklyn,
Wednesday afternoon. They were in search of Shmuel Lock, a
30-year-old law professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice,
who had spoken with Molinari by phone and agreed to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Already, volunteers had collected 79 of 82 signatures required
in the 11th district. And yesterday afternoon, Pistor and DeLillo
were in luck. In addition to Lock, who answered the door at his
family's home on Avenue J, they collected signatures from Lock's
20-year-old sister, Eli, and 18-year-old brother, Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   As Wednesday afternoon dragged on, Pistor and DeLillo made stops
at two more homes and collected signatures from people Molinari had
telephoned in advance. One signature came from Tsipora Zerbib, who
expressed surprise that McCain, so frequently in the news, would
need her signature. ``I thought he'd be on the ballot,'' she said.
``Gosh, he's in every magazine, on every TV station.''

METRO MATTER: BIG BALL, BUT NO BIG DEAL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOYCE PURNICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before we forget New Year's Eve and let our
appallingly short attention spans wander to the next distraction, a
moment of reflection on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Paris gave us the sight of a breathtaking Eiffel Tower,
encircled in ascending spirals of fireworks. Britain offered
fireworks sweeping over the Thames and a new Millennial Dome in
Greenwich. Red Square turned ethereal, with fireworks and
snowflakes falling on St. Basil's Cathedral. Sydney was aglow and
so was Beijing, even though the Chinese new year is next month.
</P>
<P>
   New York? A pretty ball descended a tower in Times Square,
illuminating an ad for Discover, the credit card. Fireworks were
hard to see, scattered pyrotechnics around town were nice.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was fun and orderly in Times Square. The 24-hour street
show was impressive, the NYPD did great, people behaved. The ball
(made by Waterford) was a new improved model and the electronic
glitz of a renewed 42nd Street area provided a glittering backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   But let's face it: for a world-class city we didn't measure up.
Anybody who saw those stunning global productions has to admit
that. Washington's was OK, with its lasers and fired-up Washington
Monument, but it was so packed with celebrities that it seemed like
a cliche _ a political cliche thanks to President Clinton's
platitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is a capital city, like London and Paris, but New
York is New York, so back to the ball and Times Square. Why so
unmillennial?
</P>
<P>
   The main reason was money. Except for Sydney's fireworks, paid
for by corporate sponsors, celebrations in the other great cities
were government-financed. The City of Paris spent about $550,000 to
create that magical Eiffel Tower, and the Ministry of Culture
invested $11 million for those Ferris wheels on the Champs-Elysees.
The fireworks on the Thames (spectacular even without the promised
flames) cost $8 million, and the permanent Millennium Dome $1.2
billion. Most of the money came from lottery profits, appropriated
by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Times Square got no government money at all (unless you count
the cost of police, fire and other city services). The celebration
cost less than $5 million, contributed by Con Ed, Discover,
Waterford, Korbel, the Doubletree Hotel and the Times Square
Business Improvement District. Timothy's donated thousands of cups
of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   The very idea of asking the federal government for money never
even came up, said Brendan Sexton, president of the Times Square
Business Improvement District. In fact, Washington chose to compete
with New York. In any case, ``We do a different kind of event,''
Sexton explained. ``Don't get me wrong; we could have used more
money, but the crowd is the event here.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, then why not stage something grand elsewhere in New York
City? We've done it before. The shimmering Brooklyn Bridge
Centennial celebration in 1983, for instance. ``This should have
been the occasion to do something grand and permanent for the
city,'' said Sen. Charles E. Schumer. ``If Americans had the same
attitude toward New York City, regarding it as a jewel as the
French do toward Paris and the English do toward London, we could
do these things, and we should.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewel is not exactly the word the average American would use to
describe the city. It is a place most love to hate, or at least
distrust. And that showed on Dec. 31. Even now, despite our
celebrated Wall Street-driven renaissance, crime-fighting mayor,
kinder, safer streets and Seinfeld legacy, New York remains alien
territory to many in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Ask John Rocker. Look at the presidential candidates who never
mention New York unless they rush through to raise funds or are
fighting to get themselves on our well-guarded ballots. Consider
also how we are perpetually shortchanged by Washington, getting
back fewer federal dollars than we contribute in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   It took a mighty struggle just to prevent Congress from cutting
operating subsidies to mass transit last year, recalls Schumer. No
New Yorker could even dream of getting fancy subway extensions of
the kind bestowed on Paris and London last year by their national
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Those projects ``were done with purpose of having them stay
global cities,'' said Robert Paaswell of the University
Transportation Research Center, at City College. ``They know their
position in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   So does New York. It's the rest of America that hasn't figured
it out yet.

NAVAJOS WON'T BE FORCED OUT, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - Navajo and Hopi leaders joined federal officials
Wednesday, Jan. 5, in an attempt to ease tensions growing from
rumors that there will be mass evictions of Navajos on Feb. 1 from
land the government has awarded the Hopis.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint announcement, the tribal leaders, U.S. Attorney's
Office in Phoenix and a federal relocation officer called for calm.
They pledged to work for peaceful resolution of a stalemate
concerning Navajos who have vowed to remain on Hopi Partitioned
Land.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made by Navajo President Kelsey Begaye,
Hopi Chairman Wayne Taylor Jr., U.S. Attorney for Arizona Jose de
Jesus Rivera and Christopher Bavasi of the Office of Navajo and
Hopi Indian Relocation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The first of February is the legal eviction date for an
estimated two dozen Navajo families who have refused to sign an
``accommodation agreement'' that would have allowed them to lease
lands from the Hopis.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline is the culmination of a land dispute that has
simmered for more than a century between two the two tribes, both
of which consider the land to be sacred.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to work cooperatively to peacefully resolve
the issue of the few Navajos who might remain on the HPL,''
Wednesday's announcement said.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal leaders and federal officials said they issued it in
response to a flood of rumors and misinformation about the
emotional land dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lot of misinformation that people are going
to be physically evicted on February 1,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney
Joseph Lodge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not going to happen, and we wanted to set the record
straight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lodge said that while the Hopis could evict the Navajos as of
Feb. 1, they've pledged to allow his office to pursue the process
in federal court. That could take six to 24 months, Lodge said. It
could lead to a court order for federal marshals to evict the
Navajos.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 Navajos have already accepted federal
relocation benefits. Some have moved to the Navajo Reservation,
others have moved to border towns, the Phoenix area or 34 states
outside Arizona. &UR; Several dozen Hopis have also relocated, most to
the partitioned land.
</P>
<P>
   But a few Navajos remain, claiming they are bound to the land by
custom and Navajo religion. They've refused to sign the
accommodation agreement because they distrust the Hopis and because
they insist the land is theirs.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of evictions has drawn international attention,
especially as most remaining Navajos are elderly people in isolated
areas, among the last traditional Indians in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The center of Navajo resistance is Big Mountain, an area with no
paved roads, electricity or running water. The Navajos there have
won the support of dozens of groups across the United States and in
several foreign countries, who call forced relocation a violation
of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The groups are calling on members to rally around the Navajos on
Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resisters at Big Mountain have been given the final date
of February 1st, 2000, to leave or be forcibly evicted from their
an cestral lands,'' claimed a Minnesota support group in an
Internet message in late December. The group is organizing a
caravan of ``human rights observers.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most active opponents of relocation is Marsha
Monestersky, a native of New York who has worked with Navajo
resisters for several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not expecting any problems on February 1,'' Monestersky
said Wednesday, Jan. 5. ``What we're planning is a symbolic
presence on the land'' to protest relocation.
</P>
<P>
   Former Hopi Chairman Ferrell Secakuku said there's a need to
defuse rumors of impending violence on the disputed lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are saying that Hopi rangers are being trained in
SWAT team tactics so that when the time comes they will be able to
go out there and clear out the Navajos,'' Secakuku said.

 LARRY BEARNARTH, BEST RELIEVER ON LOWLY METS IN '60s, DIES AT 58   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Larry Bearnarth, the New York Mets' top relief pitcher in their
lowly early years and later a pitching coach for the Montreal Expos
and the Colorado Rockies in a baseball career spanning more than
three decades, died Saturday at St. Anthony's Hospital in St.
Petersburg, Fla. He was 58.
</P>
<P>
   He had a heart attack at his home in St. Petersburg, his family
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bearnarth joined the Mets in 1963, when they were coming off an
inaugural season in which they lost a major league-record 120
games. As a rookie, he pitched for a team that featured the likes
of Marvelous Marv Throneberry, Choo Choo Coleman and Hot Rod
Kanehl, and that lost 111 games. But Bearnarth's first year in the
majors would be his best.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on an outstanding sinker, Bearnarth appeared in 58
games, 56 in relief, with a 3.42 earned run average. He pitched in
171 games for the Mets between 1963 and 1966 and was with the
Milwaukee Brewers briefly in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Bearnarth was known as the Bear, playing off his name and his
reputation as an aggressive pitcher. But when Manager Casey Stengel
summoned the right-hander in relief, that sobriquet fell victim to
Stengel's penchant for botching names.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would call down to the bullpen for a relief pitcher and I
would hear him tell the pitching coach, `Get Big Ben ready,'''
Bearnarth once recalled. ``Once I realized that was the way Casey
was with everybody, it no longer bothered me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bearnarth grew up on Staten Island and pitched three years for
St. John's, playing on the team that went to the College World
Series in 1960. Jack Kaiser, his college coach, remembered that he
did not throw especially hard but ``you could see how competitive
he was.''
</P>
<P>
   One day in Bearnarth's rookie season, Stengel, mangling his
nickname again, told the Bear, ``Ben, you're going to be a great
coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Bearnarth was a major league pitching coach, a minor league
manager and instructor, and most recently a scout for the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   As the pitching coach for the Expos, in 1976 and from 1985 to
1991, and for the Rockies, from 1993 to 1995, he preached an
aggressive approach. ``You challenge the hitters when you come in
as a relief pitcher,'' he said. ``You can't give in to the batter
or pitch around batters.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Barbara; a son, Larry Jr., of St.
Petersburg; two daughters, Kristin Bearnarth, of Denver, and Karin
Penegor, of Breckenridge, Colo.; two sisters, Veronica Pray, of
Vincentown, N.J., and Virginia Nicotra, of Staten Island, and four
grandchildren. &QL;

LUCAS HOVING, CHOREOGRAPHER AND MODERN DANCER, DIES AT 87
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lucas Hoving, a choreographer and modern dancer who performed
with the Jose Limon Dance Company from 1949 to 1963, died Wednesday
at his home in San Francisco. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Hoving was a quietly imposing figure on the stage, a gifted
actor and serenely humanistic performer who infused his roles with
a craggy, sinuous dramatic power. As a choreographer, Hoving was
best known for ``Icarus,'' a modern dance classic created in 1964
for his own company and performed by troupes that included the
Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. A spare yet glittering work
inspired by the Greek legend of Icarus and his desire to fly, the
dance portrays an arrogant young man, the lethally tantalizing sun
that draws him near, and the man's troubled father, played by
Hoving with poignant solemnity.
</P>
<P>
   Another landmark of his long career in dance was ``Growing Up in
Public,'' a popular biographical piece created for Hoving in 1984
by Remy Charlip, in which Hoving vividly re-enacted scenes from his
life in a subtly modulated flow of memories. Hoving also played the
kindly old doctor in ``Book of Days,'' a 1989 film by Meredith
Monk.
</P>
<P>
   Born Lucas Hovinga in Groningen, the Netherlands, he studied
with Yvonne Georgi and, in England, with Kurt Jooss, with whom he
danced in roles that included the Standard Bearer in the Jooss
classic ``The Green Table.'' He left for the United States in the
mid-1940s and danced with the companies of Martha Graham and
Valerie Bettis, also appearing in Broadway musicals choreographed
by Bettis, Agnes de Mille and Catherine Littlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Hoving joined the Jose Limon Dance Company in 1949 and performed
with the company to 1963, becoming a major interpreter of Limon's
choreography. He created the roles of Iago in ``The Moor's Pavane''
and the White Man in ``The Emperor Jones,'' as well as the
Conquistador in ``La Malinche'' and the ``Time to Keep Silence''
solo in ``There Is a Time.'' Hoving was also in the original casts
of ``Night Spell'' and ``Ruins and Visions,'' both by Doris
Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   He formed his own troupe in 1961, choreographing pieces that
included ``Songs for a Distant Land'' and ``Landscape With
Clouds.'' His dances have been performed by Bat-Dor in Israel, the
Cullberg Ballet in Sweden, Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, the Ballet
Nacional of Mexico City, and the Limon company.
</P>
<P>
   Hoving also served as the artistic adviser of the Limon troupe
in the early 1980s and taught modern dance in schools and
universities that included the High School of Performing Arts, the
Juilliard School and the American Dance Festival. He directed the
Rotterdam Dance Academy in the Netherlands from 1971 to 1978 and
was supervisor of dance education for the Dutch government through
1979.
</P>
<P>
   Hoving's wife, Lavina Nielsen, died in 1988. No immediate family
members survive.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Referring to Hoving's performance as the Christlike leader in
``The Traitor,'' a work by Limon, Walter Terry wrote in The New
York Herald Tribune in 1954 that Hoving danced the role ``with a
dignity that was never drab, never self-righteous but at all times
vital, urgent, commanding.''
</P>
<P>
   The role was an uncharacteristic one for Hoving. ``Jose always
cast me as the villain,'' Hoving said in a 1988 interview. ``His
psyche was always suffering onstage, and then I had to come and
make it worse.''

WALTER GALENSON, 85, ECONOMIST; WROTE BOOKS ON LABOR HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (rk) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter Galenson, a labor economist who studied the history of
American and Scandinavian unions and made the first serious attempt
by a Westerner to measure labor productivity in the former Soviet
Union, has died in Washington. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Galenson, who died on Dec. 30, explored the tensions within the
American union movement in his book, ``The C.I.O. Challenge to the
A.F.L.,'' (Harvard University Press, 1968).
</P>
<P>
   John T. Dunlop, the secretary of labor during the Ford
administration, said Galenson managed, in a series of books, to
detail the battles between union factions without alienating the
people he wrote about.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, he published a study comparing labor productivity in
the Soviet Union and the United States, an issue of vital
importance during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Galenson made a pioneering study of how living
conditions of Third World workers affected economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Galenson, who wrote or edited 28 books, earned bachelor's,
master's and doctor of philosophy degrees at Columbia University in
1934, 1935 and 1940.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he was the principal economist for the War
Department and later the Office of Strategic Services, the
forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency. He served briefly as
the State Department labor attache in Oslo and Copenhagen before
becoming an assistant professor of economics at Harvard University
in 1946. Five years later, he left for the University of California
at Berkeley, where he spent 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Kerr, who was president of the University of California
system in the 1960s, said Wednesday that Galenson adopted the views
of Scandinavian social democrats, ``which meant that by the
standards of American politics he was a liberal, but in the protest
politics of Berkeley he was seen as conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Galenson retired in 1990. His last book, ``The World's Strongest
Trade Unions,'' about Scandinavian unions, was published in 1998 by
Quorum Books.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Marjorie, who is also a retired
economics professor, of Washington; a son, David, of Chicago;
daughters Alice Galenson of Washington and Emily Schneider of

EXCERPTS FROM GORE AND BRADLEY COMMENTS AT CANDIDATES' FORUM
</HEADLINE>
   (With DEMS-DEBATE) 
(rk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the Democratic presidential forum
Wednesday night in Durham, N.H., involving Vice President Al Gore
and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, as recorded by The New
York Times:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mr. Bradley, has Mr. Gore ever taken a vote of yours or a
quote out of context?
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: A vote or a quote? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mr. Gore, has Mr. Bradley ever taken a vote or a quote out of
yours, out of context?
</P>
<P>
   GORE: I haven't complained about any.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The question was has he. ...
</P>
<P>
   GORE: I don't know that the answer is no, but if you want a no,
I'll give you a no.
</P>
<P>
   Q: OK Well then Mr. Bradley, being that you think Mr. Gore has
taken a vote or a quote out of context, choose one that you think
was particularly offensive.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: The one that was most particularly offensive to me was
when he said in this campaign that I was going to hurt
African-Americans, Latinos with the health care program that I have
offered. And he on any number of occasions has gone to groups and
said that I am going to destroy Medicaid without saying what it's
going to be replaced with. And to say to me whose had the deep
commitment to the issue of racial unity in this country since I
started in politics that I would go out and hurt African-Americans
and Latinos, consciously, as a part of a policy, I think really
offended me. What I'm trying to do with the health care program
that I've offered is to take Medicaid and replace it with something
that is better. Forty percent of the people in America who now live
in poverty, do not have any health coverage. They're not covered by
Medicaid. Under the proposal that I've offered they would all be
covered. And I think Al has misrepresented that.
</P>
<P>
   GORE: Well you know Harry Truman said in 1948 I'm not giving him
hell. I'm just telling the truth and he thinks it's hell. Now, I
didn't say any of the things that you heard. What I said is that
poor people are disproportionately likely to be minorities,
disproportionately likely to be African-American and Latino. And if
you look at the groups that are hurt when Medicaid is eliminated
and they're given instead a little $150-a-month voucher for HMOs or
health care capped at $150, then that is going to _ I do talk about
what is proposed as a replacement for Medicaid and it is entirely
inadequate. Let me tell you why, Peter. He says Use this capped
voucher to buy into the Federal Employee Benefit Plan. Look here in
New Hampshire. There are about a dozen different insurance health
policies that are under the Federal Employee Benefit Plan. Not a
single one of them can be purchased for anything close to $150 a
month. Now if you have Medicaid benefits today and you are given
that voucher instead and none of the plans in New Hampshire will
sell you health insurance for that amount of money, you bump up
against that cap, what do you do? If you are in groups that are
much more likely to be represented among impoverished Americans who
receive Medicaid, then you're going to be more likely to be hurt by
that. ...
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: The reality is that in New Hampshire the postal service
workers would work with a family of four. The reality is that when
you're writing a piece of legislation like this, you could say the
big plans _ big plans that cover big states would also have to have
available work in _ a plan in New Hampshire. It's just not so.
</P>
<P>
   And let me say one other thing. The _ Al is saying all the time
about a $150 cap. That's not a cap. It's a weighted average.
Someplace it'll be more, someplace it'll be less.
</P>
<P>
   And I might point out that the average Medicaid cost in your
home state of Tennessee is $91 a person. So you can say that the
men _ that people in Tennessee haven't been very generous, but you
can't say that my proposal would deny health coverage to Americans
who need it. ...
</P>
<P>
   GORE: I really want _ I really want to respond to this. ...
</P>
<P>
   Well, what is a weighted average? I remember the old story about
the man who had his feet on a block of ice and his head in the oven
and according to the weighted average he was really comfortable
there.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the _ the _ the fact is that the _ the plan that you just
cited for the mail handlers cost $182.72 for an individual as a
premium. You cap that at $150. You said for a family of four it
might work. Yep, that's right. That's right. But out of the dozen
plans, that is the only one where a family of four might get a
little bit of coverage. The individual would not and under all of
the others.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: Yeah, well, that's important.
</P>
<P>
   GORE: Now, now, hold on _ hold on just a second, Bill.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: You've just said that that is so.
</P>
<P>
   GORE: Look, this is serious. You have put forward a plan that
would affect New Hampshire. And all of the people who would be
affected in New Hampshire would be left out. They would be left
high and dry.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: They would not.
</P>
<P>
   GORE: because there is no plan that they can buy into. ...
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: Al, I have proposed registration and licensing of all
handguns, all 65 million handguns in America. President Clinton has
said he is for that. We're in the midst of this tremendous rash of
gun violence in America. Thirteen children are killed every day on
the streets of this country; that's a Columbine every day; 800,000
kids took a gun to school at least once last year. Registration and
licensing is what we do for automobiles. Why can't we do it for
handguns in America and why don't you support it?
</P>
<P>
   GORE: Well I do support licensing of the purchase of all new
handguns. And what the president said was that yeah, he supports
that idea. But it doesn't have a prayer of ever becoming law. And
it's much more sensible to try to get the maximum gun control that
we possibly can. Let me tell you, I know about fighting for gun
control. I helped to pass the toughest new gun control measure in a
generation. I cast the tie-breaking vote to take on the NRA and
close the gun show loophole. It took a hard fight to pass the Brady
bill and make it the Brady law to establish the three-day waiting
period. I want to go farther and completely ban Saturday night
specials and junk guns and assault weapons and have what's called
super tracing so that when a gun is used in any kind of crime it
can be immediately traced. Look, we have a flood of guns in
America. They're all over this country. We have to find a way to
make our political system work, taking into account the fact that
there are so many people who are going to fight tooth and nail
against the kind of maximalist measures that people want to talk
about. And we have to find a way, as President Clinton and I did,
to make dramatic progress to get guns out of the hands of the
people who shouldn't have them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q: Satisfactory answer, Mr. Bradley?
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: Well not really. I mean, he said, essentially, that
it's too difficult to do. That was the answer to the question.
</P>
<P>
   And I ask you, what were the _ where would the country be today
if Franklin Roosevelt said Social Security's too difficult to do.
Or if Lyndon Johnson said Medicare's too difficult to do. I mean,
the essence of leadership is taking something that is difficult and
making it possible, and making it possible because you've engaged
the American people in the attempt to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   And so I feel disappointed that he has not supported
registration and licensing of all 65 million handguns in America.
...
</P>
<P>
   GORE: I want to give you a chance, you wanted to respond earlier
to what I said about you voting for the Reagan budget cuts. But I
want to mention a couple of other tough votes. We passed tough
welfare reform, which I think has worked. You voted against it. I
voted against those budget cuts; you voted for them. I voted, as I
said a moment ago, for the resolution to use military force to push
Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait; you voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   My question is not about the details of those votes. It's really
more basic. Would you vote differently on any of those three votes
if you had it to do over again? Were they mistakes and why?
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: The answer is no I wouldn't have voted differently. In
'81, if everybody in the Congress had voted as I had voted against
the budget _ for the budget cuts but against the tax cuts, we would
not have had the deficit of the 1990s. As a result of that we would
had more economic growth. As you are well aware, given the economic
growth now, when you have more economic growth, you have more
revenue coming into the government, which would have meant more
money to do things to try to help the people who are poor.
</P>
<P>
   No on welfare reform. I don't think the answer to the problems
of people who are poor in America is to take a pot of money from
federal officials and send it to state officials and say, spend 80
percent of this as best you can. I think that this is a much more
serious question. We have a booming economy, welfare is down, but
deep poverty is up, it's not down, deep poverty. ...
</P>
<P>
   And on the issue of the Persian Gulf, no. The fact of the matter
is when the vote was taken, I thought that we should continue
sanctions, as did most people in my party. And I thought that you
should continue sanctions and then later have the right to use
force. I said I was prepared to use force at a later day. And
that's a decision that I made then and I stand by it.

MURPHY LEADS IRISH IN UPSET OF UCONN
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ With five straight victories and nine overall
this season, Notre Dame on Wednesday night posed a legitimate
threat to second-ranked Connecticut, which had won 10 straight
games since losing its season opener to Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   But those five victories by Notre Dame were over Virginia
Military Institute, Rider, Elon, St. Peter's and Loyola-Marymount.
And all were recorded at home.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish had lost four games since beating Ohio State, which
reached the Final Four last April and was ranked fourth in the
nation when it met Notre Dame. In Connecticut, Notre Dame was
facing a veteran team considered capable of repeating as the men's
national champion.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Before a capacity crowd of 16,294 at the Hartford
Civic Center, Notre Dame's young team topped its victory over Ohio
State with a stunning 75-70 triumph over Connecticut, giving its
first-year coach, Matt Doherty, his biggest victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Led by sophomore forward Troy Murphy, who scored 33 points and
grabbed 16 rebounds, 12 of them off the defensive glass, the Irish
(10-5) took a 30-28 halftime lead and widened the margin to as many
as 10 points before withstanding a gritty last-ditch, almost
one-man comeback by Khalid El-Amin, who tallied the Huskies' last 8
points of the game.
</P>
<P>
   For most of this Big East opener for both teams, it was a
head-to-head battle between Murphy, who came in with a
24-point-a-game average, and El-Amin, UConn's leading scorer with a
17-point average.
</P>
<P>
   While most of his teammates had difficulty scoring, as
Connecticut connected on only 38.7 percent of its shots (against 45
percent by Notre Dame), the flamboyant UConn point guard had a
game-high 34 points on 11-of-26 shooting which included five of 10
from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, from Morristown, N.J., was even more accurate, hitting
on 11 of 18 field goal attempts and 10 of 12 free throws, three of
which were Notre Dame's final points of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, the better team won,'' Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun
said. ``I thought Murphy was terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   The first half, in effect, was a one-on-one matchup between
El-Amin and Murphy, who at 6 feet 10 inches is a foot taller than
UConn's junior point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy was omnipresent, pulling down nine of Notre Dame's 20
first-half rebounds and scoring 15 points on 6-of-10 shooting,
along with 3 for 3 from the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin also had 15 points, connecting on six of 11 shots,
including three of four 3-pointers, and dishing off four assists.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, they scored in spurts. With the game at 2-2,
Connecticut went ahead when El-Amin scored 8 straight points on a
jumper from the lane and two from 3-point range to give Connecticut
a 10-6 lead. At that point, Murphy had scored all 6 of the Irish
points.
</P>
<P>
   But when Notre Dame took the lead for the first time, at 16-15,
it came on a 3-pointer by the reserve point guard Martin Ingelsby
and a layup by Ivan Kartelo. A free-throw by Kevin Freeman tied it
for UConn, but then, with Murphy scoring all 9 points, the Irish
went on a 9-4 run to draw ahead, 25-17.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was El-Amin's turn to surge as he nailed his third
3-pointer of the half and a jumper to trim the Irish lead to 1
point at 27-26. A 3-pointer by senior forward David Graves
eventually gave Notre Dame a 30-28 halftime lead.

ANALYSIS: PATAKI PUTS MORE FOCUS ON EDUCATION WHILE STILL CUTTING
TAXES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki has largely anchored his
reputation on a trinity of issues _ tax cuts, crime and welfare _
but in his annual speech to the Legislature on Wednesday, he made
clear that he wanted to be known as more than a fiscal puritan with
a penchant for law and order.
</P>
<P>
   By unexpectedly focusing on education, Pataki indicated that he
considered improving the schools in New York unfinished business.
Five years after taking office, he seemed to be acknowledging that
while the public might be pleased with his overall performance, he
could suffer politically if he did not address disenchantment with
the education system, particularly in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   He first hinted at this shift soon after winning his second term
in 1998, when he pushed a proposal to create charter schools
through a reluctant Legislature. He followed up last year by
setting up a special commission to investigate corruption in the
New York City schools. And Wednesday, he capped those moves by
laying out an education agenda that featured a program to provide
free tuition to college students who agree to teach in the public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new era for New York must begin with a renewed commitment to
our children's education,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no shortage of news to spur Pataki to demand
change _ from turmoil in governing New York City schools to
disappointing scores statewide _ he also cannot help but notice the
success of Republican governors like George W. Bush of Texas in
broadening their images by championing higher standards and other
education measures.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Pataki did not exactly shove aside the mainstay
issues of his first term, but he gave them less emphasis. Well into
his text, he announced an unremarkable proposal for business tax
cuts, many aimed at revitalizing the beleaguered upstate economy.
Still later, he repeated his longstanding proposal for ending the
parole system.
</P>
<P>
   Besides education, another issue featured prominently in the
speech was health care, an area that also suggests a shift in
Pataki's stewardship. In December, the governor and the Legislature
nearly doubled the cigarette tax to pay for a significant expansion
for health care for the uninsured, the first major tax increase of
his tenure. The move angered some conservatives, who questioned
Pataki's devotion to their tightfisted fiscal principles.
</P>
<P>
   Education and health care to some extent symbolize a new style,
but it would be wrong to characterize Pataki as a onetime
conservative firebrand. Aware that he is a Republican in a mostly
Democratic state, the governor has not neglected policies that
appeal to moderates, especially on abortion rights, which he
supports, and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   And though he did not promote a clarion-call educational agenda
in his first term, he did sign off on record increases in state
education aid sought by the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's speech was striking because Pataki had been expected
to pursue such a change in the course in his annual address last
year, the first of his second term. He instead clung last year to
the priorities of his first term, reeling off a list of
accomplishments and essentially calling for more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, some lawmakers had predicted that Pataki would
swing to the right Wednesday _ repeating something akin to last
year's speech _ because he would feel wounded by criticism of the
cigarette tax increase. He has been mentioned as a possible vice
presidential candidate and so it would seem natural that he might
want to reassert his conservative credentials.
</P>
<P>
   He did not, however, and his tone Wednesday indicated that he
believed that he had put the state's house in order on matters like
the budget and welfare, and could now focus on education, which is
arguably a more nettlesome issue because localities exert so much
control over the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of his priorities from the past four years are still in
place, but there is no question that he is targeting education,''
said state Sen. Thomas Libous, a Binghamton Republican. Herman
Badillo, whom Pataki appointed as chairman of the City University
of New York, said the tuition program harked back to when CUNY
tuition was free.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new tone and a new focus,'' Badillo said. ``The fact
that he put it at the top of his agenda is an indication that he is
very much aware of giving a real priority to education. The idea of
having free tuition _ it's very dramatic. I mean, that's really
moving to the left.''
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, Pataki did not announce an initiative for educational
vouchers, favored by conservative Republicans but anathema to many
Democrats. As a result, Democratic lawmakers expressed grudging
support for the proposals in the speech, while also trying to
portray Pataki as having stolen their agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's polls show that the public cares very much about
education,'' said state Sen. Martin Connor of Brooklyn. ``It's the
No. 1 issue. And it's clear that the governor and the Republicans
are trying to appease that public desire by addressing it. But it
raises the question of credibility. Where have they been the past
four years?''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Steven Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat who is chairman
of the Education Committee, said he was skeptical. ``We have to
remember that this comes from a governor who vetoed just a year ago
teacher mentor intern programs out of existence, opposed teacher
support aid, opposed teacher centers,'' he said. ``But if his
proposal represents a sincere conversion in the need to have better
trained and prepared teachers, I welcome that.''

IN DEATH OF ABANDONED NEWBORN, ECHOES OF AN EARLIER CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PATERSON, N.J. _ It is only 10 miles from the nearby town of
Wyckoff to the railroad tracks here where on Saturday passers-by
found an unclothed newborn baby amid the detritus of a poor urban
neighborhood: an empty bottle of Laird's gin, old discarded tennis
shoes, a cracked toilet tank, a rusted tire rim.
</P>
<P>
   But when the abandoned baby died in a local hospital Saturday
and his 14-year-old mother was charged with murder, an unlikely
link was forged between the forlorn railroad yard and the upscale
community to which Brian Peterson returned Tuesday, after spending
a year and a half in jail for his part in the death of his newborn
baby when he was 18 years old.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the girl in Paterson, whose name has not been made
public, pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and endangering the
welfare of a minor. Judge Nestor Guzman of the family division of
state Superior Court ordered her held for two days in the county
juvenile detention center until a probable cause hearing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say they are considering asking Guzman to charge the
girl as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   But along with their sorrow over the tragedy in Paterson, many
residents found telling differences in the attention given to the
two cases and the way they are being handled by the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson was released Tuesday after serving 18 months in prison
for the widely publicized death of his baby in 1996. Prosecutors
said that after Amy Grossberg, who was then his girlfriend, gave
birth in a motel in Delaware, Peterson placed his newborn son in a
plastic garbage bag and threw the bag into a Dumpster.
</P>
<P>
   He returned Tuesday to his neighborhood of sprawling lawns and
three-car garages and said he was sorry for his role in the baby's
death.
</P>
<P>
   He and Ms. Grossberg pleaded guilty to manslaughter charges for
their part in the death. Ms. Grossberg is to be released this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Paterson thought their penalties were light for the
death of a baby and a stark contrast with the murder charges
against the girl here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had money, that's why they got away with it,'' said
Rodney Green, a 28-year-old neighborhood resident.
</P>
<P>
   The chief assistant prosecutor for Passaic County, William
Purdy, said Tuesday that a preliminary autopsy showed that the baby
died of multiple blunt-force injuries and hypothermia. The baby's
liver was severed, it had lacerations on its lungs and it suffered
facial bone fractures, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to speculate as to how the baby got those
injuries,'' Purdy said. ``That is still under investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators identified the father as a boy about the same age
as the mother, but said they planned to file no criminal charges
against him. But they are still however, investigating whether the
girl had help in discarding the baby.
</P>
<P>
   The girl lived with her mother and father and two siblings in a
second-floor apartment in a white three-story house that abuts the
railroad track, next door to the Express Tire Center and
cater-corner to a market. There are Barbie stickers on windows of
the first story. Only a rickety chain-link fence separates the
girl's backyard from the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   People in the neighborhood talked sadly about the abandoned
baby, and wondered how it was that parents could not know what was
happening to their own child living under the same roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``She acted like a kid because she was a kid herself,'' said
Quasheema Miller, who is 34 and recalled seeing the small girl
taking a younger sister to school every day.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's lawyer, Frank Sciro of Paterson, said the parents
want the daughter tried as a juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's 14 years old,'' Sciro said. ``She had absolutely no
history of trouble with the law. She's a B student at the Passaic
County Technical and Vocational High School. Her parents are good,
hard-working people. This incident is obviously completely out of
character for this girl.''
</P>
<P>
   He also mentioned the case of Ms. Grossberg and Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community has told me loud and clear _ in calls from the
clergy and City Council members _ that they want this girl treated
the same as the children from Bergen County,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Grant, a spokesman for the Paterson mayor's office, said
Wednesday that the message of the two cases was that family
tragedies play out in both poor and rich communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The juxtaposition of these two cases shows that it goes all
across the economic and geographic lines,'' Grant said. ``We need
to make sure that our children aren't lost, whether they're from
upper-echelon neighborhoods like Columbine, Colo., or from less
economically advantaged areas.''  &QL;

ROMELY VOWS NO SPECIAL TREAT MENT FOR D- BACKS PLAYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BEVERLY FORD AND VICTORIA HARKER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - Bobby Chouinard won't be given special treatment
because he's a pro athlete, Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley
said Wednesday. But the Diamondbacks reliever won't be made an
example, either.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Under Romley's ``deadly weapons'' policy, anyone who commits a
crime with a loaded or unloaded gun is ineligible for probation
under a plea agreement or if convicted at trial.
</P>
<P>
   But exceptions are allowed, and defense attorneys across the
Phoenix area are watching the case closely to see whether
Chouinard, 27, is offered a break that indigent defendants don't
often get.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Chouinard's wife now is saying Phoenix police blew
the Christmas night incident out of proportion, and her cooperation
with prosecutors is in question.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, Jan. 5, Romley said prosecutors wouldn't
summarily deny Chouinard any plea deal that might spare him prison
time, but he won't get special treatment because of his celebrity. &QL; 
FACTORS TO WEIGH IN &QL; 
``If the defense attorney can give us reasons why we should
deviate, and we would do it in another case, then we'll consider
it,'' Romley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to be treated just like everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Romley didn't specify what factors might weigh in in the
Chouinard case. But in similar cases, prosecutors look at such
things as whether a person has previous arrests for domestic
violence or whether the police had been called to the home
previously for abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the Chouinards are hoping Romley will allow the
couple to resolve their issues in a counseling office, not a prison
cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``She loves her husband very much,'' said Michael Kimerer, Erica
Chouinard's attorney. ``They've been together for a long time, ever
since she was 15, and she says they're still totally in love with
each other. She's extremely supportive of him and of their family
and she wants to make sure her family stays together.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Chouinard's attorney, Larry Debus, said the couple are
living together, undergoing counseling and in tremendous emotional
pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many factors that brought this about,'' Debus said.
``Some go back to his childhood.
</P>
<P>
   He would not elaborate, but a police report of the incident said
Chouinard told his wife during the fight that he was upset because
he did not know his father.
</P>
<P>
   Debus said that Bobby has no criminal record and that Erica now
contends that her husband never hit her or was physically violent
with her, contrary to police accounts of her story.
</P>
<P>
   Romley downplayed Erica's change of heart, saying
domestic-violence victims often recant. And it won't stop the
prosecution of the case, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because next time, instead of cocking a gun, it may be pulling
the trigger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Chouinard, who is free on $32,000 bail, was indicted
Monday on one count of aggravated assault, a Class 3, dangerous
felony. He faces up to 15 years in prison if tried and convicted.
If he enters a plea, he faces a minimum of one year in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Other defense attorneys, particularly public defenders who
represent poor clients, want to see whether Chouinard will be
treated like Joe Sixpack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our average client, who's not a famous individual, would be
offered a prison plea under the circumstances reported in this
case,'' said Vicki Lopez, a public defender.
</P>
<P>
   Many defense attorneys believe the policy should be abolished
and plea agreements determined on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is when you enact policies and write them in
stone, you take away what the public wants in a prosecutor: an
intellect and an ability to apply facts to unique circumstances,''
said Darrow Soll, a private defense attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ahler, a division chief in the County Attorney's Office,
said he can't comment on whether Chouinard is eligible for a break.
</P>
<P>
   But he said deviations from the policy have been allowed for
several reasons, including a weak case; the disappearance of
witnesses; and whether the defendant has a mental-health issue.
</P>
<P>
   Debus said there are at least 20 reasons for allowing a
deviation in Chouinard's case.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Wambaugh of the non-profit Arizona Coalition Against
Domestic Violence said that if the police report in this case was
correct, a deviation would not be acceptable. &QL; 
INFANT'S LIFE `ENDANGERED' &QL; 
``I believe that in this case, the county attorney's policy should
be upheld under any circumstances,'' she said. ``There was a
17-month-old infant involved whose life was endangered.''
</P>
<P>
   Erica, 25, contends that police accounts of the event don't
reflect what really happened inside the couple's north Phoenix home
Christmas night.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, Erica told them her husband of four years
held a cocked and loaded pistol to her head while she begged for
her life on her knees. They say she told officers her husband
slapped and tried to strangle her while their 17-month-old son,
crying, watched from his bed. &QL; 
TAKING COUNSELORS' ADVICE &QL; 
Police say that Bobby admitted the assault after a day of drinking
and told officers that he had threatened to kill himself, too.
</P>
<P>
   Debus said his client realizes he has an alcohol problem and is
doing whatever his counselors suggest. Chouinard also is involved
in church, Debus said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Diamondbacks spokesman Robert Crawford declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Courtney, spokesman for Major League Baseball, said the
organization is aware of the allegations against Chouinard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been known to get very involved in these cases,'' he
said. ``But in cases like this, we have to let the judicial system
play its course.''  &QL;

MCCAIN DEFENDS HIS LETTER TO FCC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Arizona Sen. John McCain on Wednesday, Jan.
5, defended his intervention with a federal agency on behalf of a
big donor as ``appropriate,'' saying he had wanted only to force a
decision, not affect its outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Without revealing their names, McCain also said he was one of
seven senators who intervened with the Federal Communications
Commission to move forward on a decision to grant a license to
Paxson Communications, a contributor to McCain's campaign, for a
television station in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations were first made in Wednesday's, Jan. 5, ``Boston
Globe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the chairman of the Commerce Committee,'' McCain said.
``It's my job'' to urge the FCC to make decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't tell them to approve it; I told them to act,'' McCain
said. ``I think it's entirely appropriate. . . . I have always had
problems with the FCC. They are one of the slowest bureaucracies .
. . and two years is too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's suspicion about all of us as a result of these huge
amounts of money that wash around political campaigns. With me,
being the `reformer,' obviously those stories are more relevant.'' &QL; 
WRITTEN FCC IN PAST &QL; 
After a speech in Manchester, in which he again denounced the
influence of big money in politics, McCain told reporters he has
written to the FCC in the past and not only for companies that give
him campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the Globe also revealed that McCain took
four rides on Paxson's corporate jet, two of which came around the
time he held a high-profile summit with Democratic presidential
candidate Bill Bradley to decry the power of special interets.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 10, McCain sent a letter to the FCC urging the
five-member board to end two years of deliberations and decide
whether Paxson Communications should be given a license for a
Pittsburgh station.
</P>
<P>
   Angela J. Campbell, an attorney for opponents to the deal, told
the Globe that McCain's letter likely ``tipped'' the scales in
favor of the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator McCain said, `Do it by December 15 or explain why,'
and the commission jumped to it and did it that very day,''
Campbell told the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the trips on the Paxson jet, McCain received
$20,000 in contributions rounded up by the company and its law
firm.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he was not worried that rides on Paxson's jet _ for
which he paid the going first-class airfare rate _ create the
perception that he is not practicing what he preaches. Instead, he
said voters know he is the candidate who truly cares about campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe story comes just as the race in New Hampshire has
begun to even up. McCain, who at one time had held a sizable lead
over Texas Gov. George W. Bush, is now locked in a statistical dead
heat with the front-runner, according to recent polls. &QL; 
`MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING' &QL; 
Mike Murphy, McCain's media adviser, dismissed the eruption as
``much ado about nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain has always said he is trapped in a system he is dying
to change,'' Murphy said. ``And I think everyone who is in politics
knows this man is dead set against special interests. I think
that's clear as crystal.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as clear was that the Globe story represented the first
real crisis in an otherwise Cinderella story campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was dogged all day by reporters seeking comment on his
FCC intervention, and early in the day McCain aides began
circulating a five-page document with talking points and lengthy
explanations about each element of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Among the talking points: ``On at least two of the four flights
in question, McCain was accompanied by reporters from the Boston
Globe, making it highly unlikely that any lobbying of the senator
took place.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also noted that Paxson Communications allows all
members of Congress to use its jets and that more than 80 percent
of all U.S. business activity comes under the jurisdiction of the
Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet there is no evidence that John McCain has taken
inappropriate action on behalf of a contributor.'' &QL; 
CAMPAING HEATING UP &QL; 
Aboard his bus, the ``Straight Talk Express,'' in Manchester,
McCain said the story is proof that things are heating up in the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that it's getting intense, anything is a story,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has enjoyed unusually positive treatment from
reporters during the past two months, said the Globe story is also
evidence that he is not immune to searching coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just ask the Boston Globe and The Arizona Republic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, the story gave Bush an opening to criticize McCain for
failing to live up to his rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't question his integrity in any way, shape or form,''
Bush said, adding, ``I think it's really important for people who
are advocating reforms to live up to the spirit of reforms they are
advocating.''

COWBOYS' SMITH OUTRUNS INJURIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Emmitt Smith sees the bigger picture.
</P>
<P>
   Remind him that the Cowboys will go into Sunday's NFC wild-card
game at Minnesota as the biggest underdog in the NFL's four
first-round games this weekend, and he will say with a shrug, ``So?
I feel like an underdog every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell him that he finished 9 yards away from winning the NFC
rushing title, as he was dutifully informed by somebody on the
Cowboys' sideline in the final minutes against the New York Giants
on Sunday, and Smith will say, ``Sure, I'm 9 yards away from
leading the NFC in rushing, but I'm also one hit away from retiring
... forget it!''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's last carry against the Giants came with about five
minutes left. The Cowboys ran four more plays, including
quarterback Troy Aikman twice taking a knee to end the game. There
was no attempt made by Smith, knowingly with 1,397 rushing yards,
to overtake Washington's Stephen Davis (who played an earlier
game), with 1,405 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Try to bait Smith into saying that he's salivating at the chance
to finish business against a Vikings team that allowed him 140
rushing yards in just 24 minutes when these two teams last met Nov.
8 at the Metrodome, before he was forced to leave the game with a
broken right hand, and Smith will say, ``That's not likely to
happen again. That might be a one-time-every-five years kind of
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   There are three things that Emmitt Smith says Emmitt Smith has
needed to last 10 seasons in the NFL: 1) competitive fire in his
belly, 2) long stretches of good health and 3) God-given grace to
handle it all.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a Cowboys season that has been measured in neck
rolls, knee braces, electric massage and magnetic-resonance
imaging.
</P>
<P>
   Smith missed a career-high 10 quarters because of injury this
season, with a Nov. 8 broken hand and a Dec. 12 strained groin. For
the hand, he underwent surgery and still has an alloy metal plate
and six tiny screws implanted behind the big knuckle of the ring
finger.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries were a big part of this season for a Cowboys team that
is healthier now than at any other time since arriving in Wichita
Falls for training camp July 26. In fact, the postseason part of
their season nearly came and went without including the 8-8
Cowboys, who are seven-point underdogs against the 10-6 Vikings on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Without the 10 missed quarters because of injuries, Smith, in a
mathematical projection, would have rushed 390 times this season
for 1,656 yards, which not only would have beaten out Davis for the
NFC rushing title but would have beaten Indianapolis' Edgerrin
James (1,553) for the NFL rushing title as well.
</P>
<P>
   Before missing the second half at Minnesota, Smith was on pace
to finished that Monday night game with 280 yards and break Walter
Payton's 22-year-old NFL single-game rushing record by five yards.
</P>
<P>
   So, Smith returns Sunday to the scene of one of his greatest
regular-season performances, even though it lasted only 24 minutes.
And he revealed for the first time yesterday that he dedicated that
game to Payton, who had died seven days earlier of a rare liver
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it. I felt ``him''.'' Smith said of Payton that night
in November. ``I lost an individual whose accomplishments in life
and the game of football \Rwere what\S I looked up to. Now, I'm
chasing after him ... I'm chasing after him.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a moment of silence inside the Metrodome before that
Nov. 8 game, as there was inside every NFL stadium before every NFL
game that weekend, in Walter Payton's memory.
</P>
<P>
   Smith played that night wearing his usual No. 22 Cowboys jersey,
although in his mind, ``I draped \RPayton's\S No. 34 jersey on my
back, gave him honor ... and said, `Let me go play now.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Did he ever.
</P>
<P>
   Smith rushed for 140 yards on 13 carries before breaking his
right hand on a stiff-arm that caught in the face mask of Vikings
rookie cornerback Kenny Wright. Smith was on the way into the end
zone for the first of his two touchdown runs of 63 and 24 yards
over a span of 18 seconds in the the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``God saw fit that this hand would be broken on this particular
night, and that's that,'' Smith said with a small shrug and a lot
of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Detroit's Barry Sanders who retired last summer saying
that he had no interest in breaking Payton's NFL career record of
16,726 yards, Smith welcomes the opportunity. Smith, 30, needs
1,306 yards to catch Sanders and 2,763 yards to catch Payton.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Vikings, he knows that magic he felt two months ago
is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can try to re-create it all you want,'' Smith said.
``\RBut\S that was just a special moment for me.''

FLORIDA OPENS DRIVE TO SPEED DEATH PENALTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs 3rd graf to identify Jeb Bush as a Republican; subs 4th graf
to clarify and correct information concerning Texas' use of the
death penalty) 
 (sw) 
 By SARA RIMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ As state lawmakers began meeting on
Wednesday in a special session to replace execution by the electric
chair with execution by lethal injection, one thing became clear:
the real debate lies not in that issue but in an accompanying
proposal to speed up the appeals process so death row inmates can
be executed more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The special session of the Legislature, convened by Gov. Jeb
Bush, comes after two highly publicized incidents in which a
malfunctioning chair resulted in particularly gruesome deaths,
raising philosophical questions about protections against cruel and
unusual punishment and Florida's ability to competently carry out
executions.
</P>
<P>
   But while legislators appeared ready to adopt a new method of
execution, they became locked in heated debate over a companion
proposal by the governor, a Republican, that would speed up the
state's appeal process for death row inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan would pattern the appeals process in Florida after
the one overseen by his brother, Gov. George W. Bush, in Texas,
where more people have been executed than in any other state since
the Supreme Court allowed the death penalty to resume in 1976.
Texas' streamlined process limits the nature of appeals and the
time for bringing them.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's goal_ to reduce the time between sentencing and execution
from an average of 12 years in Florida to five _ has prompted a
remarkable outpouring from all sides of the issue. Wednesday's
session featured powerful statements from advocacy groups and
moving testimony from a wrongly imprisoned death row inmate.
</P>
<P>
   The high stakes politics were heightened by a remark by Brad
Thomas, the governor's top policy adviser on the death penalty.
``What I hope is that we become more like Texas. Bring in the
witnesses, put them on a gurney, and let's rock and roll,'' Thomas
told the St. Petersburg Times.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Thomas declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature is expected to vote on the issue this week. Even
the brevity of the session has raised concern among some lawmakers
who expressed reluctance to approve a complicated appeals bill in a
three-day special session.
</P>
<P>
   `` I think everybody should recognize if this thing blows up,
once again Florida's very, very poor track record on the death
penalty is going to show up again,'' said State Sen. Ron Klein,
D-Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Kendrick Meek, D-Miami, a former state trooper who is
in favor of the death penalty, characterized the session as
``microwave policy making,'' and accused his colleagues of bowing
to political pressure from the governor. ``Some of us need to go
see the wizard to get some courage around here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has also prompted opposition from legal experts
around the country, ranging from the American Bar Association and
death penalty lawyers to a retired Florida Supreme Court justice
and former prosecutor, who say the governor and some members of the
Republican-dominated legislature are trying to rewrite the state's
death penalty statutes virtually overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about an area of the law that beyond dispute is
both the most awesome in terms of its consequences and the most
complex as a procedural matter,'' said Elizabeth Semel, the
director of the American Bar Association's Death Penalty
Representation Project in Washington. ``You don't give full and
adequate consideration to the entire system of post conviction
review in the course of three days.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, 361 men and four women reside on Florida's Death Row. Since
1974, 20 death row inmates have been freed because of doubts about
their guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said that a speedier appeals process would ``reduce the
immoral delays that cause so much trauma to victims and cost
Florida's taxpayers millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   As Wednesday's session began, he reminded lawmakers that Florida
lags behind other states in its ability to impose the death
penalty, and said he was tired of what he described as the press
portraying ``that the people that believe in making the death
penalty more effective are somehow callous and cold.''
</P>
<P>
   The state is third in the number of executions behind Texas and
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who testified against changes in the appeals process
was Freddie Pitts, 55, a black man who was wrongly convicted, along
with another black man, Wilbert Lee, of the murder of two white gas
station attendants in Florida's Panhandle in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts and Lee spent 12 years in prison, more than nine of those
years on death row. They were both released in 1975, given full,
unconditional pardons by then-governor Reuben Askew after another
man confessed to the murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent nine-and-a-half years on Death Row, and I'm glad I'm
off,'' Pitts told the legislators. ``Had this law been in effect
when I was on Death Row, I would've been dead a long time ago.''
Pitts was calm and polite during his brief statement, but
elaborating on his feelings afterward, he said, ``I think they're a
bunch of ignorant, backwoods, redneck clowns bent on vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   There was little debate about the proposal to eliminate the
electric chair in favor of lethal injection, a move legal experts
say the Legislature was all but forced but to consider after the
U.S. Supreme Court agreed in November to review whether the state's
use of the electric chair amounts to cruel and unusual punishment.
The court's action brought executions in Florida to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   Of 38 states with capital punishment, only four require death by
electrocution. The Supreme Court agreed to the review after flames
erupted from the headpiece of one inmate and another condemned man
suffered a nosebleed in the electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents are concerned that imposing time or numerical limits
on appeals would lead to the execution of innocent inmates. Others
questioned the constitutionality of such limits as an intrusion on
the powers of the judicial branch.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Bob Butterworth, a Democrat, had raised
questions about the legislation designed to limit death case
appeals. But he threw his support behind the bill after the Senate
Criminal Justice Committee amended the legislation to allow inmates
to raise claims of innocence based on the discovery of new
evidence, regardless of time limits imposed by the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Butterworth, whose office represents the state in the appeal of
death cases, said the legislation ``is helping me do my job.''

</P>
<P>
   The bills to be considered during the special session also
include time limits on the filing of appeals and a dual-track
system to simultaneously file appeals instead of waiting until one
is done to file another.
</P>
<P>
   The last man to be executed in Florida, Allen Lee Davis, bled
all over himself when he was put to death July 8. Photographs of
his corpse with a contorted face contributed to a public outcry.
</P>
<P>
   In the current system, a convicted murder first has a chance to
file a direct appeal, which includes an examination of everything
in the record, transcripts, documents, evidence introduced at
court, prosecutors' arguments and judges' rulings. Then, if the
inmate loses the direct appeal, he has the chance to initiate a
second round of appeal _ the collateral appeal _ which involves
reinvestigating the entire case from scratch. This provides the
opportunity to unearth new evidence, to find witnesses who were
overlooked or who might recant, to examine the competence of the
defense lawyer, and to try to learn whether prosecutors withheld
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida inmates win a high percentage of their direct
appeals, making the second stage unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   This legislation requires that the first and second round of
appeals be filed at the same time. Often, years pass before the
second round is filed.
</P>
<P>
   Speeding up this process will add to the burdens of Florida's
already overburdened criminal justice system, and, according to
critics, willt make it more difficult for inmates who are not
guilty to prove their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it takes a certain amount of time to do one of these
cases,'' Ms. Semel said, referring to the second stage of a capital
appeal. ``They take hundreds if not thousands of hours of attorney
time to do them adequately.''
</P>
<P>
   Already Florida has problems _ huge numbers of cases, a shortage
of lawyers, years of not adequately funding the system of
representation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal to speed up the appeals process has been
criticized by editorial writers around the state, including The
Miami Herald, the St. Petersburg Times, the Fort Lauderdale
Sun-Sentinel and the Palm Beach Post.
</P>
<P>
   Also voicing opposition have been several retired Florida
Supreme Court justices, including Gerald Kogan who, as a
prosecutor, tried many capital cases and formerly favored the death
penalty. The Florida Supreme Court has been praised by lawyers for
its conscientious review of capital cases. Last year the court
reversed 76 percent of the capital cases it heard on direct
appeals, sending some back for new trial because of errors and
imposing a sentence of life in prison instead of death in others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that the system is flawed, that judges and lawyers
make mistakes,'' said Chris Spaulding, an assistant public defender
in Miami who has handled many death penalty appeals. ``This
legislation is trying to speed up the process without addressing
the fundamental errors that are being committed.''
</P>
<P>
   If the proposal is passed by the Legislature this week, and sent
to Gov. Bush for approval, it will most certainly result in
numerous legal challenges, legal experts say. ``It's a death
penalty lawyer's relief act,'' said Steve Hanlon, a partner in the
state's largest law firm, Holland &AMP; Knight, in Tallahassee. ``It
will tie up death penalty cases in litigation for years.''

 &HT;    INS decision angers some Florida Cubans
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Cuban-Americans in West Palm Beach
reacted with bitterness and sadness Wednesday over the United
States' decision to return Elian Gonzalez to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fidel Castro has shown once again that he can manipulate the
American government,'' said Jorge Avellana, deputy director of the
Hispanic Human Resources Council, a social services agency.
</P>
<P>
   He said Castro accepted the return of six Cubans involved in a
prison riot in Louisiana last month to pressure the United States
into giving up Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's treacherous infamy that there was an exchange of
prisoners for a little Cuban boy,'' Avellana said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was loudly debated at the Palacio Cafeteria, where
Cuban-Americans gather daily for Cuban coffee and political
commentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Cuba, Elian will never have a good life,'' said Jorge Smith
Quintero, 45, who left Cuba in 1980. ``The food is bad and there is
no milk for children after their seventh birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   Former newspaper publisher Raul Rio said he did not expect
Cuban-Americans in West Palm Beach to stage protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live here and abide by the laws,'' said Rio. ``No one can
deny that a father should have custody of his son, but I know this
is a morally wrong decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Rio said most Cubans suspect Elian's father prefers his son stay
in the United States, but can't express his true feelings because
of Cuba's political repression.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Montiel of West Palm Beach, who commanded a brigade in the
1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, said the return of Elian was an unwise
political decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the cowardice of the Clinton administration, which
wants to negotiate with Fidel Castro,'' Montiel said. ``It was a
dirty deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-American Cristobal Oviedo said he was also disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the practice of the United States to please
Castro,'' said Oviedo, who left Cuba in 1960. ``They play games
with him. That's why he's been in power for the past 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo, like many Cubans, said the U.S. should have required
Elian's father to come to the U.S. to claim his son in a court of
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason the father is not coming is that Castro won't
let him,'' Oviedo said. ``Castro always gets his way.''

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Former Washington Redskins general manager Charley Casserly will be
the first candidate interviewed for the job of director of football
operations with Houston's NFL expansion team.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Casserly is coming to Houston on Friday to interview with owner
Bob McNair and executive vice president Steve Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting the process of finding a director of football
operations,'' McNair said Wednesday night. ``We're starting the
process with Charley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charley and I have spoken on the phone several times, and I've
been very impressed with him. He started at the bottom of the
Redskins organization under George Allen and worked his way up to
become the general manager of a Super Bowl winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charley comes highly recommended by a lot of people, including
(ex-Redskins coach) Joe Gibbs. He's done everything you want in a
director of football operations. He's hired coaches and scouts.
He's been in charge of the draft. He's negotiated contracts. He's
signed free agents. I like the idea of hiring someone with
experience in those departments.''
</P>
<P>
   Casserly was fired before the season by new Redskins owner
Daniel Snyder. Washington won the NFC East, and Casserly has
received a lot of attention because such players he acquired as
quarterback Brad Johnson, running back Stephen Davis, receivers
Michael Westbrook and Albert Connell and cornerback Champ Bailey
have been instrumental in the team's first playoff appearance since
the Gibbs era.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Casserly's draft-day dealings in April left Washington
with three first-round picks in 2000, including the second overall
selection from New Orleans, which was part of the Ricky Williams
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charley's got a proven track record,'' McNair said. ``He's a
hard worker. He's organized and thorough. I've been told by a lot
of people I respect that Charley works for team results rather than
trying to promote himself, and that's not always the case in this
league.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair will interview other candidates, including Joe Mack, who
used to work with Casserly in Washington. Mack, a highly respected
personnel man, helped set up the Carolina and Cleveland
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``After talking with a lot of people around the league about
setting up an organization, I've decided I'd like to get a football
operations guy,'' McNair said. ``Someone who's done everything
eliminates some of the risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone who's done it before can handle everything that needs
to be done as far as putting together the scouting part of the
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Once McNair has hired a director of football operations, scouts
and personnel people will be the next in line. Unless there is a
head coach who has to be hired this offseason, the team probably
won't go after a coach until after the 2000 season. The Houston
team will begin play in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``My preference is to hire people who've been successful at this
level,'' McNair said. ``I'd like to hire a head coach who's been a
winner in the NFL.''

TWO INJURED COWBOYS CORNERBACKS PRACTICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys cornerbacks Kevin Smith and Kevin Mathis
practiced yesterday for the first time in weeks. Coach Chan Gailey
said if Smith is healthy, he will get his first start since Nov.
21. That ``if/, however, is a big one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much they'll be able to contribute on
Sunday,'' Gailey said. ``They stayed on the field most of the day,
which was a positive sign. We'll see how they feel tomorrow after
going through a day of practice.'' Both players have missed eight
games, and they have played in only three games together, the most
recentbeing Nov. 8 at Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Smith missed the first three games of the season with a bad back
that kept him out of most of training camp. He started the next
seven games, then injured his hamstring at Arizona and has missed
five of the last six games.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis hasn't played since Dec. 12 after injuring his knee for a
second time.
</P>
<P>
   If Smith is unable to go, Charlie Williams will start at
cornerback opposite Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Izell Reese, who has been on injured reserve for the
second half of the season, underwent surgery Monday to remove a
bone spur from his neck. Ekuban's plan Rookie defensive end
Ebenezer Ekuban, who has made four career starts, says he knows how
to get inside the head of Vikings quarterback Jeff George, who is
0-1 in the playoffs and has a reputation for coming unglued in
pressure situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to get pressure on him,'' Ekuban said. ``Once he
gets in that pocket and that pocket collapses very quickly, he gets
very uneasy and he can throw some turnovers.'' Emmitt expects
attention After what he did to the Vikings on Nov. 8 in 24 minutes
of action, Emmitt Smith is confident the Vikings' defense will be
keying on him. Smith rushed for 140 yards and two touchdowns in
staking the Cowboys to a 17-0 lead before fracturing his hand with
six minutes left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   But, commanding a defense's attention is hardly something new to
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it's been that way since, since ... ,'' Smith said,
then paused to reflect, ``since I started playing football. They're
probably saying, `Don't forget what happened last time.' That's
what they should be saying. That's their job.'' Warren playoff
pumped Backup running back Chris Warren became the Seattle
Seahawks' all-time leading rusher in his eight seasons there. But,
he never played in a playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, his first with the Cowboys, Warren missed the
Cowboys' wild-card loss to Arizona with a groin injury that hobbled
him throughout the season. So finally, after 10 NFL seasons, Warren
is ready to play in his first playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels weird to be doing something in January that has to do
with football,'' Warren said. ``I'm excited about everything. It's
new for me. I'm going to approach it the way I do every game, but
this one is special for me.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW ORLEANS _ There would have been a large crowd of supporters on
hand to witness history, even if the doors of the Superdome had
been unlocked only to kin.
</P>
<P>
   After all, when the Bowden clan has a get-together, it
practically takes a huge sports facility to fit all of the sons and
daughters-in-law, husbands and wives, kids and grandkids under one
roof. The artificial turf just makes it so much easier to clean up
the mess.
</P>
<P>
   But when Peter Warrick had buckled the knees of the Virginia
Tech secondary one last time for a 43-yard reception that was the
frosting on a 46-29 Florida State victory in the Nokia Sugar Bowl,
and the patriarch of all the Bowdens strode onto the field to
accept the national championship trophy, it was more than just a
relative success. Grandfather Bobby Bowden never looked more grand.
</P>
<P>
   The first national title, which came in the 1994 Orange Bowl,
was certainly a cause for celebration. But the second, pulled out
of the clutches of a feisty bunch of Hokies, provided a stamp of
validation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob-by Bow-den! Bob-by Bow-den!'' came the chorus from the
gleeful Florida State fans as the final seconds ticked off the
clock in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Now Grandpa Bobby's name can be chanted with the great ones _
Bear Bryant, Joe Paterno, Bud Wilkinson, to name a few _ who have
drunk from the championship cup more than one time.
</P>
<P>
   Back then in Miami, he looked more like a coastal survivor of a
furious Florida hurricane as a last-second field-goal attempt by
Nebraska slipped wide of the upright, and his Seminoles held on.
</P>
<P>
   This time, in the old town of riverboat gamblers, pirates and
good times that are always rolling, Bowden got title No. 2
delivered on the winged feet of Warrick and a team that wouldn't
fold in the face of a third-quarter blitz by Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes this so special to me is that we were able to earn
the championship by coming from behind,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Seminoles came from behind 29-28 only after they
had come from ahead 28-7 when mercurial Hokies quarterback Michael
Vick began to work his magic.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is adversity that tests all of us, and no team on any
field or court or diamond faces more than when it lets momentum and
a big lead get away.
</P>
<P>
   It is the mark of a champion to regain composure, to stop the
little stone that has turned into a giant boulder rolling downhill.
And it is the mark of a great coach to make that possible.
</P>
<P>
   For too many of his 24 years on the FSU sideline, Bowden has
been recognized more for his down-home, thick-as-molasses drawl and
his sweeter-than-any-Sugar Bowl way of dealing with setbacks. Too
many have regarded him as college football's present-day version of
former University of Houston hoops boss Guy V. Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, like Lewis, just recruited the thoroughbred athletes,
opened the doors to the practice facility and let them run wild, it
was said. Shoot, Bobby, like Guy V., couldn't tell an X from an O
if you spotted him Vanna White, the critics said.
</P>
<P>
   So there was Bowden feeding the false image during one segment
of the second quarter Tuesday night by chatting with ABC sideline
reporter Lynn Swann while his quarterback, Chris Weinke, was in the
process of hooking up with Warrick on a deep pass off a
flea-flicker.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, that's ol' Bobby, some probably said while sitting at home
watching on TV. Just let him know what the final score is.
</P>
<P>
   But know this: It is Bowden's program that has produced two
titles and a record 13 consecutive top-four Associated Press poll
finishes. It is his touch on the wheel, his hand on the tiller. He
maintains the FSU program that stretches from before Deion Sanders
to Warrick Dunn to Peter Warrick. He may not call all the plays,
but he does call all of the shots. He plots the course. He guides
the ship. He is the one who continues to see that the whole thing
keeps moving forward and thriving.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bowden has two championships instead of one, and that means
something. It means he steps out of the pack of so many one-time
wonders _ LaVell Edwards, Lou Holtz, Bill McCartney and Howard
Schnellenberger. Even Phil Fulmer eventually won one title with all
that talent at his disposal at Tennessee, and Danny Ford won one at
Clemson. Heck, it puts him one up on the ``genius'' Steve Spurrier.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden's Seminoles became the first team in history to go
wire-to-wire at No. 1 in the AP poll from the preseason through the
bowls. And after all those years of stalking the sideline, he
finally has his unbeaten, perfect season, and he has been to the
pinnacle now twice.
</P>
<P>
   That has to mean something outside the family circle of the
Bowdens. And it does.
</P>
<P>
   Grand job, Grandpa.
