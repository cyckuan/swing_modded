<HEADLINE> Syria: Termination of Occupation Will Put End to Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Syria today said that the only
rational solution that will make it possible to put an end to
violence and counter-violence is to fully abide by the commitment
of the Madrid conference formula and to terminate occupation.
</P>
<P>
This position was publicized in a commentary by radio Damascus
on the outgoing international anti-terrorism conference, which was
held in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh earlier
today.
</P>
<P>
"Had Israel believed in a just and comprehensive peace, and in
fact that peace was the only way that would guarantee its security
as well as that of the region, it (Israel) would have pulled out
of the territories it has occupied by force," the radio said in
the commentary.
</P>
<P>
The radio called on Israel to seek a genuine peace and
pronounce its commitment to "international legitimate resolutions"
which stipulate its withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
"Had Israel done so, it would have put the region on the
threshold of a new phase of security and stability," the radio
said.
</P>
<P>
The radio stressed that in order to push the peace process
forward, it was imperative that the organizers of the Sharm el
Sheikh summit conference and other international gatherings
carefully search for the real causes that have led to the
obstruction of peace.
</P>
<P>
"They ought to have allowed all participating parties to engage
(themselves) in an objective discussion and agreed on an agenda,"
it said. "To convene the summit in such a hasty way and in the
present forum would certainly not be sufficient to serve the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
The radio charged that the summit would only serve the
interests of Israel at the expense of the interests and rights of
the Arabs, a fact that Israel was keen to grab.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the radio said, Syria has been the first country
in the world to call for an international conference to define
terrorism in line with the principles of international law and the
articles of the U.N. charter.
</P>
<P>
"It has done so because it condemns terrorism and the slaying
of innocent people, upholding, at the same time, the right of
peoples to struggle for freedom and independence," it noted.
</P>
<P>
Like others, the radio said, Syria has made great sacrifice
for freedom, and for confronting terrorist acts. Hence, Syria's
adherence to a just and comprehensive peace, and the return to the
Madrid conference formula.
</P>
<P>
Both Syria and Lebanon boycotted the anti-terrorism summit,
which was attended by delegations from nearly 30 countries.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pledges U.S. Support to Israel against Terror </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
arrived in Israel tonight on a short visit to show American
support to Israel in the wake of the recent Hamas suicide attacks
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived at the Ben-Gurion Airport along with Israeli
Prime Minister Shimon Peres after flying together on Air Force
One from Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh where both
attended today's international anti-terror summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit, attended by representatives from 29 countries,
concluded with a communique calling for continuing the Middle East
peace process while combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In a brief speech at the welcoming ceremony at the airport,
Clinton delivered a strong message of U.S. support to Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The United States stands more strongly than ever, shoulder to
shoulder, with Israel. We will work with you as you strive for a
secure peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will stand by your side until Israelis come to know that
peace with security within this land is a reality, until in the
words of the prophet: the voice of joy and the voice of gladness
are heard again in the cities and the hills of Israel," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the terrorists "must not and will not
succeed" and "we must root out them and not let them kill peace."
</P>
<P>
He also said that on Thursday, he and other U.S. officials
will discuss with Peres and his security advisors "concrete ways"
the Americans can take to help the Israeli security forces combat
terror.
</P>
<P>
"America is determined to support them (Israeli security
forces) in every way and to provide them with means they need to
prevail against extremism and violence," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
This is Clinton's third visit to Israel as U.S. president. He
is being accompanied by U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross and some
other U.S. senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Peres thanked Clinton and the U.S. government for their
support and understanding for the Israeli people at this crucial
time.
</P>
<P>
Peres also vowed that Israel is determined to fight against
terror. "We have to kill terror if we want to proceed with the
peace process," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Peres were greeted at the airport by Moshe
Shahal, Israel's acting prime minister in the absence of
Peres, and other cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman was not at the airport to greet
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said Tuesday that he thinks an official reception
should be in Jerusalem. American sources travelling with Clinton
said he did not want an official Jerusalem reception because it
would imply American recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's
capital.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces were on high alert for Clinton's
visit, with a large number of soldiers and police deployed in Tel
Aviv, the Ben-Gurion Airport and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The American president is scheduled to meet with Weizman
tonight in Jerusalem. On Thursday, he will attend a symbolic
Israeli cabinet meeting and hold talks for the first time with
Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu before leaving for Washington.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say that Clinton's meeting with Netanyahu is to
counterbalance charges that his trip to Israel is being made to
bolster Peres's sagging electoral fortunes after four recent
Hamas suicide bombing attacks, which killed 58 victims and injured
more than 100.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli officials said Tuesday that Clinton
will, at a press conference on Thursday, announce his intention
to sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) next month upgrading
the security relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
This would mark the first signing of such an executive
agreement between the two countries in eight years. The last
Israeli-U.S. MOU was reached in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The MOU is expected to be signed in Washington on April 19
when Peres travels to America, said the officials. As part of the
document, Israel is expected to gain greater intelligence
cooperation with the U.S., including access to high-resolution
satellite photos that it has been denied in the past.
</P>
<P>
The MOU would also enhance Israel's status as a major non-NATO
ally, and will also include provisions of a U.S.-Israel
anti-terrorism package, which will include equipment and funding.
</P>
<P>
Ross will stay here after Clinton's departure to further
discuss the anti-terrorism initiative.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa's Defense Budget Cut By Five Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 13 (Xinhua)-- South Africa's defense
spending in this year's new budget has been cut by five percent
to 10.2 billion Rand (about 2.79 billion US Dollars), announced
Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg today.
</P>
<P>
In his budget speech in parliament, Liebenberg said the
defense budget continued the downward trend which had reduced the
defense expenditure from 4.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product in
1989/90 to under two percent in the present fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The new budget saw a modest rise in real expenditure, a
reduction of the deficit and a commitment to improved tax
collection.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in his budget review, Finance Director-General
Estian Calitz said the defense budget included the cost of
integration and demobilization of personnel and an allocation
for the head office expenses of the service corps.
</P>
<P>
Calitz said, however, the running costs of the members to be
trained through the planned service corps projects were to be met
from other sources.
</P>
<P>
A further 113 million Rand (about 30.95 million US Dollars)
appeared in the Department of Public Works budget for erecting,
procuring and maintaining land and buildings for defense
purposes, he added.

<HEADLINE> Woodland Reduces Sharply In Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- National Coordinator for the
Ethiopian Forestry Plan of Action Girma Defar said today that his
country loses about 200,000 hectares of woodland each year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, Girma made the
announcement at a meeting in Dire Dawa, the second largest city
of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Girma said, a study carried out in the last four years has
proved the devastation of 150,000-200,000 hectares of woodland
every year due to the ever increasing demand for arable land,
firewood in addition to lack of public awareness with regard to
the resource.
</P>
<P>
"The fast depletion of the country's forestry has resulted in
ecological imbalance which in turn exacerbated desertification,"
he said, stressing the need to nurture the existing natural
forest apart from launching afforestation campaigns.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics available, at present only three
percent of the land in the country is covered by forest as a
result of higher consumption of fuelwood for energy purposes.

<HEADLINE> Job Creation: S. Africa's Biggest Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Job creation remained South
Africa's biggest challenge, Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg
pointed out today.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the parliament, Liebenberg said sustainable
growth and development could only be achieved through job
creation which was "a key pillar" of the government's growth and
development strategy.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government had expected improved
employment in the last part of 1995 and in 1996 as unused
capacity was taken up and fixed investment continued to improve.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that among the poorest 40 percent of South
African households, nearly 50 percent of work seekers were unable
to find employment.
</P>
<P>
The government has to deal with the reality that most of the
unemployed were the blacks, especially those in the rural areas,
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that about 4.6 million people, or 32.6 percent
of South Africa's economically active population were unemployed.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has a total population of about 42 million, among
which about 75 percent are the blacks.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Warns against Using AL to Replay Anti-Terrorism Summit (part two) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He denied that Lebanon is one of the sponsors for the
violence in the region, saying that Lebanon is "the first
victim of the violence in the region."
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister called for a "serious summit
within the framework of the (1991) Madrid peace conference and
within the mechanism of the Madrid conference, and launched
firstly and basically from the demanded political depth."
</P>
<P>
He announced that in the AL conference, his delegation would
stress the necessity to differentiate terrorism, which is practiced
by organizations outside Lebanon's lands and borders, and the
resistance against the foreign occupation of Lebanon's land.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz underlined that the summit meeting at Sharm el
Sheikh would deepen the gap between the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Defending his country's decision to boycott the summit
at Sharm el Sheikh, the Lebanese foreign minister said that
the call for the conference came following the recent spate
of violence in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The timing and atmosphere of the summit, he said, would "make
it impossible for those attending the summit to distinguish
terrorism from resistance, and make it impossible to avoid the
summit to be in Israel's interests only."
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on any price Lebanon and Syria could pay
for their absence in the summit at Sharm el Sheikh, Boueiz said
that Lebanon paid the price in the past, and only those who make
a mistake in assessing the situations would pay the price in the
future.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the price was paid in advance and that is
behind us," the foreign minister said, "and now we think that
those making a mistake in assessing the things and practically
assessing the facts will probably pay the price."

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Warns against Using AL to Replay Anti-Terrorism Summit (by Shao Jie) (part one) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares
Boueiz today warned against making use of an Arab League (AL)
conference to replay the outgoing international anti-terrorism
summit, which was held in the Egyptian Red Sea city of Sharm el
Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz made the remarks before he left here this afternoon for
Cairo to attend the 105th conference of the AL Council, which
will be held in the Egyptian capital Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The AL conference is postponed for one day due to today's
anti-terrorism summit, dubbed as a summit of peacemakers, in Sharm
el Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
"What we are afraid of is that the Arab League could be used as
a stage to reflect what was decided in Sharm el Sheikh, and the
problem could be moved from Sharm el Sheikh to Cairo," Boueiz
told reporters at the Beirut International Airport.
</P>
<P>
"However, the Lebanese position is clear on the issues raised
currently," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both Lebanon and Syria boycotted the summit, which was attended
by nearly 30 delegations.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that it should be done seriously to put an end to
the violence in the region, that is by studying the causes of the
violence," Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the violence in the Middle East to the Israeli
practices, no matter whether on the Palestinian lands, or in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He warned against dealing with the problem of violence from
one angle and ignoring the in-depth reasons behind them.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the outgoing anti-terrorism summit, since it was
held as a response to the recent events which took place in
Israel "as if the terror is only from one side, and as if what is
happening in south Lebanon, from detaining the Lebanese citizens
to bombarding the houses and destroying them ... ... is not a
terror, and does not deserve even a (U.N.) Security Council
meeting."

<HEADLINE> UK, Ireland Express Concerns over Loyalist Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Ulster Secretary Patrick
Mayhew said today that he was hopeful about the future of the
Northern Ireland peace process, but he condemned a threat of
violence by the Protestant loyalist paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Belfast, Mayhew said political
parties in Ulster were not in agreement on the form of elections
in the troubled province leading to all-party talks which are due
to start on June 10.
</P>
<P>
However, the Ulster secretary stressed the way in which the
difficult problems had been addressed boded well for the future of
all-party talks.
</P>
<P>
In such circumstances, "it is very serious of course that there
should be any threat or expectation held out of the use of illegal
force," he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasised, "That has to be explored in all circumstances.
There can be no place for violence in a democracy."
</P>
<P>
Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said that his government was
also seriously concerned over any statements from rival sides in
Northern Ireland threatening resumption of violence, according to
reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Spring told the Irish parliament that he would hold talks with
Mayhew in Dublin to review joint efforts to get all Ulster's
political parties to the negotiating table on June 10.
</P>
<P>
According to the Anglo-Irish joint communique issued on
February 28, it is the final day today for the consultation on the
elections in Northern Ireland as a stepping stone to all-party
talks on the future of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
But the Protestant loyalist armed groups in a statement on
Tuesday night threatened to retaliate against the Irish Republican
Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
The Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC), which groups the
Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Freedom Fighters, called on
the IRA to "draw back from the brink."
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the CLMC warned, the loyalist armed groups would deal
with the IRA "blow for blow."
</P>
<P>
The loyalist armed groups declared their truce on October 13,
1994, following the IRA's cease-fire on August 31 that year. But
they have maintained their cease-fire although the IRA broke its
truce with a bomb attack in east London on February 9.

<P>
ARUSHA, TANZANIA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A Tanzanian government
official said today that all arrangements were ready for East
African Cooperation (EAC) to take off on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state of the three East Africa nations, Tanzania,
Kenya and Uganda, are expected to meet here to appoint the
Executive Secretary of Secretariate of the Tripartite Commission
and to inaugurate the Secretariat, said a Tanzanian foreign
ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Cyprian Majengo said the main agenda of the meeting was to
consider ways and means of further strengthening and deepening
East African cooperation, and in particular to appoint the two
Deputy Executive Secretaries of the Secretariat and to recommend
Kenya's nominee as the Executive Secretary for appointment by the
heads of state.
</P>
<P>
The commission has appointed Sam Nahamya of Uganda as the
Deputy Executive Secretary for Finance and Administration and
Fulgence Michael Kazaura of Tanzania as the Deputy Executive
Secretary, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two deputy executive secretaries took their oath of
allegiance last night, the spokesman added.

Majengo also disclosed that the commission passed a resolution
recommending to the heads of state to appoint Francis Kirimi
Muthaura of Kenya as the Executive Secretary of the Secretariat
of the Tripartite Commission.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tanzanian government source said the commission
agreed on ways of strengthening cooperation in the fields of
transport and communications, immigration, trade, industry,
investment, customs, security, tourism, fisheries, agriculture
and animal husbandry and environment.
</P>
<P>
It is agreed that each member state should establish a task
force to strengthen road transport and facilitate movements of
vehicles across the borders, according to the source.
</P>
<P>
The three countries would adhere to the COMESA programme (the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa) on reduction of
trade tariffs, the source added.
</P>
<P>
The three countries, among others, have agreed to take steps
to make their currencies convertible as soon as possible.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHARM EL SHEIKH, EGYPT, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat today expressed his confidence and
determination to "defeat enemies of peace and extremists."
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the "Summit of Peacemakers" in this Egyptian Red
Sea resort, Arafat said extremists wanting to destroy peace are
only a few "isolated people" and most of the Palestinian people
support peace and are against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian people must not be the victims of
terrorists," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said the Palestinian Authority has been cracking down
on Islamic extremists, but eradicating terrorism can not achieve
its objectives at a time when the entire Palestinian people are
under siege and closure.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinians have suffered unemployment and great
losses due to the closure of the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the Palestinians will continue
implementing the peace agreements signed with Israel.

<HEADLINE> UK Unemployment Rises by 6,800 in Feb. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The total number of people out of
work in Britain rose unexpectedly by 6,800 last month, ending the
2.5 years of falling unemployment, the Central Statistical Office
(CSO) said today.
</P>
<P>
The official data released today showed the number of
unemployment, adjusted for seasonal variations, rose to 2.214
million last month from 2.207 million in January. This was the
first increase in unemployment since August 1993.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate was unchanged at 7.9 percent of the work
force.
</P>
<P>
Financial markets had expected a fall of around 10,000 in
unemployment in February after an exceptionally large drop of
29,300 in January.
</P>
<P>
The CSO said the February figures might have been distorted by
an industrial dispute at unemployment offices and the trend of
monthly falls of 10,000 was likely to resume.
</P>
<P>
The February total was 153,100 lower than a year ago and well
below the unemployment peak of nearly 3 million seen in December
1992.
</P>
<P>
Economists said unemployment could rise further in the next few
months as companies cut back production in an attempt to reduce
huge stocks of unsold goods on their shelves, but could then start
falling again.

<HEADLINE> New York Students Attend Fewer Class Hours Than  Required: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Many public high school students
in New York City attend fewer class hours than required because of
overcrowding and education budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released by the Board of Education
Tuesday, 35,120 of the city's 250,369 students were not receiving
the minimum number of hours of instruction. More than 24,000 of
those students spent fewer than four and a half hours daily in
class. A full course load usually entails seven 45-minute periods.
</P>
<P>
Due to overcrowding, said the report, submitted in response to
an order from the State Department of Education, students at 58 of
the city's 137 high schools attended class in two shifts and were
required to spend only four and a half hours in class each day.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon is particularly serious in Queens inhabited
largely by immigrants. A total of 8,001 out of 66,968 -- one in
every eight -- spent fewer than five and half hours in class each
day, the report noted. The percentage -- 11.9 -- is nearly triple
the citywide level of 4.3 percent.

LUSAKA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick

harvest for this year.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba told a press conference here that the efficiency would

</P>
<P>
There is a fear that though a bumper harvest is expected this
year, maize, which is the staple food of the country, may be left
to waste due to shortage of storage facilities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chiluba urged millers to reduce maize prices, which
has been hiked by some 40 percent last month due to shortage of
grain in the country.

<P>
SHARM EL-SHEIKH, EGYPT, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Heads of state and
government officials of some 30 countries decides here today at
the "Summit of Peacemakers" to join efforts to promote security
and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
A final statement issued by co-chairmen of the one-day
conference Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and his U.S
counterpart Bill Clinton said that the participants of the summit
decided to promote coordinative efforts to "stop acts of terror on
bilateral, regional and international levels."
</P>
<P>
The summit held in this Egyptian Red Sea resort was swiftly
arranged after four suicide bombings in Israel in a nine-day
period since February 25. The bombings drove the Middle East
peace process to the brink of collapse.
</P>
<P>
The summit, ended with the issuance of the statement, had three
fundamental objectives: to enhance the peace process, to promote
security and to combat terrorism, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The participating countries of the summit and the U.N. will
exert maximum efforts to prevent terrorist organizations from
engaging in recruitment, supplying arms or fund raising, according
to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Joint efforts will also be made to "identify and determine the
sources of financing for these groups" so as to "cut them
off," it added.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that the participants expressed
their full support for the peace process and their determination
that the process continues in order to accomplish a just, lasting
and comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The summit strongly condemned all acts of terror, including
recent terrorist attacks in Israel, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The world leaders attending the meeting vowed to reinforce
the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, both politically and
economically, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Demand for Semiconductor Remains Dull in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The semiconductor industry of
the United States will continue to have a sluggish season, for the
orders for chips remained weak for a second month in February.
</P>
<P>
The book-to-bill ratio, a key semiconductor index, fell to 0.90
in February from 0.92 in January and 1.12 a year earlier, the
Semiconductor Industry Association said late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ratio is seasonally adjusted by the association. Using
unadjusted numbers, February's number is the lowest since November
1985, when the ratio was 0.89.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said the ratio was within the range of
expectations.
</P>
<P>
The book-to-bill ratio compares the rate of orders to that of
shipments. Thus, a ratio of 0.90 indicates that for every 100 U.S.
dollars worth of computer chips shipped, only 90 U.S. dollars worth
were ordered for future use, an indicator of declining sales.
</P>
<P>
Semiconductor orders for February rose 5.7 percent from a year
ago to 3.9 billion U.S. dollars, but were off 4.5 percent from
January. February's shipment came to 4.34 billion U.S. dollars,
jumping 31.6 percent from a year ago but down 1.8 percent from
January's level, the association said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Copper Mines To Be Privatized In Two Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba said today the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines would be
privatized within two years.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at state house here, Chiluba
said the company was the country's largest public asset and
entailed a lot of technical study and investigations before it
would be privatized.
</P>
<P>
The government would move cautiously towards the sale of the
mining company because it remained an important component of the
economy through employment opportunities and foreign exchange
earnings, Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he commended the Anglo-American Corporation (AAC)
for its continued support to Zambia's mining sector during the
process.
</P>
<P>
AAC has some 27 percent of the copper mining company's shares.
Other foreign investors are also engaged in negotiations on
purchase of the Zambian government's majority shares in the
company.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, which produced 307,558
tons of copper and 2,935 tons of cobalt last year, earns Zambia
some 90 percent of its foreign exchanges every year.

</P>
<P>
According to the Economic Commission For Africa (ECA), the
campaign will be opened by U.N. Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali and World Bank President James Wolfensohn.
</P>
<P>
ECA Executive Secretary K. Y. Amoako will host Ethiopian Prime

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Parties Demand End to "Collective Punishment" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Six Palestinian parties called
here today for an end to "collective punishment" to Palestinians
by Israel following a series of suicide bombings here and in Tel
Aviv since February 25.
</P>
<P>
"The curfew, closure and isolation imposed on the Palestinians
by Israel is a dangerous collective punishment against all
Palestinians," JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in east
Jerusalem, quoted a statement issued today by the parties as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The statement, signed by the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, the Palestinian People's Party, the National Democratic
Union, as well as the Democracy Building Movement and the
Arab Liberation Front, says that "The Palestinian people
have been suffering for over two weeks from a dangerous state of
siege and starvation."
</P>
<P>
"Through isolation, closure and arrests, the Israeli
government is trying to surround the West Bank with permanent
blockades," it adds.
</P>
<P>
The statement attributes "the root cause of the bloody
violence in this region" to the fact that "Israel still
occupies most of the Palestinian areas."
</P>
<P>
It emphasizes the fact that the Palestinian people are not
allowed to practice their rights of independence,
self-determination and return to their homeland, saying that these
rights are guaranteed by international law.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the international law, Israel should
withdraw from all the land it occupied in 1967, including
Jerusalem, the statement says.
</P>
<P>
The statement calls upon the governments of the United States,
Russia and the Arab countries, as well as the European Union to
exert pressure on the Israeli side to implement international law,
which, it says, if implemented, would guarantee a permanent peace
for the peoples of this region.
</P>
<P>
It urges the Israeli government to "stop the collective
punishment and closure policy against the Palestinians, and lift
the siege immediately."
</P>
<P>
"The negotiations on permanent status should begin immediately
on the basis of international law, it says.

PYONGYANG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Air forces of South Korea and
the United States held a joint exercise on Monday and Tuesday over
the west coast of the Korean Peninsula, Korean Central News Agency
(KCNA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
KCNA quoted well-informed sources as saying that 910 warplanes
from the South Korean air force and dozens of U.S. military
aircraft taking off from U.S. overseas bases participated in the
exercise. U.S. tankers were also involved in the exercise to
refuel the planes in mid-air.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of South Korean armored vehicles could also be seen in
Pa Ju area near the middle of the demarcation line.
</P>
<P>
The exercise was launched above the islands of Woe Yon, Teok
Jeok and Sang Duang off the west coast of the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
This is the second exercise launched by the air forces of the
two countries. A similar exercise was launched six days earlier
along the east and west coasts with more than 830 aircraft taking
part.
</P>
<P>
These exercises, said KCNA, undoubtedly increase the danger of
war breaking out in the peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Report: Threat of Nuclear Attacks Against U.S. Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States faces a
greater threat of a nuclear explosion today than during the Cold
War period because of poor security of nuclear weapons and
materials in the former Soviet Union, according to a report
released recently by Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
Graham Allison, former U.S. defense secretary and co-author of
the report, said that most of Russia's nuclear facilities are not
secure, and nuclear materials can be easily hidden or transported.
</P>
<P>
Allison told reporters that the one-year study found that there
is enough material spreading across the former Soviet Union to
make 100,000 nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Terrorists or rogue nations could fashion an effective nuclear
device if they had enough material for the core, Allison said,
adding that the technology to make a nuclear device is available
"off the shelf" in many nations, and the design for a basic
nuclear bomb has been posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The 295-page report, written by authors from Harvard Center for
Science and International Affairs at the Kennedy School of
Government, concluded that since the opening of the Berlin Wall in
1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the "likelihood
that a nuclear weapon will explode on U.S. territory...has
increased."
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, six cases of theft or illicit trafficking of
nuclear material have been uncovered, including a Russian employee
of a nuclear research facility who stole 3.7 pounds of highly
enriched uranium, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, Zhejiang Province, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Cuba beat hosts
China 86-79 in the third leg of the four-nation women's basketball
tournament here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
China, who snapped the Cubans twice in the previous two legs,
met tough challenge from the start after Cuba laid their emphasis
of defence on veteran Zheng Haixia, who stands 2.04 meters and
contributed 32 points in the game.
</P>
<P>
The two sides exchanged leads for several times until the score
tied at 25-25 12 minutes into action.
</P>
<P>
However, in the following two minutes, Cuba took the advantage
of several errors from China and build up a 34-28 lead.
</P>
<P>
China failed to level the score again and trailed 46-49 in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
Cuba maintained their momentum after the interval to lead by
the biggest margin of 10 points.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women managed to narrow the gap to two points with
precise free throw after the Cubans had seven fouls with three
minutes left.
</P>
<P>
However, China failed to take the advantage as Miao Bo missed a
shot at the crucial moment.
</P>
<P>
Chen Daohong, China's head coach, attributed the loss to the
player's poor performance in defence and rebounding.
</P>
<P>
The United States, who won the first two legs of the tournament
in Haikou and Zengcheng, brushed aside South Korea 100-71 in an
lopsided match.

DHAKA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- At least one person was killed and
50 others injured in violent clashes here today, as the
opposition-launched indefinite "non-cooperation" campaign entered
its fifth day.
</P>
<P>
Police confirmed that the unidentified person was killed in
clashes this afternoon between rival political activists in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
There were bomb blasts and gunfire as police used rubber
bullets and tear gas to try to stop the clashes, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream opposition parties led by the Awami (people's)
League began their campaign last Saturday to annul what they
called "farcical" parliamentary elections on February 15, which
were won by the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party with the
opposition parties boycotting.
</P>
<P>
The opposition also demands the resignation of the present
government led by Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia and the holding
of fresh polls under a neutral caretaker government.

Earlier on Tuesday, the opposition parties announced partial
relaxation in their campaign, allowing banks and shops to open for
two to six hours.

<P>
It is necessary for China to map out a strategic plan for
improving ethics and culture, said Ma Dayou, a member of the
Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
"It is unimaginable for people working in a socialist market
economy to have little knowledge, morality, faith and discipline,"
said Ma.
</P>
<P>
It is impossible to guide people's economic behavior if a
country lacks ethical norms or a legal system, said some scholars
present at the annual sessions of NPC and CPPCC.
</P>
<P>
A market economy is an ethical economy, and it is more
important for a socialist market economy to have high ethical
standards, they say.
</P>
<P>
By now, more and more people have come to realize that economic
development is a prerequisite for cultural prosperity, but
economic development cannot bring about a healthy, upright and
excellent modern civilization automatically.
</P>
<P>
A CPPCC member said China must put the development of ethics
and culture on the same footing as economic work. Such
development should have overall plans and requirements,
operationable policies, and laws. Necessary fund and adequate
materials are also necessary in the development of ethics and
culture, he said.
</P>
<P>
A number of NPC deputies and CPPCC members proposed enhancing
ethical education from kindergarten to university. Educational
departments at all levels and some universities should establish
research institutes on social ethics to promote the development of
excellent Chinese virtues and socialist ethics, they say.
</P>
<P>
As a Chinese saying goes," It takes ten years to grow trees,
but a hundred years to rear people." Progress in ethics and
culture concerns the overall quality of the Chinese nation and
cannot be achieved overnight. Feng Jicai, a well-known Chinese
writer, noted it is easier for a person to get rich but difficult
to get civilized.

<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The relationship between economic
growth and cultural and ethical advancement has drawn heated
discussions among participants in the annual sessions of China's
top legislature and top advisory body.
</P>
<P>
Deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) and members of
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) have every sympathy with Chinese
Premier Li Peng in his view on "never seeking temporary economic
growth at the cost of cultural and ideological progress."
</P>
<P>
While bringing encouraging news from the people to the
sessions, NPC deputies and CPPCC members reflected suggestions
and demands for the people, who are contented with the country's
rapid economic expansion over 17 years' reform and opening-up.
However, they noted, the people regard China's cultural and
ethical development as declining.
</P>
<P>
A vivid popular saying goes like this: "wallet is full-loaded
but one's head is empty."
</P>
<P>
In the course of economic development, if society is not kept
just, safe, civilized and healthy, then social ability and the
people's unity cannot be guaranteed and economic growth will be
affected eventually," said Qian Zhengying, vice-chairwoman of the
CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Many NPC deputies and CPPCC members pointed out that lack of
cultural and ethical progress could lead people to go astray and
care only for money and material enjoyment rather than other
things, and this will result possibly in corruption, collaboration
between government officials and business people, pornography,
gambling, drugging and superstitions.
</P>
<P>
They still keep in mind this warning of Deng Xiaoping's some 10
years ago that economic successes will be of no significance if
social atmosphere degenerates.
</P>
<P>
Li Chun, chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the
China Association for Promoting Democracy, remarked that China has
scored eminent economic achievements since its reform and
opening-up but ideological and cultural progress lags behind and

<HEADLINE> Britain Failing to Save Energy, Government Admits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 13 (Xinhua) - The British government admitted
Tuesday that Britain was failing to save energy and reduce
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Britons now use more energy at home and in their cars than they
did 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Car mileages have nearly doubled since 1970, but more than
twice as much fuel is being used due to traffic jams and bigger
cars with catalytic converters.
</P>
<P>
The amount of fuel consumed by the average household is the
same as in 1970 due to government-sponsored energy efficiency
campaigns in the wake of the oil crisis of the 1970s. However, the
number of households has grown so that the overall fuel
consumption by households has risen accordingly.
</P>
<P>
These findings are among 120 "indicators of sustainable
development" published by British Environment Secretary John
Gummer in an exercise spawned by the Rio Earth Summit.
</P>
<P>
While the indicators show that there have been some
environmental improvements, such as in the quality of rivers, they
also revealed the government's failure to tackle the biggest
environmental problems, such as the greenhouse effect and the
destruction of biological diversity.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that attempts to encourage energy-saving by
imposing 8 percent VAT (value-added tax) on fuel and annual real
increases of 5 percent on motor fuels did not go far enough.

PARIS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe
unveiled here today proposals for the European Union's
institutional reform ahead of the EU Inter-Governmental Conference
(IGC) on March 29.
</P>
<P>
Juppe urged the EU to be formed "at two distinct levels," a
general union for all and "at the heart of this union, an inner,
flexible, second circle, composed of a small number of states
around France and Germany, ready and willing to go further and
more quickly on such subjects as the single currency and defense."
</P>
<P>
Juppe also said the post of "super-secretary-general of the
Council of Ministers" should be created to enable the EU to speak
with one voice on defense and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the limitations of the EU's rotating
presidency will show up as the EU admits more and more members.
</P>
<P>
Juppe, as president of the ruling Rally for the Republic party,
was speaking to members of the European Democratic Union, a
grouping of conservative and Christian Democrat parties across

<HEADLINE> Iranian Official Sentenced to Imprisonment for Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A former Iranian official was
sentenced to two years' imprisonment and a fine of 13 million
U.S. dollars for receiving commission from foreign firms, a
local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian newspaper Kayhan reported that Ali Asghar Samet,
the former managing director of the government-owned Tobacco
Company, was found guilty of receiving 6.3 million dollars in
commission from foreign tobacco firms between 1986 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
Corruption is one of the most serious social problems in this
country. The Iranian parliament passed a bill on July 18, 1993,
making it illegal for government official to receive commission
from foreign firms.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, all commissions received by officials have
to be turned over to the government treasury.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the judge presiding over Samet's case as
saying that Samet had deposited the commission in his own and his
wife's accounts in foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
"With the commission received Samet was able to buy a house in
London priced at 270,000 pounds (about 420,000 dollars)," the
judge said.
</P>
<P>
A source close to Samet's family told Xinhua that the
commissions were received before the bill was passed by the
parliament in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"The law does not allow officials to punish people
retroactively," the source said.
</P>
<P>
However, the source declined to say whether Samet planned to
appeal against this setence.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Japan Agree to Set Up Regular Meeting on Economic  Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia welcomes a proposal by
Japan for a regular bilateral meeting so that there will be a
freer exchange of views and information at economics ministerial
level, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said today.
</P>
<P>
Alatas briefed members of a commission of the House of
Representatives on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Since Japan is one of Indonesia's biggest trading partners,
said Alatas, "Indonesia welcomes the proposal and would like to
follow up on its realization."
</P>
<P>
Alatas predicted that the existing bilateral ties between
Indonesia and Japan, especially in the economic field, will be
promising.
</P>
<P>
According to Alatas, bilateral trade in the past five years
reached 16 billion to 18 billion U.S. dollars annually, with
Indonesia enjoying a surplus of about six billion U.S. dollars
yearly.
</P>
<P>
Oil and gas accounted for about 45 percent of Indonesia's total
exports to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said Indonesia could improve its export of non-oil/gas
commodities to Japan in the future.
</P>
<P>
There has been an increase in the relocation of Japanese
industries to a number of developing countries including
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Japanese assistance to Indonesia reached
170.1 billion yen (1.7 billion U.S. dollars) in 1995. Japan has
about 788 projects in Indonesia.

LONDON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain's airports saw a big rise
in passenger traffic in February compared with the same month last
year in an indication of rising economic activity in the country.
</P>
<P>
Figures released Tuesday by British Airports Authorities (BAA)
showed that its seven airports handled 6.2 million passengers in
February, a 12 percent increase compared to the same month last
year.
</P>
<P>
Although about 4 percent of the increase came from the
additional day in a leap year, most airlines enjoyed significant
growth, BAA said.
</P>
<P>
British Airways, the flagship carrier, reported a rise in
passengers of more than 13 percent in February compared to the
same month in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The biggest growth in traffic last month took place on north
Atlantic routes, where the number of passengers rose by 20 percent
from a year earlier, according to BAA.
</P>
<P>
Passenger numbers on all long-haul routes out of Britain
increased by 17.5 percent, while those on routes between Britain
and other European destinations grew by 6.6 percent.

PYONGYANG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The annual "report on human

<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator today
called for administration of state affairs in accordance with law.
</P>
<P>
"Administration of state affairs in accordance with law and
building a socialist country with a well-developed legal system is
an extremely important part of China's modernization program,"
said Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), the Chinese legislature.
</P>
<P>
Qiao made the remark in a panel discussion on socialist
democracy and a socialist legal system with Sichuan deputies to
the NPC, which is in session here.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee,
urged the NPC and its standing committee to attach equal
importance to enactment of laws and supervision over the
implementation of the Constitution and other laws.
</P>
<P>
"The rule of law is of vital importance to China's
modernization program," he said.
</P>
<P>
China's senior leader Deng Xiaoping had pointed out that
establishment of a legal system is necessary to guarantee
democracy for the people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao quoted Deng as saying: it is necessary to incorporate
democracy into a system and laws, making it possible that such a
system and laws will be neither changed with a change of leaders,
nor altered with a change in the views and attention of leaders.
</P>
<P>
Qiao called on Party members and officials to be exemplary
law-abiding citizens.
</P>
<P>
"All people are equal before the law," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said law enforcement departments should improve the
quality of its workers.
</P>
<P>
He added that more legal education is needed to enhance public
awareness of law.

government started compiling employment statistics.
</P>
<P>
The number of persons employed increased 2.7 percent from 19.8

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Electronics Feared to Lose Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A notable Indonesian business
executive today warned that the country's electronic goods would
no longer be competitive on the international market by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's electronic industry is largely dependent on
imported components, whose prices are heavily influenced by the
global financial conditions, said Chairman of the Indonesian
Electronic Industry Association Uripto Widjaya.
</P>
<P>
He cited the appreciation of the Japanese yen against the US
dollar as an example that has raised the prices of components
imported from Japan.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Indonesia imports some 30 percent of its electronic
components from Japan and the remainder from Thailand, Taiwan and
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The association urged the Ministry of Industry and Trade to
speed up the development of the component industry in Indonesia by
first establishing a bonded zone specially for the electronics
industry.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia expects the electronics industry to become one of its
largest earners of foreign exchange in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The country's electronic goods exports consist mainly of TV
sets, radio and video cassette recorders and car audio equipment.
</P>
<P>
According to data from the Ministry of Industry and Trade,
Indonesia's exports of electronic goods reached 2.9 billion US
dollars last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
Lu Fuyuan, vice-minister of machine building industry,
acknowledged that the key role for attaining China's goals in
automobile production lies in the enhancement of the competitive
edge of its automotive production groups. The country's
automotive industry should strive to explore both domestic and
world markets by forming large conglomerates, he added.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about three million cars will be in demand
by the year 2000, and that such demand can reach five to six
million by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Any commodities will unlikely occupy a large share of market if
they cannot enter into families, according to famed industrialists
and experts in automotive industry, who called for government's
attention for the development of the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Automotive industry can be a backbone industry only because it
has private buyers, said Cai Shiqing, who also urged the state to
encourage individual car buyers.
</P>
<P>
Lu Fuyuan said China's automobile industry should be geared to
the international market. He promised that the central government
will give policy support to help build a complete domestic market
and encourage individuals to buy cars.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase in the number of private cars will surely
result in some problems including parking lot shortage, traffic
congestions and environment pollution, a common concern in China.
</P>
<P>
Such worries will be cleared along with the rise in the number
of private buyers, said Cai Shiqing, adding that the progress of
automative industry will promote road construction and traffic
administration improvement. He also voiced his disagreement with
the measures taken by some areas such as Beijing and Shanghai to
limit the development of economical-type cars.
</P>
<P>
The China No. 1 Automotive Group Co. and Dongfeng Automotive
Plant will increase their annual automobile production capacity to
700,000 motor vehicles each in the next five years with 300,000
sedans each, official sources said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China has 22 percent of the
world's population but produces only 2.5 percent of the world's
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
This is a stark reality. However, deputies present at the
on-going session of the National People's Congress (NPC) do not
sign in despair as before.
</P>
<P>
China is resolved to turn the manufacture of automobiles into a
backbone industry in the next 15 years as described in the outline
of the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
According to the outline, China is expected to turn out 2.7
million automobiles, which can meet over 90 percent of the
domestic demand by the year 2000. To attain the target, it will
concentrate on the development of auto parts and components,
economical-type cars and heavy-duty trucks. Two to three
auto-making enterprise groups will be patronized by the state to
form conglomerates with an annual production capacities of over
400,000 cars each.
</P>
<P>
Geng Zhaojie, president of the No. 1 Automative Group Co. said,
the automative industry must make up three to nine percent of the
gross national product (GNP) if the industry becomes a backbone
sector. However, he added, China turned out only 1.47 million
motor vehicles in 1995, less than one percent of the GNP.
</P>
<P>
Geng cited several factors as required for a backbone industry,
namely, sedan cars must be a chief product, private cars dominate
the consumption and an independent industrial system must be
established.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the annual production capacity must come up to one
million cars with 10 billion US dollars in annual sales volume. An
ability for independent car development is also a must, he said.
</P>
<P>
As the largest automobile-producing plant, the China No. 1
Automative Group Co. produced 200,000 automobiles last years with
18.5 billion yuan (about two billion US dollars) in sales volume.
The Dongfeng Autotomative Plant, the second largest car-making
enterprise, produced 180,000 automobiles last year, sources noted.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China boasted 165 automotive plants engaged in
production of assembled cars, which is meant that each plant
produced a little over 8,000 automobiles on average.
</P>
<P>
Both Geng Zhaojie and Cai Shiqing, president of the China
National Automobile Industry Co., share a view that China's
automotive industry must work hard to attain scale production, so
as to avoid overlapping in importation, construction and
investment and improve economic efficiency.

<HEADLINE> Ankara to Host International Conference on Arming Moslem-Croat Federation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A controversial international
conference on Washington's plans to arm the Croat-Moslem
federation will be held in Ankara Friday, Turkey's Foreign
Ministry announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Nurettin Nurkan, the deputy spokesman for the Foreign Ministry,
told a weekly press conference that Gulf states, members of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) as well as some
Western countries would send deputy-minister-level officials to
the conference.
</P>
<P>
But reports from Brussels say that European Union states,
feuding with the U.S. over its plans to arm the Croats and Moslems
in Bosnia, will only attend the meeting as observers.
</P>
<P>
Nurkan claimed the conference was aimed at establishing a
military balance between the parties in Bosnia by arming the
relatively weak Croat-Moslem federation for a long-term stability
in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said last week
in Palermo, Sicily that it was not right to "undermine arms
control by rearmament."
</P>
<P>
On monday, Washington announced it would provide some 100
million U.S. dollars to help the Croat-Moslem federation in
Bosnia build an army able to match the Bosnian Serbs.

<HEADLINE> China's Development Plan Provides Opportunities for Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China's long-term development
plan will provide opportunities for economic growth in Macao even
though the plan does not cover the territory, according to Wang
Qiren, director of Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch.
</P>
<P>
"Businesses in the Chinese mainland can enter the international
market through Macao, entrepreneurs in Macao can invest in the
mainland, and entrepreneurs of both sides can join hands in
developing the world market," Wang said in an interview today.
</P>
<P>
Wang was here attending the annual session of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, which concluded today.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the mainland can engage in entrepot trade with Macao.
</P>
<P>
Since Macao has a developed tourist industry, its tour
operators can launch high-grade tourist projects in the Pearl
River Delta area in cooperation with local businesses, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Macao can also take advantage of the mainland's expected
economic take-off by serving as a free port and an independent
tariff zone.
</P>
<P>
"It can serve as one of China's important gateways to the rest
of the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
With the efforts of compatriots in Macao, and taking
advantage of the mainland's economic development plan for the
next 15 years, Macao can achieve prosperity in the transitional
period before its return to the motherland, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> New Wheat Planting Technique Contributes to Production Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A new wheat planting technique
has been developed in northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
The method involves planting the grain in deep furrows to help
seeds survive icy cold winters, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The province has seen a large scale increase in its wheat
production in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Experts reported that when the wheat is planted into
12-to-15-cms-deep furrow, much less dies during cold winter, since
the furrows can resist cold wind.
</P>
<P>
An intensive fertilization method is also used to reduce salt,
alkali and loss of fertilizers in the soil.
</P>
<P>
Experts also said that the technique can be used in dry,
salinized and infertile land, which can raise wheat output by at
least 750 kg per hectare.
</P>
<P>
The technique also adapts to other cereal grains and cash
crops, especially to those that have to survive winter months,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The technique was used on 112,200 hectares of wheat and rape
crops last year in Qingyang Prefecture of the province. It raised
output of wheat and rapeseed by 24 percent.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Meets World Health Targets -- Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is one of the 62
countries which have met some of the World Health Organization
(WHO) major targets of health set for the year 2000, Health
Minister Chua Jui Meng said here today.
</P>
<P>
When closing the Swedish Healthcare System Symposium and
Exhibition here, Chua said: "We have achieved the infant mortality
target, mortality of children under five years old and the life
expectancy target as early as in 1992."
</P>
<P>
Chua said Malaysia's infant mortality rate in 1992 was 12
deaths per thousand births compared to WHO's target of a maximum
of 50 deaths per thousand births.
</P>
<P>
Another achievement is that by the same year, Malaysia had
brought down the mortality rate for children under five years to
19 per thousand births, compared to WHO's target of 70 per
thousand births set for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In terms of life expectancy, Chua said, Malaysia had recorded
an average of 72 years by 1995.
</P>
<P>
"With our improved economic and living conditions, better
medical and health technology, our national longevity for both
males and females is increasing," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that by the end of the century, the number of
people aged 65 and above will be 4.18 percent, and by the year
2000, the Malaysian age group above 65 will reach 7.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Solar Radiation Doubles in Britain as Ozone Depleting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Solar radiation doubled on the
ground in Britain because of the record level of ozone depletion
over Europe this spring.
</P>
<P>
Ultraviolet rays have been recorded at a dramatically
higher-than-normal level for the first time in Britain, following
last week's disclosure that the ozone layer over Britain suffered
the worst damage on record.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the British National Radiological Protection
Board, the Government's radiation adviser, found that ultraviolet
readings in Cornwall and Glasgow in March were twice their normal
level for that time of the year. In Leeds, the readings were about
50 percent higher than normal.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said the higher levels were not likely to be
dangerous but were strong evidence of the further depletion of the
ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
In large doses, ultraviolet radiation can cause skin cancer and
damage crops and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Professor Roger Clarke, director of the board, said: "These
increased levels are typically half of the normal peak ultraviolet
levels experienced during high summer and are not considered a
significant health hazard since they are short term and only
contribute a very small amount to the annual dose."

<HEADLINE> Historic Northwest Chinese City Protecting Cultural Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Hanzhong, in northwest China's
Shaanxi Province, had projects for protecting five major cultural
sites in 1995.
</P>
<P>
One was to restore some 360 m of a plank road built on the
surface of cliffs, which connected Shaanxi with neighboring
Sichuan Province as early as in the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC).
</P>
<P>
The road is regarded as China's third architectural wonder, the
other two being the Great Wall and the Grand Canal.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, the city repaired the Wangjianglou, a
building which was started in the Southern Song Dynasty
(1127-1279) and is located in the center of the city.
</P>
<P>
Hanzhong also refurbished the altar where the first emperor of
the Western Han (206 BC-25 AD) held a ceremony for a general who
later helped him in establishing the dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Boards with protecting signs have been put up at an ancient
bridge in the city and at the home of Bao Si, a famous beauty in
the Western Zhou Dynasty who was loved by the dynasty's last
emperor. Records say that she rarely smiled and the emperor
offered a reward of some 30 kg of gold to whoever could make her
laugh.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Court Freezes Former President Roh's Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul District Court today
froze the assets of former president Roh Tae-woo as a prelude to
their forfeiture.
</P>
<P>
The move came in response to a prosecution request for the
execution of last December's court order for the preservation of
Roh's assets for forfeiture.
</P>
<P>
The court said that it had accepted the prosecution request
because the bribes Roh received could not themselves be forfeited
as the money had been used to acquire financial assets and real
estate.
</P>
<P>
Roh's frozen assets are valued at 360 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He is alleged to have received bribes totaling 370 million
dollars from businessmen during his 1988-1993 presidency.
</P>
<P>
Roh was arrested on November 16 last year on graft charges.

<HEADLINE> EU Concerned About Russia's Restrictions on EU Vodka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Commission of the European
Union (EU) expressed deep concern today about Russian restrictions
on vodka imports from the EU.
</P>
<P>
Moscow announced Tuesday that starting today, each liter of
vodka imported from the EU should be priced a minimum of 8.2
U.S. dollars, whereas vodka imported from the Commonwealth of
Independent States will be sold at only 3.8 dollars per liter.
</P>
<P>
The EU called the Russian action "a great surprise" and
considered the measures "not compatible" with the interim
agreement between Russia and the EU, which took effect on February
1 this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the interim agreement, prior consultations are
required before such measures are introduced.
</P>
<P>
An EU spokesman said today that the measures were also
"counterproductive with regard to the quest for Russian membership
of the World Trade Organization."
</P>
<P>
He added: "The move also sends out a negative signal to foreign
investors who are already cautious about investing in Russia."
</P>
<P>
EU Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek would discuss this and
similar problems with Russian authorities during his visit to
Moscow from March 18 to 19, said the spokesman.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China will make greater efforts
at prospecting and developing mineral resources in the central and
western parts of the country to help boost economic development
there.
</P>
<P>
Song Ruixiang, minister of geology and mineral resources, made
known the new strategy at a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, his ministry will increase resources
exploration-development projects in central and western China, and
grant exploration-development rights to project investors, Song
said.
</P>
<P>
Key areas where the new strategy applies include resource-rich
areas in southwest China, northwest China, along the southern
section of the Beijing-Kowloon Railway, and along the central and
western sections of the Eurasian Continental Bridge, which runs
from Lianyungang Port on China's east coast to Rotterdam, the
Netherlands, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources has worked out a
plan for resources exploration and exploitation in an especially
resource-rich area in southwest China's Yunnan province, called
the Three-River Area.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, 3-5 big or super-big mines
will be developed in the next five years, making the area a new
supply base for industrial raw materials and a production base for
mineral exports.

<HEADLINE> Chubb Group Sets Up Third Office in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The US's Chubb Group of Insurance
Companies announced here today that it has set up an office in
Shenzhen in south China's Guangdong Province recently.
</P>
<P>
The company got approval from the People's Bank of China, said
Ian Lancaster, Chubb's general manager in China.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen office is the third to be established by Chubb in
China, after the company's headquarters were set up in Beijing in
1994, and a second office set up in Shanghai last October.
</P>
<P>
As one of China's special economic zones, Shenzhen has had
speedy development in its industry and commerce and is a lucrative
market for overseas investors, Lancaster pointed out, something
that encouraged Chubb to open an office there.
</P>
<P>
The office will continue activities and market research already
underway in Beijing and Shanghai, including in-depth studies of
China's earthquake preparedness and construction codes, an
extensive study of the country's power industry, further training
and consulting with the People's Insurance Company of China and
other Chinese insurance companies, and seminars with insurance
officials and executives throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
Chubb is managed by Chubb &AMP; Son Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Chubb Corporation. It provides property and casualty
insurance and has branches and affiliates throughout North
America, Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific Region. Its
property is worth a total of 20 billion US dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's gross domestic
product (GDP) shrank progressively in the last three quarters of
1995, signaling a possible recession, according to official
statistics released today.
</P>
<P>
The GDP dropped by 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter, following
decreases of 0.1 percent and 0.5 percent in the second and third
quarters, the statistics showed. Total GDP growth for 1995 was
only 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the Swiss economy is on the edge of a recession
since by the European definition, recession occurs when negative
growth is registered for four consecutive quarters.
</P>
<P>
Economists also attributed the GDP's negative growth mainly to
sluggish private consumption which dropped by 0.9 percent in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Swiss consumers face increasing unemployment,
falling real incomes and uncertainty about the future.

<HEADLINE> UUP Leader Urges Loyalist Armed Groups Not to Retaliate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- David Trimble, leader of Northern
Ireland's largest Protestant political organization, today urged
Protestant loyalist paramilitary groups not to retaliate against
the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC TV today, Trimble, head of the Ulster
Unionist Party (UUP), appealed to the loyalist paramilitaries not
to be provoked by the IRA into embarking on a new campaign of
violence.
</P>
<P>
Trimble also said that current preparatory discussions on the
planned all-party negotiations on Northern Ireland's future had
focused on form rather than substance.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that arms decommissioning -- strongly opposed by
the IRA -- would have to top the agenda when all-party talks start
on June 10.
</P>
<P>
He also promised that during his forthcoming trip to the United
States, he would ask President Bill Clinton to prohibit
fundraising in the U.S. by Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing,
and possibly even Sinn Fein's access to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC), which groups two
main loyalist paramilitary groups, the Ulster Volunteer Force and
the Ulster Freedom Fighters, on Tuesday night called on the IRA to
"draw back from the brink".
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the loyalist armed groups would retaliate to each
bombing "blow for blow," the CLMC warned in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Protestant loyalist armed groups announced their ceasefire
on October 13, 1994, following the IRA's ceasefire. Although the
IRA broke its truce with a bomb attack in east London on February
9, the loyalist armed groups have maintained their ceasefire.

WUHAN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A German woman, who has taught in
the Wuhan Foreign Languages School for four years, said recently
that her deepest impression of the city is it has become "greener".
</P>
<P>
She said that she likes to run on the tree-shaded road on the
bank of the Yangtze River, as it reminds her of her home town --
Hamburg on the Rhine.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, the city government has had a "green" campaign to
motivate people to beautify the city. In five years, the city has
planted about two million trees and public green space per capita
has increased by 4.78 sq m.
</P>
<P>
The city has also afforested about 18,700 hectares of suburban
hills, and planted deciduous and evergreen trees along 60 new
roads, said an official in charge of the city's horticulture.
</P>
<P>
Large enterprises have also placed much importance on the
city's environment. Last year the Wuhan Steel Plant invested over
one million yuan (about 120,000 US dollars) in building 100,000
square meters of lawns.
</P>
<P>
Vice-mayor Yin Zengtao said that Wuhan is paying even greater
attention to planting trees in and around the city to turn it into
a garden city.

<HEADLINE> More Tourists Visit HK In Chinese New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Hotel occupancy figures in Hong
Kong showed considerable rises during the 10-day Chinese Lunar New
Year period, a traditional quiet time for tourism.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA), the
occupancy rate for top luxury properties during the 1996 Spring
Festival period was 47.5 percent, compared with 39.5 percent in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Four or five-star hotels saw 68.4 percent of their rooms
occupied during the Lunar New Year period, 49.1 percent up from
last year.
</P>
<P>
The HKTA attributed the gains to the success of two activities
staged during the Chinese New Year -- a parade of floats and a
fortune-telling fair.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that some 50,000 spectators watched the
two-hour parade of 19 floats and many entertainers on the first
day of the Year of the Rat, while 6,000 people visited the Wheel
of Fortune Fair.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese New Year period used to be the slack season for
Hong Kong's tourism, the second biggest foreign exchange earner in
the territory.

<HEADLINE> Kipketer to Have Difficulty Before Running for Denmark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's National Olympic
Committee (KNOC) will not permit 800 meters world champion Wilson
Kipketer to run for Denmark at the Atlanta Olympic Games, a senior
executive said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot give any authority since the rules in the Olympic
Charter are very clear, and we cannot divert from the rules
because we will be setting a bad precedent," said KNOC Chairman
Charles Mukora.
</P>
<P>
Under International Olympic Committee (IOC) rules, only full
citizens may compete for their country in the Games.
</P>
<P>
That meant if Kipketer wants to run in Atlanta in July, he must
be granted citizenship by the Danish parliament or run for Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Kipketer has previously said he wanted to give Denmark an
Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
David Okeyo, secretary-general of the Kenya Amateur Athletic
Association (KAAA) said Kipketer had to attend Kenya's Olympic
trials for a place at the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
But Okeyo added that the KAAA had no objections to Kipketer
running for Denmark if he fulfilled all selection criteria.
</P>
<P>
Denmark's top athletic official said on Tuesday he would
appeal to his government to grant Kipketer full citizenship in
time for the Olympic Games next July.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to promote
cooperation with foreign investors in exploiting crude oil, gas
and mineral resources, Minister of Geology and Mineral Resources
Song Ruixiang said here today.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, China conducted extensive cooperation
with nearly 100 foreign firms relating to the mining of mineral
resources, oil and gas exploitation, Song said at a press
conference held during the annual sessions of the National
People's Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1995, foreign oil and gas firms invested more
than three billion US dollars in marine oil prospection in China.
Sino-foreign cooperation in land oil prospection is going on in 21
provinces and autonomous regions across the country, according to
Song.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a number of foreign mining companies have signed
agreements with China on the exploitation of mineral and other
solid nonmetallic mineral ores in Sichuan, Hebei, Yunnan and
Guizhou provinces, and coal gas in the northern part of Shaanxi
Province, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Hongren, vice-minister of geology and
mineral resources, Chinese enterprises are engaged in exploitation
of mineral resources abroad, such as items concerning the
cooperative-mining of iron ores in Australia and Peru, while they
are attracting foreign funds in the sector within China.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain has reached an agreement
with Germany and France to join in the production of a new
multi-role armored vehicle (MRAV), it was reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, which comes after months of negotiations,
arms manufacturers from the three countries will work together to
submit plans for the MRAV, which is expected to start rolling off
the production line some time after the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
France and Germany had drawn up bidding documents beforehand,
but it was believed that Britain had managed to include a
provision which allowed the competing companies, notably British
ones, a greater say in how the vehicle was to be designed.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was hailed by German defense officials as a
significant step toward closer cooperation between the arms
industries of the three countries and would pave the way for
Britain's entry into a Franco-German arms procurement agency.
</P>
<P>
The agency, established at the last Franco-German summit in
December, was conceived as part of an effort to compete more
effectively with the much bigger defense industry in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Italy and other European countries reportedly are watching the
agency closely with a view to joining it in the future. Germany
and France have also privately expressed the hope that it will
develop into a fully-fledged European procurement agency.

HANOI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's army paper today
criticized the U.S. Helms-Burton Bill against Cuba as "an outmoded
decision" and a clumsy ploy of Washington in international
relations.
</P>
<P>
A commentary in the People's Army said that the bill "mirrors
the ugly image of the United States in the contemporary
international life."
</P>
<P>
The bill "ignores the most fundamental principles of
international law and holds in contempt the interests of other
countries, and runs counter to the world trend of peace and
dialogue," the commentary added.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton Bill, signed by U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Tuesday, tightened sanctions on Cuba for its shooting down of two
American civilian airplanes last month.
</P>
<P>
The paper pointed out that the bill is not only one for embargo
against a country whose political system does not cater to the
United States, but is also meant for imposing U.S. laws upon
another nation.
</P>
<P>
Describing the bill as "a very dangerous precedent," the
commentary denounced it for "befouling the climate for
international cooperation based on equality and mutual respect for
sovereignty and independence."

<HEADLINE> Manila Identifies 35 Priority Areas for Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today approved 35 priority areas for investments this year,
including exports, rice and corn production and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Secretary Rizalino Navarro said the 1996
Investment Priorities Plan (IPP) supports the government's goal of
helping local industries achieve global competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The IPP's centerpiece is the export sector, as was envisaged in
the plan last year.
</P>
<P>
Other priority sectors include the manufacture of fine jewelry,
composite boards, processed food, drugs and medicines, cement,
shipbuilding and textiles.
</P>
<P>
The IPP, drawn up by an inter-agency committee led by the Board
of Investments (BOI), encourages the dispersal of industries into
the countryside.
</P>
<P>
The government will also give incentives to the production of
rice and corn as well as the processing of livestock and poultry
in a bid to attain self-sufficiency in food supply.
</P>
<P>
Navarro said the numerous incentives provided by the plan were
expected to draw up to 380 billion pesos (15.2 billion US dollars)
in investments this year, of which 80 percent would come from
small and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The BOI approved investments of about 323 billion pesos (12.92
billion US dollars) last year, compared with 455 billion pesos
(18.2 billion US dollars) in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The fall is attributed to the fewer capital-intensive power
projects in 1995.

XI'AN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Shaanxi Province,
which has the largest number of historical sites under state
protection in China, has devised a conservation plan for cultural
relics over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The province was the capital of some 13 dynasties throughout
history and has 37 sites under state protection and 372 under
provincial protection.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996-2000 period, Shaanxi will focus on conservation
work at large historical sites, such as the capital ruins of the
Western Zhou (11th Century-771 BC) and Western Han (206 BC-25 AD)
dynasties, the imperial palace remains of Qin (221-206 BC) and
Tang (618-907) dynasties, and Han and Tang imperial tombs.
</P>
<P>
The province will either build new museums or expand existing
ones, including the famous terra-cotta warriors and horses museum.
</P>
<P>
There will be exploratory work for tombs of the emperors of the
Western Zhou, the first emperor of the Qin, and China's first
empress of the Tang Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Construction of Sino-Italian and Sino-German joint cultural
relics conservation centers and a Sino-Japanese joint project on
conservation of the Daming Palace of the Tang Dynasty are expected
to be completed during the period.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Create Three Big Export Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Three large export groups engaged
in industry, science and technology are to be created in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The groups will be backed by large enterprises, such as the
industrial group, headed by the Capital Iron and Steel
Corporation, says the capital's Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The capital used to have special foreign trade companies, which
were authorized by the government to deal in exports and
imports. But they were slow at responding to market changes.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period, production enterprises, and joint
ventures, were also granted privileges to deal in exports and
imports. And the total export value during this period went up by
200 million US dollars from the 1986-1990 period.
</P>
<P>
One of the enterprises is the Capital Iron and Steel
Corporation, which provided 18 percent of the capital's total
financial income.
</P>
<P>
The scientific and technological group is backed by the Capital
Science and Technology Group, established last year, which
includes 48 scientific research institutes. It is a move by the
capital to speed up the development of high-tech industry.

<HEADLINE> Long Distance from Oceans Causes Aridity in Taklimakan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China's Taklimakan Desert has been
described as one of the driest places on earth.
</P>
<P>
 Now scientists have explained why the desert is so arid --
nature has conspired to shield it from monsoon rains by distance
and a curtain of surrounding mountains.
</P>
<P>
 New observations prove that the desert's long distance from
oceans, which has a marked impact on land climate, has caused
aridity in Taklimakan Desert, the world's second largest wandering
desert located in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
Scientists with the China Academy of Sciences (CAS) proved that
the major cause of the aridity in Taklimakan is that monsoon vapor
cannot reach the place due to the long distance from oceans, as
well as a shield of high mountains.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Taklimakan's hinterland, the world's
farthest desert in distance from the oceans, is 3,800 km from the
Pacific Ocean, 6,500 km from the Atlantic, 3,900 km from the
Arctic and 1,900 km from the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the Pamirs and the Tianshan Mountain
enclose the Taklimakan, barricading ocean monsoons from entering
the desert. As a result, Taklimakan is one of the driest places in
the world compared with other places at the same latitude.
</P>
<P>
Observations show that only a little amount of vapor from the
Arctic and the Atlantic can enter the Taklimakan by passing the
Tianshan Mountain and the Pamirs, while vapor from the Pacific and
the Indian Ocean can hardly pass the barricade of the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
However, Kirghizstan, situated to the west of the Pamirs and
Tianshan Mountain which can meet ocean monsoons, receives twice
the amount of vapor of that in Xinjiang, which lies to the east of
the Pamirs and Tianshan. The annual rainfall in Kirghizstan is
more than seven times the figure for Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau blocks vapor from the Pacific and the
Indian Ocean , which results in hot summers and cold winters
inside the Taklimakan, making the Taklimakan even drier.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Benefited from Foreign Know-How </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Foreign know-how is helping
promote the economic development of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of more foreign experts has become an
unswerving policy of the region, a local official told Xinhua
recently.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, Guangxi has approved more than 200 programs
in which foreign experts have been employed.
</P>
<P>
A total of 135 programs are now operational, with more than 510
foreign experts employed. The experts have played a significant
role in promoting the development of Guangxi's economy, science
and education.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Guangxi is now seriously short of
technical personnel, especially people of high-quality. Statistics
show that there are only 151.32 technical personnel above
polytechnic school level per 10,000 people, 10 percentage points
lower than the average national standard.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that employing more foreign experts has
become an important way to shorten the gap between Guangxi's and
the world's advanced technical levels.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi has sent a great number of high-ranking officials and
technical personnel abroad to gain experience and study advanced
foreign techniques as a way of serving the region's economic
development.

<HEADLINE> Human Activities Blamed for Desertification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Human activity has been blamed for
the spread of deserts, a leading Chinese scientist has concluded.
</P>
<P>
After studies lasting several years, scientist Jing Ai, has
dispelled the traditional notion that nature is solely to blame
for desertification.
</P>
<P>
Instead it is the impact on nature brought about by human
activities.
</P>
<P>
Jing Ai, a historian and archaeologist, started his
observations and studies at the beginning of the 1970s and charted
the historical progress of desert covering sandy land in the
northeastern part of Inner Mongolia, and the northern part of
north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
He also investigated deserts around Yinshan Mountain and in the
western desert areas of Inner Mongolia, as well as in ancient
reclamation areas in the Gansu Corridor, and at the edge of the
Taklimakan Desert in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Based on his studies and archaeological materials, Jing has
completed a book on the causes of desertification in north China
and the solutions. The book is scheduled to be published this
month.
</P>
<P>
Jing attributed the worsening of China's desertification to
damage to the land by people.
</P>
<P>
Noting there are similar situations in other countries and
regions, he said, before solving the problem, people should learn
from historical lessons that desertification is a result of the
impact on nature brought about by human activities, while not that
desertification is decided by nature.
</P>
<P>
Professor Zhu Zhenda, also an expert on desert studies, said
that Jing's conclusion is of practical significance to the
prevention of desertification.
</P>
<P>
Surveys show that from the mid 1950s to the mid 1970s, an
annual amount of 1,560 square kilometers of desert was added to
China's territory. In the decade starting from the mid 1970s, the
figure was about 2,100.
</P>
<P>
From the mid 1980s to the end of this century, the average
figure in this regard is expected to reach 2,370 sq-km.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Hold 2nd Interior Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Second International
Interior Fair organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council
(TDC) and international trade fair organizer Messe Frankfurt will
be held here from March 19 to 21.
</P>
<P>
Entitled as "Interior - International Trade Fair for Interior
Furnishings and Contract Business", the fair aims to assist
architecture and construction companies and those trading in
fixtures and fittings to tap into Asia's burgeoning interior
furnishings and contract business.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference today, Patrick Wong, TDC's deputy senior
manager of the fair, said that rising affluence of people in East
Asia fuels the desire for good quality living conditions, thus
leading to strong market demand for all kinds of interior
furnishing products and services.
</P>
<P>
Wong said that along with East Asia's economic growth, China
is making greater progress. It is forecast that more than 2,000
hotels will be constructed in China over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
He said that in 1995, Hong Kong imported 42 billion HK dollar
(5.38 billion US dollar) worth of interior furnishing products, up
11 percent over 1994.  Re-exports to China rose 22 percent to
10.8 billion HK dollars (1.38 billion US dollars) last year,
underlining the importance of Hong Kong as an entrepot for trade
to China, he continued.
</P>
<P>
Arthur Spurdle, Messe Frankfurt (HK) Ltd. managing director,
said the annual interior fair is a platform for business partners
around the world, and this year, it has attracted nearly 200
exhibitors from over 20 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of traders, especially those from Asia, are expected
to attend the event, he said.
</P>
<P>
A series of market seminars featuring speakers from China,
Hong Kong, Taiwan and Spain will be arranged on the second day of
the fair. The speakers will give their views on the interior
industry and cover topics on potential growth of the interior
decoration industry worldwide.

<P>
MANILA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Negligence charges have been
dropped against 14 former Philippine officials who were forced to
resign after the execution of a Filipino maid, Contemplacion, in
Singapore last year, an official report said today.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Ombudsman Aniano Desierto dismissed the charges
against former foreign secretary Roberto Romulo, former labor
secretary Nieves Confessor and 12 other officials on the
recommendation of a three-member investigation panel.
</P>
<P>
Contemplacion was executed in Singapore on charges of murdering
another Filipino maid, Maga, and a Singapore boy under Maga's
care, which led to a chill in the relations between the
Philippines and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The 14 Philippine officials were forced to resign after being
charged with negligence in dealing with the case by the Cancayco
Commission, a presidential fact-finding body formed to probe the
Contemplacion tragedy.
</P>
<P>
The ombudsman panel said the Cancayco Commission had failed to
prove any "gross and inexcusable negligence" on the 14 Filipino
officials.

<HEADLINE> HK Dog Owners Face Quick Evictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, MARCH 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's public housing
estate tenants with dog could be evicted after only one warning in
the near future, following last week's fatal attack on a baby.
</P>
<P>
The move is one of the measures the Housing Department is
considering to take in enforcing its ban on dogs.
</P>
<P>
A Department spokesman said it was considering more eviction
notices, increased foot patrols and warning letters to residents.
</P>
<P>
The current procedure is that two verbal warnings and a written
warning are served before eviction is threatened.
</P>
<P>
"We're now looking at shortening this procedure. It could go
from three to two warnings or even three to one," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Seven-month-old Yuen Wing-sum was mauled to death by her family
dog in Fung Tak Estate, Wong Tai Sin Friday.
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said they had complained to the Department and warned
her parents about the two pit bull terriers "for years".
</P>
<P>
The department said it has issued two warnings to the family
and the dogs had not been seen when officers visited the flat
later.
</P>
<P>
The dogs were taken away from the flat by the Department staff
after the incident.
</P>
<P>
But there is concern that harsher measures will increase
strays. The owners might just abandon the dogs leaving even more
congregate outside the estates and cause more threat to the
public.
</P>
<P>
The Department said 992 stray dogs were caught on the estates
from April 1994 to December last year. During the period, 2,280
families got rid of their dogs after warnings and two families
failed to do so were evicted.

<HEADLINE> Deadlock Broken for HK Newspaper Price War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The deadlock of the price war
for Hong Kong's Chinese-language newspapers was broken Tuesday as
the Oriental Daily News announced a price rise from two HK dollars
to three.
</P>
<P>
The move opens the way for two other newspapers remaining at
the lower price, Hong Kong Daily News and Sing Pao, to rise.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper war began four months ago when the Oriental Daily
News put the newspapers at war by dropping the price to just two
HK dollars from the uniform price of five.
</P>
<P>
The mass-market Oriental Daily News, owned by the Oriental
Press Group, said its price would rise by one HK dollar and its
magazine stablemate, Eastweek, would increase from eight HK
dollars to 10. A shortage of coins in circulation and problems
for hawkers handling change were what the newspaper picked up as
the reason for the price change.
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman of the Hong Kong Monetary Authorities, which is
in charge of the coin supply, denied the claim. "We're not aware
of any shortage of coins," he said. There were 652 million
one-HK-dollar coins and 435 million two-HK-dollars coins
circulating at the end of February, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Daily News was reported to be considering a price
rise. Sing Pao did not have any plan for price change, at least
now.
</P>
<P>
A member of the Newspaper Society committee, which has been
holding talks to end the discounting, said it would still be a few
more months before prices rose to four or five HK dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 13 (Xinhua)-- A group of suspected Sea Tigers
swooped on a flotilla of fishing craft near Mannar in north Sri
Lanka Tuesday and seized several boats and more than a dozen
outboard motors, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place late last night in the sea off
Seelawature, which is south of Mannar.
</P>
<P>
There were 20 fishermen in 13 fiber-glass boats. All boats were
fitted with outboard engines. The loss to the fishermen is
estimated to be more than 40,000 US dollars, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen were reportedly confronted by an armed gang of
three men in a boat. The gang robbed the fishermen of three boats,
13 outboard motors and 24 fishing nets.
</P>
<P>
The reports added that it is suspected that this was the work
of Sea Tigers from a Tamil rebel camp at Seelawature in the north
of the country.
</P>
<P>
On an earlier occasion, fishermen lost 30 fishing boats in this
manner to the Tiger rebels. The fishermen had been warned to
refrain from fishing in this area.
</P>
<P>
Security sources here feel that last night's incident was a
move by the rebels to replenish its fleet of boats after recent
losses to the navy.

<HEADLINE> Pavilion Completed to Commemorate HK Hero Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The construction of a wooden
pavilion has been completed at a hilltop to commemorate two
secondary school teachers who died when rescuing their students
off a killer hill fire which took place last month.
</P>
<P>
An unveiling ceremony for the pavilion, which is located at Tai
Mei Tuk, Tai Po, four kilometers from the hill fire site, was held
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The teachers perished together with two students at the
horrific incident at a steep section of the Pat Sin Range.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 50 students escaped the fire without injuries,
while 11 had to be hospitalized. One girl died 10 days later and
two students have been released so far. Seven including the
miracle survivor Lee Chun-man, are still in the Prince of Wales
Hospital but are out of danger.
</P>
<P>
The name of "Spring Breeze Memorial Pavilion" was taken from a
Chinese idiom used to signify the influence of teachers on
students - "soft and effective as a spring breeze".
</P>
<P>
The pavilion cost 50,000 HK dollars (6,426 US dollars) and
building staff spent 20 days including weekends and Sundays to
complete the pavilion.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military on Full Alert in Irian Jaya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The military is on full alert
following three-day riots since Sunday in and around the
US-controlled Freeport mines in the jungles of Indonesia's Irian
Jaya, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The copper town of Timika is beset with damage inflicted on the
town's airport and facilities owned by PT Freeport Indonesia, the
giant American mining company.
</P>
<P>
Military sources in Jayapura quoted by Antara said three
Freeport employees were badly injured and 12 others sustained
light injuries in the clashes. So far, seven people have been
arrested by the police in connection with the riots.
</P>
<P>
The riots originated in rumors that a local resident had been
killed after he was hit by a Freeport car in a road accident last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Then thousands of residents, armed with axes, bows and arrows,
rampaged through Timika and other towns and Freeport offices. The
protesters clashed with soldiers who tried to disperse them. Some
soldiers were seen firing warning shots, according to reports
quoting some witnesses.
</P>
<P>
The airport was closed Tuesday and would only be opened when
the situation returned to normal.
</P>
<P>
The military in Jakarta played down the incident, saying that
the military commander in Irian Jaya was handling the situation.
</P>
<P>
Armed Forces Chief of General Affairs Lt. Gen. Soeyono
confirmed that Maj. Gen. Dunidja of the Eighth Trikora Command of
the armed forces has full authority in deciding what course to
take in handling the riots.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that many local Irian people harbor resentment
against Freeport.

<HEADLINE> Number of Visitors to Macao Drops in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of visitors to Macao in
1995 dropped one percent from that of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Macao Statistics and Census Department
show that the total number of passengers coming to Macao via sea,
air and land ports reached 7,752,495 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Although the general figures dropped, the number of visitors
from China's mainland was 1.2 times of that in 1994. The number of
travelers from Taiwan, Japan and Britain also increased.
</P>
<P>
Income from tourism is one of the leading sources of revenue of
the Macao government. Although the overall number of tourists
declined, the industry is expected a boom following the opening of
an international airport last November.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that while the number of passengers coming
via sea and land ports dropped, the number of passengers coming by
air increased 77.9 percent over 1994. Macao had a helicopter
airport near the sea port before the opening of the international
airport.
</P>
<P>
Macao government officials said that a total of 130,000
passengers have arrived in Macao via the new airport since its
opening. They expect some 1.8 million passengers come and leave
via the airport by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Mobilize Domestic Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van
Kiet on Tuesday called for the mobilization of all domestic
resources to maintain a high growth rate and prepare for accession
to regional and world trade organizations.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister told a parliament hearing that mobilization
of domestic funds should be especially underscored in spurring the
economy.
</P>
<P>
"The only choice is to involve people in contributing money to
developing projects," Kiet said.
</P>
<P>
He said lack of money remains one of the most serious problems
hindering Vietnam's prompt integration into regional and world
economic organizations.
</P>
<P>
Since Vietnam became a full ASEAN member, it has been forced to
work harder in order to be able to join the ASEAN Free Trade Area
(AFTA) and the World Trade Organization (WTO), Kiet said.
</P>
<P>
"The problem now is how to find financial resources to meet
rising external and internal demands," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister criticised some provincial authorities for
thinking of complete reliance on state budgetary allocations.
</P>
<P>
Kiet also emphasized the urgent need to reform the tax system
to raise national revenues.

<HEADLINE> Reproductive Health Care Pays off in Jilin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Reproductive health care in
northeast China's Jilin Province has benefited local people and
has been commended by international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Reproductive health, which refers to physical, mental and
social conditions related to the reproductive system and its
functions, has been cited as a new concept by the international
community in recent years, and has become a major question drawing
the attention of women's organizations worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has attached great importance to
reproductive health care and included it in the Outline of the
Chinese Family Planning Program.
</P>
<P>
Having inspected Jilin, officials from the United Nations Fund
for Population Activities (UNFPA) and the World Health
Organization (WHO) praised the province for its success in
reproductive health care.
</P>
<P>
Jilin's reproductive health care efforts have met advanced
world standards, according to Ian Bruce Howie, director of the
representative office of the UNFPA in China.
</P>
<P>
Last April the Jilin Provincial Family Planning Institute set
up a center to provide reproductive health services for grassroots
units and to conduct surveys at the county level.
</P>
<P>
The center has launched ten reproductive health care projects
in accordance with a survey conducted in 21 villages in Yongji and
Qianguo counties.
</P>
<P>
In Qianguo County it tried out the establishment of a
sub-center in the county seat and service units in
townships. Experts are invited to train family planning officials
at the township and county levels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the center has issued certificates for free
reproductive health care check-ups to local women. To date, the
doctors at the center have checked 6,585 women and 743 children,
and discovered and cured 1,334 cases of disease.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to reproductive health care, 16,000 rural couples in the
pilot county have received one-child parents' certificates.
</P>
<P>
Last September the State Family Planning Commission held a
symposium on social sciences and reproductive health in the
county, in a bid to spread Jilin's experience in this regard to
other parts of the country.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Swedish King Carl
Gustaf said here today that development and environmental
conservation can go hand-in-hand with proper planning at every
stage.
</P>
<P>
He told an informal press conference here today that there was
an increasing awareness and understanding of environmental issues
in developing countries which had to cope with rapid economic
expansion and development.
</P>
<P>
"There is a danger (to the environment) when there is rapid
economic expansion of the society," the Swedish king pointed out,
adding if one really plans, the two things could be combined.
</P>
<P>
The king, who is also president of the World Fund for Nature in
Sweden, said: "I think it is good that you think twice on these
environmental matters."
</P>
<P>
When asked whether he would encourage more Swedish companies to
invest in Malaysia, Carl Gustaf said it was up to the companies to
come and evaluate business potential in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
He said there were already several Swedish companies operating
in Malaysia, including telecommunications firm Ericsson and car
manufacturer Volvo.
</P>
<P>
Carl Gustaf hoped that his visit would translate into greater
political and economic ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish king and his wife arrived here Tuesday on a
five-day state visit to Malaysia. They will leave here for Sabah
state Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Rising Fire Cases Push Up Insurance Rates  in Thailand  (by Xiong Ping) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Thai insurance firms have to ask
department store operators to share more responsibility with them
as fire disasters at shopping complexes rose in the country
recently.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Insurance PLC, one of Thailand's largest insurers, is
leading insurance firms to initiate a self-insurance measure to
require mall operators to pay more for their own safety.
</P>
<P>
Indicating that the shared proportion of insurance liability by
the operators depends on their location and fire prevention
measures, the company said that it would ask the Central Group to
bear a 40 percent of the sum insured.
</P>
<P>
The Central Group is a leading department store operator in the
country and it currently has the largest sum insured in the
country, at about 10 billion baht (about 400 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Other insurance firms are also joining Bangkok Insurance PLC to
raise their fire premiums and impose a minimum 20 percent
self-insurance rate from department stores after their current
insurance policies expire.
</P>
<P>
The insurers also have decided to double their fire premium
rates for Bangkok-based department stores to 0.2 percent from 0.1
percent, while demanding 0.25 percent for stores located in other
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Higher insurance rates would force mall operators to improve
their fire prevention measures, said Chai Sophonpanich, president
of Bangkok Insurance PLC.
</P>
<P>
Since October 20 last year, seven fire cases occurred at
department stores in Thailand with three of them owned by the
Central Group. At least eight people were killed in the disasters
and the property losses were estimated far beyond 3.3 billion baht
(132 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Chai said that his company has paid out 810 million baht (32.4
million dollars) for the claims in department store fires, double
the 1994 level.
</P>
<P>
The spate of mall fires has hurt the Thai insurance industry's
position with foreign re-insurance companies, which have reduced
the commission given to Thai insurers by 2.5 percent from the
previous 47-52 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
Currently, nearly 85 percent of each 1-billion-baht (40 million
dollars) policy in Thailand is re-insured by foreign insurance
companies, which have frequently bypassed local firms to survey
stores independently.
</P>
<P>
With higher insurance rates imposed, local insurance firms are
also stepping up their checkups on shopping malls in a bid to
reduce their losses.
</P>
<P>
They also assured department store operators that the
self-insurance level will be lowered if they show safety
improvements.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Prosecution Starts Probe into Violence Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul District Prosecutor's
Office (SDPO) today began an investigation into a violence case
involving three sons of former South Korean President Chun
Doo-hwan.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors will look into the circumstances under which Kang
Min-Jo, 62, father of Kang Kyung-dae, a college student who was
beaten to death by riot police in 1991, was attacked by Chun's
three sons early this week.
</P>
<P>
Kang was allegedly mobbed and beaten by Chun's sons while he
was yelling "blood-thirsty felons" at Chun and another former
President Roh Tae-woo as well as their confidants implicated in
the 1979 military mutiny and the 1980 military crackdown on
pro-democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
Kang made the verbal attack when Chun and Roh were leaving a
courtroom at the Seoul District Court here soon after the first
session of the public trial of their treason charges adjourned on
the afternoon of March 11.
</P>
<P>
Kang filed a complaint with the SDPO against Chun's sons
earlier today.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to determine who the assailant was in the
scuffle. So we'll question court employees before summoning
Chun's sons -- Chun Jae-kuk, Chun Jae-yong and Chun Jae-man -- for
questioning," a SDPO official said.
</P>
<P>
Kang, who is being hospitalized in southern Seoul, has received
medical certification which indicates his injuries will take three
weeks to heal.
</P>
<P>
The March 11 trial was the first time for the two former South
Korean presidents to stand trial together.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh, who were arrested last year, have been indicted
for treason and insurrection for their roles in the military
mutiny on December 12, 1979 and the military crackdown on the
civil uprising on May 18, 1980 in Kwangju, Capital of the
country's South Cholla Province, in addition to graft charges.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh have stood trial once and three times respectively
already on the graft charges.
</P>
<P>
Chun seized power on August 27, 1980 and ruled the nation until
February 1988. He was followed by Roh who stepped down in
February 1993.

<HEADLINE> India's Ruling Party Welcomes EC Decision on Symbol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Indian National
Congress (INC) Tuesday welcomed the Election Commission's decision
in rejecting the claim of the party's breakaway faction to the
"hand" poll symbol, the National Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
By a majority decision, the three-member commission declared
that the group headed by Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao is the
real Indian National Congress and would retain the "hand" symbol.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy that our stand has been upheld and our claim that
we are the real congress has been vindicated," INC spokesman V.N.
Gadgil said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the commission also decided to recognize the group led
by N.D. Tiwari as the "All India Indira Congress" with the status
of a national party.
</P>
<P>
In his minority opinion, Chief Election Commissioner T.N.
Seshan held that since neither of the groups of INC could prove it
is the real congress, the commission would not be fully justified
but left with no alternative to freeze the symbol "hand."
</P>
<P>
The other two commissioners, M.S. Gill and G.V.G.
Krishnamurthy, disagreed with Seshan and said as the commission
had rejected the Tiwari group's claim to be the real INC, the
congress led by Rao would automatically be entitled to continue to
have all the rights and privileges untouched and undisturbed.
</P>
<P>
The commission asked the All India Indira Congress to choose
and apply for a new symbol.

<HEADLINE> International Summit of Peacemakers Opens in Egypt (by zhu yunlong, meng xin) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHARM EL-SHEIKH, EGYPT, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The International
Summit of Peacemakers opened in this Red Sea resort today to save
the shaken Middle East peace process and combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The summit, co-hosted by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton, has drawn representatives from
some 30 countries.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Russian President
Boris Yeltsin and European leaders are among those attending the
gathering.
</P>
<P>
The summit was hastily arranged in the wake of four suicide
bombing attacks in Israel since February 25, which jeopardize the
Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, especially on the Palestinian
track.
</P>
<P>
Israel suspended talks with the Palestinians and Syria
following the attacks, which killed 62 people, including the four
bombers. The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) claimed
responsibility for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
To maintain the peace momentum, participating nations are
expected to discuss stepped-up aid for the Palestinians and
strengthened security guarantees for Israel.
</P>
<P>
The major peace partners -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, King Hussein of Jordan
along with Mubarak -- are participating in the one-day
conference.
</P>
<P>
But the other two parties in the Arab-Israeli conflict, Syria
and Lebanon, boycotted the the summit.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon said that no parties have responded to its
condemnation of the violence by Israel in south Lebanon and have
neglected a distinction between terrorism and resistance of
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Libya, opposed to the regional peace process, also
criticized the summit.
</P>
<P>
Iran said that the summit serves propaganda only and nothing
will come out of it.
</P>
<P>
While Israel has expressed hope that world leaders attending
the summit can take practical steps against Islamic terrorists,
Arab participants believe that the summit would primarily focus
on protecting peace.
</P>
<P>
Participants also include British Prime Minister John Major,
French President Jacques Chirac, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
officials from some other European countries, most Gulf states,
several North African countries, Yemen, Turkey, Canada and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Official: Only Khamenei Can Cancel Death Sentence on Rushdie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei is the only person who has the authority to cancel
the death sentence on Salman Rushdie, a high-ranking official at
presidential office said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The decree [death sentence] has not been cancelled. No one,
except for Ayatollah Khamenei, can revise the decree," the
official at presidential office told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The official at presidential office who spoke on condition of
anonymity said that since the decree was issued by a religious
scholar of the high stature of Khomeini it could not be changed by
officials.
</P>
<P>
"Only Ayatollah Khamenei, as the Supreme Jurisprudent, can
revise decrees issued by the late Imam," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On February 14, 1989, the late Iranian leader Ayatollah
Khomeini issued a religious edict, pronouncing a sentence of
death on the British author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in
protest at the publication of Rushdie's novel "The Satanic
Verses", and exhorting all Moslems to carry out the sentence.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Rushdie issue has turned into a big
controversial problem that hinders the relations between Iran and
European countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian authorities have given into tremendous pressures
from the European Union after the death of Khomeini, promising
not to dispatch any commandos to kill Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati told a press conference
here last week that Iran would not send anyone to kill
Rushdie. Similar assurances have been given to European Union by
President Rafsanjani and Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said at a press conference
here Monday that the sentence on Salman Rushdie was an issue
of Islamic law and that "it was not essentially an Executive
issue."
</P>
<P>
The official at presidential office said that Rafsanjani wanted
to draw the attention to the religious importance of the
decree.
</P>
<P>
"The president wanted to make a distinction between a
religious, jurisprudential decree and an executive, administrative
one," the official said.
</P>
<P>
"The British with their hue and cry wanted to make it sound
that the decree was an executive one," he added.
</P>
<P>
"In fact it was the British themselves who did not want to
have this issue resolved and even now their actions show they do
not seek an end to it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani's Monday statement on Rushdie has drawn criticism
from a national newspaper Jomhuri Eslami.
</P>
<P>
The paper issued an editorial Tuesday, saying that
Rushdie still has to face death sentence because "no one has
the right to change the divine command."
</P>
<P>
"It is the responsibility of all Moslems to kill anyone who
would insult the Blessed Progeny of Prophet Muhammad, the Holy
Koran and Islamic sanctities," the daily said.
</P>
<P>
"This punishment has to be done regardless of time, place and
individuals involved. The decree is not a governmental or
personal decree and hence cannot be changed to adjust to new
political conditions," it warned.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the indirect talks on Salman Rushdie
between EU and Tehran is producing some understanding. The two
sides have agreed the case be regarded merely as a religious and
theoretical issue.
</P>
<P>
They said that with U.S. pressures mounting on Iran,
Iranian authorities have decided to solve the Rushdie issue to
gain the cooperation of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"The question is not whether, but how, to withdraw from
previous position, in such a way that Iran will not lose face both
at home and abroad," a political analyst here said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian authorities also face tremendous pressure and
opposition from the religious extremists inside the country on the
issue of Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials have stated recently that they want to
adopt a protective stance with regard to issues such as
Rushdie affair.
</P>
<P>
Mostafa Mirsalim, Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance,
said at a press conference held last week that Iran will take the
case of insulting religious sanctities like the Rushdie affair to
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran will ask the United Nations to effectively
put a ban on insulting religious sanctities in a bid to prevent
disputes such as Rushdie affairs.

One key area where this new level of cooperation is expected

</P>
<P>
The eight-man team, all members of the board of directors,

Television and independent television and hold talks with members
of the Tanzania Telecommunication Commission and the Tanzania
Broadcasting Commission.
</P>

The head of the delegation, Mr. Fredson Mambiya, told newsmen

<HEADLINE> India's Foreign Debt Manageable: World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- India's foreign debt touched a
record 98.99 billion US dollar mark at the end of 1994 but it is
still within the "manageable limits" and there is no cause for
concern, the World Bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank's annual "World Debt Tables", according to the
National Herald today, said the situation improved in 1995 as the
debt grew less rapidly than the previous years. But the bank does
not give the debt figure for 1995.
</P>
<P>
It placed India among "moderately indebted low-income
countries" whose present value of debt service to exports of goods
and services is less than 220 percent but higher than 132 percent.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank document, released here Tuesday, also noted that
India has attracted growing foreign direct investment (FDI) flows
since its economic liberalization in 1991.
</P>
<P>
India secured 1.5 billion dollars in FDI in 1995 and emerged as
the "principal host" in South Asia. Total FDI inflows for the
region last year were two billion dollars, of which Pakistan
received over 400 million dollars, Bangladesh 125 million and Sri
Lanka 200 million.

BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China's united front work has
entered a new historical stage and is the union with the most
extensive representation of all the socialist laborers and
patriots who are devoted to socialism or to the reunification of
the motherland, said senior party leader Li Ruihuan today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing ceremony of the Fourth Session of the
Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), China's top advisory body, Li
urged his members to bring all the positive factors into full play
so as to build China into a modern socialist country and achieve
the reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"It is a political issue of paramount importance to bring about
the broadest unity by means of resorting to the correct policies
and throgh effective work," said Li, who is also a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The people's political consultative conference, comprising
personalities from various parties, organizations and
nationalities, has the most profound representation in
organization and hence symbolizes the great alliance, he said.
</P>

Li urged members from various sectors to increase cooperation
and set an examplary role of great unity. Efforts must also be
made to enhance friendship with the compatriots from Taiwan, Hong
Kong, Macao and Chinese nationals residing overseas for the
promotion of the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"We should have a clear-cut stand to oppose the intrigues by
certain leaders of the Taiwan authorities in their schemes for
'two Chinas', 'one China, one Taiwan' and 'Taiwan independence',"
to contribute to the great unity of the Chinese nationals at home
and overseas, he said.

<HEADLINE> How to Let Free Small State Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China should convert most of its
small state-owned enterprises into joint stock companies as a way
to revitalize the public sector, a senior economist said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jue, a professor from the Party School of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China and president of China
Market Economy Study Society, said that vitalizing the small ones
is "practical."
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee last September made a decision to
"concentrate efforts on large state-owned enterprises and let free
small ones" in order to breathe new life into the state-owned
sector as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Compared with large state enterprises, small ones have a small
debt burden, a small redundant workforce and less social
obligations, said Wang, who is here attending the just-concluded
session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, the country's top advisory
body.
</P>
<P>
"For them, reform will be less difficult," he said.
</P>
<P>
Small state enterprises have a direct bearing on people's daily
life, and most of them are labor-intensive, he said.
</P>
<P>
A vitalization of these small operations can help build a sound
micro foundation for a market economy and facilitate the
development of such an economy, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He said rejuvenating them also can create more job
opportunities and therefore be instrumental to maintaining social
stability.
</P>
<P>
The rejuvenation of small enterprises may take the forms of
restructuring, integration, mergers, conversion to public
companies, contracting, leasing, bankruptcy, and auction, the
professor said.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted, however, that the form most compatible with
socialism and most acceptable to workers is their conversion to
joint stock companies.
</P>
<P>
Contracting and leasing have the shortcomings of enterprise
management seeking short-term interests and reducing capital
utilization efficiency, he said.
</P>
<P>
Auction and bankruptcy should not occur too frequently due to
"big" difficulties and obstacles and a possible negative impact on
social stability, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Integrating and merging small state-owned enterprises with
large ones will implicate the latter, the majority of which have
already been plagued by a low economic efficiency and heavy
financial burdens, he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Eases Closure on Gaza Strip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel today eased the closure
on the Gaza Strip, allowing some 35 trucks carrying essential
supplies to the strip via the Karni crossing point, which was
reopened this morning.
</P>
<P>
However, no products will be allowed into Israel from the
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The Karni crossing point was closed after an Israeli Arab
smuggled in a Hamas suicide bomber, who carried out the Dizengoff
bombing in Tel Aviv on March 3 which killed 13 people.
</P>
<P>
The southern command of the Israeli army decided to reopen the
crossing point after security arrangements were made in
coordination with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
An overall closure on the Gaza Strip and the West Bank has
been in place following the Hamas suicide bus bombing in
Jerusalem on January 25.
</P>
<P>
There are reports that the closure has already brought about
food shortage in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Israeli army decided to allow more than 80
trucks filled with flour and other produce to enter the Gaza
Strip from Egypt, and ordered troops not to delay sick people
seeking medical treatment in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The latest moves by Israel to ease the hardships of the
Palestinians came before the opening of today's international
anti-terrorism summit in Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el
Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from some 3 countries will attend the
conference, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
The one-day summit is aimed to find solutions to terrorist
activities in the wake of the recent wave of Hamas suicide
attacks in Israel which killed 58 people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli police Inspector-General Assaf Hefetz said
Tuesday that Hamas is planning a major terrorist attack aimed at
marring the visit of Clinton to Israel which begins this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Hefetz said that Israel had recommended to U.S. officials that
Clinton not visit the two Jaffa Road Hamas suicide bombing sites,
for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials apparently agreed and Clinton will not lay
wreaths at the sites, as originally planned.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland Opposition Rejects Talks with Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- An alliance of Swaziland
opposition groups, unions and civic groups have rejected new
government initiatives to hold talks on constitutional reforms, a
local daily "the Star" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the newly-established Swaziland Democratic Alliance
said in Mbabane on Tuesday that they would not take part in
negotiations with King Mswati iii's government until he lifted a
23-year-old ban on political activity.
</P>
<P>
The loose alliance, formed by eleven pro-democracy groups last
week, was aimed at ensuring the democratization process in
Swaziland was not reversed.
</P>
<P>
All political parties were declared illegal in Swaziland in
1973 and a permanent state of emergency was decreed by Mswati's
father late King Sobhuza.
</P>
<P>
King Mswati iii, who rules the kingdom by decree, has come
under increasing pressure this year to reintroduce constitutional
democracy.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Mswati promised to reinstate the constitution
suspended by his father in 1973 and planned to "embark on an
exercise to improve the political structure of the country."
</P>
<P>
He also ordered the setting up of a national constitutional
forum as part of his promise to introduce political reforms.
</P>
<P>
However, the proposed forum excluded all banned political
parties, including the kingdom's largest opposition group the
People's United Democratic Movement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU),
though legal in the country, said it would not take part in the
talks.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide strike, called by the SFTU in January, had
brought the land-locked country to a complete halt.

</P>
<P>
In his opening address, ADB President Mitstu Sato said, "The

links among the peoples of the neighboring countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Now with the strong commitments and determined policy
initiatives of the four countries, the prospect for rapid and
sustainable development of the EAGA is greatly enhanced."
</P>
<P>
He indicated, "We must now move forward to disseminate widely
the study findings and recommendations, and create the necessary
institutional arrangements to effectively forge economic
cooperation among the four countries."
</P>
<P>
The conference marks the conclusion of a year-long study to
develop a strategic plan to promote economic cooperation and
development in its growth quadrangle and contribute to more
balanced regional development within the four countries.
</P>
<P>
The study identifies a wide range of policy, program and
project initiatives covering agriculture, fishing and forestry,
trade, investment and trade in financial services, industrial
development, transport and communications, power and energy,

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Benefits From Afforestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINGCHUAN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- An afforestation program has
improved the ecological environment in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region, and yielded substantial economic benefits for local
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Located in northwest China, arid Ningxia afforested a total of
216,000 ha during the second phase of a huge greening campaign in
northwest, north and northeast China, which ended last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Forestry Department of the regional
government show that about 100,000 ha of the trees have survived,
bringing the region's forest coverage rate from 4.8 percent to 6.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
Lan Zesong, director of the department, said Ningxia has become
the first place in China to roll back desert encroachment.
</P>
<P>
About 150,000 ha of desert has been harnessed and many oases
planted.
</P>
<P>
Deserts account for 30 percent of the region.
</P>
<P>
Lan said the forest-related output value totaled 280 million
yuan last year, a sevenfold increase over 1991, and the total
fruit output reached 130 million kg, with 2.6 million kg exported.
</P>
<P>
The average per capita income from forestry also increased by
8.6 times.
</P>
<P>
The director also cited co-operation with 10 countries and
regions for the rapid development of the region's afforestation.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui's "Democracy" Ploy Further Refuted (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1992 Lee Teng-hui initiated the second "amendment to the
constitution" and got the right to nominate "supervisors", which
were not enjoyed even by Chiang Kai-shek and his son during their
periods of rule.
</P>
<P>
So, "the impeachment of the president" became impossible, for
those "supervisors", who have the power to impeach, are nominated
by Lee Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
In December 1993, amid great din of strife, the "mainstream" of
the Kuomintang (KMT) forced the hasty passage of three laws
covering the "national security council" and "national security
bureau".
</P>
<P>
These "laws" gave Lee the power over defense, foreign
affairs, mainland policies and personnel in the "Executive Yuan".
</P>
<P>
After the "laws" were passed the Democratic Progressive Party
criticized Lee as being "wild and crazy", while legislators of the
New Party announced that "both the parliament and democracy have
died", and denounced those KMT legislators who had passed the three
"laws" in accordance with Lee's will as "shameless".
</P>
<P>
In 1994 the third "amendment to the constitution" was passed in
Taipei, which made clear a system of "direct election for
president" and reduced the power of the "president of the
Executive Yuan", who used to share the power of personnel
appointment with the "president". This move turned the "president"
into a new political strong man.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the KMT's "mainstream" who are loyal to the
"president" promoted, from the original No.75, the KMT's bill to
be the first one among a total of 87 bills to "amend the
constitution".
</P>
<P>
Besides, they vetoed the other 86 bills within a single day
because these bills had been presented by others.
</P>
<P>
When it was the last day for the "amendment", its passage was
announced even though the vote counting had still not finished.
</P>
<P>
As to the result of the "amendment", the opposition parties held
that it was "a big joke in the history of constitutional
politics", and "the constitution of Dictator Lee" was "a negative
example for education in the constitution".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taiwan press condemned the "amendment", with a
commentary carried by the "United Daily News" calling it a
"one-person-directed amendment" and thus the "constitution" was
"for one person". The commentary added that the price of the
"amendment" was "the destruction of the whole of constitutional
politics".
</P>
<P>
This Taiwan press opinion is probably the best comment on Lee
Teng-hui's "democracy".

<HEADLINE> APEC to Focus on Small, Medium Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) will focus its attention on small and medium
enterprises (SME) in a three-day workshop which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The workshop will discuss the organizational structure of the
APEC Center for Technology Exchange and Training for Small and
Medium Enterprises (ACTETSME) which will be located at the Science
Park in Los Banos, Laguna.
</P>
<P>
APEC members which have successfully harnessed SMEs in their
development like Australia, Canada, Malaysia and the United States
will share their experiences on policy formulation, servicing
clients and networking.
</P>
<P>
In his welcoming remarks, Philippine Trade and Industry
Undersecretary Ernesto Ordonez said, "SMEs are envisioned to
become a major vehicle in the growth and sustainable development
of an open and free trade driven Asia-Pacific environment."
</P>
<P>
He said that SMEs provide a critical engine of growth, vitality
and innovation in the Asia-Pacific region and they have the
ability to respond flexibly to technological innovation and the
diverse and demanding nature of consumers.
</P>
<P>
The ACTETSME was an initiative of President Fidel Ramos in line
with the Philippine government's emphasis on human resource
development.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of ACTETSME was adopted at the APEC leaders
meeting in Seattle, and subsequent APEC leaders meeting supported
the project.
</P>
<P>
APEC's ministerial meeting on human resource development last
January urged the speedy operationalization of ACTETSME as it
would "facilitate the upgrading and mobility of human resources"
among APEC member economies.
</P>
<P>
Small and medium enterprises make up 90 percent of all APEC
enterprises, account for 32 to 48 percent of employment and
contribute 30 to 60 percent to the gross domestic product in
individual APEC economies.
</P>
<P>
They also contribute some 35 percent of the total number of
manufacturing establishments, 50 percent of employment generated
and 25 percent of the value added in production.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of trees have been
planted across East China's Anhui Province at a cost of 550
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The province has planted the trees on more than 100,000
hectares of land in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The province launched 11 foreign-funded projects, including
research and development of poplar tree planting, supported by the
United Nations (UN) Development Program, the World Bank-funded
state afforestation program, and construction of shelter forest
along the Yangtze River, a joint project between China and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Three of these projects have now been completed, seven are
under development and one is to be started this year.
</P>
<P>
During 1991-1994, 240 million yuan, loaned by the World Bank,
was invested in planting 97,000 hectares of fast-growing
high-yield trees in the province's 17 counties.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, another afforestation program, funded by the world
bank, went into effect in another 16 counties. Under this program,
a total of 132 million yuan was spent on the planting of 33,000
hectares of trees.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui's "Democracy" Ploy Further Refuted (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Judging by the standards of
democracy, Lee Teng-hui's "democracy test" will not pass at all,
says a signed article published today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The article by Huang Jiashu, the second of a series of articles
criticizing Lee Teng-hui's pseudo-democracy, says the main
components of a democracy should be based on "governing by law"
and "checks and balances" apart from regular, universal and fair
elections.
</P>
<P>
"To govern by law" stresses that " everything must be done in
line with the law", and not that "the strong man decides
everything", the article says.
</P>
<P>
It explains that to prevent the creation of any "strong man",
there must be the establishment of mutually containing, and
supervising, relations between various power systems, the
so-called "checks and balances".
</P>
<P>
According to the article, titled "Shield of individual
dictatorship", democracy has a higher level of meaning above the
level of 'a system'. One who reaches a higher level will
harmonize self-confidence with respect for the others.
</P>
<P>
The article notes that none of the biographies about Lee
Teng-hui, flattering or battering him, considers him
"democratic". Lee claims to "respect the freedom of speech", but
he has overtly manipulated the party, and administrative systems,
to assault a major newspaper, and lost his temper in the face of
his critics in public several times.
</P>
<P>
Recently Lee has hired legal advisors to "guard his fame",
intending to frighten the press, and one news organ in Taiwan
warned the public "Be careful, Lee Teng-hui might sue you".
</P>
<P>
The division of Kuomintang, and the rate of support for
Kuomintang dropping below 50 percent, is absolutely related to Lee
Teng-hui's dictatorial guideline of organization, the article says.
</P>
<P>
Since he is such a personality, expecting Lee Teng-hui to
pursue "governing by law" and "checks and balances" will lead
nowhere, Huang says.
</P>
<P>
When Lee Teng-hui convened a "conference on state affairs" in
1990, he invited the "Godfather of Taiwan Independence" Peng
Mingmin, who then had a dwelling in the United States, to attend
in the name of a "dignitary", although the "judicial" department
of Taiwan had not then cancelled a warrant for Peng's arrest.
</P>
<P>
It was a solid example of Lee's self-assertiveness and
dictatorship, Huang says.
</P>
<P>
A more convincing example is the three "constitutional
amendments" made under the directorship of Lee Teng-hui. They are
a major link in so-called "democratic reforms" and took four years
to complete. Although the first "amendment" proclaimed to sweep
away with the "provisional regulations for mobilization to
suppress a communist rebellion", it retained the most important
two rights the "provisional regulations" gave to the Chiang family,
 i.e., the rights to issue emergency orders, and decide
major policies and guidelines, and passed them to Lee Teng-hui.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The matter of upmost importance
in overcoming China's difficulties is adherence to Deng Xiaoping's
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and to
the basic line of the Communist Party of China (CPC) under the
leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the
core.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) at the closing ceremony of the Eighth Session
of the CPPCC National Committee this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He cited the theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics set forth by Deng Xiaoping as inheriting and
developing the scientific principles of Mao Zedong Thought as well
as an embodiment of the wisdom of the entire nation and the
nation's spiritual pillar. It is a powerful ideological weapon in
overcoming difficulties ahead, he said.
</P>
<P>
China must continue to adhere resolutely, thoroughly and
earnestly to this theory to cope with various kinds of hazards
that might possibly occur in the future, he said.

BEIRUT, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Hours before the opening of an
international summit in Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el
Sheikh, Lebanese Shiite Moslem guerrillas announced that they
launched this morning a series of attacks at the positions in
Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Lebanon.

largest scale operation against the Israeli occupation forces and
their client militia.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, military wing of Hezbollah, said in a

BC-Israel-Clinton Visit
mee031306hke -- Unprecedented Stringent Security To Greet
</P>
<P>
Clinton's Visit
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Security arrangements,
code-named "Operation Song 4," are being carried out by the
authorities concerned for U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Gurion Airport will come to a standstill this afternoon,
Tel Aviv will grind to a halt tomorrow and some 10,000 policemen,
nearly half the nation's police force, will be involved in
securing the Clinton visit in the two days. Central district and
Tel Aviv police and security forces finalized their arrangements
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to arrive at Ben Gurion Airport from Sharm
el-Sheikh this evening. A short ceremony will take place before he
leaves for Jerusalem. The airport, main highway, and surrounding
areas will be heavily guarded by police, border policemen, Civil
Guards volunteers, and the army.
</P>
<P>
Preparations began yesterday, with 1,000 policemen in the
central district alone on full alert. Security forces will also
patrol along the Green Line in the central district.
</P>
<P>
During Clinton's Tel Aviv visit police are expected to seal
off all streets near the Tel Aviv Museum from the early morning.
</P>
<P>
Cars will not be allowed to park in the area where Clinton is
scheduled to speak to high school students, near the museum.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's visit is being shadowed by an intelligent report
that the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) is planning a major
attack to coincide with the visit.
</P>
<P>
Police Inspector-General Assaf Hefetz said yesterday that
Israel had recommended to U.S. officials that Clinton not visit
the two Jaffa Road Hamas suicide bombing sites, for security
reasons. The U.S. officials apparently agreed, and Clinton will
not lay wreaths at the sites, as originally planned.
</P>
<P>
"We have intelligence information showing that they will try
to carry out a major attack. Hamas itself announced it plans an
attack," Hefetz said. However, according to Hefetz, The
intelligence information was not detailed, and it is unclear
exactly where Hamas will try and attack.
</P>
<P>
The Inspector-General was speaking to reporters after a meeting
 of police brass in Jerusalem to discuss security arrangements
for the Clinton visit. An officer with the General Security
Service VIP Security Department participated in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The visit comes after several very serious attacks ... and we
are doing our utmost to ensure that it passes quietly," Hefetz
said. He said that all demonstrations planned for the two days
will not be allowed to materialize, so as not to further strain
police manpower.

<HEADLINE> TAZARA Suspends Shuttle Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- TAZARA has from this week
suspended its shuttle passenger train services between Dar Es
Salaam and three cities of Mzenga, Kidatu and Makambako because
of passenger shortage, a TAZARA official confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Deputy Managing Director of the Tanzania
Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA), Mr. Ernest Mulokozi, the
shuttle trains are not profitable during February and March.
</P>
<P>
"During this period, the would-be passengers are engaged in
agricultural activities. In other words, people in the areas
served by the two shuttle trains do not travel during this
period," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Since TAZARA was expected to operate commercially to generate
more revenue, locomotives of the suspended shuttle trains will be
used to strengthen freight trains.
</P>
<P>
"It is the freight service that generates revenue, therefore
earning the authority some profits for its continued operations,"
Mulokozi noted.
</P>
<P>
The shuttle services were introduced in July last year as
relief trains to ease congestion of passengers between the
capital and the three cities.

PARIS -- The European Union (EU) hopes U.S. legislation will
not hinder EU's trade with Cuba, a French Foreign Ministry
spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
While the EU has no intention of interfering in U.S.-Cuban
relations it hopes the U.S. Congress will not pass a bill which
will affect European business activities in Cuba, he added.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. laws have no exterritoriality and even the U.N. Security
Council has not yet decided to apply sanctions on Cuba," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
ZAGREB -- The mayor of Sarajevo, Tarik Kupusovic, resigned on
Tuesday in protest at the creation of a Muslim-dominated Sarajevo
government, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The BH Press news agency said that Kupusovic wrote to Bosnian
President Alija Izetbegovic that he was resigning over the "manner
of the inauguration of the Sarajevo canton Monday."
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian federation's constitution, agreed upon by Croats
and Muslims in 1994, stipulates that the Bosnian capital has a
special status to guard its multi-ethnic nature.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton peace treaty sought to change that status by handing
power in the Sarajevo regional government to Muslim-dominated
authorities to end the ethnic parity rule.
</P>
<P>
MOSCOW -- Aslan Maskhadov, chief of staff of the rebel Chechen
military, has been badly wounded and is receiving treatment in
eastern Chechnya, Itar-Tass reported today.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted a witness as saying that he saw
Maskhadov receiving intravenous injections at a heavily guarded
private house, an impromptu field hospital, in a village near
Gudermes on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass quoted another Chechen resident as claiming to have
witnessed an assassination attempt against Maskhadov last Thursday
near the Chechen settlement at Gerzel-Aul, some 55 kilometers east
of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
The man said that a militiaman, loyal to Salman Raduyev, hit
Maskhadov with a rifle butt and broke his skull. Raduyev,
son-in-law of rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev and mastermind of the
raid against Daghestani town of Kizlyar in January, died a week
ago from bullet wounds sustained from a factional fight.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS -- The members of the Security Council
reiterated Tuesday that the Iraqi government must allow the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) inspection teams immediate,
unconditional and unrestricted access to all sites designated by
the commission for inspection.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to Chairman of UNSCOM Rolf Ekeus, the current
council president Legwaila Legwaila of Botswana said that the
members of the council considered that Iraq's delay in permitting
the current inspection teams access to the sites concerned
constitutes a clear violation by Iraq of the provisions in
Resolutions 687, 707 and 715 adopted by the Security Council in
1991.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Doctors Urged to Reduce Maternal Death Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Health has
challenged doctors to chart out strategies to reduce the maternal
mortality rate in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The challenge was made by Assistant Chief Medical Officer in
the Ministry of Health Dr. Peter Kilima here on Tuesday, when
opening a three-day scientific and annual general conference of
the Association of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians of Tanzania
(AGOTA).
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kilima said that Tanzania's maternal death rate ranges
between 100 and 400 deaths for every 100,000 deliveries, which
said to be one of the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
"This is indeed the biggest challenge to AGOTA," stressed Dr.
Kilima, adding he is optimistic that the seminar would find a
solution to the "souring" problem.
</P>
<P>
He pinpointed the causes of the problem as delivery at tender
age or at short intervals.
</P>
<P>
Kilima praised family planning initiatives in some countries,
regretting however that the level of acceptance in Tanzania is
below 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
He proposed networking among all local and international
groups in Tanzania dealing with women health, especially family
planning which he described as primary.
</P>
<P>
The doctor further stressed on the need to improve
professional standards in the health sector using modern science
and technology for the betterment of women's health.
</P>
<P>
He also underscored the importance research but emphasized
that it should be focused on problems obstructing progress in
maternal health care.
</P>
<P>
earlier, the president of AGOTA, Professor Hubert Kairuki
spoke on the need for protection of women's health with "quality
care."
</P>
<P>
Kairuki said a regional body was in the pipeline to cater for
East and Southern Africa to facilitate exchange of knowledge and
experience.
</P>
<P>
A regional reproductive health research workshop is slated for
Dar Es Salaam, between March 18 and 23 to pave way for the
proposed body.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Peace and development are still
the theme of the times, which is favorable for China to pool
strength on its modernization drive, said a senior Chinese
official here today.
</P>
<P>
In the closing address at the Fourth Session of the Eighth
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National
Committee, said China has a lot of favorable conditions in
achieving its ambitious goals set in the outline of the Ninth
Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000) and for the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Internationally, he noted, overall situation is tending to be
relaxed despite that the world is full of contradictions and
regional conflicts occur frequently.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, said that
domestically, China has scored tremendous progress in reform and
opening-up and economic development, thus laying a solid
structural conditions and material basis for future development.
</P>
<P>
The stability and unity brought about by the entire Chinese
people offer both social conditions and political guarantee for
the country's future work.
</P>
<P>
However, he acknowledged that China's development is restricted
by basic national conditions, such as vast population, poor
foundation, a relative shortage of resources and imbalance in
regional development.
</P>
<P>
In economic sphere, he noted, China has poor agricultural
foundation, some state-owned enterprises are confronted with
difficulties and there is also a growing pressure for employment.
</P>
<P>
In a word, he said, there exist in the country both both
historical opportunities and stark challenges and both favorable
and unfavorable conditions.
</P>
<P>
"We must pluck up our confidence and keep sober-minded, and be
prepared to make protracted and arduous efforts," he told the
members of the CPPCC National Committee members.

</P>
<P>
The survey was carried out by the Damen Information and

Guangzhou and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Most of those surveyed put scientists at the top of a list of
13 major professions.
</P>
<P>
Government officials were in the second place, and teachers,
who used to have quite a low social status, were in the third
place this time.
</P>
<P>
Those with decent incomes, such as managers, private
businessmen, employees with foreign-funded enterprises, actors and
actresses were low on the list.
</P>
<P>
Industrial and service sector workers and farmers, who form the
bulk of the population, were still at the bottom of the list.

<P>
According to the survey, Beijingers tend to respect scientists
and teachers most, while people in Guangzhou show the greatest
respect for government officials, and then scientists.
</P>

As the ideal profession, most residents of Guangzhou would
choose to be owners of private businesses and then financiers,

<HEADLINE> Uganda-French Economic Ties Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The economic relationship
between Uganda and France has grown in the past two years
(1994-95), and it is expected to do better.
</P>
<P>
The local paper "the Monitor" today quoted French Ambassador
to Uganda Francois Descoueyte as saying that after Kenya, today
Uganda is France's second trading partner in the East African
region.
</P>
<P>
He said, "20 percent of the total of Uganda's exports
(basically coffee) is bought by France."
</P>
<P>
In 1995 sales of France's exports to Uganda multiplied by
three times.
</P>
<P>
In the 12 months of 1995, France sold to Uganda goods worth
250 million Francs (50 million US Dollars) and it bought from
Uganda 75 million Dollars. This was mainly in coffee exports, he
said, adding so Uganda exports more to France than it imports.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Uganda and France signed a financial
bilateral protocol on December 28, 1995, consisting of 4.5
million Dollars which was designed to enhance transport (railway
locomotives were allocated 1.8 million Dollars and air traffic
control, 500,000 Dollars) and water management.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 protocol was an off-shoot of the 1994 protocol which
comprised 6 million Dollars and amounted to one-fifth of the
total yearly French grants to Uganda, the bulk of which comes
through European Union grants. France pays 25 percent of the
European Development Fund.
</P>
<P>
He said relations between Uganda and France are on the rise,
because the number of significant French firms active in Uganda
have increased from 6 to 26.
</P>
<P>
Air France will resume its flights to Entebbe International
Airport on April 1. Air France stopped its flights to Uganda in
1979 after Middle East terrorists hijacked a French air-bus and
forced it to land at Entebbe, 40 kilemeters south of Kampala.

<HEADLINE> Kunming Tunnel to Drain Polluted Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Xiyuan Tunnel, one of the key
parts of the work to control water pollution in Dianchi Lake,
outside this capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province, is now
in operation.
</P>
<P>
The lake is a major water source for nearby residents as well
as for people in Kunming. Each day hundreds of thousands of tons
of waste water are discharged into the lake, causing severe
pollution and posing a health hazard, as well as hampering
industrial and agricultural production in the region.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel bypasses the lake and drains polluted water into its
outlet. It will also help to ease the impact of floods.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel project began early in 1994.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the municipal and the Yunnan provincial
governments will continue to fund the control of water pollution
in Dianchi Lake. It is planned that by the year 2000 the damage to
the ecological environment of the region by urban pollution will
be basically halted.

an official with the Ministry of the Coal Industry, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Despite that, the industry is still hopeful of making itself
profitable, Gao said, noting that besides exploiting coal as fuel
for power generating, coal enterprises are also expected to carry
out intensive processing, coking and chemical treatment of coal,
since the country is rich in coal resources.
</P>
<P>
Gao also told the newspaper that his ministry will attach prime
importance to the development of 36 key state-owned coal
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Huge Dragon-Like Rock Found in Henan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A dragon-shaped rock has been
found some 26 km to the southwest of the famous Longmen (Dragon
Gate) Grottoes in Luoyang City, central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The dragon is a legendary auspicious animal in
China. Traditionally, the dragon is depicted with the head of an
ox, deer's antlers, snake's body and eagle's claws.
</P>
<P>
The rock was found by experts from the Luoyang Association for
Ancient Capitals, who went to a village in Yichuan County to do
research on place names.
</P>
<P>
The "dragon", 70.9 m long and 9.5 m high, is holding its head
high and its mouth is open, showing six "teeth".
</P>
<P>
On a platform opposite the "dragon" the experts found a stone
tablet bearing the inscription: "There is a dragon in the Dragon
Head Ditch where water flows".
</P>
<P>
The experts consider that there might be some connection
between the dragon-like stone and the name Longmen.

<HEADLINE> Forestry Industry takes Root in Zhejiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Progress has been made in the
forestry industry of east China's Zhejiang Province, thanks to the
province's efforts at planting trees, "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
Last year, total output of the forestry industry reached 11
billion yuan(1.33 billion US dollar), an increase of three billion
yuan over 1994. Exports of the province's forest products reached
350 million US dollars, said an official with the provincial
forestry department.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, there were 81 foreign-funded forestry
projects, drawing overseas capital totalling 83 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Statistics suggest that the percentage of forest land in
Zhejiang Province has reached 54.6 percent, ranking it first in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Of 109 State-owned tree farms, the percentage of forest land
reached 81 percent. Total tree accumulation reached 115 million
cubic metres.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed these achievements to the introduction of
scientific management and technology, which has upgraded the
quality of planted trees.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of last year, the province began to turn
toward cash trees and bamboo.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province planted 28.5 million trees covering an
area of 64,600 hectares, which is 47.7 percent higher than the
planned figure.
</P>
<P>
Of the newly planted areas, 34,600 hectares were planted with
bamboo and cash trees such as tea and fruit, said an official.
</P>
<P>
"From now on, we'll keep the ratio of cash trees at 50-60
percent among the newly planted trees," said Chen Weishan, chief
of Zhejiang Provincial Forestry Industry Department.

ANKARA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A representative for Iraqi kurds

oil pipeline passing through northern Iraq, the main outlet for
the limited sales of iraqi oil.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Keep AIDS Carriers' Identity Secret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Ministry of Health
has given assurances that the identity of people who have the
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or the acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS) will be kept secret.
</P>
<P>
When the office of the director general for communicable
disease control and environmental health collects data of people
who have AIDS and HIV from hospitals, it does not request their
names, according to sources from the office here today.
</P>
<P>
Each month the ministry updates the number of people reported
to have HIV and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The office asks details of AIDS/HIV patients including their
home address, ID card number, sex and age for epidemiological
purposes. Without such details, it would be impossible for the
government to study the spread of HIV and AIDS in the country.
</P>
<P>
Related regulations require hospitals to report every case of
HIV and AIDS to the government.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics, the number of people
reported to have HIV/AIDS in Indonesia reached 376 in January this
year, although officials believe that the actual number is much
larger.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Candidate Withdraws from Presidential Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the opposition ZANU
(Ndonga) Party of Zimbabwe Ndabaningi Sithole has withdrawn from
the race alleging interference by state intelligence officers to
destroy his party and family ahead of the poll.
</P>
<P>
He is one of the three challengers of the presidential
elections scheduled for this weekend. His party has two seats in
the 150-seat parliament in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Tuesday entitled "I beg to withdraw,"
Sithole (76), claimed he had in his possession secret Central
Intelligence Organization (CIO) documents that showed President
Robert Mugabe was involved in a plot to destabilize his campaign.
</P>
<P>
"I am one of the presidential candidates, but my position has
been prejudiced by the government well in advance of the
forthcoming elections as the documents clearly show," Sithole
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Registrar-General of elections Tobaiwa Mudede told
the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation that Sithole's withdrawal
was not official unless forwarded in writing.
</P>
<P>
Sithole's withdrawal came a day after he revealed what he
alleged were secret documents detailing a plan by the CIO to
frame him in an assassination plot against Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
He is currently on bail on charges of plotting to kill Mugabe
and overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
The CIO, tarnished in a bruising court case in which a senior
officer was convicted in the near-fatal shooting of an opposition
candidate in the 1990 general elections, is accused by Sithole of
scheming to derail his campaign by recruiting his wife, Vesta,
and Secretary-General of his party, Godfrey Mumbamarwo, to
destroy him.
</P>
<P>
But the government has denied any involvement in schemes to
destabilize Sithole, his party and family.
</P>
<P>
On Monday Sithole, at a press conference in Harare, disclosed
the alleged secret documents detailing the plot to frame him. But
Minister of State for National Security Sidney Sekeramayi
dismissed the documents as a "poor and totally hopeless
fabrication."

<HEADLINE> Hangzhou Outlines Tourism Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China's major tourist city -
known as a paradise on earth - is aiming to attract thousands more
tourists over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Hangzhou has set its sights on growing into a world tourist
city in the next 15 years, according to its newly published
tourism plan.
</P>
<P>
The plan, adopted at a municipal tourism conference, says the
number of tourists to the city will increase by eight to 10
percent a year, and that by the year 2000, the number of overseas
tourists to the city will rise to about 700,000. The foreign
visitors will generate foreign currency earnings of up to about
380 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The city, in east China's Zhejiang Province, is famous in
Chinese history for its scenic West Lake.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to improvements in traffic, hotels and other tourist
facilities, and a greater marketing drive, the number of overseas
tourists to Hangzhou has been rising three percent a year in the
last five years.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, it received 441,300 overseas tourists and earned 125
million US dollars in foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
The plan indicates that the city will increase its spending on
tourism, including the development of new tourists attractions,
and more intensive promotion.
</P>
<P>
The city will focus its efforts on services such as commercial
tours, vacations and international conferences.
</P>
<P>
It also aims to expand its marketing in Europe, and North
America, while consolidating its market in Japan, the Republic of
Korea and southeast Asian nations.

<HEADLINE> "China's Economic Growth Helpful for Asia-Pacific Integration" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Experts attending a seminar here
on the government's role in economic transition, forecast that
China's steady economic growth will speed up the development of
economic integration among the Asia-Pacific countries.
</P>
<P>
Minister-level officials from China, Vietnam, Cambodia and
Central Asian countries are attending the meeting, as well as
experts from the US, Germany and the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP). All these Asian countries are carrying out
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The attendants have highly praised China's economic
achievements after 17 years of the policy of opening-up and
reform, and they have positive opinions on the country's smooth
and gradual transition to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Herbert Behrstock, chief of the regional program and policy
division of the UNDP, said that China is one of the traditional
planned economies now in transition, and China's experience is
helpful for those Asian countries whose agricultural population
constitutes the majority.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period China's national economy maintained
an average annual growth rate of about 11 percent, and its
people's living standards have been greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
Now China is at a crucial point in establishing a socialist
market system, and it will focus on building a modern enterprise
system in companies and enterprises nationwide in the coming 15
years.
</P>
<P>
Other Asian countries have, to a greater or lesser extent drawn
on China's experience in carrying out their own economic and
financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
The transition of China and other Asian countries from planned
to market economies will speed up not only the development of the
economies of those countries themselves, but also economic
integration among the Asia-Pacific countries, said Arthur
Holcombe, UNDP resident representative in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Clearer Scheme For State Enterprise Reform (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deputies from enterprises or government officials in charge of
economic work are positive about the measures.
</P>
<P>
Xu Guangyi, director of the Economic Commission of Shanghai,
said that reforms have helped reduce the average asset-liability
ratio in the city's state-owned enterprises to 72 percent,
compared with 80 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The value of state assets in 140 enterprises trying out a
modern corporate system has increased by 12 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Centering on six pillar industries, Shanghai has significantly
readjusted its industrial structure and product mix and achieved a
fair degree of economies of scale through restructuring assets, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The six pillar industries now account for 45 percent of
Shanghai's municipal industrial output value and 57 percent of
total profits and taxes, he said.
</P>
<P>
"State-owned enterprises in Shanghai will be restructured into
joint-stock or limited-liability companies in the next five
years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has moved 860,000 redundant workers to other sectors
and reemployed 600,000 others, he said.
</P>
<P>
In Tianjin, an industrial city in north China, the majority of
former government departments responsible for managing different
economic sectors have been restructured and entrusted to
administer state assets.
</P>
<P>
Large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises in Liaoning,
which is home to one tenth of such firms of the country, have
bottomed out and begun showing signs of a rebound, said Zhang
Guoguang, deputy secretary of the provincial committee of the
Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
The number of big money-losing enterprises has dropped by 10
percent in Shenyang, the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
Wang Peizhou, general manager of Baoshan Iron and Steel Works
in Shanghai, said that reform of state-owned enterprises should
rely more on themselves than on government support.
</P>
<P>
He said that good product quality and variety and good
management are the right path for better economic returns.
</P>
<P>
At Baoshan, he said, per capita steel output has reached 650
tons a year and energy consumption per ton has gone down to 780
kg.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the asset-liability ratio of his company has
dropped to 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
Deputies interviewed by Xinhua basically agree that problems
confronted by China's state-owned enterprises are the result of a
decades-old planned economy.
</P>
<P>
The problems, concerning all aspects of the Chinese economy,
cannot be solved overnight, but that does not mean they are
insurmountable, they said.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Clearer Scheme For State Enterprise Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China's loss-making state-owned
enterprises are a focus of the current session of the National
People's Congress, the Chinese legislature. Different from
previous sessions, however, deputies are more confident in the
future of these enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Deputies to the NPC from industrial and research circles have
reached the consensus that a clearer scheme has been developed for
the reform of state-owned enterprises and that their existing
difficulties can be overcome with the deepening of reform.
</P>
<P>
Major difficulties plaguing these enterprises can be overcome
in the framework of public ownership, they say. The difficulties
include large debts, surplus labor, poor efficiency, and out-dated
facilities.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang Da, a well-known economist and professor
from the People's University of China, public ownership should not
be blamed for the existing difficulties. It is the fault of the
operational mechanism and irrational industrial structure that
came into being under central planning, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1979 when China started its reform program, a series of
reform policies have been implemented for state-owned enterprises
such as responsibility contracting and giving enterprises more
decision-making powers.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, state-owned enterprises received heavier does of
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
After visiting nearly 50 state-owned enterprises across China,
Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee, noted," It is normal to have different
views in the experimental stage. We should push ahead with bold
experiments in order to find problems and sum up experience."
</P>
<P>
Last September, the Fifth Plenary Session of the 14th CPC
Central Committee put forward a proposal on establishing a modern
enterprise system in line with the principles of "clearer property
rights, defined rights and responsibilities, separation of
functions between government and enterprise and scientific
management."
</P>
<P>
This was followed by a new scheme which can be summarized as
"optimizing large and superior enterprises while letting free
small ones."
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the State Council moved ahead with its pilot
experiment project involving 100 enterprises that centers on the
establishment of a modern enterprise system. Such reform has also
started in 2,000 provincial-level enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, another experiment with the aim of relieving
the debt burdens of state-owned enterprises has been going on
smoothly in 18 major Chinese cities. The move has cut debt
totaling 10.1 billion yuan and separated more than 4,000
non-productive institutions and 1.4 million surplus people from
industrial enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Down by 5.8 Percent in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Inflation rate in Uganda fell to
5.8 percent in February from 8.5 percent in the previous month,
according to statistics made known by the ministry of Finance and
Economic Planning here today.
</P>
<P>
The statistics indicated that decreases in the annual headline
inflation rate for the year ended February were observed in food,
beverages, tobacco, clothing, footwear as well as transport and
communication group.
</P>
<P>
These low figures were mainly as a result of decreases in the
prices of fresh food produce, local and bottled beer, textiles,
petrol and bicycle spar parts, they showed.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the prices of petrol were cut down by 10 percent
due to the strengthening of the Uganda Shilling.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1995/96 national budget, inflation would be
targeted at about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government is determined to keep inflation down through
concerted financial discipline.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Official Appeals to Helping Mothers in Impoverished Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior official with China's
top advisory body called for the whole society to care for and
help mothers in the country's poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guangmei, member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National
Committee and wife of former President Liu Shaoqi, made the appeal
at the CPPCC annual session.
</P>
<P>
"Poor mothers work very hard to raise children and take care of
their families to the neglect of themselves," Wang said. "To help
these poor mothers is also to come to the aid of their kids."
</P>
<P>
Relevant statistics show there are 70 million impoverished
people in China, and poor mothers suffer most because of low
income, illiteracy and poor health.
</P>
<P>
"Happiness Project", with Wang Guangmei as director of its
organizing committee, is aimed at helping mothers in the country's
undeveloped areas. It was launched in February last year at the
sponsorship of by the China Population Welfare Foundation, Family
Planning Association of China and "China Population News".
</P>
<P>
The project, different from other relief projects, offers
cattle, sheep and chemical fertilizers instead of money to the
poor mothers to help them overcome poverty by their own
self-reliant efforts, she said.
</P>
<P>
People from both at home and overseas responded to the project
and contributed donations.
</P>
<P>
Beginning April last year, the "Happiness Project" was tried
out in some counties in Gansu, Guizhou, Shaanxi and Anhui
provinces. For example, in Lixian County in Gansu Province, where
each poor mother was given two sheep, which have produced lambs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the piloting counties have opened literary courses
for mothers to learn how to read and write, and provide medical
services to help improve their health condition.
</P>
<P>
Generally, loans in kind were granted for the implementation of
the "Happiness Project" and, after their repayment in two years,
poor mothers will be subsequent subsidized, Wang said. She pledged
that there would not be any possibility for misuse of these funds.
</P>
<P>
The "Happiness Project" plans to select 11 piloting places
during the first half of this year, and more mothers will be
benefited as more funds are to be donated to its implementation.

macro-economic controls, China should set up a 'financial transfer
of payment' system," wrote Dr. Hu An'gang, an economist with the
Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the proposal in the recently-published "Regional
Disparities in China", the result of a survey on regional
development across the country over a period of more than two
years.
</P>
<P>
In establishing the system, the 'tax sharing' system should
stick to the principle of "financial contribution matching
economic contribution", or, the greater the economic growth the
greater the financial contribution to the central government, he
suggested.
</P>
<P>
The central government's actual receipts or tax revenues, apart
from those reimbursements to localities, as a share of GDP have
fallen, widening the gap between different regions after a 'tax
sharing' system was introduced in 1994, according to the
economist, an expert on China's development.
</P>
<P>
"Under the 'tax sharing' system, rich provinces get back more,
and poor ones get back less," Hu, who was educated at Yale
University, explained.
</P>
<P>
"Areas with per capita GDP lower than the national average
should receive higher per capita financial assistance from the
central government," he noted. "The proportion of ethnic minority
people living in a region should be taken into account."
</P>
<P>
"Expenditures should mainly be transferred vertically, that is,
the central government should get part of its finances from
the 'tax sharing' system and distribute it to localities. As a
supplement, developed regions should also help poorer ones through
partnership programs.
</P>
<P>
"Financial aid should no longer be unconditional," he pointed
out, "It should aim at improving the 'producing of blood' rather
than simply 'transfusions of blood'."
</P>
<P>
Financial aid should mainly be used to build infrastructure and
to develop human resources in less developed regions, according to
the survey.
</P>
<P>
"There is now a good opportunity to set up the 'financial
transfer of payment' system as the new fiscal year and the new
five-year plan (the ninth, 1996-2000) will begin soon.
</P>
<P>
"If the 'financial transfer of payment' system is not put in
place in time, it will be postponed until the next five-year plan."
</P>
<P>
"Another reason for using the system is that the Ninth
Five-Year Plan proposes to 'gradually narrow the gaps in regional
development' and the system will lay the foundation for achieving
this goal," Hu emphasized.

MEXICO CITY, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Mexico said today it is
determined to defend the interests of its farmers and the rights
granted to it by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Commerce and Industrial Promotion issued a
communique today that Mexico will continue to fight against new
protectionist actions blocking Mexican exports to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The communique was issued after Florida Agricultural
Commissioner Bob Crawford filed a lawsuit with the International
Trade Commission under the World Trade Organization, complaining
against sales of Mexican tomatoes and peppers in his state.
</P>
<P>
Also, avocado growers in California reportedly appealed to
American President Bill Clinton to uphold the ban on imports of
the fruit, which has been in power since 1914.
</P>
<P>
It still maintains severe restrictions on the entry of Mexican
truck drivers who should have been granted free access from
December 18, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, Canada and the United States signed the NAFTA accord
more than two years ago but Mexican farmers have time and again
complained protectionist violations from their northern
neighbors.

<HEADLINE> U.S. MIA Team Winds up Visit to Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. presidential delegation on
Americans Missing in Action (MIA) in Vietnam left here this
morning after a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
This was the first such visit since the normalization of
relations between Vietnam and the United States last July.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Communist Party leader Do Muoi said Vietnam has done
and will continue to do all it can to help settle the MIA issue
and he sympathized with the U.S. government, veteran organizations
and all MIA families in the United States.
</P>
<P>
But he appealed to the delegation for U.S. cash to help trace
the missing as searching for MIAs requires both money and time.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation was led jointly by Hershel Gober, Deputy
Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs; Kent Wiederman,
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, and James Wold, Deputy
Assistant Secretary of Defense.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials were met by Do Muoi, Prime Minister Vo Van
Kiet and Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports quoted Gober as describing his meetings
with the Vietnamese officials as useful and quoted Do Muoi as
saying that Vietnam regards the MIA issue as a humanitarian one.
</P>
<P>
Do Muoi said that the Vietnamese Communist Party and the
government have instructed local authorities at all levels to make
more efforts to search for Americans and Vietnamese still listed
as missing in action in the Vietnam War which ended more than 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Do Muoi was quoted as saying that he hopes both sides will
promote their cooperation in settling all humanitarian issues left
over by the war.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Afforestation Makes Macao Greener (by Che Yuming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Years of afforestation efforts have
turned the densely-populated Macao into a place where trees and
flowers can be seen almost anywhere from a street corner to around
a building.
</P>
<P>
The green coverage rate in Macao has almost doubled in the past
decade as the result of an afforestation campaign that has been
going on for 15 years, a Macao municipal official told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
On the 6.7-square-kilometer Macao Peninsula, where over 90
percent of the population lives, the green coverage rate has been
improved from less than 3.5 percent to over six percent.
</P>
<P>
On Macao's two islands, the tree coverage rate has topped 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
The official said the afforestation movement would continue
although places for municipal construction and industrial
development are in a short supply.
</P>
<P>
Luis de Azeredo Falcao, an engineer with the afforestation
office of the Macao municipal government, said Macao would conduct
a series of activities next week to promote awareness of
protecting trees and to plant more trees.
</P>
<P>
The activities will include exhibition of garden designs and
lectures and picture contests on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Ornamental plants and relevant books will be presented to local
citizens while special postcards and envelopes will be issued.
</P>
<P>
"We will mainly do our promotion campaigns among students,"
said Falcao.
</P>
<P>
He added that more than 40 institutions are expected to
participate in the activities and thousands of trees are to be
planted this year.
</P>
<P>
The local government has decided to invest some 447,000 patacas
(about 57,500 US dollars) in the afforestation campaign in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"We aim at making Macao a place full of vitality," he said,
"and planting trees is the best way to make the environment
beautiful."

<HEADLINE> Thai Finance Ministry Denies Plans on Swap Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand has not
proposed a swap tax to curb short-term foreign capital inflows, a
senior official of the Thai Finance Ministry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank just proposed that the government increase the
withholding tax on non-resident baht accounts from 10 percent to
15 percent, said Permanent Secretary of the Finance Ministry Chatu
Mongkok Sonakul.
</P>
<P>
Recent media reports said the bank proposed that a swap tax
would be levied every time foreign investors swap US dollars or
other foreign currencies into the Thai baht before depositing the
money in non-resident baht accounts.
</P>
<P>
The measure is aimed at raising the cost of short-term foreign
capital inflows to enjoy the country's high interest rate in a bid
to cut the country's current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
Yet officials from the Central Bank admitted that the bank is
studying new measures to trim the inflows of "hot" money,
according to local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Thailand currently has restrictions on non-residents to
deposit foreign currencies in its banks. Foreigners usually have
to convert foreign currencies into the Thai baht before putting
their money in Thai banks.

<HEADLINE> EU Hopes U.S. Bill on Cuba Will Not Impede Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) hopes
U.S. legislation will not hinder EU's trade with Cuba, a French
Foreign Ministry spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
While the EU has no intention of interfering in U.S.-Cuban
relations it hopes the U.S. Congress will not pass a bill which
will affect European business activities in Cuba, he added.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. laws have no exterritoriality and even the U.N. Security
Council has not yet decided to apply sanctions on Cuba," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
EU countries coordinated their stance on trade with Cuba last
week.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress last week approved the Helms-Burton bill to
tighten economic and trade sanctions against Cuba after it shot
down two U.S. private planes allegedly flying over its air space.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is investigating the incident in which four
pilots, members of an exiled Cuban group in the U.S. were killed.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton is due to sign the bill today to make it
law. It's highly unlikely Clinton will veto the bill as he is
toughening up his foreign policy stand to woo more voters in the
upcoming presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The bill allows Cuban exiles in the U.S. to sue foreign
companies using their confiscated property in Cuba. The U.S.'
European allies and Canada, who have an increasing number of firms
in Cuba, have strongly criticized the bill.

KIEV, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian and Ukrainian presidents
Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kuchma today agreed to send their prime
ministers to meet in Moscow March 15-16 to clear way for their
upcoming summit, a highly-claimed event intended to improve mutual
ties.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's early April visit to Ukraine was nailed down during a

An all-wrapping pact setting the tone for a new partnership is

</P>
<P>
Implementation of the Agreement on Black Sea Fleet signed last
June will be carefully reviewed by the prime ministers at the
first session of the Russo-Ukraine mixed committee.

Long at loggerheads over the Black Sea fleet issue, the two
countries have been forced to put off the summit and the creation
of a bilateral political accord was obstructed.

RIO DE JANEIRO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian investments in
Cuba will not be affected by the U.S. anti-Cuba "Helms-Burton
Bill", government sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian Souza Cruz company, which has links with the
London-based British America Tobacco company, has a 120-million
U.S. dollar investment in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
But Foreign Ministry sources said its investment would be
unaffected by the U.S. bill, aimed at tightening the 35-year-old
embargo against Cuba after it downed two American civilians planes.
</P>
<P>
The bill stipulates sanctions against foreign investors who use
properties confiscated by the Cuban authorities.
</P>
<P>
The sources from the ministry pointed out that the Souza Cruz
company which invested in Cuba did not purchase any real estate on
the island that had been confiscated from U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian government opposes the U.S. economic embargo
against Cuba, the sources said.

Last year Brazil exported about 40 million dollars of goods to
Cuba and imported 70 million dollars worth of merchandise.

Jamaat-e-Islami, which launched the non-cooperation campaign from
March 9 to press for the resignation of the government.
</P>

</P>
<P>
While announcing the relaxation, the mainstream opposition
parties urged the people to continue non-cooperation campaign
until the fall of the government.

<HEADLINE> Dole Wins In "Super Tuesday" Primaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Majority Leader
Bob Dole has virtually wrapped up the Republican presidential
nomination as he won a landslide victory in at least six of the
seven states' GOP primaries tonight.
</P>
<P>
Early returns showed that the 72-year-old Republican
presidential front-runner defeated his two remnant rivals,
conservative TV commentator Pat Buchanan and multimillionaire
magazine publisher Steve Forbes by more than 2-to-1 margins in
Florida, Texas, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
In what was described as "Super Tuesday" primaries, Republican
voters in Florida, Texas, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Oregon
and Louisiana today elected delegates to the Republican National
Convention to be held in San Diego in August. At least 996
delegates are required for a Republican presidential runner to win
the nomination for the party's candidate for the White House at
the August convention.
</P>
<P>
Dole had 392 delegates from earlier victories coming into
"Super Tuesday." Today's victory would lead Dole to win two-thirds
of the delegates needed to clinch the nomination.
</P>
<P>
"Today, the American people in seven states chose the
conservative they want to lead America, chose the conservative
they want in the White House," Dole told a victory rally in
Washington tonight.
</P>
<P>
Dole held out to his remaining rivals and called them to "put
our ideas together" to beat Democratic President Bill Clinton in
elections on November 5.
</P>
<P>
But neither Buchanan and Forbes has showed signs to join Dole
in his bid to capture the White House.

<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Non-aligned
Movement (NAM) expressed its concern here today over the growing
tendency of some countries to resort to unilateral qualification
of the policies of other countries in their own self-interest.
</P>
<P>
The use of unilateral evaluation, qualification and
certification measures is inconsistent with NAM's principles of
equality of state sovereignty and non-intervention, the
movement said in a communique.
</P>
<P>
The NAM reiterated the commitments made by the heads of its
more than 100 members at the XI summit in Cartagena, Colombia,
last year to fight all kinds of unilateral and coercive
conditionalities, measures, regulations and policies threatened
against or imposed on member states.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan government troops
Tuesday unleashed a major rocket, artillery and bomb attack on the
Taliban militia near Kabul, said a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
An Afghan Defense Spokesman was quoted as saying, "the
Taliban's heavy weapon sites and military barracks were mainly
targeted."
</P>
<P>
The Afghan government's jets bombed the key Taliban base at
Charasyab, 25 kilometers south of Kabul, five times Tuesday,
killing 16 Taliban fighters and destroying two vehicles.
</P>
<P>
"Taliban for the past two days have targeted our positions and
the government troops have to respond," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Taliban had reinforced their frontlines near Charasyab
recently, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We have proposed peace talks to all the Afghan opposition
groups and will not take any such military action unless there is
no option left open to us," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the Afghan government's attack came just one
day ahead of the planned visit of UN special envoy to Afghanistan
Mehmud Mestiri to the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Mestiri had come to mediate among the Afghan warlords in the
first two months of 1996, but failed to break the ice.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian legislators from
different political parties have criticized the U.S. intention to
sanction against countries which trade with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Oyden Ortega, chairman of the Assembly Foreign Relations
Committee, said the U.S. bill violates the
constitutional charters of the Organization of American States and
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Ortega added the Assembly passed a resolution on June 1, 1995,
rejecting the U.S. anti-Cuba "Helms-Burton" Bill. The resolution
made it clear that issues between two countries should not have
repercussions on other countries.
</P>
<P>
Former assembly leader Balbina Herrera noted that the United
States can not tell Panama with whom it can or can not do business
since Panama has the right to establish friendships with whomever
it pleases.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the Cuban situation should be decided by the
Cubans, not other countries.
</P>
<P>
Victoria Figge, general manager of the Duty Free Zone of Colon,
said the U.S. bill against Cuba will not affect the zone's
operations. But she predicted "problems with the United States"
because the zone maintains a sales volume of 50 million
U.S. dollars with Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Sarajevo Mayor Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The mayor of Sarajevo, Tarik
Kupusovic, resigned on Tuesday in protest at the creation of a
Muslim-dominated Sarajevo government, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The BH Press news agency said that Kupusovic wrote to Bosnian
President Alija Izetbegovic that he was resigning over the "manner
of the inauguration of the Sarajevo canton Monday."
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian federation's constitution, agreed upon by Croats
and Muslims in 1994, stipulates that the Bosnian capital has a
special status to guard its multi-ethnic nature.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton peace treaty sought to change that status by handing
power in the Sarajevo regional government to Muslim-dominated
authorities to end the ethnic parity rule.
</P>
<P>
The Sarajevo assembly voted to formalize the change on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kupusovic said that he disagreed with the transformation of the
assembly into an ethnically one-sided institution because it had
not yet been approved by the constitution.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the way the wishes of Croats have been ignored
represents "a suicide of Sarajevo."

BANGKOK, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaria cases are now on the rise
along the Thai-Cambodian border in Aranyaprathet district of Sa
Kaew province, according to a Thai Public Health official.
</P>
<P>
Today's Bangkok Post quoted Surasak Phosri, chief of the
Aranyaprathet-based malaria diseases control unit, as saying that
there have so far been 186 cases of malaria reported to his office
since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The increase is obvious considering there were only 129 cases
reported during the whole of 1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ongoing fighting in Cambodia may be causing the disease to
spread because many troops from both the government and Khmer
Rouge sides are believed to be malaria carriers.
</P>
<P>
Mosquitoes have also caused the disease to spread across the
border, Surasak added.

BANGKOK, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand and the
central banks of 10 other Southeast Asian and Pacific economies
will form as Asian BIS (bank for international settlements) Fund,
hoping to create closer financial cooperation among members.
</P>
<P>
The Asian BIS is expected to be an upgraded form of the
executives meeting of East Asia Pacific Central Bank (EMEAP).
</P>
<P>
Other members are Hong Kong, Japan, Australia, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, China, New Zealand and South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
The Asian BIS fund will aim to provide financial support and
share know-how between members, Rerngchai Marakanond, deputy
governor of the Bank of Thailand was quoted by today's Bangkok
Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
The first talks between central bank governors of all 11
members of the Asian BIS, which will be officially formed soon,
will be held this July.
</P>
<P>
Rerngchai said the Asian BIS will exchange ideas on the
management of central bank official reserves, money market
liquidity and money infrastructure (money transaction system).
</P>
<P>
The central banks of the Asian BIS members, Rerngchai said,
will have to put their money down as Asian BIS capital. The Asian
BIS then will play an important role when members are facing
financial crisis.

<P>
The fund will also help finance regional development project,

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition Requests Support for No-confidence  Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition Communist
Party of Nepal (UML) has asked other parties in the parliament to
support a no-confidence motion against the government in a special
House session next week.
</P>
<P>
The National Democratic Party (RPP), the second ruling partner
in the present coalition government, Tuesday received an official
letter from the UML party requesting for its support to the
motion, one RPP leader said.
</P>
<P>
RPP holds the key to survival of the three-party government led
by the Nepali Congress (NC) party with its 19 seats in the House
of Representatives. UML and the main ruling NC party have 88 and
86 seats respectively in the 205-seat House.
</P>
<P>
UML leaders said Tuesday that they had approached all parties
represented in the parliament except NC for their support to the
no-confidence motion, which would be tabled by UML in the
forthcoming House session.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, soon after King Birendra announced to convene the
special House session on March 20 under the demand by UML, Prime
Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba Tuesday called an emergency meeting of
his cabinet to discuss how to tackle the UML challenge.
</P>
<P>
It was reported all ministers from RPP at the meeting had
assured Deuba that they would face the motion unitedly but they
said their party had not reached any decision over the UML's
motion.
</P>
<P>
It was expected the RPP parliamentary party would hold a
meeting today to review the current political situation and make
its decision on the regard of the no-confidence motion.

SOFIA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Slovenian President Milan Kucan
arrived here today for a two-day visit to strengthen economic and
trade ties with Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
Kucan will hold talks with his Bulgarian counterpart, Zheliu
Zhelev, during which agreements are expected on the establishment
of a bilateral free-trade zone, the cancellation of double
taxation, mutual investment protection and economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Slovenian president will seek Bulgaria's help in applying for
membership of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Zone while
Bulgaria will ask for Slovenia's support in its bid to join the
Central European Free Trade Zone.
</P>
<P>
When he arrived this morning, Kucan appealed for peace in the
Balkans and praised the Dayton peace accord which ended the
conflict in the former Yugoslavia last November.
</P>
<P>
"All Balkan nations should have realized that they should live
in peace," he said, adding that neither money nor force had been
able to bring peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed peace in the Balkans would be beneficial
to Bulgaria and Slovenia, which both have suffered considerably
from international sanctions against the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The visit is the first by Kucan since he led the tiny former
Yugoslav republic with a two-million population to independence in
July 1991 and became its president several months later.

<HEADLINE> Spain Expects Steady Government Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Spain's two main parties, the
Popular Party (PP) and the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party
(SSWP), today agreed to a smooth and steady transition of
government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting outgoing socialist prime minister Felipe
Gonzalez, Jose Maria Aznar, leader of the conservative Popular
Party which won last week's Spanish election, appealed to
political parties to respect the result of the elections and
cooperate with his party.
</P>
<P>
The PP won 39 percent of votes in the elections on March 3,
taking power from the SSWP which has governed the country for the
last 13 years. But the PP doesn't have enough seats to form a
majority and is now seeking to form alliances with other parties
to gain the necessary majority to form a government.
</P>
<P>
Aznar is likely to seek support from nationalists from
Catalonian, Vasco, and Canarian autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
The conservative leader said his first "contact" in seeking
alliances, particularly with Catalonian nationalists, had been
positive, and believed that his action of forming a "stable and
durable" government will get support from those autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing prime minister Gonzalez, also head of the SSWP, said
his party is in favor of an accord between the PP and nationalists
to form a government, while underlining the "difficulties" of
their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He described his meeting with Aznar as "cordial and
constructive" and said he hoped for a stable government and a
peaceful atmosphere in domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
He also said there are no disputes between the two on the
country's foreign policy.

<HEADLINE> China Unveils Anti-Poverty Program (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In three remote prefectures inhabited mostly by Tibetans in
southern Qinghai, many farmers do not have access to drinking
water and electricity and live a nomadic life.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government's aid-the-poor program focuses on
building permanent residences, animal pens and grassland for
farmers as well as herdsmen there.
</P>
<P>
Dingxi Prefecture in Gansu Province, well known for the poverty
of its farmers, has lifted more than 400,000 people out of poverty
in the past 40 years by building water conservancy projects and
terraced fields and improving soil in valleys with small rivers.
</P>
<P>
Not a single death, of starvation, occurred in the area last
year when a long drought, not seen in 60 years, struck the the
prefecture, according to a Dingxi deputy to the Nation People's
Congress here in session.
</P>
<P>
The central government calls on the entire nation to provide
help for the still destitute population.
</P>
<P>
Wu Renbao, an NPC deputy from Huaxi Village of Jiangsu, a
booming province in east China, said that Huaxi will help 100,000
people in central and western China to bid farewell to poverty in
the next five years and enable 10,000 of them to lead a relatively
comfortable life.
</P>
<P>
Huaxi began constructing two "Huaxi villages" in the
northwestern autonomous region of Ningxia last year and has since
launched a number of labor-intensive enterprises there, according
to Wu.
</P>
<P>
He said he is optimistic about the country's poverty
elimination program.
</P>
<P>
"The ratio of the destitute to the affluent in China is one to
three now, or 65 million to 200 million. With every three people
helping each poor person, common prosperity can be achieved," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The largest private business in the Chinese mainland -- the
Hope Group -- has invested more than 100 million yuan in launching
factories that aim to help the poor. The group is to invest
another 100 million yuan soon, said Liu Yonghao, board chairman of
the group and a member of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, the country's top
advisory body.
</P>
<P>
"Economic returns on investment in poverty-stricken areas may
come slow and be low, but what we are doing is in the interests of
the nation and ourselves," Liu said.

<HEADLINE> China Unveils Anti-poverty Program (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China is determined to eliminate
poverty for 65 million people still living a destitute life by the
turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the goals set by the Chinese government in its
new five-year plan for 1996-2000 made known to the public by Li
Peng, premier of the State Council, in his report on the plan at
the ongoing session of the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
The premier said it is an arduous task to provide adequate food
and clothing for all the rural poor in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
In the report, he urged governments at all levels to step up
the effort to assist poor areas and earnestly implement the
state's anti-poverty program.
</P>
<P>
Eliminating poverty has been an important item on the agenda of
the Chinese government. In 1978, 150 million Chinese were living
under the poverty line. Years of poverty-relief efforts have
eliminated poverty for more than half of its poor population.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the number of people living under the
poverty line had been cut to 65 million.
</P>
<P>
Chinese economists are cautious about the government's
anti-poverty program, saying most poverty-stricken people live in
remote areas of northwest and southwest China with poor
transportation, deteriorating living and production conditions. It
is no easy task to pull them out of destitution, they say.
</P>
<P>
And, to accomplish the task of eliminating absolute poverty
throughout the country by the year 2000 means annual poverty
elimination for 13 million people, an arduous task, they say.
</P>
<P>
Officials are more confident. Chen Jinhua, minister in charge
of the State Planning Commission, said recently that China's
anti-poverty effort will be enhanced with its continued growth in
overall economic strength.
</P>
<P>
"In the coming five years, the central government will set
aside five billion yuan in the form of materials for poor areas as
assistance for local economic development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed confidence that the anti-poverty program will be
accomplished with success.
</P>
<P>
Local officials emphasize the importance of improving
production and living conditions in poor areas to prevent a return
to poverty after relief money and materials are used up.
</P>
<P>
In northwest China's Qinghai Province, for example, 830,000
people are still living under the poverty line. Most of them live
in dry mountainous and cold areas.
</P>
<P>
Tian Chenping, governor of the province, said the province will
concentrate on improving production and living conditions in these
areas. Specifically, he said, assistance will be given to them for
building irrigation projects, grasslands, drinking water
facilities and roads. The province is also seeking international
assistance, he said.

<P>
VIENNA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's economy will
weaken in 1996, with sluggish growth of just 2 percent and Germany
leading the downward slide, the Vienna Institute for Economic
Research estimated.
</P>
<P>
Concern over the continuing economic fallout in EU countries at
the start of the year has led the institute's experts to cut their
previous 1996 growth estimates for EU member states by one quarter
to a half of a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
December's forecasts of 2.3 percent growth for the EU, 2
percent growth for Germany and 1.6 percent for Austria, then seen
as quite conservative, is overoptimistic, Georg Busch, an expert
with the institute told the Austrian Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
Another body, the German Institute for Economic Research has
estimated Germany's gross domestic product for the first quarter
of this year will fall one percentage point on the last quarter of
1995, double the last seasonally adjusted quarterly fall.
</P>
<P>
The institute said that the Austrian economy almost came to a
standstill in the latter half of last year.

<HEADLINE> Overfishing Threatens Latin American Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Overfishing is leading to a
depletion of marine life and threatening Latin American seafood
exports, a U.N. report has warned.
</P>
<P>
The industry can expect little growth over the next few years
because of previous overfishing, the U.N. Economic Commission for
Latin America says in its report on the region's marine exports.
</P>
<P>
But producers of shellfish and mollusks can expect a softer
ride than other fish producers because this kind of seafood can be
cultivated in farms set up along the coast, says the report.
</P>
<P>
Overfishing, which is threatening certain species of sea life,
is partly blamed on changing tastes and fashions which have led to
rising demand for fresh fish.
</P>
<P>
Catches of seafood have fallen in most Latin American countries
although the production of fresh and frozen fish has risen in
Argentina, Chile, Cuba and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 percent of Latin American marine exports consist of
shellfish and mollusks. Ecuador, Argentina and Mexico are the
biggest producers, accounting for more than two thirds of Latin
American production in 1992, says the report.
</P>
<P>
Fresh and frozen fish account for 28 percent of the region's
seafood exports, and fishmeal for 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. report says that the shellfish and mollusk sector will
continue to be the most important product categories as shellfish
can be cultivated in tanks in coastal waters.

<HEADLINE> MERCOSUR, Chile Resume Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Negotiations between the
four-nation Latin American trade bloc MERCOSUR and Chile resumed
today to pave the way for Chile's entry into the organization.
</P>
<P>
The two-day talks are aimed at finalizing a list of tariff
exemptions for export products.
</P>
<P>
The two sides must reach agreement by the end of March, the
deadline for deciding Chile's entry to the bloc and for the expiry
of preferential trade agreements with MERCOSUR countries --
Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
Chile and MERCOSUR, also known as the Southern Cone Common
Market, agreed to accelerate negotiations on Chile's accession to
the bloc or at least to extend its preferential trade agreements
at a meeting last December in Montevideo, Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations are a continuation of February's talks
which yielded little progress due to disagreements over the
breadth of the tariff exemptions and the transition period,
especially for several agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
MERCOSUR has rejected Chile's demands to include imports of
several sensitive products including wheat, meat, oil, fruit,
footwear, and cars in the list of exemptions.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Germany's Trade Surplus Hits Record High in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Germany's trade surplus hit a high
of 93.4 billion marks (about 62 billion U.S. dollars) in 1995, the
highest this decade, but trade is forecast to worsen in 1996 due
to a sharp increase in the value of the mark.
</P>
<P>
Figures released today by the Federal Statistical Bureau showed
exports rose 5.4 per cent last year to 727.6 billion marks (485
billion dollars) in the year, while imports rose 2.7 per cent to
634.2 billion marks (423 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
But the current account had an overall deficit of 24.8 billion
marks (17 billion dollars) due to large deficits on unrequited
transfers and services.
</P>
<P>
The FSB predicted a worsening trade situation for 1996 since
the sharp increase in the mark's foreign exchange rate is
beginning to have a negative impact.
</P>
<P>
Exports and imports fell 2.7 percent and 6.9 percent
respectively in December 1995.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Improve phone Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The telecommunications
administration of the Chinese capital plans to take several
measures this year to deal with complaints from local residents
and improve service quality, "China Daily" said today.
</P>
<P>
Complaints have mainly focused on difficulties in installing
phones, relocation of phones and maintenance service quality.
</P>
<P>
A time limit of three months has been set by the Beijing
Telecommunications Administration for installing telephones in
urban districts or 45 days in suburban areas.
</P>
<P>
To make telephone maintenance service more convenient , the
administration has required that the repair of telephones be
completed within 72 hours if it is a cable problem and 24 hours
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
The relocation of urban telephones should be completed within
two months while the service takes as long as one month for
relocation in the outskirts.
</P>
<P>
A set of rules of punishment has been drafted to deal with
cases of time-limit violations by telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
A total of 15,000 public phones are expected to be installed by
the end of this year to meet the increasing demand for
telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
Immediate operation of digital mobile phones will be guaranteed
after the charge is paid.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is expected to strengthen its social supervision system
by awarding those who report offenses by service staff, the paper
said.

<HEADLINE> State Probes Prices of Agricultural Supplies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The State Planning Commission
launched new inspections of prices of agricultural production
materials, especially chemical fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
The move, which started on March 10 and will last until May 20,
was made in response to continuous price hikes in the sector as a
result of chemical fertilizer shortage and poor management of the
market, today's "China Daily" quoted Li Zengqi, deputy director of
the Price Inspection Department under the State Planning
Commission, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The SPC earlier issued a circular urging local price management
authorities to re-examine implementation of State policies on
prices of farm production materials since 1995, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He added that key farm production materials like chemical
fertilizers are controlled by the state so they can be adequately
distributed and used.
</P>
<P>
A considerable number of units and individuals were punished
last year for illegally raising prices, Li said.
</P>
<P>
But the chaos is still not "satisfactorily stopped," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
To develop grain and cotton production, the circular called for
close attention from the localities and central government
ministries regarding inspection and welcomed public supervision.
</P>
<P>
Also yesterday, the SPC and the State Statistics Bureau
announced the price change of retail goods in 30 provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions and 36 major cities for the
first two months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The report indicated that the country witnessed an average 7.7
percent growth in retail goods prices, as compared the same period
last year.

CANBERRA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Australian housing finance
rose 8.4 percent seasonally adjusted in January over the previous
month.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
today showed that the housing industry strengthened with the
construction or purchase of 39,359 units of dwelling houses being
funded in the month.
</P>
<P>
The rise in the housing finance was higher than expected.
Local economists predicted a rise of 3.5 percent in January
following an unexpected fall of 6 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
The January figure was 10.7 percent higher than one year ago on
a seasonally adjusted basis. It was 0.2 percent higher over
December in trend terms.
</P>
<P>
The ABS figures indicated that the housing industry in
Australia is slowly gathering steam after sliding into a two-year
slump due to over-supply of houses and higher interest rates.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China's legal construction
achieved new progress last year with more laws approved and the
supervision over law-enforcement strengthened, "People's Daily"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the National People's Congress (NPC), the country's
top legislature, and its Standing Committee deliberated 37 draft
laws and draft law-related decisions, and had 24 of them passed.
</P>
<P>
Most of these laws concern economic issues such as banking
operation, insurance, negotiable instruments, electric power,
pollution by solid wastes and financial crimes, so that the
framework of laws in the service of socialist market economy has
become increasingly distinct.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee also approved 11 treaties,
conventions and agreements with other countries last year.
</P>
<P>
At the on-going NPC Fourth Session, the draft Law on
Administrative Publishment and the draft Amendments to the
Criminal Procedure Law are under deliberation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local people's congresses and their standing
committees formulated more than 1,500 local laws and regulations
in 1995, most of which were law codes regulating economic
activities in the localities.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the enactment of laws, the NPC intensified its
supervision over the conduct of government functionaries and
law-enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
In response to some hot topics among the public, the NPC
organized and sent 17 teams to inspect and look into the
implementation of laws with regard to anti-drug, environmental
protection, protection of women's rights and interests, and
agricultural production.

<P>
SAN JOSE, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Two European women kidnapped on
January 1 in Costa Rica were set free today after a ransom of
200,000 U.S. dollars was paid, according to newspapers here.
</P>
<P>
The two women were turned over to their relatives in northern
Costa Rica by the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
They were abducted during a robbery by an armed group in a
hotel near the Nicaraguan border where they were celebrating the
New Year as tourists.
</P>
<P>
Their release occurred following negotiations of the kidnappers
with their relatives, who made contact with each other on the
Costa Rica-Nicaragua border Monday.
</P>
<P>
The identity of the kidnappers, who called themselves as
"Viviana Gallardo," the name of a political leader assassinated
last decade in a Costa Rican jail, remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the ransom, the kidnappers also asked for salary
increases for workers and prices freezing from the Costa Rican
government, but both were rejected.

<HEADLINE> 135-Million-Year-Old Dinosaur Fossils Found in Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Fossil remains of a dinosaur,
that lived more than 135 million years ago, have been found in the
southwest of Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Part of a thigh bone and some teeth of the dinosaur belonging
to the Jurassic Era were among the findings made by a group from
Maracaibo University in the state of Tachira.
</P>
<P>
John Moody, researcher and director of the Biology Museum of
the University of Zulia, said that the dinosaur teeth measure two
to three meters in length.
</P>
<P>
The fossil remains belong to a species much older than that
found two years ago in the same area.
</P>
<P>
Paleontologists are studying the fossils and researchers
believe the area where the dinosaur fossils were unearthed is of
great archaeological significance as large quantities of fossils
of teeth, bones and scales of Jurassic-Era fish were also found in
the place.
</P>
<P>
Dinosaurs were egg-laying reptiles that lived in the Mesozoic
Era, between 65 and 225 million years ago.

<HEADLINE> IMF Agrees on Conditional Loan to Azerbaijan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) agreed Tuesday to give Azerbaijan a
multi-million-U.S.-dollar loan if the country commits itself to
privatization and economic reform.
</P>
<P>
An agreement to this effect was struck by Azeri President
Geidar Aliyev and IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus after
talks in Baku, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Azerbaijan will receive about 350 million
U.S. dollars within three years. The first credit of some 80
million on favorable terms will arrive by the month end to
privatize 8,000 small enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Once it completes this privatization and drafts a new
three-year economic restructure plan, Azerbaijan will have access
to another 260 to 350 million.
</P>
<P>
IMF experts are to assist Azerbaijan in drafting the
restructuring program within three months.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said it is time for Azerbaijan to launch economic
reform now which requires its leadership to create necessary
legal, logistical and constitutional conditions.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Azerbaijan should set up private and
joint-stock companies, cut administrative apparatus and privatize
the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Accords also were reached on Azerbaijan's resettlement of
refugees and displaced people from the prolonged conflict between
Azerbaijan and neighboring Armenia over the disputed
Nagorno-Karabakh region, and the economic restoration of
conflict-involved territories.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan and Armenia have fought each other for years for the
control of Azerbaijan's breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region which is
inhabited mostly by Armenians, leaving thousands of civilians
killed and displaced.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan needs help from the IMF and the World Bank to cope
with these problems, said Camdessus, who arrived in Baku Monday
night at the invitation of Aliyev and Azerbaijan's National Bank.
</P>
<P>
The IMF leader will meet Azeri Finance Minister Fikret Yusifov
and opposition leaders today before leaving Baku.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Replaces Tax Service Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 13 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin today
sacked the head of the State Tax Service, Vladimir Gusev,
replacing him with the country's First Deputy Finance Minister
Vitaly Artyukhov.
</P>
<P>
Gusev's dismissal is believed to be linked to the sharp
decrease in tax revenue since the beginning of 1996.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said Gusev was moving to a new job, but
gave no further details.
</P>
<P>
Artyukhov's appointment, at deputy prime ministerial level, was
announced Tuesday afternoon after a working meeting between
Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
Artyukhov, 52, served as a Deputy Transport Minister before he
became First Deputy Finance Minister in 1995. Within the Finance
Ministry, Artyukhov oversaw problems concerning industry, the
transport and construction sectors and the auditing department.
</P>
<P>
Ten days ago he sent a letter to Chernomyrdin proposing an
emergency budget expenses scheme to tide over "pressing
social-economic priorities."

<HEADLINE> Rebel Chechen Military Chief Wounded in Factional Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Aslan Maskhadov, chief of staff of
the rebel Chechen military, has been badly wounded and is
receiving treatment in eastern Chechnya, Itar-Tass reported today.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted a witness as saying that he saw
Maskhadov receiving intravenous injections at a heavily guarded
private house, an impromptu field hospital, in a village near
Gudermes on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass quoted another Chechen resident as claiming to have
witnessed an assassination attempt against Maskhadov last Thursday
near the Chechen settlement at Gerzel-Aul, some 55 kilometers east
of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
The man said that a militiaman, loyal to Salman Raduyev, hit
Maskhadov with a rifle butt and broke his skull.
</P>
<P>
Raduyev, son-in-law of rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev and
mastermind of the raid against Daghestani town of Kizlyar in
January, died a week ago from bullet wounds sustained from a
factional fight.
</P>
<P>
The second witness said that Maskhadov later sustained a wound
in the lung as his men tried to take him to neighboring Daghestan
and hit a land mine in the shallow waters of the Aksai River.
</P>
<P>
Though the pro-Moscow Chechen law enforcement agency could not
confirm the report, Itar-Tass linked Maskhadov's wounding with
Raduyev's death.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said that Maskhadov sharply criticized Raduyev
for the failure of the Pervomaiskoye operation in Daghestan in
January, which led to the deaths of hundreds of Chechen rebel
fighters.

<P>
MADRID, March 12 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Spain's Taugres Vitoria beat
PAOK Salonika of Greece 88-81 in the final to win the European Cup
men's basketball tournament in Vitoria, Spain, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Vitoria seemed to be going to lose its third European Cup final
when it trailed PAOK 50-44 at half-time, but was inspired by Ramon
Rivas to level it 50-50 only three minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
Former cup holder PAOK pulled away again to 64-54 but finally
lost steam in the last minutes, when Vitoria easily ripped through
the Greek defence to sink consecutive points.
</P>
<P>
Vitoria lost only four of its 34 matches at its home court and
Tuesday's victory brought its first European title since the club
was founded 39 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Several objects were thrown on to the court during the game,
but there was never a crowd trouble due to the heavily-deployed
police force at the arena.

billion Australian dollars (3.08 billion US dollars) in each of

next financial year.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Banks Raise Lending Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Two New Zealand leading banks
have raised their lending rates, a local press report said today.
</P>
<P>
The National Bank moved first, quietly withdrawing a five-year
fixed mortgage deal at 8.75 percent and moving its fixed lending
rates up by 0.25 percent. Its one-year fixed rate now stands at
9.5 percent instead of the previous 9.25 percent, while the
floating rate remains unchanged at 9.95 percent.
</P>
<P>
The move was followed by the Bank of New Zealand, which raised
its one year rate to 9.5 percent from 9.0 percent, its two year
rate to 9.75 percent from 9.25 percent and its three year rate to
10.0 percent from 9.25 percent. The new rates are effective from
today.
</P>
<P>
Other banks said they are reviewing their rates and that rises
in wholesale yields will inevitably impact on retail rates despite
a competitive lending market.
</P>
<P>
The rises followed a spike higher in interest rates Monday
reflecting a shake-out in United States bond markets. This came
after sustained upward pressure on yields in recent weeks, the
report said.

<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- British foreign secretary Malcolm
Rifkind said today that his country would do everything it could
to help keep the peace process in the Middle East going on.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an international conference here, Rifkind said: "We
will do all within our power to help combat the terrorists, in
cooperation with the Israeli and Palestinian authorities."
</P>
<P>
"We have helped the Palestinian police in their basic skills
and in public order training, and we are considering further
program, including anti-terrorist work," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind suggested that the European Union, which has approved a
three-year 625 million US dollars aid program to help the
Palestinians, could do more.
</P>
<P>
"I have asked my European colleagues to consider what more we
can do in the light of the new situation. It is incumbent, in
those difficult days, to consider this," he told the conference.
</P>
<P>
He urged all the sides in the Middle East peace process to
continue talking and build upon the establishment of a Palestinian
authority and elections earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"The agreements so far reached between Israel and the
Palestinians lay the foundations for a permanent settlement to the
Arab-Israel dispute and and to enduring peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Distant though that prospect may seem today, it is still worth
the struggle," he added.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls on Accelerating Peace Process in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
called on today both the Government of Angola and the UNITA (the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola) fulfilling
their commitments and accelerating the peace process.
</P>
<P>
After consultations on Angola, current Security Council
President Legwaila Legwaila of Botswana said that the council
considered the recent meeting of top leaders of the two parties
very important.
</P>
<P>
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and UNITA leader Jonas
Savimbi held their fourth meeting on March 1, at which they agreed
a lot of things, including the formation of the Government of
Unity and National Reconciliation. Savimbi submitted to President
dos Santos a list of officials from UNITA in the new government,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The council members looked forward to these agreements and
considered them very important for the peace process in Angola.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the parties will follow through with them and
implement them in time for the formation of the Government of
Unity and National Reconciliation in July," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted the problem of slow progress of the quartering of
troops, particularly the quartering of troops of Savimbi, who has
63,000 troops. Only about 17,000 have been quartered so far.
</P>
<P>
The council expected Savimbi to "rush quartering" of his
troops, he said.
</P>
<P>
As the process of Angola is more than one year old, "we are
going beyond the halfway mark of the process, which is supposed to
terminate in February next year. There is not much time left for
the parties to implement the Lusaka Protocol," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Government of Angola to accelerate the
disengagement of their troops from quartering areas as well,
though the Government has proceeded much better in implementing
the agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council expressed the hope that both parties will
continue their meetings and continue to solve their outstanding
issues. That is the only way the United Nations Angola
Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) will conclude their mission
within the given time, he said.
</P>
<P>
UNAVEM III was established in February 1995 to assist the
parties in restoring peace and achieving national reconciliation
in Angola on the basis of the Lusaka Protocol signed on November
20, 1994.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Withstand Selling Spree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The New York Stock Exchange
witnessed another volatile session Tuesday with blue-chip issues
diving and roaring back, as a sluggish reading on retail sales
enlivened hope for lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Although the Dow Jones industrial average edged up 2.89 points
to 5,583.89 at the end, other indexes declined and most stocks
fell sharply.
</P>
<P>
NYSE decliners led advancers by a margin of 1,474 to 927, with
711 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 453.83 million shares, higher than the
449.46 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 1.36 to 341.39. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.93 to 637.09.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 6.28 to 1,074.22.
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell
2.21 to 559.17.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the well-known index of blue chip companies gained
more than 110 points, its third largest point gain ever, recouping
much of Friday's 171-point sell-off.
</P>
<P>
While there was little specific news to trigger the day's
selling, some analysts attributed the decline to the continuing
turbulence in the bond market. Bonds declined this morning,
sending their interest rates higher.
</P>
<P>
Lower borrowing costs help spur business activity and boost
corporate profits, making stocks and bonds more attractive than
other investments such as savings accounts.

<HEADLINE> NATO "Deeply Concerned" by Situation in Sarajevo's  Suburbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, March 12 (Xinhua) -- NATO and the IFOR commanders
today expressed their "deep concern" about the recent increase in
"arson, beatings and other criminal actions" in the suburbs of
Sarajevo being transferred to Federation control under the terms of
the Dayton Peace Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Today, General George Joulwan, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander
Europe(SACEUR), held a discussion with NATO Secretary General
Javier Solana on the deteriorating situation in the suburbs of
Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the press issued this evening, NATO said
that, pursuant to the discussion, General Joulwan directed the
Commander of the Peace Force in Bosnia, Admiral Leighton Smith to
continue "full support" of the International Police Task
Force(IPTF) and Federation Police in their efforts to provide
effective law enforcement in affected areas around Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Admiral Smith has assured SACEUR
that measures have been put in place, to include substantially
increasing the IFOR presence in those areas, and providing
security for the fire brigades.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn those who have encouraged the mass exodus of
Serbian people from Sarajevo and call on all parties to respect
human rights and to allow civilians to remain in or return to
their homes," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
NATO also said that IFOR had been "working closely" with the
the High Representative Carl Bildt, the IPTF and local leaders to
prevent further such occurrences and to restore calm and order.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Files Action Over Canadian Magazine Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States has filed
complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO) alleging that
Canada unfairly discriminates against U.S. magazines, officials of
the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said today.
</P>
<P>
The case involves an 80 percent excise tax imposed on revenue
from Canadian advertisers taken by a Canadian edition of the U.S.
magazine "Sports Illustrated."
</P>
<P>
Canada has insisted that it has had laws on its books and
magazines since 1965 to protect the nation's magazine industry
from competing by foreign media giants on the Canadian market.
</P>
<P>
Canadian officials maintain that they were within their rights
to slap an 80 percent excise tax on advertising in "split-run"
magazines such as Sports Illustrated's Canadian edition, which
includes some articles especially for the Canadian audience as
well as the magazine's regular U.S. content.
</P>
<P>
Many American magazines are sold in Canada, but only a few
publish Canadian editions that compete more directly for
advertising from Canadian companies.
</P>
<P>
Mickey Kantor, the U.S. Trade Representative, said on Monday
that he would challenge the Canadian practice in the world trade
body that he alleged unfairly shut out U.S. magazines from the
Canadian market.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration took the action as it has been under
growing criticism from Republican presidential candidates for not
being tougher with the nation's trading partners.
</P>
<P>
The process would start with formal consultations between the
two nations and then proceed to an international dispute panel. If
no compromise was reached and the American position was upheld,
the process could end with the U.S. imposing retaliatory sanctions
in about 18 months, the U.S. officials said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Signs Temporary Debt Ceiling Measure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- President Clinton signed a
legislation today to temporarily raise the ceiling of the U.S.
government's debt, avoiding a possible default until the end of
the month.
</P>
<P>
U.S. government's debt ceiling is the federal borrowing
authority allowing the government to borrow money to finance the
federal departments and programs. The debt ceiling will be
breached on March 15 unless it is extended.
</P>
<P>
The measure, approved by the U.S. Congress last week, will
extend the borrowing authority through March 29, buying more time
for the bargaining between the Republicans and Democrats on the
long-term extension of the debt limit.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Egypt for an anti-terrorism summit meeting,
President Clinton said that "Congress must pass a straight-forward
long-term extension by the end of the month."
</P>
<P>
The president also called on Congress to quickly pass a
seven-year balanced budget plan that preserves his priorities of
protecting Medicare, environmental protection and investments in
education, worker training and technology.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. Congress is debating a spending legislation
for some U.S. departments and agencies which are operating on a
stopgap spending bill expiring on March 15.
</P>
<P>
At stake was a Senate measure providing 160 billion U.S.
dollars for dozens of U.S. departments and agencies for the
remaining half of fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
But President Clinton is demanding 8 billion dollars more for
environmental, education, high technology and job training
programs and threating to veto any bill which lacks that amount of
money.
</P>
<P>
Republicans in Senate are now willing to add 4.7 billion dollars
to the bill and those in the House only wanted to give additional
3.3 billion if offsetting cuts elsewhere in the budget can be
found later. They will make a compromise deal and present the
spending bill to the U.S. president later this week.
</P>
<P>
Even though money for some agencies runs out next Friday, a
partial government shutdown seems unlikely because neither
Republicans nor Democrats want to be seen as causing it.

<HEADLINE> Strict Security For Kwazulu/Natal Amakhosi Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 12 (Xinhua)-- A high-profile police
delegation will go to Ulundi, Kwazulu/Natal Province, this week
to ensure adequate security measures for a planned meeting of
Amakhosi (traditional chiefs), a press report said today.
</P>
<P>
The police delegation will be led by South African National
Police Commissioner George Fivaz, reported the South African
Press Association.
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini,
Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, African
National Congress (ANC) leader in Kwazulu/Natal Jacob Zuma and
traditional leaders in the province are expected to attend the
meeting on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Pretoria, Fivaz saidthat it was
imperative that" every conceivable measure be taken" to ensure
the safety of President Mandela, the King, Minister of Home
Affairs Buthelezi and other dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
He said the police delegation would analyze the security
situation and ensure the necessary security measures.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said in
Cape Town that there was no concern for Mandela's safety as
adequate security forces would be deployed for the duration of
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana said the forthcoming Amakhosi meeting, a
preliminary meeting of a planned peace Imbizo (a national
gathering of Zulus) in the strife-torn province, would be chaired
by Chris Fismer, Minister of the Provincial Affairs and
Constitutional Development.
</P>
<P>
It was also hoped that the Imbizo, proposed by Mandela early
this year, would help restore peace and stability in
Kwazulu/Natal where about 20000 people had been killed in
fighting between IFP and ANC since mid-1980s.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Meets Buthelezi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today met Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi to finalize Friday's meeting with
Kwazulu/Natal chiefs and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Mandela and Buthelezi at the president's
official Cape Town office was reportedly focused on setting
agenda for the forthcoming meeting of Amakhosi (traditional
Chiees), a preliminary meeting of a planned peace Imbizo (a
National gathering of Zulus) in the strife-torn province.
</P>
<P>
The date and venue of the Amakhosi had been agreed to by
Mandela and Buthelezi last month. Mandela proposed an Imbizo
earlier this year as an urgent step to bring an end to the
increasing violence in Kwazulu/Natal.
</P>
<P>
However, today's talks turned out friendly among the two
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Calling Mandela "my president and a friend", Buthelezi said he
had the highest regard for the president, "but in political terms
we have some differences".
</P>
<P>
While Mandela, who referred to Buthelezi as "Nkosi" (Chief)
throughout, said: "my concern was the role leaders should play
and he (Buthelezi) has played a very constructive role."
</P>
<P>
There was apparently no outward sign of any tension between
the two leaders during the talks, despite recent statements by
Buthelezi that his confidence in the president had reached a low
level because of several "broken promises".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, mandela stressed that Friday's Amakhosi meeting
would be free to express any problems they might have, including
the issue of international mediation.
</P>
<P>
"The Amakhosi are a very important constituency and to ensure
the success of the iIbizo we should let them express any problem
which they may have, so that we can go the Imbizo speaking one
language," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also urged the IFP to return to the
constitutional-writing process, saying he would be very happy if
the IFP came back to the constitutional assembly.

<HEADLINE> Bruton Urges IRA to Restore Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister John Bruton
once again appealed this afternoon to the Irish Republican Army
(IRA) to restore its ceasefire, according to reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Before departure for a one-day summit on terrorism to be
convened in Egypt, the Irish prime minister told the IRA to give
its political wing Sinn Fein a seat at the peace talks on the
future of Northern Ireland by renewing its truce it shattered one
month ago.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the IRA to "give peace a chance and give the
talks a chance".
</P>
<P>
Bruton said this morning that his talks with the delegation of
the Ulster Unionist Party on Monday night was "constructive".
</P>
<P>
The Irish premier and the UUP delegation headed by its leader
David Trimble had a three-hour discussion on the Ulster peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The UUP leader insisted that new laws must be advanced in
Dublin to set up a body to verify the arms decommissioning by
rival paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland before all-party
talks start.
</P>
<P>
Trimble indicated that without the legislation, his party might
boycott the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Bruton had brought in Ireland's attorney-general to discuss the
issue of laws on terrorist weapons.
</P>
<P>
Bruton said: "Obviously there gaps in our legislation in so far
as the issue of arms being taken out of commission is concerned."
</P>
<P>
This was the formal talks between the Irish government and the
Ulster Unionist Party on the Ulster peace process since the
7-month abortive talks in 1992.

<HEADLINE> UN Reiterates Iraq Must Allow Inspection of Any Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The members of the
Security Council reiterated today that the Iraqi government must
allow the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) inspection teams
immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access to all sites
designated by the commission for inspection.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to Chairman of UNSCOM Rolf Ekeus, the current
council president Legwaila Legwaila of Botswana said that the
members of the council considered that Iraq's delay in permitting
the current inspection teams access to the sites concerned
constitutes a clear violation by Iraq of the provisions in
Resolutions 687, 707 and 715 adopted by the Security Council in
1991.
</P>
<P>
The letter read, "members of the Security Council have followed
with concern the incident described in your letter on March 9,
1996, when immediate access was not allowed by Iraqi authorities
to a special commission inspection team, which sought access to a
site in Baghdad designated for inspection by the Special
Commission."
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Security Council have also learned with
concern of the further incident on March 11, 1996, when an
inspection team was again not allowed immediate and unconditional
access to a site similarly designated by the Special Commission.
In both cases, accesses were subsequently granted only after
unacceptable delays," the letter read.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the council fully support your continued
efforts and those of the inspection teams in Iraq on the bases of
the relevant council resolutions," the letter added.
</P>
<P>
The council members recalled paragraph 9 B of Resolution 687
that the Special Commission "shall carry out immediate on-site
inspection of Iraq's biological, chemical and missile
capabilities, based on Iraq's declarations and the designation of
any additional locations by the Special Commission."
</P>
<P>
By its Resolution 707 in 1991, the council demanded that Iraq
"allow the Special Commission, the IAEA and their inspection teams
immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access to any and all
areas, facilities, equipment, records and means of transportation
which they wish to inspect."
</P>
<P>
The obligation was further more confirmed in Resolution 715,
the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The members of the council reiterated that the Iraqi government
must allow the Special Commission inspection teams immediate,
unconditional and unrestricted access to all sites designated by
the commission for inspection, the letter stressed.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Soldiers In Rwanda To Return Home Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian soldiers serving in
Rwanda are to return home on thursday following the termination
of the un peace-keeping operations in that country, announced a
defence spokesman here today.
</P>
<P>
The Director of Defence Information, Fred Chijuka, said that
the Nigerian soldiers did "a good job" in the service of the U.N.
and humanity, stressing that some of them went to Rwanda when the
situation in that country was "still very bad".
</P>
<P>
Most of the soldiers have served in Rwanda for about a year
with the peace-keeping force or with the un military observer
group.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian battalion, under the command of Samuel Katung was
stationed in Byumba, a town in north-western Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.last year announced that it was ending its operations
in Rwanda following the refusal of the government to extend its
mandate to prevent further killings by Hutu and Tutsi ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of people were massacred during the
Rwandan civil war in 1994.

<HEADLINE> UK Oil, Gas Reserves Enough for 15 More Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- British oil companies Monday
predicted Britain will remain a net oil exporter until 2010, which
is 10 years later than they forecast six years ago.
</P>
<P>
The latest optimistic assessment about North Sea oil and gas
reserves from the United Kingdom Offshore Operators Association
said that gas production will not reach a peak until around the
turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
It added that more gas-fired power stations, along with exports
through the planned link with the Continent, are likely to be
needed to reduce the growing surplus.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports from the association, which represents 34
companies operating in British waters, predicted in 1984 and 1989
that oil production would peak in the early 1990s and that Britain
would lose its status as a self-sufficient oil nation around the
turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
But the latest forecasts show production peaking at about three
million barrels a day, close to 150 million tons a year over the
next two years, self-sufficiency lasting for another 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Output could be still running at about one million barrels, or
50 million tons, by 2020.
</P>
<P>
The report estimates that around half of estimated oil reserves
of 30.5 billion barrels and just a third of gas, 115 trillion
cubic feet, had been produced by the end of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1989 report 5.7 billion barrels have been added to
reserves, with two-thirds coming from more oil in existing oil
fields.
</P>
<P>
Cost-cutting, long-reach drilling techniques, three-dimension
seismic techniques, along with an earlier-than-planned opening of
the West of Shetland basin, have also make significant reserves,
the UKOOA said.
</P>
<P>
Gas production potential is still rising and is expected to
level out at between 10 and 11 billion cubic feet a day before
dropping to four billion in 2020.
</P>
<P>
"The offshore industry will continue to be an important input
to the UK economy as it has been over the last 10 year," UKOOA
Director General Harold Hughes told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Warns Denmark Over 'Kurdish Parliament in Exile' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Ministry today
issued a severely-worded warning to Denmark which failed to stop a
meeting in Copenhagen of the so-called Kurdish Parliament in exile.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey has told Denmark that it cannot accept the realization
of such a meeting and expected Copenhagen to stop it and if this
is not done, it is inevitable that relations will affected
negatively," the foreign ministry said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Copenhagen said that the Kurdish Parliament in
exile had started its meetings despite Turkey's efforts both in
Ankara and Copenhagen to have it banned.
</P>
<P>
Ankara believes the members of the Kurdish parliament have
close cooperation with the separatist Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK), which Ankara views as a terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
The statement said it was tragic that such a terrorism-related
group could meet in the capital of one of its western allies when
an international anti-terrorism summit was taking place in Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Demands Release of Frozen Gulf Bank Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today called for the release
of 50 million U.S. dollars of its frozen bank assets in Saudi
Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates to enable Iraqi
citizens to perform pilgrimage this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Radio Baghdad, the human rights society in Iraq
has made this request in messages addressed respectively to the
president of the Security Council, the Secretary General of the
United Nations, the chairman of the Human Rights Committee in
Geneva, the secretary general of the Arab League and the secretary
general of the Organization of the Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
The letters said that the "unjust embargo" against Iraq had
brought about grave damages to Iraq and had had tragic
consequences on the lives of the Iraqi people, particularly
children, women and old people, who are facing a severe shortage
of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Iraq announced that its frozen balances in Arab banks,
due to its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, amounted to over 1 billion
dollars, most of which were in the Arab Gulf states.

<HEADLINE> Syria: Termination of Occupation Will Put End to Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Syria today said that the only
rational solution that will make it possible to put an end to
violence and counter-violence is to fully abide by the commitment
of the Madrid conference formula and to terminate occupation.
</P>
<P>
This position was publicized in a commentary by radio Damascus
on the outgoing international anti-terrorism conference, which was
held in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh earlier
today.
</P>
<P>
"Had Israel believed in a just and comprehensive peace, and in
fact that peace was the only way that would guarantee its security
as well as that of the region, it (Israel) would have pulled out
of the territories it has occupied by force," the radio said in
the commentary.
</P>
<P>
The radio called on Israel to seek a genuine peace and
pronounce its commitment to "international legitimate resolutions"
which stipulate its withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
"Had Israel done so, it would have put the region on the
threshold of a new phase of security and stability," the radio
said.
</P>
<P>
The radio stressed that in order to push the peace process
forward, it was imperative that the organizers of the Sharm el
Sheikh summit conference and other international gatherings
carefully search for the real causes that have led to the
obstruction of peace.
</P>
<P>
"They ought to have allowed all participating parties to engage
(themselves) in an objective discussion and agreed on an agenda,"
it said. "To convene the summit in such a hasty way and in the
present forum would certainly not be sufficient to serve the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
The radio charged that the summit would only serve the
interests of Israel at the expense of the interests and rights of
the Arabs, a fact that Israel was keen to grab.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the radio said, Syria has been the first country
in the world to call for an international conference to define
terrorism in line with the principles of international law and the
articles of the U.N. charter.
</P>
<P>
"It has done so because it condemns terrorism and the slaying
of innocent people, upholding, at the same time, the right of
peoples to struggle for freedom and independence," it noted.
</P>
<P>
Like others, the radio said, Syria has made great sacrifice
for freedom, and for confronting terrorist acts. Hence, Syria's
adherence to a just and comprehensive peace, and the return to the
Madrid conference formula.
</P>
<P>
Both Syria and Lebanon boycotted the anti-terrorism summit,
which was attended by delegations from nearly 30 countries.
