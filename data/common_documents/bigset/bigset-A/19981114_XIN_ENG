<HEADLINE> Number of Abducted Women, Children Down in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of cases involving
the abducting and selling of women and children in China has been
declining for six years in a row, dropping from more than 20,000
cases in 1992 to some 6,000 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Such crimes, which had been eliminated after the founding of
the New China in 1949, began to make a comeback in the early
1980s, said Zhu Yantao, an official with the Crime Investigation
Division of the Public Security Ministry of the People's Republic
of China.
</P>
<P>
She added that the number of such cases peaked in the 1989-1990
period, and most of the victims were women, among whom girls under
18 years of age accounted for more than 60 percent. Male infants
also made up a certain proportion of those abducted and kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
In some Chinese villages, where there are many more males than
females, farmers with no awareness of the law would sometimes buy
women for wives from the abductors, explained Zhu, and this
makes up a large proportion of cases.
</P>
<P>
Some rural couples with infertility problems also tend to buy
abducted boys to "carry on their family lines," she said.
</P>
<P>
She went on to say that most of kidnapping victims are from
Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan and Hubei provinces and the
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and sold in Zhejiang, Jiangxi,
and Shanxi provinces, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and
other areas.

<HEADLINE> Number of Abducted Women, Children Down in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To cut off the demand for abducted and kidnapped women and
children, the Chinese government has issued regulations imposing
punishment on the buyers. People involved in abducting,
trafficking, selling, and hiding women and children and those who
use violence to prevent the police from rescuing the victims will
be severely punished.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, heads of criminal gangs involved
in these crimes, those who have abducted and sold more than three
women or children, committed rape or forced abducted women into
prostitution, or sold women overseas will be sentenced to more
than ten years imprisonment and fined up to 10,000 yuan (1,204
U.S. dollars). Those who have caused serious social dangers with
be sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
Public security departments at all levels have launched
crackdowns on the abducting and selling of women and children
several times since the early 1990s, and have united local women's
federations and railway management departments to both detect
and arrest criminals.
</P>
<P>
Zhu pointed out that the abducting of women has taken on new
characteristics, though the number of cases is on the decline.
</P>
<P>
Abductors now seem to aim at younger females, and more abducted
women are being forced into prostitution, she said, adding that
abductors have also begun to target women in public places such as
labor markets and railway stations instead of merely village and
township households, as in the past.
</P>
<P>
The abduction and kidnapping of women has tended to become an
"international industry," and China will work in cooperation with
other countries to adopt international conventions and laws to
protect women from such abuses, Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Manpower Development Strategies Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A sub-committee of the
Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness (CSC) Friday released its
report on strategies for manpower development in the island state
in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
The report deems a cost-competitive and capable workforce will
place the country among the top league of developed nations.
</P>
<P>
The report sets forth a vision which connotes a skilled,
thinking and innovative workforce with world-class capabilities in
five areas -- business management, technology, innovation,
production and services, and international market development.
</P>
<P>
Citing the main challenge is to develop the entrepreneurial
ability to link and integrate as well as to add value to these
areas, the report emphasizes that Singapore's strategies toward
human and intellectual capital must be comprehensive, stretching
from nurturing skills, creativity and talent at all levels of the
workforce to the development of entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
It also underlines the need to maximize the full potential of
the domestic workforce and enhance the attractiveness to foreign
talent -- a twin approach for the implementation of the
strategies.
</P>
<P>
In the report, the sub-committee proposes four thrusts to
achieve its vision: best education for the young, life-long
employability for the working adults, leading intellectual hub in
the knowledge economy and new mindset towards pride and
professionalism.
</P>
<P>
The sub-committee said the vision and strategies for manpower
development are directed at achieving competitiveness and
employability, which are the pr-requisites for achieving full
employment.
</P>
<P>
The CSC was formed in May 1997 on the advice of Singapore Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong and was assigned to make a thorough review
of the country's economic competitiveness and highlight key
strategies to sharpen its competitive edge for the next 10 years.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Friday confirmed
"their determination to make every effort to sign a peace treaty
by the year 2000."

MOSCOW AAA1113053 Russia-Iraq
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin Urges Iraq to Resume Cooperation With U.N.
</P>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
has told Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein that use of force may be
carried out unless a political decision is reached promptly.
</P>
<P>
In a personal message to Saddam Thursday, Yeltsin expressed
profound concern over the situation withLz 2
O1zIra,3&AMP;Z"AK3c4CmYeltsin's
spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The decision of Baghdad to stop cooperating with the U.N.
Special Commission dealt a serious blow to the normalization
process," Yeltsin noted in the letter.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that Yeltsin's no-show at the official dinner
Thursday night in honor of Obuchi was agreed at their meeting
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Some observers linked Yeltsin's absence at the dinner to his
health problems. Yeltsin returned to Moscow last week from the
Black Sea resort of Sochi, where he took a vacation prescribed by
his doctors to recuperate from "serious fatigue" in the wake of a
bout of bronchitis.
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin said he "would not link Yeltsin's absence [from the
lunch] with his health," Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
He said both sides "gained something" from the summit, noting
"good, sincere atmosphere" at the talks.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese know what the Russian public thinks about the
territorial issue." he said.
</P>
<P>
The Moscow Declaration, on the establishment of constructive
partnership between the two countries, said the two leaders
"instructed their governments to step up talks on a peace treaty."
</P>
<P>
They "also ordered the formation of a subcommittee for joint
economic activities in the said islands which, acting
simultaneously with the subcommittee for border delimitation,
would define the forms of possible joint economic activity in the
islands that will not damage the legal positions of the sides,"
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders "agreed in principle on allowing very
simplified, virtually free visits to the islands by Japanese
citizens who are former residents of the islands and their
families."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Obuchi realize the importance of cooperation
related to the four islands to promote understanding between the
residents of neighboring areas of Russia and Japan and to expand
multi-faceted mutually beneficial cooperation, which will create
conditions for the speedy signing of a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
On cooperation in international affairs, the declaration said
Russia and Japan will deepen interaction within the framework of
the G-8 and that Moscow supports Japan's determination to become a
permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also expressed their determination to expand
cooperation in strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation treaty,
speedily enforcing the treaty on a general and complete ban on
nuclear tests, and drafting a treaty banning the production of
fissile materials for nuclear arms and other nuclear explosive
devices.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the two sides signed a document on the establishment
of a Japanese- Russian investment company "to contribute to direct
investments in Russia by Japanese companies, including joint
ventures, with support from the governments of Russia and
Japan."
</P>
<P>
"The funds necessary for the investment will be made available
by the governments of Russia and Japan to the Russian and the
Japanese companies respectively so that the total amount of the
funds allocated by each government stands at 50 million U.S.
dollars."
</P>
<P>
The company will be able to provide one enterprise implementing
an investment project with up to 20 percent of the overall amount
of investment in this project.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi also met with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said the Moscow Declaration on creative partnership
between Russia and Japan has demonstrated that the two countries
are coming closer together.
</P>
<P>
"This movement is irreversible," Primakov said after his talks
with Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders exchanged copies of the declaration before the
start of a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi said he was pleased with the results of his talks with
Primakov and expressed confidence that relations between the two
countries would successfully expand in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks, the two sides signed an intergovernmental
agreement on investment encouragement and protection and two
memorandums, one on cooperation in the field of tourism and the
other on cooperation in environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
They also signed a document on postal and telecommunications
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Says He'll Serve Out House Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing U.S. House of
Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich said on Friday that he will
serve out his current term before leaving office in January.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich announced November 6 that he would leave Congress in
the wake of elections that reduced the Republican's House majority
to six votes. But he did not say when.
</P>
<P>
On his way to an orientation session for the House's incoming
40 freshmen Friday morning, Gingrich told a reporter that he would
serve out his term, the Associated Press said.
</P>
<P>
The 106th Congress will be sworn in January 6.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich was re-elected to an 11th two-year term on Election
Day. To replace him, Georgia's governor is expected to schedule a
special election shortly.
</P>
<P>
Republicans held an 11-vote margin in the 105th Congress, and
Republican leaders had hoped to add up to 40 seats in the November
3 voting. Many rank-and-file lawmakers blamed their leaders for
their party's disappointing electoral showing, saying they had
failed to provide them with a coherent agenda with which to
campaign.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 13 (Xinhua)-- The Nagano Olympic Committee
will donate all its profit from February's Winter Games, an
organizing official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Exactly 90 percent of its 4.5 billion yen (36.87 million
U.S. dollars profit from the Games will go to the Nagano
prefectural (state) government, said Jin-o Matsuo, spokesman for
the Nagano Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 10 percent or 450 million yen (3.68 million
U.S. dollars) will be donated to the Japanese Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
All the donated money will be used to help athletes aspiring
to participate in future Olympics and also to promote mostly
winter sports in Japan, Matsuo said.
</P>
<P>
Higher-than-expected ticket and Olympic merchandise sales,
coupled with the weak yen, largely contributed to the posting of
the surplus in the games, held in Nagano, said officials.
</P>
<P>
The operating costs for the Nagano Winter games totaled 113.9
billion yen (932.8 million U.S. dollars), they said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Limits President's Terms of Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's highest
legislative body, the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), passed
a degree on Friday night, limiting the presidential and vice
presidential terms of office to only two five-year terms of
office.
</P>
<P>
The decree was adopted to avoid misinterpretations of the 1945
Constitution's Article 7 on the subject and to boost
democratization.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution's Article 7 only states that the country's
president could be "elected again" after his or her first term,
without citing how many times.
</P>
<P>
Some factions in the MPR argued that the article had been
abused by former president Soeharto to perpetuate his power and
thus weaken democracy throughout his administration. Soeharto had
maintained his post for seven consecutive five-year periods.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech on Tuesday, Speaker Harmoko said the
decision was in line with the spirit of reform, "so the president
institution does not have to go through a personalization process
that leads to an authoritarian and centralistic rule."

<HEADLINE> Britain to Pull More Troops out of N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain is to pull more troops
out of Northern Ireland as situation there is getting more stable,
the province's police chief announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Four hundred troops of the 16th Regiment Royal Artillery will
return to bases in England by next week, said Ronnie Flanagan,
head of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
</P>
<P>
The regiment, based at Drumadd Barracks in Co. Armagh,
controlled three checkpoints in the South Armagh village of
Besbrook.
</P>
<P>
"The security situation continues to be kept under close
scrutiny and further progress will depend on the operational
assessment of the terrorist threat," he said.
</P>
<P>
The latest scaling-down reduces the garrison to 15,000, its
smallest since 1970 when the region was plunged into conflict.
</P>
<P>
Security has been relaxed since pro-Irish and pro-British
parties signed an accord in April aimed at ending strife.
</P>
<P>
Flanagan said 400 members of the Royal Artillery Corps would
return to mainland Britain and army checkpoints at the village of
Besbrook near the Irish border would be removed.
</P>
<P>
But the army will leave the regiment under the control of its
Northern Ireland command so that they can return to the province
immediately, should such a measure become necessary.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of a continuing scaling down of military
presence in Northern Ireland as a reflection of the "improved
security situation".
</P>
<P>
The last troops to be withdrawn, on 22 September, were 400
soldiers of the 39th Regiment Royal Artillery and 1st Battalion
Highlanders.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Police Officers End Training in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A total of 29 Rwandan police
cadet officers have finished their three-month training by
Ugandan instructors and will be deployed back home very soon.
</P>
<P>
At the passing-out ceremony held in the Ugandan Police
Training School here Friday afternoon, the trainees received
their certificates.
</P>
<P>
The students are said to have received both technical and
management training in the school and they will lay the future
foundation for the Rwandan police.
</P>
<P>
This training, first of its kind, was a result of the
bilateral cooperation between the police forces of the two
countries and the commitment of the two governments.
</P>
<P>
The training program started in 1996 and so far a total of 363
Rwandan police officers have benefited from this protocol.
</P>
<P>
Onyu Stephen, the senior assistant commissioner of police in
charge of administration, hailed the excellent performance of the
Rwandan students in the school.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan Ambassador to Uganda Sagahutu Murashi said: "This is
possible because of the cooperation of the two countries, and
particularly of the commitment of our two leaders."
</P>
<P>
He assured the Ugandan police authorities that the trainees
will perform well in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The top five out of the trainees were dressed by the
dignitaries present and ten of the trainees will stay on to
continue their training as instructors.

<HEADLINE> 43 Percent American Homes With Children Have Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A gun-control group on
Friday suggested American parents keep vigilant not only about
guns in their own homes but in the homes of others as two-fifths
of households with children have guns.
</P>
<P>
The survey by the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence found that
43 percent of homes have both guns and children, and 23 percent of
those keep the gun loaded.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 28 percent of the gun-owners with
children keep the gun hidden but not locked up. Still, 73 percent
of parents think it is unlikely their children would find or
handle a gun without their permission, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
While three-fourths of parents have talked to their children
about what to do if they find a gun at the home of a friend, only
30 percent have checked with other parents to see if they keep
guns, the group said.
</P>
<P>
It urged parents to pay more attention to the possibility of
guns in the homes their children visit.

<HEADLINE> Rwandans to Benefit From Ugandan-Training: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda will benefit a lot
from the training their police officers have received from their
Ugandan instructors because the training enhances their
capability, a senior Rwandan official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Theonest Mutsindashyaka, Rwandan secretary-general in the
Ministry of Interior, Communal Development and Resettlement, made
the remarks at the passing-out ceremony of 29 Rwandan cadet
police officers in Kampala Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"The graduation of these police officers marks another step
ahead in the re-establishment of qualified police personnel to
the population of Rwanda," said the Rwandan official.
</P>
<P>
"We pay great tribute to this Police College for the excellent
job done in developing these officers to this standard," he said.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, which
reportedly caused 500,000 lives to the cruelty of the
blood-thirsty criminals who happened to be in charge of affairs
in the country.
</P>
<P>
"What was most humiliating was the fact that members of the
Armed Forces, the Police, some religious organizations and senior
government leaders were all deeply involved in planning and
executing the genocide, to the extent that the population was
totally abandoned and left to the mercy of reckless militias," he
said in a 15-minute speech.
</P>
<P>
He challenged the police officers trained here to realize that
this undermined the integrity of the police.
</P>
<P>
When the government of national unity came into being in July
1994, immediate steps were taken to re-establish the various
organs of government, including the police forces, he noted.
</P>
<P>
To let the police enjoy the confidence of the population,
Rwanda decided on developing professionalism among our officers
and non-commissioned officers so that the recovering po

He said training and re-training has been one of the most

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The two British military
bases in Cyprus are on alert and will play as a staging point for
air supplies to other bases in case of a military strike against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The bases in Cyprus are already at a very high standard of
alertness," Cyprus News Agency quoted a British Defense Ministry
spokesman as saying in London Friday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that "their use in any possible situation of
operations against Iraq will be the same as on the occasion of the
previous crisis in February and during the Gulf War. That is as a
staging point for air supplies to other bases."
</P>
<P>
Britain retains two military bases, Dhekelia and Akrotiri, in
Cyprus since the island gained independence from British colonial
rule in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,500 British troops are stationed at the two bases.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have beefed up military forces in the Gulf

of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, triggering off a new round

<HEADLINE> Turkey Calls for Extradition of PKK Leader From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Justice Minister Hasan
Denizkurdu Friday called for the extradition of Abdullah Ocalan,
leader of a Kurdish terrorist group, from Italy.
</P>
<P>
Denizkurdu made the statement after Ocalan, head of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) was detained by Italian
police Thursday night upon his arrival in Rome by a passenger
plane of the Russian Airlines.
</P>
<P>
The PKK leader was later taken to a military hospital for
health check.
</P>
<P>
Denizkurdu said that his ministry will give the file about
Ocalan to Italian Justice Ministry through Turkish Foreign
Ministry, adding that the Italian Justice Ministry will transfer
the issue to Italian court to give a decision about the
extradition.
</P>
<P>
"There is no legal obstacle for the extradition of Ocalan
from Italy," added the Turkish justice minister.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish Interior Minister Kutlu Aktas said here at
the same day that "Turkey has begun overall initiatives for
the extradition of Abdullah Ocalan, the chief of separatist
terrorist PKK organization."
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz also told reporters that
"I am pleased to share with you that as a result of our pressures
on Syria within the framework of our struggle against terrorism,
our struggle came to an extreme positive new stage: Abdullah
Ocalan who is responsible for the killings of thousands of people
for 14 years was captured in Italy."
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was forced to leave Syria for Moscow as Turkey
threatened to launch military strikes against the PKK camps and
shelters on the Syrian territory if Damascus continues to
provide support for the PKK.
</P>
<P>
With Turkish pressure on the Russian government for the
extradition of Ocalan, Russia promised Turkey that Moscow will
not allow Ocalan to take shelter in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan leads the PKK separatist group which has been
fighting a 14-year-old war for autonomy in southeastern
Turkey, which has claimed over 37,000 lives since August 1984.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Ask U.N. to Debate on Cyprus Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- President Glafcos Clerides
said Friday that the National Council had decided to request the
U.N. to hold a debate on the Cyprus problem at its General
Assembly next year.
</P>
<P>
Clerides made the remarks after a two-hour session of the
National Council, his top advisory body on the Cyprus problem
comprising political party leaders on the island.
</P>
<P>
"The National Council decided to request time for a debate of
the Cyprus problem at the new session of the U.N. General
Assembly, which begins either in April or May," Clerides told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Describing the decision as "an initial decision," government
spokesman Christos Stylianides said "I believe we would all like
to reconsider the matter, if there are positive developments on
the Cyprus issue."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation formula, but the
Turkish Cypriots opted out of the peace negotiations last year to
protest against a decision of the European Union to begin
accession talks with Cyprus while scraping Turkey off its
immediate membership candidates list.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Urges Demonstrators to Refrain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie here Friday called on all demonstrators to restrain
themselves and not act destructively.
</P>
<P>
After attending a session of the People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR), Minister/State Secretary Akbar Tanjung said that
the president was principally of the view that the demonstrations
were inseparable from democratic life.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the student demonstrations in several cities in the
country, Tanjung said as long as they did not disturb peace and
spark clashes, they would be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
He said certain parties with their own interest had been
provoking student rallies and mass movements. He therefore called
on students to continue maintaining and protecting their ideals
and prevent them from being abused by those groups.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, all factions in Indonesian People's Consultative
Assembly have expressed deep regret over the death of three
student demonstrators in Jakarta on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We regret the clash between the students and the security
forces which caused the death of the three students. The
Functional Group faction also calls on all parties to exercise
self-control in order to prevent the emergence of an anarchic
situation," the faction's Secretary Rully Chairul Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
Buttu R. Hutapea, chairman of the Indonesian Democratic Party
faction, was even surprised upon learning the fatal casualty of
the clash between the student demonstrators and the security
forces.
</P>
<P>
To prevent more victims, he called on the student demonstrators
and the security forces to promote self-control.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Husein Umar of the United Development Party faction
served a similar plea. "Don't let a situation like this throw us
into anarchy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mardiyanto of the regional Representatives faction joined his
colleagues in expressing concern and regret over the death of the
three demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Agum Gumelar of the Armed Forces faction also expressed concern
over the bloody incident.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of university students in the past several days took
to the streets in several cities to protest the holding of MPR
special session and demanding the revocation of the Armed Forces
socio-political role.
</P>
<P>
At least three students were killed and a number of others
injured in clashes with security personnel in Jakarta on Friday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Indonesian Police Information Service Brig. Gen.
Togar M. Sianipar denied that they have used live bullets to
disperse demonstrators in several parts of the capital on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Security personnel have been equipped with rubber bullets and
none of them is allowed to use live bullets. If one says that the
security personnel use live bullets to disperse the demonstrators,
that is slander," he said.

<HEADLINE> German Economic Growth up 0.5-1.0 pc in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 13 (Xinhua) - Germany's economy grew by 0.5 to
1.0 percent in the third quarter over the second quarter, the Bonn
economics ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
But the country must brace for a slowdown next winter as the
financial crisis around the world make themselves felt, the Bonn
economics ministry said.
</P>
<P>
According to a preliminary estimate issued by the ministry,
Germany's third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) was 2.5
percent above that of the third quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
It also said that Bonn expected Germany's economic growth pace
to pick up in the remainder of this year and that there would be a
slight relaxation in the labour market situation.
</P>
<P>
The third-quarter upswing of 0.5 percent showed an economy
gathering momentum after the second quarter GDP rise of only 0.1
percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But the ministry cautioned about potential problems ahead next
year.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the currency and financial crisis in various regions of
the world, some shadows have recently appeared over the continued
positive domestic economic picture," it said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that it expected the trend to continue in
which the basis for economic growth will shift from foreign demand
to domestic demand, cautioning however that this process would not
take place "without some temporary adaptation difficulties".
</P>
<P>
The report coincided Friday with a Federal Statistics Office
report in Wiesbaden which indicated that Germany's powerful
foreign trade sector was starting to feel the effects of foreign
economic turmoil, with September showing the first monthly drop in
exports and imports in more than two years.
</P>
<P>
The office said exports dropped by 2.9 percent to 77 billion
marks (45.8 billion US dollars) while imports were down by 0.6
percent to 65.3 billion marks. It was the first trade decline on
an annualized basis since June 1996.
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of the year, German exports were up
8.6 percent to 705 billion marks, while imports were up 6.7
percent to 604 billion. The resulting 101 billion mark surplus far
surpassed the 83.2 billion marks figure for the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The office said that Germany's balance on current accounts
situation meanwhile continued to improve. The nine-month deficit
in the balance - comprising visible trade, services and transfers
- came to 7.2 billion marks, compared with a red-ink figure of
12.6 billion in the same period of 1997.

KATHMANDU, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The five-day 34th Conference
of Directors General of Civil Aviation in Asia and the Pacific
Region concluded here Friday with a number of recommendations for
strengthening flight safety.
</P>
<P>
The participants called for countries in the region to help the

</P>
<P>
It noted that other recommendations included English-language
skill training for pilots and air traffic controllers on civil
aviation operation and awareness generation about civil aviation's
role in the development of national economy.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the conference requested the implementation of the
satellite-based communication, navigation, surveillance/air
traffic management (CNS/ATM) system with the coordination of the
ICAO and the utilization of computer-based technologies.
</P>
<P>
The conference laid emphasis on the aeronautical frequency band
to maintain the standard of frequency regulatory authority and
effective implementation of national air security facilities, the
department said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 111 working papers were presented at the meeting, it
added.
</P>
<P>
The next meeting is scheduled to be held in Hanoi, Vietnam on
September 6-10, 1999, the department said, adding that the theme
will be cooperation in emerging policies on air transport
developments for safety, efficiency and economy in civil aviation.
</P>
<P>
Since its inception in 1960, the annual event of the civil
aviation directors general has become a strong forum for the
region in fostering mutual trust and solidarity in the direction
of coordinated and cooperative efforts, the department noted.

The MPA, the second news agency in Greece, is based in the

Relations between Greece and Macedonia have been strained for

<HEADLINE> Ghana Lowers Rediscount Rate Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The steady decline in
inflation has encouraged the Bank of Ghana to lower its
rediscount rate to 37 percent from 42 percent, the Pan-african
News Agency (PANA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Ghanaian central bank said in a statement issued in
capital Accra Thursday that the reduction effective on the same
day, the second in seven weeks, was in response to the declining
rate of inflation and relative stability of the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The bank rate remained at 42 percent since September 24 when
the first reduction from 45 percent was announced.
</P>
<P>
PANA quoted the statement as saying that the bank was
encouraged by the steady decline in the rate of inflation, which
stood at about 17 percent at the end of September.
</P>
<P>
"These developments reflect continuing improvements in the
macro-economic situation of the country," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The governor of the Bank of Ghana assures the nation that the
central bank will continue to pursue tight monetary policies to
ensure the achievement of financial stability of the economy," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The bank also welcomed the drop in the 91-day treasury bill

<HEADLINE> Blair Warns Saddam Over UN Defiance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) - British Prime Minister Tony
Blair has warned Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein that he will "suffer
the consequences" if he does not comply with UN Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Blair told the North Atlantic Assembly meeting in Edinburgh
Friday that Saddam "cannot simply go on defying the international
community".
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said there was a simple choice for President
Hussein - full compliance with United Nations demands or military
action.
</P>
<P>
"If action proves necessary, we will take it with a real sense
of responsibility, with a heavy heart and with deep regret," he
added.
</P>
<P>
His warning came as more US warships, ground troops and
aircraft made their way to the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Both the US and Britain say there is no scope left for
negotiation with Iraq as it continues to refuse to co-operate with
UN weapons inspectors.

<HEADLINE> Albright Warns Iraq Comply or Face Consequences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary Madeleine
Albright said on Friday that the U.S. wants a "peaceful outcome"
from the standoff with Iraq, but if Baghdad fails to comply, it
may face consequences.
</P>
<P>
If Iraqi President Saddam Hussein publicly rescind his refusal
to cooperate with the U.N. inspectors, a military action against
Iraq can be avoided, Albright told a news conference at the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
"For months we have said that every option was on the table.
Unfortunately, one by one, the diplomatic options have been
rebuffed. Iraq has a simple choice: reverse course or face the
consequence," she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright told reporters she didn't see much room left for
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
The White House said it saw no need for a last-ditch mission to
Iraq by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan as recommended by
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russian special Middle East envoy Viktor Posuvalyuk has said
Moscow would support a new trip to Iraq by Annan, who headed off
U.S. airstrikes by cutting a last-minute deal with Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein during a previous crisis in February.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the United States
believed the message to Saddam is already quite clear that he
needs to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors or face
the possibility of military retaliation.
</P>
<P>
"We've made clear that the message has been delivered. It needs
to be received, and there's no room for negotiation. It would be
hard to see the utility of constructing multiple new ways to
deliver the message. We think the message has been delivered and
is quite clear," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Annan meets Security Council members on Friday after cutting
short a trip to North Africa because of the Iraqi crisis, but is
not making any plans to visit Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Albright suggested that only Saddam himself might be able to
stop the strikes. "He needs to rescind publicly his decision" to
bar cooperation with weapons inspectors, she said.
</P>
<P>
"No further warnings are needed" if the U.S. took military
actions, she said.

<HEADLINE> Korean Poaching Ship Fined in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A Korean ship detained last
month for illegaling fishing in the Angolan waters has to pay a
fine of 3.995 million U.S. Dollars to the Angolan government,
officials said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Legal Bureau under the Angolan Ministry of
Fisheries Eurico Paz Costa said the Korean fishing boat Han Nam-7
was fined in line with the Angolan law for the protection of
fishery resources, including the punitive clauses.
</P>
<P>
Costa said the payment may be larger if the cost for the
repatriation of the 295 fishermen by the Angolan Immigration
Department is included.
</P>
<P>
The department has said that the owner of the ship has to pay
1,000 Dollars for repatriation of each fisherman.
</P>
<P>
The ship flying the flag of Honduras belongs to Korean Han Nam
Fishers, a company registered in Spain. It was seized with 150
tons of various fishes aboard by police of the fisheries ministry
on October 22 in the waters near the town of Quinzao in northern
Zaire Province.
</P>
<P>
Most of the employees on the ship were repatriated in recent
days.
</P>
<P>
On November 6, the Angolan police detained another Korean
fishing boat Acadia off the same province.
</P>
<P>
Angola boasts of one of the richest fishing waters in Africa,
with a potential catch of 850,000 tons of various fishes a year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign fishing fleets are often seen catching fish illegally
in the Angolan waters, but they cannot be totally curbed because
of a 1,650-kilometer coastal line of this southern African
country.

<HEADLINE> (repeat)Russia-Japan Declaration Eyes Peace Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Friday confirmed
"their determination to make every effort to sign a peace treaty
by the year 2000."
</P>
<P>
"For this purpose they ordered the formation of a subcommittee
on border delimitation within the framework of the existing joint
Russian-Japanese commission for a peace treaty," said the Moscow
Declaration signed by the two leaders separately.
</P>
<P>
The disputed Southern Kuril Islands, known as the Northern
Territories in Japan, has been a sticking point barring the
signing of a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi is here on a three-day official visit, the first one by
a Japanese premier in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Moscow Declaration, Yeltsin's spokesman
Dmitry Yakushkin said no special status for the South Kuril
islands is going to be discussed with Japan, but Russia is ready
to consider economic interaction in the islands and visa-free
travel of Japanese citizens to the Kurils.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that Yeltsin's no-show at the official dinner
Thursday night in honor of Obuchi was agreed at their meeting
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Some observers linked Yeltsin's absence at the dinner to his
health problems. Yeltsin returned to Moscow last week from the
Black Sea resort of Sochi, where he took a vacation prescribed by
his doctors to recuperate from "serious fatigue" in the wake of a
bout of bronchitis.
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin said he "would not link Yeltsin's absence [from the
lunch] with his health," Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
He said both sides "gained something" from the summit, noting
"good, sincere atmosphere" at the talks.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese know what the Russian public thinks about the
territorial issue." he said.
</P>
<P>
The Moscow Declaration, on the establishment of constructive
partnership between the two countries, said the two leaders
"instructed their governments to step up talks on a peace treaty."
</P>
<P>
They "also ordered the formation of a subcommittee for joint
economic activities in the said islands which, acting
simultaneously with the subcommittee for border delimitation,
would define the forms of possible joint economic activity in the
islands that will not damage the legal positions of the sides,"
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders "agreed in principle on allowing very
simplified, virtually free visits to the islands by Japanese
citizens who are former residents of the islands and their
families."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Obuchi realize the importance of cooperation
related to the four islands to promote understanding between the
residents of neighboring areas of Russia and Japan and to expand
multi-faceted mutually beneficial cooperation, which will create
conditions for the speedy signing of a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
On cooperation in international affairs, the declaration said
Russia and Japan will deepen interaction within the framework of
the G-8 and that Moscow supports Japan's determination to become a
permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also expressed their determination to expand
cooperation in strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation treaty,
speedily enforcing the treaty on a general and complete ban on
nuclear tests, and drafting a treaty banning the production of
fissile materials for nuclear arms and other nuclear explosive
devices.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the two sides signed a document on the establishment
of a Japanese- Russian investment company "to contribute to direct
investments in Russia by Japanese companies, including joint
ventures, with support from the governments of Russia and
Japan."
</P>
<P>
"The funds necessary for the investment will be made available
by the governments of Russia and Japan to the Russian and the
Japanese companies respectively so that the total amount of the
funds allocated by each government stands at 50 million U.S.
dollars."
</P>
<P>
The company will be able to provide one enterprise implementing
an investment project with up to 20 percent of the overall amount
of investment in this project.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi also met with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said the Moscow Declaration on creative partnership
between Russia and Japan has demonstrated that the two countries
are coming closer together.
</P>
<P>
"This movement is irreversible," Primakov said after his talks
with Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders exchanged copies of the declaration before the
start of a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi said he was pleased with the results of his talks with
Primakov and expressed confidence that relations between the two
countries would successfully expand in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks, the two sides signed an intergovernmental
agreement on investment encouragement and protection and two
memorandums, one on cooperation in the field of tourism and the
other on cooperation in environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
They also signed a document on postal and telecommunications
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Urges Youth to Nurture Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 13 (Xinhua) -- President Robert Mugabe Friday
said Zimbabwe is proud of its unique and diverse culture which
must be nurtured and enriched at all times, particularly among
the youths who are tomorrow's leaders.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said this in Harare when he officially opened the first
Mobil Zimbabwe Heritage Biennial Awards for 1998, where a total
of 17 local artists received awards for their outstanding
performance in painting and stone carving.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said since the national independence in 1980, local
artists have achieved international fame, demonstrating their
ability and talent and gained acceptability in the world that is
fast becoming a global village.
</P>
<P>
Despite hardships, the president said, Zimbabwe's talented
artists have demonstrated total dedication and commitment to
their chosen profession.
</P>
<P>
"The young men and women who produce work of this high quality
now offer a welcome challenge to the established artists in whose
footsteps they have been following," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
The government is fully aware and feels concerned that the
Zimbabwe national gallery is experiencing financial constraints
and appeals to public and private sectors to assist by offering
financial and material assistance, he added.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Economic Environment Deteriorating: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe National Chamber
of Commerce (ZNCC) Friday expressed concern over the continued
rapid deterioration of the economic environment and the
government's inability to curb it.
</P>
<P>
Opening a new chamber office in capital Harare, ZNCC Deputy
President Peter Chanaiwa said with inflation above 34 percent and
small and medium enterprises borrowing at 50 percent interest
rates, the continued slide of the Zimbabwean Dollar against major
currencies was of great concern to members.
</P>
<P>
"With the escalating input costs and the declining domestic
demand, many of our members are being pushed to the wall and
throwing workers onto the streets," said Chanaiwa.
</P>
<P>
If the current environment was not immediately put right, the
nation could be plunged into anarchy, the Zimbabwe News Agency
Ziana quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said Wednesday's mass strike organized by the Zimbabwe
Congress of Trade Unions to protest against the 68 percent hike
in fuel prices and the escalating cost of living was testimony of
a population that could no longer bear the current economic
hardships.
</P>
<P>
The chamber was heavily involved in the tripartite talks
involving labor, the government and the employers to resolve
these problems and bring relief to the business community.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's postponement of the meeting of the
tripartite negotiating forum, accusing the trade union of
negotiating in bad faith, had only worsened the situation.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to convene an urgent meeting to chart the way
forward and cure the battered economy.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Corporate Layoffs Increasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 13 (Xinhua) -- As most economists predict
that the U.S. economy is going to slow down next year, many
American companies are streamlining themselves by cutting jobs.
</P>
<P>
In the first ten months this year, U.S. companies have
announced 523,000 layoffs, shaping up 1998 as the biggest year for
corporate layoff announcements in a decade.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of this year's layoffs has come in the U.S.
manufacturing sector, according to some recent surveys.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. press reports said Friday that 1999 could be even
worse in corporate job cuts as layoffs continue to mount.
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Texaco said that it would cut 1,000 jobs while shipper
AmeriTruck announced that it would lay off up to 1,000, capping a
four-day cluster of layoff announcements.
</P>
<P>
The announcements include 300 job cuts by Eastman Kodak, 1,000
job cuts by Monsanto and 700 job cuts by J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Federal Express is considering to permanently reduce its
reliance on its air shipments, a move that threatens to cut the
ranks of its 3,500 pilots.
</P>
<P>
Some economists expect the nation's unemployment rate, 4.6
percent in October, to rise to about 5 percent this month.
</P>
<P>
But surveys indicated that job growth is strong in the software
and retail sectors.
</P>
<P>
The unemployed workers are taking an average of just 2.6 months
to find jobs, down from a typical average of about 3.2 months.

<HEADLINE> India, Pakistan Conclude Second Phase of Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 13 (Xinhua) -- India and Pakistan concluded
their second phase of dialogue process Friday with no tangible
progress on nearly all issues discussed in the nine-day talks on
the long-pending disputes including territory disputes and
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Cultural secretaries of the two countries discussed Friday the
promotion of relations through cultural, media and friendly
exchange between the two peoples and agreed to meet again on
November 20 to finalize an agreement on the much-publicized Delhi
to Lahore bus service.
</P>
<P>
A Pakistani spokesman said after the talks that Islamabad was
ready to sign the protocol on the bus service but some
technicalities had to be gone through before it is finalized.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Islamabad was "totally disappointing" with
the outcome of the dialogue with India and accused New Delhi of
adopting "rigid and inflexible" attitude toward resolving all
outstanding bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
"We have come with high hope for moving forward on resolution
of bilateral disputes," but "met with total disappointment as
there was not progress because of inflexibility and rigid attitude
of India," he said.
</P>
<P>
India rejected the charge immediately, saying that New Delhi
would continue to approach the bilateral talks in a "serious,
constructive and positive" manner without any third party
mediation.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors failed to make any headway on issues relating
to Siachen, Tulbul navigation project, Sir Creek maritime boundary
dispute and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
However, both sides struck a positive note on promoting
friendly exchanges in various fields and agreed to meet again.
</P>
<P>
The two sides failed to reach any understanding on their
perceptions on terrorism and narcotic smuggling at the bilateral
talks held here Thursday. They agreed to set up a mechanism for
regular meetings and exchange of operational information between
India's Central Bureau of Investigation and the Federal
Investigation Agency of Pakistan for expeditious assistance to
each other for combating various types of crimes.
</P>
<P>
Brief joint statements issued after nearly every round of talks
merely said that the two sides stated their respective positions
in "frank and cordial atmosphere" and agreed to continue their
discussions during the next round of the dialogue process.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors held their first round of talks Tuesday on
commerce and trade with initial signs showing that only marginal
headway has been made in resolving key issues relating to
telecommunications, railways and power sector.
</P>
<P>
The two countries failed to make any progress Monday on their
long-pending Sir Creek maritime boundary dispute with New Delhi
firmly rejecting Islamabad's proposal for third party arbitration
during their talks.
</P>
<P>
The current round of talks is the second phase of the scheduled
nine-day dialogue between the two countries which have so far not
turned out any positive results on three of the six outstanding
identified issues.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on both a navigation project and the Siachen
Glacier held here last week had also ended in a deadlock.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Friday that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has it within his
hands to end the crisis over weapons inspections -- by resuming
cooperation with U.N. monitors.
</P>
<P>
"For more than three months, the United States and the
international community have very patiently sought a diplomatic
solution to Iraq's decision to end all its cooperation with the
U.N. weapons inspectors," Clinton said at an event at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq's continued refusal to embrace a diplomatic peaceful
solution... makes it plainer than ever that its real goal is to
end the sanctions without giving up its weapons of mass
destruction program," he added.
</P>
<P>
While holding out hopes for a peaceful solution, Clinton said
the world has made it clear that "none of us can tolerate an Iraq
free to develop weapons of mass destruction with impunity,"
Clinton noted.
</P>
<P>
"Still, Saddam Hussein has it within his hands to end this
crisis now by resuming full cooperation with UNSCOM," the United
Nations Special Commission, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, U.S. Secretary Madeleine Albright said that
the U.S. wants a "peaceful outcome" from the standoff with Iraq,
but if Baghdad fails to comply, it may face consequences.
</P>
<P>
If Iraqi President Saddam Hussein publicly rescind his refusal
to cooperate with the U.N. inspectors, a military action against
Iraq can be avoided, Albright told a news conference at the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
"For months we have said that every option was on the table.
Unfortunately, one by one, the diplomatic options have been
rebuffed. Iraq has a simple choice: reverse course or face the
consequence," she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright told reporters she didn't see much room left for
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
The White House said it saw no need for a last-ditch mission to
Iraq by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan as recommended by
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russian special Middle East envoy Viktor Posuvalyuk has said
Moscow would support a new trip to Iraq by Annan, who headed off
U.S. airstrikes by cutting a last-minute deal with Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein during a previous crisis in February.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the United States
believed the message to Saddam is already quite clear that he
needs to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors or face
the possibility of military retaliation.
</P>
<P>
"We've made clear that the message has been delivered. It needs
to be received, and there's no room for negotiation. It would be
hard to see the utility of constructing multiple new ways to
deliver the message. We think the message has been delivered and
is quite clear," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Annan meets Security Council members on Friday after cutting
short a trip to North Africa because of the Iraqi crisis, but is
not making any plans to visit Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Albright suggested that only Saddam himself might be able to
stop the strikes. "He needs to rescind publicly his decision" to
bar cooperation with weapons inspectors, she said.
</P>
<P>
"No further warnings are needed" if the U.S. took military
actions, she said.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Announces to Accept Positive Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
declared Friday that Iraq is ready to accept any positive
initiatives to end the current Iraq-U.N. crisis.
</P>
<P>
In his first public statement since the crisis began on October
31 when Iraq suspended all cooperation with the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq, Saddam Hussein said Iraq
was not trying to create a crisis or stop cooperation with the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Iraqi official News Agency (INA) as saying
that his decision on October 31 to restrict the activities of
UNSCOM was intended to get responses to Iraq's legal demands.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to the Iraqi demand that the
economic sanctions imposed by the U.N. seven and half years ago be
lifted.
</P>
<P>
Saddam's Statement came as the United States and Britain are
busy beefing up their military strength in the Gulf in preparation
for a possible military strike against Iraq to compel it to
rescind its October 31 decision.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Saddam also expressed his appreciation of and
trust in Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov and for Russia's efforts in supporting Iraq's
just cause, INA said.
</P>
<P>
Russia have urged the U.N. Security Council to ease the
sanctions as Iraq has complied with U.N. resolutions adopted after
the 1991 Gulf War that call for the elimination of Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council will lift the sanctions only when the
U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has destroyed all those weapons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton said in a statement that
Saddam Hussein "has it within his hands to end the crisis now."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said it would be unacceptable for Saddam to proceed
with His weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
"Still, Saddam Hussein has it Within his hands to end this
crisis now by resuming full cooperation with UNSCOM."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's statement came shortly after U.S. Secretary of State
Madeline Albright said Iraq can stop the possible airstrikes if
it rescinds a ban on U.N. weapons inspections. "Reverse course
or face the consequences," she warned.

<HEADLINE> IMF Launches IMF-Led $42 Bln Rescue Program for Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Friday launched a rescue program up to some 42 billion
U.S. dollars for Brazil in a bid to stop global financial chaos
from spreading to Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian authorities and an IMF team "have successfully
concluded negotiations on a strong three-year program of economic
and financial reform," declared Michel Camdessus, IMF Managing
Director at a press conference at his headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
He said that as part of the agreement, Brazil committed itself
to reducing its 65 billion dollar budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
"The way is now open for the international community to provide
financial support to Brazil that will enhance market confidence in
the government's economic policies and help ensure the success of
the country's program," the IMF chief noted.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said more than 41 billion dollars would be available
to Brazil over the next three years with 37 billion dollars ready
if needed in the next three months. Camdessus said that as part of
the package the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB) would provide 4.5 billion dollars separately for the
program.
</P>
<P>
He said Brazil also would obtain funds from a large number of
industrial countries in North America, Europe and Asia totaling
about 14.5 billion dollars which also includes the 5 billion
dollars from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The IMF is expected to contribute between 15 billion dollars
and 18 billion dollars to support Brazilian economic plan of tax
increases and spending cuts aimed at saving 23.5 billion dollars
so as to avert a devaluation of the country's currency.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said the agreement
offered "a solid basis for restored confidence and renewed
growth." As part of the package between the IMF and Brazil, the
United States will provide up to 5 billion dollars in short-term
funding.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the Clinton administration's decision to participate
reflects our commitment to strengthen the international financial
system, guard against financial market contagion, and protect
America's economic interests."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. contribution will come from a Treasury Department fund
originally established to protect the dollar. The United States
used the fund to help Mexico in 1995 and South Korea and Indonesia
last year.
</P>
<P>
The IMF-led international rescue program for Brazil would bring
the final total to an estimated 42 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
After Asia's financial crisis last year and Russia's economic
crisis in mid-August triggered panic in global markets,
international investors and bankers feared Brazil would be forced
to devalue.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's foreign exchange reserves have dropped from 65 billion
dollars to 47 billion dollars as investors moved out their money.
In an attempt to stem the flow, the Cardoso government raised
interest rates to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year, in response to Asia's financial crisis, the
Washington-based lending agency arranged a 57 billion dollar
package for South Korea, a 23 billion-plus deal for Indonesia and
a 17.2 billion dollar loan arrangement for Thailand. In August
this year, the IMF established a 23 billion dollar safety net for
Russia.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reiterates Sovereignty over Gulf Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Mahmoud Mohammadi reiterated Friday that the three islands of Abu
Musa, the Greater and Lesser Tunbs in the Persian Gulf are "an
integral part of Iran's territory."
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi made the remarks in a response to the statement of
the 16th meeting of foreign ministers of the Damascus Declaration
signatories issued on Thursday in Qatari capital of Doha, the
official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said the misunderstanding between Iran and the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) over the three islands can be solved on
the basis of the 1971 letter of understanding between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran is committed to broadening relations with all Muslim
states and especially those in the Persian Gulf region, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that Arab countries will encourage
the UAE to continue talks with Iran to solve their
misunderstanding over the three islands.
</P>
<P>
Iran took over the three Gulf islands in the strategic Hormoz
Strait in 1971 after the British forces withdrew from the region.
</P>
<P>
However, both Iran and the UAE claimed full sovereignty over
the three islands though they reached an agreement in 1971 to
co-rule the islets.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Syria, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and
the UAE signed the Damascus Declaration after the 1991 Gulf War to
create a mechanism aimed at guaranteeing security in the Gulf
region.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the eight member states attended the
November 11-12 meeting.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Confirms Presence of Liberian Ex-Warlord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
confirmed the presence of former Liberian warlord Roosevelt
Johnson for the first time since Johnson was flied to Nigeria in
late September.
</P>
<P>
Johnson is now residing in Nigeria on asylum, which
was arranged by the U.S. government, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Malam Mohammed Haruna, the Chief Press Secretary to
Nigerian leader General Abdulsalami Abubakar said in Abuja
Thursday that the U.S. government is bearing the cost of
Johnson's stay in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Haruna denied a claim by Johnson on a foreign radio that he is
being held in Nigeria against his will.
</P>
<P>
Johnson fled into the U.S. Embassy in Liberian capital
Monrovia for refugee in September, when Liberian security forces
tried to arrest him on charges of treason and murder.
</P>
<P>
He was later lifted out of the embassy on a helicopter by the
Americans, after a reported agreement between the U.S. and
Liberian governments that allows Johnson to take refugee in a
third country.
</P>
<P>
Johnson was a major rival of Charles Taylor, another major
warlord during the country's 1990-1997 civil war and now
President of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Taylor accused Johnson of plotting against his government.

<HEADLINE> Annan to Meet Chinese, French, Russian Envoys on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has accepted a request from the Chinese, French and
Russian representatives to the United Nations for a meeting before
the U.N. chief's scheduled meeting with all 15 Security Council
members on Friday afternoon, a U.N. spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
"The representatives of China, France and the Russian
Federation have requested a meeting with him (the
Secretary-General) before that meeting with all 15 members of the
Security Council, and he has agreed to do that," U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard said, "I don't have a specific time for that
meeting."
</P>
<P>
Annan, who cut short his North Africa tour before his Thursday
return to the U.N. headquarters in New York, is scheduled to have
a meeting with 15 Security Council members "at their request for
an exchange of views on Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
China, France and Russia, three permanent members of the
Security Council, earlier lashed out at a decision, taken by the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) without previous consultations
with Security Council members, to pull its staff out of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Richard Butler, who heads the UNSCOM in charge of disarming
Iraq, said he made the decision on "strong recommendation" from
the U.S. Government, which is increasing military build-up in the
Gulf to press Iraq to back off on its non-cooperation stance.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who defused a major Iraqi crisis in February this year,
has no plan to visit Iraq over the latest stalemate as he saw no
ripe conditions for such a visit.
</P>
<P>
Before his decision to cut off his North Africa visit, the U.N.
chief said in a statement issued via his spokesman's office here
that he was "saddened and burdened" by the Iraq's October 31
decision to suspend all cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Annan "strongly urged" the Iraqi leadership to resume
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors, saying "the only way"
towards the lifting of sanctions against Iran, which remains in
force following Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Peter Burleigh, president of the Security Council and charge
d'affaires of the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, said on
Friday that "the ball is in the Iraqi court."

<HEADLINE> NATO Approves Extraction Forces Concept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization approved on Friday the concept of extraction forces
as the backup for the OSCE-led verification mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
But the North Atlantic Council, the decision-making body of the
16-nation military alliance, did not decide on the size of the
extraction forces or the formation of the forces.
</P>
<P>
NATO has been studying the mission of the extraction forces,
conceived to standby and extract the 2,000 verifiers from Kosovo
should the situation there become dangerous.
</P>
<P>
The extraction forces, to be led by France, are assumed to
station in nearby Macedonia and may consist of from 1,500 to 1,800
troops from four or five European allies of NATO, possibly France,
Britain, Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
The United States have decided not to join the extraction
forces.
</P>
<P>
A NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, explained
earlier that the allies wanted to get things right from the very
beginning and had therefore been very meticulous in planning the
operation of the extraction forces.
</P>
<P>
NATO decision makers were bothered by the legality of
extraction forces entering into the sovereign territory of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the event of the extraction
operation of Organization for Security and Cooperation in European
(OSCE) verifiers.

KUWAIT CITY, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Deputy Prime
Minister and Defense Minister Salem Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah said
Friday that Kuwait has taken preventive measures as a
U.S. military strike against Iraq is said to be imminent.
</P>
<P>
Salem was speaking to the Kuwait News Agency shortly after he
was back from a visit to the United States. He cut short the
visit due to the Iraqi crisis with the U.N. after Baghdad's
suspension of cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"The geographic location of Kuwait obliged us to follow these
developments closely," Salem said.
</P>
<P>
He said all preventive measures were taken in Kuwait in case a
military strike was launched against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti defense minister also reiterated that his country
was "committed to defense pacts with the world's big powers,"
saying "coordination was going on between Kuwait and neighboring
and friendly countries to back the security of the north Gulf
state."
</P>
<P>
Salem met in Washington Thursday with his U.S. counterpart
William Cohen on defense cooperation as well as the latest
U.N.-Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti government stressed last week the need of Iraq's
full compliance with U.N. Security Council resolutions related
to its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Annan to Share Iraqi Assessment With Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan is expected to meet with representatives from China,
France and Russia at 3:00 p.m. EST on Friday before his previously
scheduled closed-door meeting with all 15 Security Council members
on the current Iraqi crisis, a U.N. spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General will meet with Ambassadors of China,
France and Russia at 3 p.m. (EST) on Friday," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, China, France and Russia, three permanent members of
the Security Council, has lashed out at a decision by the U.N.
Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, without consultations with
the Security Council members to pull its staff out of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Richard Butler, who heads UNSCOM, said on Tuesday that he made
such a decision on "strong recommendation" from the U.S.
Government and out of concerns on security and safety for his
staff in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Peter Burleigh, president of the Security Council and also
charge d'affaires of the U.S. Mission to the United Nations,
Friday told reporters that Annan will have a closed-door meeting
with all Council members at the request of the Council.
</P>
<P>
They "are going to share the assessment of development
overnight and (during the period) since the Secretary-General's
going away from New York for a week," Burleigh said.
</P>
<P>
"The Council felt the need to hear from him (Annan) his
assessment of the event," he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, "the ball is in the Iraqi court, and the
responsibility is theirs" to come back to compliance with relevant
U.N. resolutions and cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General and the Security Council have made it
clear to Iraq that there is no hope to lift sanctions against the
Mideast country, which remains in force after Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait, if Iraq refuses to rescind its non-cooperation decision
announced on August 5 and October 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who cut short his North Africa tour for an earlier
return to the U.N. headquarters on Thursday, has no plan to visit
Iraq over the present crisis.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief has headed off a major crisis in February after
he reached an agreement with Iraqi leaders in the Iraqi capital of
Baghdad on unfettered access to all sites by U.N. weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the Council members have direct bilateral contacts
with the Iraqi Government, and they were pressing Iraq to reverse
itself and rescind its decision," Burleigh said. "As far as I am
aware, there has been no positive response from the Iraqi side to
any of these bilateral initiatives."

<HEADLINE> U.N. Monitors for Food Imports into Iraq Leave Posts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A British Company
contracted by the United Nations to monitor humanitarian imports
into Iraq was leaving their posts on Friday, a U.N. official said
in a statement issued here.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, suppliers will not be paid for the goods shipped as
certification of their arrival is needed from the inspectors, said
Benon Sevan, Executive Director of the Office of the Iraq Program
dealing with the "oil-for-food" matters.
</P>
<P>
"At 0715 today (New York Time), I was informed by telephone
that the independent inspection agents who certify the arrival of
humanitarian supllies into Iraq were being withdrawn immediately
from their posts," Sevan said.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision by Lloyds Register company was taken
without prior consultation with the United Nations. 54 Lloyds
staff were based at border crossings with Jordan, Turkey and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program allows Iraq to export more than 5.2
billion U.S. dollars of oil every six months in order to buy food,
medicine and other humanitarian goods as U.N. trade sanctions have
been in place since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The oil revenues are put into a special account from which
goods suppliers are paid, provided that their arrival is
certified.
</P>
<P>
Sevan said he is going to consult with the relevant committee
of the Security Council this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Uzbekistan Denies Backing Tajik Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Uzbekistan on Friday denied as
"totally groundless" statements that rebels have been penetrating
into Tajikistan from Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
"Uzbekistan, the closest neighbor of Tajikistan, is interested
in peace and stability in this country more than anybody else,"
the Uzbek Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It said Uzbekistan is bewildered by the statements of Tajik
President Emomali Rakhmonov Thursday in the parliament accusing
Uzbekistan of interfering in Tajikistan's domestic affairs and
even of supporting the recent insurgency in northern Tajikistan,
Interfax quoted the ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said such statements by the Tajik leadership are
"poorly thought-out actions and may lead to serious complications
and inter-ethnic discord, primarily in Tajikistan itself."
</P>
<P>
"The Uzbek Foreign Ministry would like to confirm that any
armed insurgencies in neighboring Tajikistan should be seen as
actions by forces opposing the peace process and pursuing their
own selfish, narrow interests."
</P>
<P>
"Uzbekistan is confident that the international community and
primarily the mission of U.N. observers in Tajikistan will make
an appropriate evaluation of such accusations," the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Announces to Accept Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein Friday said he was not trying to create crisis or stop
cooperation with the U.N. and will accept "positively any
initiative" that would meet Iraq's legal demands.
</P>
<P>
Saddam made the remarks when meeting Russian Ambassador to
Iraq, Nikolai Kartouzov, who delivered two letters from Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, the
Iraqi News Agency INA reported.
</P>
<P>
But the contents of the letters were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
This is Saddam's first public statement since the latest
Iraqi-U.N. standoff began on October 31 when Iraq announced to halt
all cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), which
oversees Iraq's disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The decision came a day after the U.N. Security Council decided
to conduct a comprehensive review on Iraq's progress on eliminating
banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
But the council refused to concede to the Baghdad's demand that
the review lead to the lift of the U.N. sanctions, imposed on Iraq
following its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The council maintains the sanctions will not be lifted until
UNSCOM verifies that Iraq has eradicated all its weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Saddam said Friday the Iraqi leadership's decision was not to
"create a crisis or stop cooperating with the Security Council,
but to get response to Iraq's legal demands."
</P>
<P>
He also said "Iraq will accept positively any initiative that
meets its just and balanced demands."
</P>
<P>
Saddam's statement came amid the military buildup by the
U.S. in the Gulf for a possible military strike to compel Iraq to
rescind its October 31 decision.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Saddam also expressed his appreciation of and
trust in Yeltsin and Primakov and for Russia's efforts in
supporting Iraq's just cause, INA said.
</P>
<P>
Russia have urged the Security Council to ease the sanctions as
Iraq has complied with U.N. resolutions adopted after the 1991
Gulf War that call for the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
But, meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton said in a statement
that the only way to end the ongoing crisis is for Iraq to resume
cooperation with UNSCOM immediately.
</P>
<P>
It will be unacceptable for Saddam to proceed with his weapons
programs, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"Still, Saddam Hussein has it Within his hands to end this
crisis now by resuming full cooperation with UNSCOM," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made statement shortly after U.S. Secretary of State
Madeline Albright said Iraq can stop the possible airstrikes if
it rescinds a ban on U.N. weapons inspections. "Reverse course
or face the consequences," she warned.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said that
Secretary Kofi Annan has no plans at this time to go to Baghdad to
mediate the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has pinned much hope on Annan to help end the current
standoff, who helped defuse a similar Iraqi-U.N. crisis in
February by going to Baghdad to broker an agreement that head off
a U.S. airstrike.

will join hands in development and manufacture of new defense
systems.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-Indian defense technology cooperation can be
significantly expanded, Mikhailov said at the end of a meeting of
the bilateral working group on military technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Indian delegation was headed by Deputy Defense Minister
Ajit Kumar.
</P>
<P>
Mikhailov, the Russian co-chairman of the group, noted that
India was a leading importer of Russian defense hardware, Interfax

The deal on the purchase of 10 Su-30MKI fighters was discussed
at the meeting of the Russian-Indian task force on defense
cooperation in Moscow this week, Interfax said, quoting an
informed military source.
</P>
<P>
A Russian delegation will fly to India next week to hold
further discussions on the contract, and some preliminary
agreements on terms of the sale may be signed during the visit,
the source said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> COMESA to Oversee Regional Telecommunications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) will set up a company to oversee
telecommunications services in its member countries.
</P>
<P>
COMESA Secretary General Erastus Mwencha said here Friday that
COMESA is in the process of establishing the company, COMTEL.
</P>
<P>
He told a meeting attended by ministers of transport and
communications from COMESA member countries that liberalization
of telecommunications services in the region will lead to
increased economic activity, improved telephone access and
adoption of more modern technology.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization of the telecommunications will also result
in increased investment in the sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he added, more players will enter the sector and
create jobs and thereby enhance quality of services.
</P>
<P>
Many COMESA members have agreed to reduce state role in the
transport and communication sector and let the private sector be
the motive force behind the development efforts, Mwencha said.
</P>
<P>
He said resources required for projects under transport and
communications and other investment programs are enormous.
</P>
<P>
Plans are underway to strengthen COMESA bank by expanding its
membership through share capital currently valued at 540 million
U.S. Dollars to five billion Dollars, Mwencha announced at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"While the bank has already accumulated experience in lending
to the transport and communication sector, we are working closely
within to provided leadership in mobilizing resources for telecom
projects such as COMTEL," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Communications and Transport Minister David Saviye
said COMESA has already set up a working group which will draft a
working document for the establishment of COMTEL.
</P>
<P>
Saviye said the major objective of the company is to achieve
telecommunications inter-connectivity among COMESA member
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations on
Friday urged the international community and donor countries to
help hurricane-hit Central America address the longer-term
development needs.
</P>
<P>
Significant resources will be needed to make an early
transition from relief to development, said U.N. Development
Program (UNDP) Administrator James Gustave Speth in a statement
issued here.
</P>
<P>
"People can't be expected to live under canvas indefinitely,
without safe water supplies, health care or sources of energy.
They need help to rebuild their lives and better futures for their
children," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the countries hardest-hit by Hurricane Mitch has some
of the lowest incomes and highest debt burdens in the world, with
interest on the loans held by Nicaragua and Honduras at 2.2
million dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
Honduras and Nicaragua have long-term debts of 4 billion and
6.1 billion dollars respectively and the interest due on
Nicaragua's debt is equal to 29 percent of its annual export
income.
</P>
<P>
Speth praised France's announcement this week to forgive 69.8
million dollars owed by Nicaragua and 29.4 million dollars by
Honduras, saying France has set an important example for major
industrial nations.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) appealed Friday for aid in financing the
first phase of an emergency operation to help Central American
children and families left destitute by Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF warned that without urgent provision of clean safe
water, basic hygiene and essential drugs, killer diseases like
cholera, dysentery, malaria and measles could soon threaten the
lives of thousands of children.
</P>
<P>
"Unless we move quickly, what is already a catastrophic
regional disaster could become even worse," said Carol Bellamy,
the UNICEF's executive director.
</P>
<P>
The executive director said at least 3.7 million U.S. dollars
was needed by the UNICEF over the next 30 days to address the most
urgent needs of children and women.
</P>
<P>
Without speedy help, she said, survivors could fall prey to
disease and starvation.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said the UNICEF was focusing on essential health and
survival measures, water supply and sanitation, public-health
education, re-establishment of networks of community workers,
psychosocial rehabilitation of traumatized children, logistical
support and continuing assessment.

<HEADLINE> Rawlings Calls for End to Sanctions Against Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 13 (Xinhua)-- Ghanaian President Jerry John
Rawlings Friday called for an end to the United States economic
sanctions against Cuba and said the Caribbean nation needs to be
given a fair treatment.
</P>
<P>
''It is not fair to subject millions of people to such a
treatment, but I know Cuba will survive because of its
tenacity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
President Rawlings said this when he met Mrs. Vilma Espin De
Castro, President of Women's Federation of Cuba at the Castle,
Osu, the Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said Cuba has made a lot of sacrifice for the progress of
humanity and mentioned its contribution to the fight against
colonialism in Africa, where Cuba ''shed its blood''.
</P>
<P>
Without Havana's assistance, some African countries would have
found it difficult to achieve independence, said Rawlings who
paid an official visit to Cuba last month.
</P>
<P>
He said African countries could repay Cuba through increased
economic collaboration especially at this time that it is facing
economic difficulties as a result of U.S. sanctions, which have
been in place since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
He said Cuba has been of immense assistance to Ghana over the
past few years, "giving us something more valuable than money.
You gave us a good number of your doctors, who are serving in
some of the most difficult parts of the country".

<HEADLINE> China, France, Russia Press for Diplomacy on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- China, together with
France and Russia, is reinforcing diplomatic efforts at the United
Nations for a peaceful solution to the current Iraqi crisis, a
sharp contrast against the U.S. rattling of military threat
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The representatives of the three permanent members of the
Security Council began a meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan before his previously scheduled consultations with all 15
Security Council members.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting with the U.N. chief, the three
representatives may stress the importance for the international
community to continue to seek a solution to the crisis through
political and diplomatic means, a well-informed source told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the United States is increasing its military
build-up in the Gulf and voiced repeated threats to use force to
press Iraq to rescind its decision to suspend all cooperation with
U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who cut short his North Africa tour for an earlier
return to the U.N. headquarters in New York, is expected to meet
with all Security Council members late Friday to assess the
latest developments in the Iraq-U.N. standoff.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, Zhu Bangzao, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign
Ministry, said that the international community should reinforce
its diplomatic effort for a peaceful resolution to the current
weapons inspection confrontation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
China has maintained close contacts with the other permanent
members of the Security Council and the countries concerned to
seek a peaceful resolution to the crisis, Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says War Can Be Avoid if Iraq Complies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Friday that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has it within his
hands to end the crisis over weapons inspections -- by resuming
cooperation with U.N. monitors.
</P>
<P>
"For more than three months, the United States and the
international community have very patiently sought a diplomatic
solution to Iraq's decision to end all its cooperation with the
U.N. weapons inspectors," Clinton said at an event at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq's continued refusal to embrace a diplomatic peaceful
solution... makes it plainer than ever that its real goal is to
end the sanctions without giving up its weapons of mass
destruction program," he added.
</P>
<P>
While holding out hopes for a peaceful solution, Clinton said
the world has made it clear that "none of us can tolerate an Iraq
free to develop weapons of mass destruction with impunity,"
Clinton noted.
</P>
<P>
"Still, Saddam Hussein has it within his hands to end this
crisis now by resuming full cooperation with UNSCOM," the United
Nations Special Commission, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, U.S. Secretary Madeleine Albright said that
the U.S. wants a "peaceful outcome" from the standoff with Iraq,
but if Baghdad fails to comply, it may face consequences.
</P>
<P>
If Iraqi President Saddam Hussein publicly rescind his refusal
to cooperate with the U.N. inspectors, a military action against
Iraq can be avoided, Albright told a news conference at the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
"For months we have said that every option was on the table.
Unfortunately, one by one, the diplomatic options have been
rebuffed. Iraq has a simple choice: reverse course or face the
consequence," she said.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen made a similar warning in a
speech in Suffolk, Virginia, saying that Saddam could still avert a
military strike by permitting U.N. weapons inspections to resume.
</P>
<P>
"He can simply say, 'yes, we will comply,'" Cohen said.
"That's been his obligation."
</P>
<P>
The White House said it saw no need for a last-ditch mission to
Iraq by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan as recommended by
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russian special Middle East envoy Viktor Posuvalyuk has said
Moscow would support a new trip to Iraq by Annan, who headed off
U.S. airstrikes by cutting a last-minute deal with Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein during a previous crisis in February.
</P>
<P>
Annan meets Security Council members on Friday after cutting
short a trip to North Africa because of the Iraqi crisis, but is
not making any plans to visit Baghdad.

BAGHDAD, November 13 (Xinhua) -- French representative to
Iraq, who was recalled last week to Paris for consultations on
the current Iraq-U.S. standoff over weapons inspections, returned
to Baghdad on Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency reported that Charge D'affaires of the
French interests section in Iraq, Yves Aubin de la Messuziere,
returned to Baghdad to continue his duty.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi leadership decided on October 31 to halt all forms of
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission for disarming Iraq
(UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on November 5 condemned the Iraqi
decision and urged Iraq to resume cooperation with UNSCOM
immediately and unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
French government also deplored the Iraqi decision and
recalled its representative in Iraq to Paris for consultation.
</P>
<P>
Before Messuziere's return to Baghdad, France said on Thursday
that he would not carry any special message from the French
government to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, France expressed its wish that U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan can help defuse the on-going crisis between Iraq and
the United States, which has been building up its military
presence in the Gulf region and threatening to launch military
strikes on Iraq to force it to reverse course.

<HEADLINE> Inquiry Into Allegations Against Ghanaian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's main opposition, New
Patriotic Party (NPP), has called for an independent inquiry into
the allegations of five-million-Dollar payment by the former
Nigerian military leader, General Sani Abacha to President Jerry
Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
The NPP call was contained in a statement signed by Hackman
Owusu-Agyeman, member of parliament and minority spokesman for
foreign affairs, the Ghana News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
It said the allegations published by Nigeria's Post Express
newspaper and have found their way on to the internet " are as
damaging to the person and threaten to undermine the very
high office the president occupies and the sovereignty and the
reputation of Ghana."
</P>
<P>
The party said an investigation into the veracity or otherwise
of the allegations is necessary to protect "the nascent
constitutional order and ensure the continued peace and stability
of the country."
</P>
<P>
It therefore appealed to parliament to rise up to the
occasion and give all necessary assistance to facilitate the work
of the proposed independent body of inquiry to arrive at a speedy
verification of facts.
</P>
<P>
The NPP expressed the hope that current consultations by the
leadership of parliament would help define the necessary cause of
action.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian newspaper published a story early this month in
which it alleged that an amount of five million Dollars was paid
to Rawlings by Gen. Abacha to plead Nigeria's cause in the
international community in 1996.

over Baghdad's refusal to cooperate with United Nations arms
inspectors and assist the Security Council resolve the crisis
through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleading for a little more time and a little more

President Bill Clinton's special envoy.
</P>
<P>
Jackson is concluding a west African tour, which has taken him
to Nigeria, Guinea and Sierra Leone on a mission to promote human
rights, good governance and democracy, the Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The United States is assembling forces in the Gulf and has
warned Iraq of "significant military strikes if it failed to end
a ban on U.N. arms inspectors."
</P>
<P>
Rawlings said it would be worthwhile for the U.S. to hold back
its strength, adding "It pays to hold back the use of force."
</P>
<P>
The president spoke about Africa's hot spots and appealed to
the U.S. to assist the continent to resolve these conflicts.
</P>
<P>
In the era of the Cold War, he said, Zaire (the Democratic
Republic of Congo) "served a certain purpose" for the West. But
the time has come to right the wrongs of the past.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the gathering storm in the Gulf, Jackson said: "War
is not a solution. There should be a way out."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy briefed Rawlings on his activities during his
current African tour, saying his government appreciates the role
Ghana is playing in the search for peace and stability in west
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Passes Statement Against Extremism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma on
Friday approved the main points of a mildly-worded draft statement
condemning racism.
</P>
<P>
The statement at the lower house of parliament was passed amid
the furor caused by the recent anti-Semitic statements by
Communist parliament deputy Albert Makashov, who blamed Jews for
Russia's economic woes.
</P>
<P>
The draft, entitled "On the Unacceptability of Actions or
Statements which Aggravate Ethnic Relations in the Russian
Federation," cleared the 450-seat Duma with 303 votes, far
exceeding the 226 votes needed. Thirty-four deputies voted
against, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
"The ethnic issue cannot and must not become the reason for
political speculation," the draft says.
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning Makashov's name, the statement said "some
politicians, including State Duma deputies, resort to tactless
statements which hurt ethnic feelings, thereby increasing tension
in ethnic relations and aggravating instability in society."
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai
Bordyuzha warned that tough measures are taken against extremists,
Russia is likely to slide into disintegration.
</P>
<P>
"The disintegration of the USSR started with ethnic squabbles,"
he said after a meeting with heads of law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
"Today we are on the threshold of similar processes. Unless
emergency steps are taken to put an end to extremism, we may face
the possibility of Russia's disintegration," Bordyuzha said.
</P>
<P>
"Manifestations of extremism are on the rise and seriously
hinder efforts by the authorities to lead the country out of the
economic crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting discussed the need to pass a law on Nazi symbols,
and to work out a program of countering extremism, Bordyuzha said.
</P>
<P>
"Practical steps for control of rallies and marches where
extremist slogans are often voiced" were also discussed.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin has criticized law enforcement agencies
for their failure to react to manifestations of political and
ethnic extremism, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Extremist statements "are very dangerous because they are being
made against a background of the present difficult social and
economic situation," Yakushkin quoted Yeltsin as saying.

Kofi Annan and the members of the Security Council would hold an
unusual meeting on Iraq late in the afternoon, council sources
said Friday.
</P>

The schedule of the meeting was not listed in the U.N. daily
journal although it was announced Thursday by Council President
Peter Burleigh and the spokesman's office for the U.N.
secretary-general, the sources said.

<P>
The attendance was also restricted, with the ambassadors of the
15 council members limited to two aides each and with minimal U.N.

The meeting would focus on further diplomatic efforts to be
made to avoid the possible U.S. military strike against Iraq.

final of the 1.1 million U.S. dollars Kremlin Cup men's tennis
tournament on Sunday.

the final after six-seeded Marc Rosset retired with a hip injury
in the second set of a semifinal on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rosset's withdrawal came trailing 6-1, 2-0 behind the Russian,
who did not give Rosset any chance from the start. The only
reminder of his powerful serve was four straight aces in the
sixth game.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss could not serve and volley better in the second set
before he finally stepped down after the second game.
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Croat Ivanisevic booked his final berth after he
ousted surprise contender Arnaud Clement of France, 7-5, 6-2 in
the other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
The first set was more of a battle which saw both held on
until Ivanisevic broke in the twelfth game.
</P>

Clement, who got tired out in the second set, was unable to
keep up with the big server in a number of long rallies.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Characters May Be Older Than Egyptian Glyphs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUOYANG, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A local archaeologist from the
central China city of Luoyang has studied ancient Chinese culture
for 18 years and has concluded that Chinese characters are at
least 7,000-years old, much older than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
Chinese characters have been considered to be 3,300 years old,
created in the Shang Dynasty (about 2100-1600 B.C.), with the
findings of meaningful and artistic scratches on animal bones.
</P>
<P>
Cai Yunzhang, chairman of the Luoyang Society for Study of the
Book of Changes, revealed at a local seminar on Friday that the
origins of Chinese characters can be traced to the Peigang Culture
of some 7,000-8,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Cai has found similar scratches on excavated earthenware made
by ancient people living in China in periods ranging from the
Peigang Culture Period to the Shang Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
These symbolic scratches are the same as the divinatory symbols
in the well-known ancient Chinese Book of Changes, regarded as one
of the most valuable works in Chinese history which was used for
divination, according to the Chinese researcher.
</P>
<P>
Cai's findings would make Chinese characters more than 1,500
years older than ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics which were
inscribed at religious sites some 5,500 years ago, and are known
as "sacred script."
</P>
<P>
Both ancient Chinese characters and ancient Egyptian
hieroglyphics were used for religious ceremonious purposes, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese experts attending the seminar, including Yu
Weichao, curator of the China Museum of History, and Xu Shunzhan,
a well-known archeologist, spoke highly of Cai's finding and
agreed that it would cast important light on the study of Chinese
culture and world civilization.
</P>
<P>
Luoyang is an ancient city in central China's Henan Province,
and was the capital of 13 ancient dynasties and kingdoms. The city
is known for numerous historic relics and archeological finds
including its renowned, ancient stone-carved caves, religious
buildings, and tombs of famous ancient officials and scholars.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Turnover has exceeded five
billion yuan during the first two days of an agricultural and
sideline products trade fair being held in this capital of south
China's Hainan Province.

be part of Guangdong Province, became a separate province
ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
Hainan, which is also China's largest special economic zone,
has a tropical climate, and in the winter is the country's leading

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Urges International Role in Talks With India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz Saturday urged the international community to play a
"supporting role" in making the talks between Pakistan and India
result-oriented.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters here, Aziz expressed his disappointment
over the lack of progress in the Pakistani-Indian talks held in
New Delhi this week "due to New Delhi's attitude."
</P>
<P>
"We were not expecting a breakthrough, but we were hoping for
some progress. We are disappointed that it did not come due to the
Indian attitude," Aziz told the reporters at the National
Institute of Science and Technical Education.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the international community should
"closely follow the talks and analyze our proposals and the Indian
response to them" for the success of the next round of talks in
February.
</P>
<P>
"It is not multilateral mediation but a supporting role," said
Aziz, adding that "we hope that the international community will
show interest and see who is talking reason. It should analyze our
proposals and the Indian response to them."
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question about U.S. reiteration of mediation on
a resolution to the Kashmir dispute and other issues, Aziz said,
"Pakistan is ready but India is not."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's basic stand is on the Kashmir issue, he said, adding
that "we are for parallel progress on the Jammu and Kashmir
dispute."
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Pakistan's emphasis during this week' talks was on
peace and security issues, restraint along the Line of Control,
and humanitarian aspects like the release of fishermen and
prisoners.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Continues Preparations for Military strike on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States continued
its preparations for a possible air strike against Iraq despite
the latter's intention to resume dealings with the United Nations
arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The White House on Saturday demanded "concrete and demonstrable
actions" that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein will allow the return
of the U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
An overnight diplomatic gesture from U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to the Iraqis left the situation unchanged, the White
House said, a day after President Bill Clinton ordered an air and
sea armada and thousands of fresh ground troops to the Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
A senior Iraqi official said Saturday that Iraq's government is
expected to respond positively to Annan's pleas to resume dealings
with U.N. arms inspectors, but the U.S. said it was looking for
actions rather than words.
</P>
<P>
"Public commitment by Iraq must be followed by concrete and
demonstrable actions," David Leavy, spokesman for the National
Security Council, said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, military planners who work for the Joint Chiefs of
Staff met Saturday morning at the Pentagon in another round of
daily consultations on the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen, Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott and national security adviser Sandy Berger met at
the White House late Friday to assess the situation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, seeking more support, spoke by telephone on Friday
with Annan, Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and Jabar Sabah,
the emir of Kuwait. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
meanwhile, called a dozen foreign officials, including Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, who has registered his opposition to
air strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
At the Pentagon, officials said most of the B-52 heavy bombers
and F-117 Stealth fighter jets ordered to the gulf would be on
their way this weekend while the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise
is en route to the gulf, along with a Marine amphibious task
force. An additional 3,000 U.S. combat troops will join 1,500
already stationed in Kuwait to help protect its borders.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with the Security Council, Annan said all 15
members "stress the desirability of a peaceful and diplomatic
solution, but events on the ground may be running away from us."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Annan met with the ambassadors of Russia, France and
China who appealed to him to intervene to find a diplomatic
solution and avert U.S. air strikes. Annan later delivered a
private letter to the Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations.

missions in Baghdad that Saddam is to reply positively to Annan's
letter sent to him from U.N..
</P>
<P>
A positive answer means that Iraq will rescind its October
decision of suspending all cooperation with the United Nations
Special Commission on disarming Iraq and let the U.N. inspectors
back to work, observers said.
</P>
<P>
After meeting security council members on late Friday, Annan
urged Baghdad to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors
before "it is too late."
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced on October 31 to stop all cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors unless the U.N. considers the lifting of
the eight-year-old comprehensive sanctions on it.
</P>
<P>
Under U.N. resolutions, the sanctions can only be lifted after
the U.N. weapons inspectors verify that Iraq has destroyed its
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has threatened a military attack to force an Iraqi
backdown and is busy with building up military power in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Washington is sending in B-52 and B-1 bombers along with F-117
stealth jets. This will bring U.S. forces poised near Iraq to more
than 20,000 armymen, 300 aircraft and 20 ships, including two
aircraft carriers.

<HEADLINE> Russian Ambassador on President Jiang's Upcoming Russia Visit (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin's
upcoming Russia visit is of great significance for strengthening
Russian-Chinese ties and forming a new international pattern.
</P>
<P>
This remarks was made by Igor Rogachev, Russian ambassador to
China, during an interview with Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said the anticipated talks between the two top
leaders will be the sixth between them, and will continue the
frank dialogue which began with Russian President Boris Yeltsin's
China visit in 1992, and the discussions will push forward
bilateral ties including two-way trade.
</P>
<P>
Through such dialogue, he noted, the two countries are
approaching their common goal -- to set up a strategic partnership
oriented toward the 21st century. This goal is in the common
interest of both countries, Rogachev added.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Russia, President Jiang will exchange views
with Russian leaders on bilateral ties and international issues of
common concern in talks with President Yeltsin and in meetings with
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and leaders of
the Russian Federation Council and State Duma.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Russian-Chinese relations since the two countries
forged diplomatic ties 49 years ago, Rogachev said that bilateral
ties have gone through ups and downs during the period, and the
major lesson drawn by the leaders and peoples of the two countries
is that both countries should consolidate cooperation by a view
toward the future and living in harmony.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are no political issues that hinder the
development of bilateral ties, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
As permanent members of the United Nations Security Council,
Russia and China shoulder heavy responsibilities for global peace
and security, he adid. The two countries share similar or
identical views on many international issues, and they have
established mechanisms for regular discussions on major
international issues.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador cited the formation of a new international order
and the promotion of multi-polarization as the common goals of
both Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
He said it is of great significance that Russia, China, the
United States and Japan maintain normal relations, and he hopes
these four nations will coordinate efforts to overcome the
financial crisis. No party should pursue benefits for itself from
this crisis, he emphasised.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon Russian-Chinese trade, he said China is one of
Russia's largest trading partners, and that Russia places priority
on economic cooperation with China. There are broad prospects for
bilateral ties in the fields of energy, machine building, hi-tech,
aviation, space, laser, gas and and oil pipelines, and electric
power supplies, he added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that bilateral economic cooperation should be
upgraded from simple trade patterns to large-scale cooperation
such as a project to send natural gas from Russia to
China. According to this project, which is still under
negotiation, Russia will send 10 billion cubic meters of natural
gas from Irkutsk to China annually over the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The construction of a nuclear station in the city of
Lianyungang in east China's Jiangsu Province is currently the
largest cooperation project between Russia and China, he said,
adding that the Russian side will steadfastly carry out the
contract.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Army on Alert Amid Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti army has
stepped up its preparedness as "a precautionary measure" as
specter of military action looms large in the region.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Ahamad Al-Rahmani, the Director of Moral Guidance and
Public relations in the Kuwaiti Army, said on Saturday the army's
preparedness is to face up any emergency.
</P>
<P>
"We are in permanent, full and close coordination with the
allied forces to safeguard the security and stability of Kuwait
and protect it from any foreign aggression," Ahmad said.
</P>
<P>
He said Kuwait is not a party in the strife pitting the Iraq
regime against the United Nations and Kuwait always seeks security
and stability to the region.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister
Salem Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah said Kuwait has taken preventive
measures in case a military strike is launched against Iraq in
response to Baghdad's suspension of cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Salem noted "the geographic location of Kuwait obliges us to
follow these developments closely."
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti defense minister reiterated his country is
"committed to defense pacts with the world's big powers," saying
"coordination is going on between Kuwait and neighboring and
friendly countries to back the security of the north Gulf state."
</P>
<P>
The tension in the Gulf region is still mounting as the United
States is beefing up its forces in the region for a major military
strike against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> China Determined to Train More Cadres of Ethnic Origin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- China is determined to train
more outstanding cadres of various ethnic origins, Wang Zhaoguo,
vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who is also head of the United Front Work Department of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made the
remarks at a closing ceremony of a training program for cadres of
ethnic origin and cadres from ethnic areas.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee has always attached great importance
to the work related to ethnic affairs and has scored huge
achievements in this regard, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
As the reform deepens, China faces new tasks in ethnic affairs
work, he said, urging cadres in ethnic areas to improve their
theoretical and policy attainments and lead the people in their
respective areas to strive for faster growth.
</P>
<P>
Cadres in the ethnic areas should also contribute to union
among various ethnic groups and the safeguarding of national unity
and social stability, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Li Tielin, deputy head of the United Front Work Department of
the CPC Central Committee, said that cadres of ethnic origin and
cadres in ethnic areas should continue to be encouraged to gain
hands-on experience through short-term work at government agencies
and more developed areas on the East Coast, a practice that has
continued for nine years, and then apply their knowledge and
experience to practical work, thereby making new contributions to
the development of ethnic areas.
</P>
<P>
This year, a total of 205 young and middle-aged cadres from 31
ethnic groups in 19 provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions have been sent to government agencies in several of the
more developed cities and provinces to gain practical experience,
according to Li.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Uzbekistan foreign
ministry flatly denied charges that "Tajik armed military rebels
were entering northern areas of Tajikistan from Uzbekistan,"
sources in the Uzbekistan capital Tashkent reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Friday, the Uzbekistan Foreign Ministry
described the accusation as "slanderous and without grounds."
</P>
<P>
"As Tajikistan's neighbor, Uzbekistan cares about
the peace and stability of Tajikistan," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
On November 12, in an address to the parliament, Tajikistan
President Emomali Sharipovich Rakhmonov accused Uzbekistan of
"interfering in Tajikistan's internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
The military rebellion led by Makhmud Khudoiberdyev in
Tajikistan's northern Leninabad region early this month gained
support from Uzbekistan, said Rakhmonov.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are engaged in a dispute over national and
border issues because the northern part of Tajikistan is where
Uzbekistanians live.
</P>

In a statement on November 4, the Uzbek Foreign Ministry denied
any connection with the rebellion in Tajikistan.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz said Saturday Pakistan will not sign the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) during Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's visit
to the United States early next month.
</P>

Aziz, while referring to Sharif's address to the U.N. General

He recalled that Sharif in his address had stated that Pakistan
would adhere to the treaty before September 1999.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question, Aziz ruled out Pakistan's joining of
the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
</P>
<P>
"The NPT is out of our dictionary - we are a nuclear power and
we will not sign it as a non-nuclear country," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. insistence on halting fissile material production
even before the Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty (FMCT) comes into
force, he said, "we have conveyed that unless there is a framework
we cannot do so, we cannot do that unless the FMCT comes into
force."
</P>
<P>
In addition, Aziz said, Pakistan has to keep in mind that India
has gone much ahead of it in the production of fissile material.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Sharif's planned talks with U.S. President Bill
Clinton, Aziz said the two sides will review progress on the
issues that have been under discussion after Pakistan's nuclear
tests in May this year.
</P>
<P>
"We will take up a host of issues including the removal of
sanctions, the F-16 issue and military sales issue," the foreign
minister said.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Holds Talks with Spanish Senate President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
National Committee, has expressed satisfaction with the smooth
development of Sino-Spanish relations.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Juan Ignacio Barrero, president of the
Spanish Senate, Li said here today that since China and Spain
forged diplomatic ties 25 years ago, the two countries have
maintained good relations featuring frequent high-level visits,
expanded two-way trade, and enhanced exchanges in the scientific,
technological and cultural spheres.
</P>
<P>
He said he also appreciates Spanish's support for China on the
issues of Taiwan, human rights and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Li said, China and Spain are important countries in
Asia and Europe respectively, and they are playing more important
roles in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
China attaches importance to its ties with Spain, and would
like to strengthen bilateral and multi-lateral cooperation in
order to set up long-term stable friendly cooperation between the
two countries, and thereby contribute to world peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the domestic situation, Li said that although great
changes have taken place in China since the start of reform and
open-up 20 years ago, China's level of economic growth is still
low due to its vast population, poor foundation and imbalanced
development.
</P>
<P>
China is confident of countering these difficulties and
reaching its development goal, Li added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the CPPCC National Committee will solidify its
cooperation with the Spanish Senate.
</P>
<P>
Barrero said that Spanish-Chinese ties are enjoying sound
advancement at present, and Spain will make every effort to ensure
beautiful prospects for bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that through these visits relations
between the Spanish Senate and the CPPCC National Committee will
be further consolidated.

<HEADLINE> HK to Launch Pilot Scheme to Crack Down Smoky Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A three-month pilot scheme
will be launched here from next Monday, using a chassis
dynamometer to test the smoke emissions of vehicles over 5.5 tons
reported to have emitted excessive smoke.
</P>
<P>
Mok Wai-chuen, principal officer of the Environmental
Protection Department, said here Saturday that with the aid of a
chassis dynamometer, "we can test the smoke emissions of a vehicle
under real driving conditions. Unless a vehicle is properly
repaired, it cannot pass the smoke test."
</P>
<P>
During the pilot scheme, a vehicle failing to pass the test
will be required to undergo repair again and be retested until it
passed.
</P>
<P>
"If the pilot scheme is successful, we will seek to introduce
it as soon as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Using a similar device for light duty vehicles of 5.5 tons and
below has been proven effective during a pilot scheme conducted
last year.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government has a plan to require using chassis
dynamometers for testing light duty vehicles as from mid-1999.

<HEADLINE> Indo-Pakistani Talks A "Barren Round": Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has described its
latest talks with India as a "barren round", accusing its neighbor
of adopting an intransigence attitude and showing no sincerity.
</P>
<P>
"We had gone to India with an open mind and a constructive
attitude. But the Indian side was not willing to reciprocate. It
was a barren round," a Foreign Office spokesman said Saturday on
his return from New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
The latest talks between the two South Asian nations on six
subjects, namely the Siachin glacier, Sir Creek, Wullar Barrage,
Economic and commercial cooperation, terrorism and drug
trafficking, and friendly exchanges, concluded in New Delhi Friday
without any progress, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries held their foreign secretary-level talks on
the issues of peace and security, Jammu and Kashmir, in Islamabad
on October 16-18.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at the New Delhi talks the Indian side
was not prepared to make any progress towards the settlement of
the disputes on the six subjects.
</P>
<P>
Even on the Siachin issue, the Indian side resiled from the
agreement reached in 1989 which requires it to withdraw its troops
in line with the Simla agreement of 1972 between the two
countries, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, they sought to legitimize their illegal
occupation of the Siachin glacier by proposing a ceasefire without
an effective and central monitoring mechanism," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Pakistani delegations to all the meetings of
the six issues were of the opinion that without resolving the
issues including the core dispute of Kashmir, the environment
could not be conducive for promoting economic cooperation and
people to people contacts, as an environment of peace and security
is the prerequisite for real progress towards normalization of
relations.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Budget Deficit Edges Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's budget spending
exceeded revenues by 40 percent in the first 10 months of this
year, one point over the first nine-month figure.
</P>
<P>
A report by the country's finance ministry says the government
collected 2.481 billion U.S. dollars in the first 10 months this
year and spent 3.47 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In October, the deficit was 49 percent, up from 46 percent in
the month of September.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry renewed its pledge to keep the deficit
around 42 percent for the year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"We are taking all the necessary measures to control
expenditures and boost revenues in accordance with the policy to
reduce the deficit gradually over the next few years," the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Kamal Shehadi, director of sovereign risk at Tomson BankWatch,
an international rating agency, said if the ministry continues in
this pattern it will be possible to meet the 42 percent target.
</P>
<P>
Due to the ballooning budget deficit last year, several
international rating agencies, including Tomson BankWatch, have
issued warnings to downgrade their ratings toward Lebanon's
economy.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Lebanon's budget deficit has reached as far as 59
percent, accounting for 22 percent of GDP.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
El-Ganzouri Saturday discussed with visiting Secretary of Commerce
of the United States William Daley ways of boosting bilateral
economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Gowaili, who also
attended the discussion, said they tackled a number of issues
pertaining to bilateral cooperation, including the export of
Egyptian garments to the U.S. and the establishment of a free
trade zone.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between Egypt and the U.S. stood at about 4.5
billion U.S. dollars in Egypt's 1996-97 fiscal year (ending on June
30, 1997).
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Daley described the talks as
"constructive and fruitful," saying the meeting took place within
the context of strong relations of friendship between the two
countries, especially in the economic areas.
</P>
<P>
He praised the economic development in Egypt, expressing
keenness on bolstering bilateral economic and investment
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Since Egypt started economic reforms in 1991, the growth rate
of its gross domestic product has risen to 5 percent from 2
percent, inflation fallen to less than 4 percent from 20 percent
and foreign currency reserves climbed to 20 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official said the two countries are taking steps
towards the establishment of a free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
Daley, who arrived here Friday for a two-day visit, is expected
to meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and senior officials
in charge of trade and foreign economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He is currently on a regional tour, which has taken him to

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Set Up Overseas Workers' Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
decided to set up a special hospital for the country's overseas
workers to protect their welfare, the Philippine News Agency said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that in response to a pledge of President
Joseph Estrada to ensure the welfare of overseas Filipino workers
(OFWs), the senate has drafted a measure allocating 400 million
pesos (10 million U.S. dollars) to a hospital for OFWs.
</P>
<P>
Senator Franklin Drilon was quoted by the agency as saying that
this pro-OFW measure would give flesh to the government's
declaration recognizing Filipino workers abroad as the country's
heroes.
</P>
<P>
"We will help our OFWs by building a hospital for them, because
many of them get sick," he added.
</P>
<P>
Drilon said that dependents of OFWs will also benefit from the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Estrada announced earlier a package of pro-OFW measures,
including exemption of income tax and the setting-up of express
lanes for OFWs at the international airport in Manila to ensure
their hassle-free return to the country.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are at least 4.5 million OFWs working all
over the world, and their income has become a major source of the
country's foreign exchange revenues.

<HEADLINE> Mainland Trial of Cheung Tze-keung Case Correct and Legitimate: Law Expert (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUXI, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A leading Chinese law expert said
here today that according to Chinese law it is correct and
legitimate that a mainland court has jurisdiction over and
conducted a trial in the case of Hong Kong resident Cheung
Tze-keung and his 36-member gang, which committed a series of
felonies in Hong Kong and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
In a public announcement of its first instance verdict
Thursday, the Intermediate People's Court of Guangzhou, the
capital of south China's Guangdong Province, sentenced Cheung and
four of his major accomplices to death and permanent deprivation
of political rights for the crimes of illegal trading in
explosives, smuggling of firearms and ammunition, and kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
"I have paid close attention to this extremely serious case and
have learned its details through media reports," said Gao
Mingxuan, a professor at the law school of prestigious People's
University of China.
</P>
<P>
Gao, 70, has been engaged in the research and teaching of
criminal law worldwide for 47 years. As one of the drafters of
China's Criminal Law, he is now attending a national symposium on
enforcement of the newly amended Chinese Criminal Law in Wuxi
in the Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
"Cheung and other principal criminals in his gang committed
many serious crimes in an extremely vile way in the mainland and
Hong Kong, and did great social harm to both places," said
Gao. "They absolutely deserved the death sentence according to
law."

<HEADLINE> Mainland Trial of Cheung Tze-keung Case Correct and Legitimate: Law Expert (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since members of the gang include both Hong Kong and mainland
residents, and the crimes they were accused of were committed in
both Hong Kong and the mainland, Gao noted, it is natural that the
issue of jurisdiction over this case has aroused the concern of
some people, including a number of law experts.
</P>
<P>
According to Article 24 of the Criminal Procedure Law of the
People's Republic of China (PRC), he said, a criminal case is
under the jurisdiction of the people's court in the place of the
crime.
</P>
<P>
Article 2 of the Explanation on Certain Issues Concerning the
Implementation of the Criminal Procedure Law of the PRC, which was
adopted by the Judicial Committee under the Supreme People's Court
on June 29, 1998, stipulates that the place of the crime refers to
both the place where the criminal action took place and the place
where the criminal consequences took place.
</P>
<P>
"This means that a criminal case can be tried by courts either
in the place of the criminal action or in the place where the
criminal consequences occurred. Consequently, public security
organs in the location of the court have the power to investigate
the case and then transfer the case to the local procuratorial
organs, which can then institute legal proceedings according to
law," he explained.

<P>
Gao noted that the crimes of kidnapping and robbery committed
by Cheung and his gang in Hong Kong were all plotted and prepared
in the mainland. The explosives illegally traded were bought at
Cheung's order and with Cheung's money in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Preparing tools and creating conditions for the commission of
crimes are preparations for crimes, and should be regarded as
criminal actions, says Article 22 of China's Criminal Law.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question but that the people's court in the place
where such criminal actions occurred has jurisdiction over the
case," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Article 24 of the Criminal Procedure Law, he said,
there is no doubt that the court in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, where the criminal consequences in Cheung's
case took place, also has the right to claim jurisdiction over, and
hold a trial of, the case of Cheung and his gang, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, according to Article 25 of the Criminal Procedure Law,
he said, for a case in which courts in different regions all
have jurisdiction, the court that first accepts the case will hold
the trial.
</P>
<P>
He noted that according to media reports, Cheung and other
criminals in his gang were all arrested in the mainland after they
committed crimes in Hong Kong and sneaked back to the mainland to
hide.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a host of witnesses and material evidence in this
case were obtained or seized in the mainland, he added.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, there is a solid legal basis for holding
the Cheung trial in the Intermediate People's Court of Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
"A trial in the mainland will also lead to a thorough
investigation into this case, so as to punish criminals according
to law, and help safeguard public security in both Hong Kong and
the mainland," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Sends Team to India to Check Beef Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government sent
an inspection team to India Saturday to make sure that carabao
beef products coming from that country are free from the virus
causing the foot-and-mouth (FMD) disease.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview Saturday, Acting Agriculture Secretary
William Dar said: "I have instructed the agencies concerned to be
strict in all these aspects of quarantine."
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, a team left Saturday for India to check if
carabao beef imports from that country are safe for human
consumption.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada ordered government agencies Friday to
keep tabs on the entry of Indian carabao beef amid warnings from
local cattle growers that such imports come from India's
Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, where FMD outbreaks have occurred
since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, livestock growers and lawmakers said that Indian
carabao beef now sold in Metro Manila's wet markets could be
contaminated with the FMD virus.
</P>
<P>
Some fast-food chains and meat processors were accused of
possibly using carabao beef in their products without telling
consumers.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Urges Demonstrators to Calm Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Saturday issued a statement urging the demonstrators to
calm down and warned of stern measures against those violating the
existing laws.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with prominent figures here, the president said
there were violent acts aiming to foil the special session of the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), which violated the existing
laws.
</P>
<P>
The special MPR session ended on Friday night amid bloody
clashes between student demonstrators and security forces outside
the Parliament building here.
</P>
<P>
The violent acts were an attempt to overthrow the legal
government and can resort to a coup, the president said.
</P>
<P>
"I have, therefore, instructed Defense and Security
Minister/Armed Forces (ABRI) Commander Gen. Wiranto to take stern
measures in accordance with the existing laws," Habibie said.
</P>
<P>
The president called on public figures and mass organizations'
leaders as well as civilian and military officials to try to calm
down the people so that they would not be provoked to commit
illegal acts which could damage the national unity and integrity.
</P>
<P>
Habibie also expressed deep concern over the shooting incidents
in the capital on Friday which claimed at least nine lives.
</P>
<P>
ABRI spokesman Syamsul Maarif told reporters that Wiranto has
instructed Police Chief Lt. Gen. Roesmanhadi and Chief of Military
Police Maj. Gen. Djasri to investigate the shooting incidents.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said his side never gave any instructions to open fire
and use live bullets to security officers guarding the special MPR
session.
</P>
<P>
Antara News Agency Saturday reported that it received a number
of faxes from such organizations as the Women's Solidarity, the
Alliance of Independent Journalists and the Presidium of
Indonesian National Student Movement, calling for Wiranto's
resignation as the armed forces commander.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the National Mandate Party Amien Rais said Wiranto
was the first to take responsibility for the incidents in several
parts of the capital.
</P>
<P>
"That's why I appeal to Gen. Wiranto to resign immediately. I
think the people will respond to it (his resignation) positively,
meaning that the Armed Forces leaders have good intention to
comply with the aspirations of the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the National Front Lt. Gen. (retired) Kemal Idris
said, "Wiranto must be responsible and resign."
</P>
<P>
Noted human rights activist Adnan Buyung Nasution described the
violent acts as "uncivilized and meaningless". He said the Armed
Forces chief must be held responsible for the acts of the security
personnel.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Saturday called for speedy diplomatic efforts
as U.S. momentum for a showdown with Iraq over arms inspection
have accelerated.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after its weekly meeting presided over by
the PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat, the PNA said a diplomatic solution
to the Iraqi crisis is better than the military one.
</P>
<P>
The PNA stated any military action against Iraq at present
could cause negative repercussions to the Mideast peace process
and could affect Palestinian-Israeli further peace talks in
particular.
</P>
<P>
The PNA also urged United States and Israel to speed up the
implementation of the Wye peace accord signed last month in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Arafat planned a meeting in Nablus with visiting U.S. peace
envoy Dennis Ross on Saturday over the implementation of the Wye
accord and other issues on how to enter into final-status talks
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ross returned to the region Friday and held a close-door
meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shortly
after his arrival. Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon will hold talks
with Ross on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ross's current mission is to verify the implementation of the
Wye accord. The U.S. envoy will stay in the region for few days,
but other members of his team will remain.
</P>
<P>
Israeli cabinet ratified the Wye accord Wednesday, but its
implementation by Israeli side only comes after the Knesset's
(parliament) approval, which is scheduled for next Monday or
Tuesday.

MANILA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' bid to boost
the country's telecommunications and this sector's liberalization
have driven the country's phone density rate up by 700 percent in
five years, the Philippines News Agency said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Senior official of the Department of Transportation and
Communications (DOTC) of the Philippines were quoted by the agency
as saying the rate skyrocketed to 9.6 telephone per 100 people
this year from 1.2 in 1993.
</P>

In this five years, the number of telephone lines nationwide
increased from 700,000 to seven million, or a 900 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
"The Philippines has undergone an aggressive program of
building its telecommunications infrastructure," DOTC
Undersecretary Josefina Lichauco recently told an International
Telecommunications Union (ITU) conference in Minneapolis, the

</P>
<P>
Lichauco attributed the boom to investment of local and foreign
investors attracted by privatization, liberalization and
competition in this sunrise sector.

While the effects of the Asian economic crisis may have slowed
the pace of construction, the DOTC is optimistic that the
telecommunications sector would pursue the growth and sustained

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
will continue to inject resources for the construction of more
hospitals as well as other hospital improvement and development
projects.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, made the pledge at the opening ceremony of
the North District Hospital in "New Territories" here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The North District Hospital, a casualty clearing hospital at
the cost of 1.7 billion HK dollars (217.95 million U.S. dollars),
has been operating in phases since February this year to meet the
growing demands for hospital services in northern "New
Territories".
</P>
<P>
To cope with the growth in population, Tung said: "We will put
into use 853 additional beds next year, thereby bringing the total
number of beds in public hospitals to 28,400."
</P>
<P>
Now, Kowloon Medical and Rehabilitation Center and two
hospitals are under construction in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said the government has provided funds for a
number of hospital improvement and development projects to cope
with the increasing demand of the north-west "New Territories",
and for the setting up of a radiotherapy center at Princess
Margaret Hospital to upgrade the services for cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that the estimated expenditure of the Hospital
Authority for the current fiscal year amounts to 2.6 billion HK
dollars (333.33 million U.S. dollars), accounting for 13 percent
of the overall recurrent public expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Tung noted that an Enhanced Productivity Program will be
launched in the public sector this year.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the productivity gains amounting to five
percent of the operating expenditure between now and the year 2002
will be achieved, he said.
</P>
<P>
"All savings made by the government departments and subsidized
agencies under the Enhanced Productivity Program will be used for
the development of new services and improvement of our existing
services to meet the needs of the community", he added.

<HEADLINE> French President Pleads for Diplomatic Solution to Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
has pleaded for a diplomatic solution to the Iraq crisis and urged
Iraq to "engage in a diplomatic process", said a report reaching
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chirac made the appeal at a press conference held Friday in
Mexico, where he was making a visit.
</P>
<P>
"I support a diplomatic solution, of course. But it will pass,
before and above all, through Iraq which should say whether it is
ready or not to return the counter to zero and engage in a
diplomatic process," he said.
</P>
<P>
France holds that any military action against Iraq should be
decided with an endorsement by the United Nations Security
Council, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"If a military action goes off without this endorsement, it is
outside the rules and I would regret it," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Asked if France would join the U.S. military action against
Iraq, Chirac said that since France is still in the stage of "wait
and see" and is studying the situation, this question is
"premature."
</P>

<HEADLINE> 6 Nigerian Food Co.s to Fortify Products With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Six food manufacturing
companies have agreed to fortify their products with Vitamin A
beginning from next March under the initiative of the U.N.
Children's Fund (UNICEF), Daily Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the manufacturers agreed to produce their
fortified food items including corn flour, sugar and vegetable
oil, but called for the involvement of other local food companies
for optimal results.
</P>
<P>
Food Manufacturers involved urged UNICEF and the Nigerian
government to establish the minimum fortification levels by the
National Foods and Drugs Control and Administration for the
benefit of all food industries.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF project officer in charge of micro-nutrients John
Egbuta was quoted as saying at a two-day meeting that his
organization would conduct an impact evaluation review to
determine the current prevalence of Vitamin A Deficiency (VAD) in
the country.
</P>
<P>
VAD causes blindness among children, decreases immunity,
increases the gravity of respiration and affects foetus in
pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 9.2 million children and 7.2
million mothers suffer from a deficiency in Vitamin A in the West
African country.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria still records 114 deaths per 1,000 live births and 191
deaths from 1,000 children under five years annually due to the
high level of VAD deficiency, the paper said, adding that the
figures are considered as one of the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government launched in October the Vitamin A food
fortification logo which is aimed at improving the welfare and
health of Nigerians through the consumption of food with
sufficient Vietamin A content.

<HEADLINE> China Cruises into Quarterfinal Stage at Volleyball Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SENDAI, Japan, November 14 (Xinhua) -- China grabbed their
berth in the last 16 at the men's world volleyball championships
by outclassing the Czech Republic in straight sets in group C
here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Both sides were deadlocked in the scoring until 5-all when the
Asians slowly got into the tempo by taking full advantage of
their quick attacks to make up for their disadvantage in height.
</P>
<P>
The Czech clawed back to 9-8 after the Chinese surged to lead
9-6. The scoring momentum was snapped before China wrapped up the
first set victory 15-9.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese finished the second set with the same score as
their successful blocking earned them seven points.
</P>
<P>
With equally crisp blocking, the Asian champions ate away the
patience of the bigger-sized opponents in the last set, which
they won 15-10.
</P>
<P>
The Czechs had tried to stay in the game with their high
attacking game, but their blunders in team combination cost them
dear.
</P>
<P>
This victory, combined with their win over Ukraine on Friday,
ensured China a slot in the quarterfinal stage.
</P>
<P>
The top two teams in each preliminary group plus the four best
third-placers enter the quarterfinal stage, which will be
competed with 16 teams playing in two round-robin groups.
</P>

They will face powerhouse the Netherlands in their last group
C match on Sunday.

<P>
PARIS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Saturday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The conference on climate of Buenos Aires was due to end
Friday night with a totally disappointing result. The only ``good
news'' from the conference is that the 160 countries meeting at the
conference are near the decision to meet again in a future
conference on climate to implement the resolutions adopted in Kyoto,
Japan, held in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
-- Although Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has expressed his
intention to ``respond positively to all initiatives which take into
account his legitimate requests,'' the hope for avoiding a military
strike by the United States against Iraq remains slim. The United
States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that Saddam
Hussein must officially cancel his order to suspend cooperation with
U.N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The French Defense Minister Alain Richard has decided to
recruit all French youths who are born before January 1979 for a
service in the military. The policy will be carried out until the
complete professionalization of the French army by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
-- On the eve of the opening of the European Week of Prevention
of Drugs, European nations are sharply divided over anti-drug
policies. Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark are more or
less tolerant of the so-called ``soft drugs'' that are used at home,
while France remains one of the most repressive on drug abuse with a
1970 law banning all such practice.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Opposes Use of Force on Iraq Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan said Saturday that
it is opposed to the use of force in dealing with the crisis
relating to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the escalation of tension is likely to
endanger innocent civilian population of Iraq besides representing
a serious threat to regional peace and stability," a press release
issued by the Foreign Office said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has been closely monitoring the recent developments
relating to Iraq, it said.
</P>
<P>
While supporting all U.N. Security Council resolutions on Iraq
and calling for their full implementation, Pakistan is opposed to
the use of force in dealing with the situation, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The release said Pakistan feels that the crisis should be
resolved peacefully through diplomatic efforts and in this context
welcomes the latest initiative taken by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan as a follow-up of the U.N. Security Council meeting on
November 13.
</P>
<P>
Annan after the meeting reiterated the Security Council's offer
to hold a comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions once it resumes cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors charged with monitoring Iraq's elimination of weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"Once that is done, I trust the council will be in a position
to
lift the sanctions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq stopped cooperating with the U.N. weapons inspectors at
the end of last month and asked for the lifting of U.N. sanctions
imposed after the Gulf war in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan said in the release that the people of Iraq have
suffered for long under the U.N. sanctions which have been in
force for more than eight years now and their sufferings need to
be alleviated as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
"We urge all parties to exercise restraint and avoid taking
actions which may aggravate the situation," the release said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Embassies in Iraq Begin to Evacuate Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Some foreign embassies in
Iraq on Saturday began to withdraw their non-essential staff
from Baghdad as fears are spreading that U.S. military strikes
are imminent, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources who spoke on condition of anonymity told Xinhua
that the French interests section in Iraq has evacuated 10
non-essential staff from Iraq. Yet this is not confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian embassy also withdrew nine staff and family
members of some staff, said the sources, adding that a
third-secretary of the embassy died in a car accident on the way
to Amman, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Air flights from and to Iraq are banned under U.N. resolutions
since the 1991 Gulf War, and there is only one land route to leave
Iraq, that is by way of Amman, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The 1000-kilometer-long Amman-Baghdad road is called "the death
 road" by foreign diplomats in Baghdad for frequent car accidents
on this road and many people have been killed and injured in those
accidents.
</P>
<P>
According to other diplomatic sources, some foreign embassies
are also planning to pull out their non-essential embassy staff
from Iraq as a precautionary measure.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States and Britain are stepping up
their military presense in the Gulf region and threatening to
launch military strikes to force Iraq to resume cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan sent a letter on Friday to
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein urging him to resume cooperation
with the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq. So
far Iraq has not responded to the letter.

<HEADLINE> UK Says Time is Over for Talks with Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I think it is a bit rich of Saddam Hussein saying he will
respond to any initiative when all week he has been refusing
the many initiatives that have been made," Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the time for negotiation was over, he replied;
</P>
<P>
"There has never been any room for negotiations. The
negotiations took place last February...Now what we want is for
Saddam to actually carry out that agreement. If Saddam now acts
and says 'I made a mistake, I want to comply. I agree to let the
U.N. inspectors come back and get on to work,' then yes."
</P>
<P>
Britain has consistently backed the United States in
threatening force against Iraq and has 12 Tornado bombers on
standby in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Cook said Saddam could avoid action only if he comply with
the agreement signed last February with United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
"I am not saying attack is inevitable...This attack is only
inevitable if Saddam refuses to carry out the undertakings he
has given," he said.
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Prime Minister Tony Blair warned that Saddam would
have to bear all the responsibilities if he refused to cooperate with
the United Nations on the matter of weapon inspection.

<HEADLINE> Georgian Finance Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze has accepted the resignation of Finance Minister
Mikhail Chkuaseli, Interfax news agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chkuaseli resigned amid worsening financial situation in the
former Soviet republic, the report quoted the presidential press
service as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chkuaseli, 28, believed to be the youngest in the cabinet,
had served as finance minister for about a year.
</P>
<P>
He had been criticized by both the opposition and the ruling
Union of Georgian Citizens party of which Chkuaseli is a member,
Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting of the government Commission for Financial
Stabilization, Prime Minister Vazha Lordkipanidze blamed the
failure of this year's budget on Chkuaseli.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 months of the year, only 76 percent of the
budget revenue was collected, resulting in a shortfall of more
than 160 million laris (about 120 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
David Onoprishvili, chairman of parliament's Committee on
Economic Policy and Reforms, may be appointed to the post,
Interfax said, quoting a source in the State Chancellery.

<HEADLINE> Oil, Gold, Silver Prices Fall After Saddam's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Oil, gold and silver
prices fell back Friday as market participants interpreted
comments from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein as a move to avert a
U.S. military strike that could disrupt oil export, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi president Friday told the Russian ambassador to Iraq
that he was willing to "react positively to any initiative which
meets Iraq's legitimate demand," showing the first sign of
flexibility in the current standoff with the United States.
</P>
<P>
At the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for December
delivery closed 27 cents lower at 13.57 U.S. dollar a barrel, with
December gasoline down 0.58 cent a gallon at 41.05 cents and
December heating oil down 0.84 cent a gallon at 37.86 cents.
</P>
<P>
The perception that tensions might ease was also reflected in
lower precious metals prices. Gold for December delivery closed
one dollar lower at 296.5 dollar an ounce, while December silver
fell 10.8 cents at 5.025 dollar an ounce.
</P>
<P>
Crude prices have seesawed this week as market participants
attempt to gauge whether an attack would affect ample world oil
supplies. Iraq exports 1.7 million barrels daily, or about 2.5
percent of daily world supply, under a U.N.-approved oil-for-aid
program.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting a sharp U.S. military buildup in the Gulf this week
and a rising war of words between U.S. and Iraqi officials, gold
and silver prices also jumped as investors sought a haven from
paper markets.

Friday that it will spend a total of 290 million to 340 million
U.S. dollars to deal with the Year 2000 computer bug, according to
reports from the company.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 million dollars will be the future costs related to
internal resources, said the company, adding that the rest of the
budget will be external costs.
</P>
<P>
All the above-mentioned estimates, however, do not include
potential lawsuits should there be any service interruptions or
loss of business due to the Year 2000 issues, the company said.
</P>
<P>
Most computers read years by the last two digits. The Year
2000, therefore, would be recognized as 1900 and could cause
computer system failure.
</P>
<P>
Motorola said it has and will continue to devote substantial
resources to address its Year 2000 issues.

<HEADLINE> Business Activity Said to Have Picked Up in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Saturday that business activity has picked
up in his country.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that this follows the positive
contribution from various economic measures undertaken by the
government, including the imposition of selective exchange
controls since September 2 this year.
</P>
<P>
The controls have contributed positively to the country's march
toward economic recovery, he said in an interview with the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama TV.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, could be seen from the rise in the Kuala Lumpur
Stock Exchange Composite Index (KLSE CI) to more than 400 points
now from just 262 points at one time as well as the improved
position of the country's foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
The KLSE CI closed at 465.08 points on November 13 while the
country's foreign reserves rose to 22.99 billion U.S. dollars as
at October 22, 1998, from 20.2 billion dollars in August this
year.
</P>
<P>
The trade balance is also in Malaysia's favor and sales of
motor vehicles and houses have risen. In the first nine months of
this year, Malaysia recorded a trade surplus of 38.75 billion
ringgit (about 10.2 billion dollars) compared with a deficit of
1.5 billion ringgit (about 394 million dollars) in the
January-September 1997 period, Mahathir noted.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the Malaysian economy would recover next year
although it would take some time to achieve the previous growth
levels of 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian economy is expected to record a negative growth
of 4.8 percent this year while next year's growth is anticipated
at 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Growth does not only depend on what we do in the country. If
our trading partners face problems, they would not be in a
position to buy from us and this would affect economic growth," he
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Diplomats' Families to Leave Kuwait Facing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Family members of
U.S. diplomats in Kuwait have decided to leave over the next few
days as a possible U.S. military strike against Iraq seems
imminent.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's English daily the Arab Times Saturday quoted a
U.S. embassy official as saying "A number of embassy families have
made plans to depart Kuwait over the next several days. Others
have decided to stay."
</P>
<P>
According to unofficial figures, the U.S. embassy employs some
500 people and about half of them are U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
The official added that the U.S. embassy would remain open and
functional, as it "is still confident in the security of Kuwait,"
a close neighbor of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the newspaper quoted unnamed sources as saying
that the U.S. embassy hosted a meeting for American wardens in
Kuwait on Friday. The embassy advised people "to leave when they
feel uncomfortable", and the wardens were told that the use of
biological and chemical weapons remains "a threat, but a remote
possibility, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. embassy sources reached by Xinhua through
telephone refused to comment and give any details on the above
reports.
</P>
<P>
Tension is still mounting in the Gulf region as the United
States is beefing up its forces in the Gulf for a major military
strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
There is no indication that Iraq will rescind rescind its
October 31 decision of suspending all cooperation with the
U.N. weapons inspectors, which triggered the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Washington is sending 18 B-52 and B-1 bombers along with 12
radar-evading F-117a "stealth" jets. This buildup, the second
this year, will bring U.S. forces poised near Iraq to more than
300 aircraft and 20 ships, including two aircraft carriers.
</P>
<P>
Another 3,000 U.S. troops are expected to arrive in Kuwait to
joined the 1,500 regularly deployed near the Iraqi border.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Budgetary Surplus Up in First Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The budgetary surplus of
Canada's federal government increased by some 2 billion Canadian
dollars (about 1.3 billion U.S. dollars) in the first six months
of the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
A Finance Department's document released Friday shows that
over the six months (April to September), the surplus was
estimated at 10.4 billion Canadian dollars (about 6.7 billion U.S.
dollars), compared with last year's 8.4 billion Canadian dollars
(about 5.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government revenues went up by 3.6 percent or 2.7 billion
Canadian dollars (about 1.74 billion U.S. dollars) over the same
period of last year, according to the monthly Fiscal Monitor of
the department.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government spending was up by 1.5 percent or 0.7
billion Canadian dollars (about 452 million dollars), while public
debt charges were virtually unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the latest surplus figure would put more
pressure on Finance Minister Paul Martin to cut taxes and increase
social spending.
</P>
<P>
Martin suggested last month that global financial turmoil may
reduce the government surplus significantly and there is not much
room to move.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls for Iraq's Compliance as War Looms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Friday urged Iraq to resume cooperation with the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) supervising the destruction of
Iraq's chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"I would use this opportunity once again to urge President
Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi leadership to take the wise decision
of resuming cooperation with UNSCOM and the Atomic Agency," Annan
told reporters after a five-hour consultation with the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that this appeal, which has been made by many people,
many in the region, and myself, will be listened to by the Iraqi
authorities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan has earlier reiterated his position that the only way
toward the lifting of sanctions against Iraq, imposed following
Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, is for the country to fully
cooperate with the Security Council and the U.N. arms inspection
teams.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday, Peter Burleigh, president of the Security
Council for the month of November, said, "the ball is in Iraq's
court," and "it's their responsibility to come back to compliance"
with the relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 100 U.N. arms inspectors, all International
Atomic Energy Agency monitors and non-essential staff have begun
withdrawing from Baghdad, after Iraq announced an end to all
cooperation with UNSCOM on October 31, which provoked the current
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The build-up of U.S. planes, warships and ground troops in the
Gulf region and the pullout of personnel are seen as a sign of a
possible military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sharply against the backdrop of increasing U.S. military buildup
and mounting war threats, China, France and Russia are reinforcing
their efforts at the United Nations for a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
The representatives of the three countries, all permanent
members of the Security Council, hoped that Annan, who headed off
a major crisis in February this year by a visit to Iraq, continues
to play his role in promoting a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein raised the
possibility of a diplomatic solution as he told visiting Russian
envoy Nikolai Kartuzov that "Iraq is willing to react positively
to any initiative which meets Iraq's legitimate demand."

Minister Jean Chretien said here Saturday that he is optimistic
about Asian economic recovery and confident about the bright
future of Asia despite the current uncertainty in the Asia Pacific

He said the fundamental economic underpinnings in Asia remain

take some time and serious common effort to resolve," the prime

motivated, highly educated and -- above all -- very
entrepreneurial."

its bumps."

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Flower Trade Flourishing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's earnings
from flower exports reached 11.5 million U.S. Dollars in 1997, a
sharp increase of 25 percent over the previous year, a foreign
trade official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The rise can be explained by greater investment by Dutch and
local businessmen, Director of Research and Planning of the
Board of External Trade (BET), K.S. Mwasha, said in Dar es
Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Flowers such as rose and atriples are planted in the northern
regions of Moshi and Arusha because of favorable weather, Mwasha
told Xinhua in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
Iringa and Mbeya in the southwest are also ideal places but
transportation problems need to be solved for the regions, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the flowers have been exported to the Netherlands, he
said, adding that flower exports have become a major foreign
exchange earner, ranking eighth or ninth in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the horticulture industry in Tanzania has a vast
potential to tap, but the problem is that local businessmen need
to form partnership with foreigners.
</P>
<P>
At present, the country has 11 companies doing the flower
business, Mwasha said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Court to Continue With Kaunda's Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A Zambian court has ruled that
the case in which the country's former President Kenneth Kaunda
has been sued over his citizenship should continue,
government-controlled Times of Zambia said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ruling made Friday by the Ndola High Court of the
Copperbelt Province followed a Supreme Court judgement passed
four days ago in Lusaka that any person who was born in Zambia
before October 23, 1964 when the land won its independence became
a Zambian automatically.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda's lawyers observed during the continued hearing of
Kaunda's case at the court that the Supreme Court ruling should
have settled the matter.
</P>
<P>
Former minister of legal affairs Remmy Mushota and former
parliament member Patrick Katyoka who sued Kaunda over his
citizenship, however, insisted that the case should go ahead
because Kaunda's real place of birth and his parents' nationality
should be established.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court last Tuesday threw out a presidential
petition in which five opposition parties were challenging the
parentage of President Frederick Chiluba and the results of the
1996 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The citizenship saga started three years ago when the ruling
Movement for Muti-party Democracy (MMD) intended to amend
Zambia's constitution in an effort to bar Kaunda, the proposed
opposition hopeful, from running for the 1996 presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
It was said that Kaunda is a Malawian instead of a Zambian.
Therefore the veteran politician who led the country to
independence from British colonial rule was not qualified to be a
presidential candidate and he might have ruled Zambia "illegally"
for 27 years, according to the Constitution Amendments.
</P>
<P>
The amendments adopted in May 1996 provide that foreign
nationals and those with foreign parentage are prohibited from
contesting the presidency.

<P>
Manila, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The export and investment
sectors remain the "twin engines of growth" to power the economic
rebound of the Philippines, the government said in a news release
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Jose Pardo, secretary of trade and industry, was quoted as
saying the likely economic recovery is brought about by the
structural reforms introduced in succession since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Briefing a recent gathering of international business leaders,
he said exports hit 21.8 billion U.S. dollars in the first nine
months of this year, or a 19-percent increase over a year earlier,
indicating that the country would meet its 1998 export target of
29 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Compared with its Southeast Asian neighbors, the country's
export growth was the highest at 29 percent in 1997, almost five
times the 6.2-percent growth average in the region.
</P>
<P>
Investments totaled 6.2 billion dollars in the first eight
months of the year, Pardo said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Philippine government is committed to market reform
and liberalization policies which would "provide for a foundation
for both local and foreign investments to prosper."

<P>
The number of military personnel deployed on Cendana Street was
greatly increased over unconfirmed reports that thousands of
people were planning to abduct the elderly former leader for his
multifarious wrongdoings in the past.
</P>
<P>
"We want a serious investigation into the wealth of Suharto,
his family and cronies," said Shamullah, chairman of the Social
and Political Sciences Institute's Student Representatives Council.
</P>
<P>
Security officers on Cendana Street said reinforcements have
been sent in to ensure that no angry mobs will end up invading
Suharto's house.
</P>
<P>
Pamphlets entitled "the National Petition" have been widely
distributed in Jakarta in recent days, inviting the public to
unite to force Suharto to make an accountability speech before a
"people's Assembly" on his 32-year reign.
</P>
<P>
When Suharto resigned on May 21 amid rising student protests,
the armed forces vowed to protect the security of the veteran
leader.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted analysts as saying that although Suharto is
now out of politics, he still wields considerable clout from
behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
Following days of heated debates, the five factions of the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) agreed Friday to name Suharto
in Article 4 of a MPR decree on good governance.
</P>
<P>
Article 4 stipulates that efforts to eradicate corruption,
collusion and nepotism must be made indiscriminately upon any
state officials, former state officials, their families and
cronies as well as business tycoons and former president Suharto.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania in Need of 135,000 Tons of Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania needs at least
135,000 tons of grain to meet the severe food shortage in some
regions in the next few months, Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye
has said.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye, quoted by local press Saturday, told parliament in
central town of Dodoma that with only 45,000 tons of grain, the
Strategic Grain Reserve is not enough to counter the deficit.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 13th National Assembly session which wound up
Friday, Sumaye blamed the impending crisis on bad weather and
pests.
</P>
<P>
He said that a study conducted by the government and donors
has confirmed a looming famine in Tanga, Dodoma, Singida, Coast,
Mara, Kigoma, Morogoro, Tabora and Dar es Salaam regions.
</P>
<P>
"Many other regions are also likely to face severe food
shortage unless they receive food aid," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister called on his people to practise frugality
in food consumption while the government searches for a solution.

BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Wu Jieping, vice-chairman of
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC),
called on overseas Chinese students to serve the cause of
invigorating the country through science and education.
</P>
<P>
Wu, also director of the Returned Western Students'
Association, made the remarks at the association's third council

</P>
<P>
As the biggest overseas returned students' organization, the

<P>
As a nongovernmental organization, the association enjoys great
influence among overseas students, and it should strengthen
research on introducing overseas talents to serve the country, he

</P>
<P>
The association was set up in 1913 to develop patriotism,
unite western Chinese students to strive for the
revitalization of the country.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kenya Boosts Power Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
energetically implementing a seven-million-U.S.-Dollar energy
development program, mainly focusing on hydro and geothermal
power development.
</P>
<P>
In line with the program, Kenya will start five power projects
before the year 2001, with a combined installed capacity of 338
megawatts and a total investment of 570 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has approved the Kenyan government's request
for 125 million Dollars line credits for the power development
project scheduled to start soon, according to a governmental
source.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of power supply has affected the Kenya's economic
development for years. Its current installed capacity totals 814
megawatts and electricity from hydro and geothermal sources only
accounts for about 29 percent of the total energy demand.
</P>
<P>
Thus, this east African country has had to import
hydro-electric energy from Uganda annually in order to fill the
gap of power supply.
</P>
<P>
To support its industrialization program, the government is
restructuring the power sector, adopting the liberalization
policy and the privatization reform, and encouraging the
independent power producers to develop power plants.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the government decided to split the
functions of the Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC) and the
Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen).
</P>
<P>
KPLC is vested with power transmission and distribution, while
KenGen has publicly owned power plants and is charged with
responsibility of generating electricity.
</P>
<P>
The decision has paved the way for the reform of the energy
sector, especially streamlining of power generation and
distribution in terms of the restructuring and the privatization
of the sector.
</P>
<P>
The privatization of the sector is attracting interest from
both overseas financial agencies and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has signed agreements with the World
Bank, the European Investment Bank and the German government for
the funding of a new 75mw thermal plant at Kipevu, Coast
Province, and a 64mw geothermal plant at Ol Karia, Rift Valley
Province.
</P>
<P>
The Kipevu plant, with an investment of 85 million Dollars,
will be funded, built and operated by an independent power
producer and KPLC will undertake a 20-year power purchase.
</P>
<P>
On November 11, 1998, KPLC also signed a contract with
Israel's Ormat Turbines Ltd. on building the geothermal plant at
Ol Karia. Under the contract, Ormat designs and builds the plant
worth up to 172.5 million Dollars and will have a 20-year
operating license for the plant.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the hydro-electric plant at Sondu-Miriu, western
Kenya will be constructed with assistance from the government of
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The government had so far spent 650 million Dollars on rural
electrification program which has boosted economic growth in the
country, according to Kenyan Minister of Energy Chrisanthus
Okemo.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, KPLC has embarked on an expansion program to
supply electricity to all parts of the country. Over the past
year, the company has invested some five million Dollars to
promote supplies to urban centers in western and central regions.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that by 2010, Kenya would have attained
self-sufficiency in power generation in line with the country's
objective of becoming a newly industrialized nation by 2020.

DAR ES SALAAM, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's earnings
from flower exports reached 11.5 million U.S. Dollars in 1997, a
sharp increase of 75 percent over the previous year, a foreign
trade official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The rise can be explained by increased investment by the

</P>
<P>
Roses and other flowers are planted in Moshi, Arusha and other

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Climb in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. retail sales rose by
1 percent to a seasonally adjusted 227 billion U.S. dollars in
October, the Commerce Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest increase in five months.
</P>
<P>
Auto sales surged 2.6 percent, the largest in 15 months.
Excluding autos, sales rose by 0.5 percent, according to the
department.
</P>
<P>
It is a sign that Christmas sales, which account for half of
some stores' annual receipts, might not be as weak as some
analysts feared.
</P>
<P>
As the world-wide financial chaos cut in the U.S. exports, the
labor market isn't quite as strong as it was this spring and
unemployment rate has crept up from 4.3 percent to 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
But, by historical standards, jobs remain plentiful. Also,
incomes are rising roughly double the very-low inflation rate and
interest rates are low.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Labor Department said prices charged by
factories, farms and other producers increased by 0.2 percent in
October, reflecting the first increase in energy costs in five
months. Core prices, excluding the volatile food and energy
components, rose by a mild 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the first 10 months of this year, producer prices declined
at a 0.5 percent annual rate, compared with a 1.2 percent drop for
1997.

<P>
NEW DELHI, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
expressed concern over the nuclear tests conducted by India and
Pakistan in May this year, saying they contributed to the
deterioration of stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
During a day-long meeting Friday with an Indian delegation led
by Minister of State for External Affairs Vasundhare Raje, a
visiting EU delegation led by Austrian Minister of State for

"No firm commitment was given (by India). But EU got the
impression that this matter is being taken forward by the Indian
government for a possible solution in the near future,"
Ferrero-Waldner told a press conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which represented the EU presidency, included
German Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Gunther Verheugen,
British Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs
Derek Fatchett and Vice President of the European Commission

<HEADLINE> Military Action No Solution to U.S.-Iraq Standoff: Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Russia
agreed Saturday that the U.S.-Iraq standoff over weapons
inspections cannot be resolved through military action, Malaysian
Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries also asked U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to play an active role to end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We also feel that Iraq should understand the U.N. resolutions
and Baghdad should at least cooperate with the U.N. arms
inspectors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting his Russian counterpart,
Igor Ivanov, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation Leaders' meeting, here, Abdullah said the U.N.
Security Council must do something positive to help Iraq by
lifting the oil embargo and other sanctions imposed on the
country.
</P>
<P>
"It is indeed difficult to withdraw the sanctions as a lot more
need to be done but it will be easier to lift the oil embargo," he
said.
</P>
<P>
War in the Gulf loomed larger when the United States and Iraq
ruled out any compromise in the crisis over U.N. arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
The United States had rejected negotiations with Baghdad after
the latter ceased cooperation with the U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
It gave a clear signal Friday that it was time for Iraq to stop
playing with fire in the crisis as Washington reinforced its
already powerful forces in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah and Ivanov also discussed the West Asian peace process
and expressed the hope that the new peace initiatives could be
implemented without any hindrances.
</P>
<P>
They also touched on the developments in Cambodia and expressed
satisfaction with the role played by Cambodian King Norodom
Sihanouk to resolve the dispute between Prime Minister Hun Sen and
Prince Norodom Ranariddh.

<HEADLINE> Armed Bandits in Tanzania Ordered to Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has ordered
armed bandits in the western region of Kigoma to surrender all
weapons before November 30, otherwise they will be sternly
punished.
</P>
<P>
The order was given by Kigoma Regional Commissioner Ukiwaona
Ditopile Mzuzuri, who made a one-week tour of the areas along the
shore of Lake Tanganyika, press reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mzuzuri said armed banditry has increased since refugees start
pouring into the region from neighboring Burundi and the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Some refugees entered the region with weapons, particularly
guns, which they didn't hand over to the local authorities but
fell into the hands of bandits or gangsters who use them for
conducting criminal activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the bandits to come forward and turn over the weapons
at police stations, government or any political party offices,
village authorities before the deadline, assuring that those who
heed the call will not be apprehended.
</P>
<P>
But after the deadline, the government will make all efforts
to uncover the weapons and deal with bandits seized "with a heavy
hand," said the regional commissioner, who made the tour
accompanied by defense, security and police officers.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, residents at the Kigoma District of the
region have cast secret ballots to expose armed bandits at public
meetings with Mzuzuri.
</P>
<P>
The Kigoma Region currently plays host to more than 200,000
refugees, primarily from Burundi and DRC and the number is still
increasing by hundreds with each passing day due to wars in both
countries.

<HEADLINE> UN Food Agencies: DPRK Still Needs Food Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) will need to import 1.35 million tonnes of food
grain in 1999 to meet its population's minimum nutritional
requirements, according to a report issued by the United Nations
food agencies.
</P>
<P>
The report, issued jointly by the Rome-based Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Program (WFP),
said that the DPRK still needs substantial food aid despite an
improved harvest this year.
</P>
<P>
Based on the findings of a UN mission that toured the country
last month, it forecasts DPRK's cereal production for 1998/99 will
only enough to cover minimum consumption needs for eight months.
</P>
<P>
At 3.5 million tonnes this years harvest will be a considerable
improvement on last year's severely reduced crop. But FAO and WFP
say the DPRK will still enter 1999 with a severe food shortage.
</P>
<P>
"Despite favourable weather this year, food production has not
recovered enought to avert serious food shortages," said WFP's
Senior Program Coordinator for the DPRK, Mr Saeed Malik.
</P>
<P>
"The food crisis has been compounded by a complete run-down of
the country's economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
The natural disasters that struck the DPRK between 1995 and
1997, including two years of flooding, a drought and a typhoon,
have badly damaged the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The FAO/WFP report also cites the need for economic reform and
increased aid to agriculture in the DPRK.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesian Highest Legislative Body Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Following four days of heated
debates, the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), Indonesia's
highest legislative body, Friday finally adopted 12 draft decrees
aiming to accelerate the country's political reform process.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet the people's demand, President B.J. Habibie's
government must carry out the 12 decrees seriously as the decrees
are the people's mandate, MPR Speaker Harmoko said in closing
remarks.
</P>
<P>
"The Assembly should be able to accommodate the people's
aspirations and demand for improvement in all aspects of life.
Reform is a demand which is alive and growing among the people who
want to see changes for a better future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before MPR members after receiving a document on MPR
decrees from Harmoko, Habibie said the outcome of the MPR special
session reflected the aspirations of those in favor of and against
the session.
</P>
<P>
Habibie promised to implement all the decisions fairly and
honestly. He also asked the people of all walks of life to help
him in carrying out the national agenda.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting adopted 12 MPR decrees that had been
prepared by the Working Committee including the decrees on the
holding of the May 1999 general election, anti-corruption,
limiting the presidential and vice presidential terms of office
and lifting the March 1998 decree on the granting of an
extraordinary power to the president.
</P>
<P>
Eleven of the 12 decrees were agreed upon by consensus, while
decree on general election was decided by an open voting.
</P>
<P>
The five factions agreed to advance the time frame of the next
general election from the year 2002 to May or June 1999, but the
Muslim-dominated United Development Party faction placed a
stumbling block in the path of consensus by insisting that the
military has no place at the House of Representatives (DPR). The
military occupies 75 seats in the 500-seat DPR.
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented vote, the MPR agreed to a gradual phase-out
of the military's socio-political role. The United Development
Party faction was alone in the voting, with its 122 members voting
for an immediate drop of the military from the DPR, while 784
members of the other four factions voted for a gradual phase-out.
</P>
<P>
Following days of heated debates, the five factions of the MPR
finally agreed to add a provision to a decree on clean governance,
naming former president Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Article 4 of the decree states that efforts to eradicate
corruption, collusion and nepotism must be made indiscriminately
upon any state officials, former state officials, their families
and cronies as well as private businessmen, business tycoons and
Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
As the mentioning of names in an MPR decree was unprecedented,
analysts said, it seems that the country's highest legislative
body has tried to compromise on one of the key issues by
"accommodating" mounting demands for a special decree on an
investigation into the alleged ill-gotten wealth of Soeharto, his
family as well cronies.
</P>
<P>
In efforts to prevent an authoritarian and centralistic rule,
the special session passed a degree on limiting the presidential
and vice presidential terms of office to only two five-year terms.
Soeharto had maintained his post for seven consecutive five-year
periods.
</P>
<P>
The special MPR session was closed amidst bloody clashes
between student demonstrators and security forces outside the MPR
building. In the past several days, tens of thousands of
university students took to the streets in Jakarta and other
cities, protesting against the holding of the special MPR session
and demanding the revocation of the Armed Forces socio-political
role.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, parts of the Indonesian capital turned into a
virtual battlefield pitting students, supported by the masses,
against heavily armed police and soldiers. At least twelve people
died and over 250 were injured in the bloody clashes described by
the Jakarta Post as "Black Friday."
</P>
<P>
Habibie and all five MPR factions have expressed their
condolences over the death of students in the mass demonstrations.
The president also called on all demonstrators to restrain
themselves and not to act destructively.
</P>
<P>
However, some opposition parties and students who are not
satisfied with the result of the MPR meeting warned that they will
continue their struggle for sweeping political, economic and
judicial reform in the country.
</P>
<P>
With the closing of the MPR special session, the country now
will focus on the general election next year.
</P>
<P>
In his closing speech, Harmoko expressed the hope that the
special session will open the gate to the realization of various
reform agendas in the future, particularly the general election in
May 1999 and the MPR general session by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
"If these agendas could be carried out satisfactorily and
democratically, the Assembly is confident that a new democratic
Indonesian era will emerge, with a new government, Assembly, House
of Representatives and Regional Councils as a result of the
general election, and the realization of a civic society we all
aspire," he added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Buy Power from China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Thailand expects to purchase
electricity from China, according to the Power Group of Yunnan
Province, southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Under a memorandum signed by the two countries recently in
Beijing, Thai companies will buy up to three million
kilowatt-hours of electricity from China by the year 2017.
</P>
<P>
China plans to build eight large hydropower plants with a total
installed capacity of 13 million kw along the Lancang River, which
is known as the Mekong when it runs into southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
As early as in 1995, the Yunnan Provincial Power Group and the
Thai GMS company began cooperation by setting up a joint venture
to conduct feasibility studies on the construction of the Jinghong
Hydropower Plant, one of the eight on the Lancang, and on the
transmission of power to Thailand from China.
</P>
<P>
The 4,880-kilometer Lancang-Mekong River flows through
China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and Viet Nam. It runs
2,130 kilometers in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, nations in the Lancang-Mekong River Basins
have shown great interest in developing its rich energy
resources.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- All efforts must be
focused on a diplomatic solution to the latest standoff between
Iraq and the United Nations, Russia stressed here on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
After five-hour consultations between U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan and the Security Council on the Iraq issue, Russian
Ambassador to the United Nations Sergey Lavrov told the press that
both Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov had wrote a message to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on
Thursday and had got positive response from him.
</P>
<P>
This was a constructive shift, and all efforts should be
concentrated on diplomatic solutions to get Iraq to rescind its
decision of October 31, Lavrov stressed.
</P>
<P>
The latest crisis over U.N. arms inspection in Iraq erupted on
October 31 when Iraq announced suspension of all its ties with the
Untied Nations Special Commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction. Iraq reiterated that it would not
resume cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors until the sanctions
against it get lifted.
</P>
<P>
The United States has massed heavy forces in the Gulf region
and threatened to launch a military strike against Iraq if it
still refuses to cooperate with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is scheduled to hold another meeting on
Iraq on Saturday afternoon.

Jayawardane Friday took oaths before the president at a simple
ceremony here, according to a press release issued by the
president secretariat.
</P>
<P>
His appointment was one of a series of measures to bring the
North-East provincial Council and the Resettlement and
Rehabilitation Authority of North together with a view to speeding
up development in the region, government sources said.
</P>
<P>
Jayawardane will work with the armed forces and civilian
authorities in areas affected by Tamil rebels who have been
fighting a war against the government since 1983 for a separate
state in the north and east of the country.
</P>
<P>
The appointment comes in the wake of terrorist efforts to
cripple civil administration in the Jaffna Peninsula which was
recaptured by government troops in May 1996 from the Tamil rebels'
control.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have been engaged in a "campaign of death and
destruction" aimed at blocking government efforts to restore
facilities in the war-torn region.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have killed two Jaffna mayors and scores of other
government officials.

ROME, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema
on Friday met visiting Argentine President Carlos Menem for talks
on bilateral relations and Latin American situation.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, the two agreed to continue to seek ways to
further bolster bilateral cooperation in the areas of trade and
business, which had already enjoyed a significant boost following
a recent visit to Buenos Aires by Italian former Premier Romano
Prodi.
</P>
<P>
On the international financial crisis, which began in Asia and
quickly spread to Latin America, Menem appreciated the measures
adopted by the Group of Seven nations to help Brazil and expressed
his confidence that the other Latin American nations would pull
themselves through the difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The two also shared the "common concern" over the developments
in the Gulf and discussed the Pinochet affairs.

<P>
ROME, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Trade Minister
Piero Fassino Friday called on the European Union to do more to
help Russia overcome the economic and financial crisis threatening
its political stability.
</P>
<P>
"The European Union must take a more determined lead in
international efforts to support the transition underway in
Russia," Fassino said in Turin.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference organized by the Agnelli Foundation on
the "new Russia," Fassino praised Italian car-maker Fiat for its
behavior during the darkest days of Russia's crisis.
</P>
<P>
Fiat CEO Paolo Cantarella had publicly confirmed the group's
investments in Russia and thus helped stave off a mass abandonment
of the country by foreign companies, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
"It was an important signal because afterwards the whole
business system moved in that same direction," Fassino said.
</P>
<P>
Italy is the third biggest investor in Russia, and also is
Russia's second trading partner and second biggest creditor. For
this reason Italy had a strong interest in promoting stability in
Russia, Fassino said.
</P>
<P>
"The government must come up with concrete support strategies:
financial aid, investment policies and support for training
initiatives for managers in business and public administration,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Fiat Expects 2.5 Million Cars to Be Sold in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Fabbrica Italiana Automobile
Torino (Fiat) will sell a total of around 2.5 million cars
worldwide in 1998, Fiat Auto managing director Roberto Testore
announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The estimate, compared to 2.7 million last year, was given
during the presentation of Fiat's new Multipla modal to be
marketed on November 21 with a price-tag of around 30 million lire
(under 18,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Testore was pleased with the 1998 sales figures because the
market in South America, and especially in Brazil, had plummeted.
</P>
<P>
The car market in Italy this year should be around 2.3 million
cars sold, he said.
</P>
<P>
The company invested around 350 billion lire (about 200 million
U.S. dollars) in the new car aimed at selling some 40,000 a year
to make initial profits, Testore explained.
</P>
<P>
However, Fiat's marketing experts expect the sales to hit
60,000 and the plant, at which the presentation took place, is set
up to increase output up to 100,000 to 110,000 a year, the
managing director noted.

<HEADLINE> Polymer Sensors Sniff Out Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Specially trained dogs for
detecting landmines may soon find themselves out of employment as
scientists in the United States have designed a kind of polymer
sensor to rival them in their "monopolized" field.
</P>
<P>
According to the Web edition of the Journal of the American
Chemical Society Friday, the sensor, designed by scientists from
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, can trace
vapors of TNT and its derivatives commonly used in landmines.
</P>
<P>
Mimicking dog's acute biochemical mechanisms of smell, the new
sensors are fluorescent polymers, activated by light to have high
energy electrons.
</P>
<P>
When TNT floats in between the spaces it momentarily steals an
electron, decreasing the fluorescence and sending a signal to the
detector's "brain".
</P>
<P>
Dr. Timothy M. Swager, leader of the scientists, said that the
system is very sensitive because "one TNT molecule can deactivate
many of these electrons".
</P>
<P>
The polymers look like 3-dimensional X's, attached through
their center to parallel rows of chemical backbones. This
structure keeps individual sensor polymers separated.
</P>
<P>
A device based on Swager's polymers is currently being tested.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Peaceful Solution to Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- China on Friday night
called for a peaceful solution to the current Iraqi crisis and
warned that "any practices to abandon peaceful efforts are
dangerous."
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, China's permanent representative to the United
Nations, said, "We hope the parties concerned will properly solve
the crisis through dialogue and consultation."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese envoy made the statement to the press after the
Security Council spent five hours on closed-door consultations on
the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Qin's statement came as Washington was increasing its military
buildup in the Gulf, hoping to use military threat to force
Baghdad to back off on its non-cooperation stance.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply concerned over the recent development and
military threat," he said, referring to the U.S. tough position on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We urge parties concerned to keep restraint, to solve the
crisis through peaceful means," he said, "We believe there is
still some hope for peaceful solution of the crisis."
</P>
<P>
He said, "Any practices to abandon the peaceful efforts are
dangerous, we support the Secretary-General for his efforts of
mediation, and solve the crisis through diplomatic efforts."
</P>
<P>
China, France and Russia, three permanent members of the
Security Council, met with Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Friday
afternoon before the U.N. chief's scheduled meeting with all 15
Security Council members.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting held at the request of the three
representatives, they voiced their hope that Annan will continue
to play his role in promoting a peaceful solution, diplomatic
sources said.
</P>
<P>
It is also hoped that the international community will continue
the effort to seek peaceful solution to the Iraqi crisis through
dialogue and consultation, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the three countries lashed out at UNSCOM's decision to
pull its staff out of Iraq without consultations with Security
Council members.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Iraqi Cooperation With UN Arms Inspectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Friday night called on Iraq to resume cooperation
with U.N. weapons inspectors, but warned that events on the ground
"may be running away from us."
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the U.N. chief's closed-door
consultations with all 15 Security Council members on the current
Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
"I would use this opportunity once again to urge President
Saddam Hussein to take a wise decision of resuming cooperation
with UNSCOM (the U.N. Special Commission) and the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)."
</P>
<P>
If President Saddam "did as the Council has already indicated,
we will move forward with a comprehensive review" of Iraq's ties
with the world body, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Once they (the Iraqis) have rescinded (the non-cooperation
decision) and (Council members) have done the comprehensive
review, I trust the Council will be in a position to lift the
sanctions" against Iraq, which remain in force following Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Annan's statement means that the U.N. stance on sanctions
against Iraq remained unchanged unless Baghdad publicly announced
a policy shift in the current standoff over weapons inspection in
Iraq, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he has had "very constructive and useful discussion
with Council members, all stress the desirability of a peaceful
and diplomatic solution" to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
China, France and Russia, three permanent members of the
Security Council, are stepping up their efforts in seeking a
diplomatic solution to the crisis at the United Nations as
Washington is rattling threat of military strikes against Iraq by
increasing military buildup in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Perter Burleigh, charge d'affaires of the U.S. mission to the
United Nations, made it clear once again on Friday that "the ball
is in Iraq's court" and the resumption of unfettered weapons
inspection is not negotiable.
</P>
<P>
Burleigh, who is also president of the Security Council, said
that the Council will resume consultations at 3:30 p.m. EST on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The latest clash of wills erupted on October 31 when Baghdad
announced its suspension of cooperation with UNSCOM and insisted
that the eight-year sanctions be lifted.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who cut short his North Africa tour to return to the
U.N. headquarters to consult the Security Council, has earlier
said that he was "saddened and burdened" by Iraq's August 5 and
October 31 decisions to suspend cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief, who headed off a major Iraqi crisis in February
this year in the wake of a visit to Baghdad, said that he has no
plan at the moment for such a visit.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council will meet again on the Iraq crisis on Saturday, the
council's November president Peter Burleigh said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement in a brief statement after the council
had five hours of closed-door consultations on the issue with
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who cut short his Africa tour and returned here
Thursday, was trying to get acquainted with the latest
developments surrounding the U.S.-Iraqi standoff on U.N. arms
inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Before he met with the 15 council members, the U.N. chief had
an hour-long discussion with representatives of China, France and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Burleigh said, "We reiterated our strong support and
endorsement of the Secretary-General's appeal of November 11 to
the Iraqi authorities."
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate the role the Secretary-General is playing, in
close consultation with the council, in trying to find a
diplomatic solution to the crisis."
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the consultations Friday, Annan told reporters
that he urged Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to "take a wise
decision" of resuming cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission
for Iraq's disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Once the Iraqis have rescinded their non-cooperation decision
and the council members have done the comprehensive review on
Iraq's compliance with the council's resolutions, the council will
be in a position to lift the sanctions against Iraq, which has
remained in force since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Annan
said.
</P>
<P>
Annan's statement is the same as the one he made two days ago
through his spokesman in the U.N. headquarters.
</P>
<P>
China, France and Russia are making diplomatic efforts for a
peaceful solution to the standoff.

<HEADLINE> Italy: Military Intervention Against Iraq Only Decided by UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Any military intervention against
Iraq can only be decided by the United Nations, Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after a cabinet meeting at which the new
Iraq crisis dominated the agenda, Dini said Italy is still hoping
a military intervention can be avoided.
</P>
<P>
"There is now a risk of getting to a point of no return,"
warned Dini, "and this could lead to the use of military force
which we do not want to see."
</P>
<P>
Dini also said the Italian government hopes that UN
Secretary-General Kofi Annan will visit Baghdad in search of a
diplomatic solution.
</P>
<P>
Dini confirmed that Italy has been proposing that a full
resumption of Iraqi cooperation with the U.N. should be matched by
speeding up U.N. arms inspections with a view to lifting
international sanctions against Baghdad according to a clear
timetable.
</P>
<P>
Iraq halted cooperation with UNSCOM (U.N. Special Commission),
the U.N. team monitoring implementation of the Security Council's
disarmament requirements, arguing that the team's strategy had
seemed to spin out the checks interminably.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi government officials said they withdrew cooperation with
the U.N. team because they could not tolerate the impact of the
sanctions, which was instrumental in the death of hundreds of
thousands of their countrymen.
</P>
<P>
Dini proposed a "global revision" of the requirements still in
force, requesting an acceleration of those concerning disarmament,
"to open the path for a repeal of the sanctions, hopefully
according to a clear temporal schedule."
</P>
<P>
Dini's report to the government was approved unanimously,
including the hard-left Justice Minister Oliviero Diliberto.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema said Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein's attitude was "very negative" and expressed
hope that the current crisis be solved through political channels
but not military interventions.
</P>
<P>
Italian Defense Minister Carlo Scognamiglio said a diplomatic
solution is possible if Iraq agrees to resume cooperation with the
U.N.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that Italy would take no part in military actions
against Iraq unless there is an explicit U.N. mandate.

<HEADLINE> Hamdoon: Iraq Wants Diplomatic Solution to Current Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraq wanted a
diplomatic solution to the current crisis, Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's
Ambassador to the United Nations, said here on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Hamdoon made the statement after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and the Security Council ended a five-hour consultation,
trying to find a peaceful solution to the latest standoff between
Iraq and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Hamdoon said Iraq had complied with
U.N. resolutions and it would continue to do so provided that the
Security Council deals fairly and objectively with Iraq in term of
the comprehensive review proposed by the U.N. chief and welcomed
by Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Unless this comprehensive review was guaranteed to be objective
and to be fair, it would be difficult for Iraq to accept, Hamdoon
said.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador said Iraq still hoped that there would be a
diplomatic solution to the crisis. But he said it seemed that the
Untied States was not ready for a diplomatic outcome.
</P>
<P>
Some chances should be given to diplomacy and diplomacy was not
a dictate, Hamdoon stressed.
</P>
<P>
The latest crisis over U.N. arms inspection in Iraq erupted on
October 31 when Iraq announced to suspend all its ties with the
Untied Nations Special Commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq reiterated that it would not resume cooperation with
U.N. arms inspectors until the sanctions against it get lifted.
</P>
<P>
The United States has massed heavy forces in the Gulf and
threatened to launch a military strike against Iraq if it still
refuses to cooperate with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the Security Council on
Friday night urged Iraq to rescind its decision of October 31 and
resume cooperation with the U.N.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council will held another meeting on Iraq on
Saturday afternoon.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's King Norodom
Sihanouk, accompanied by Queen Monineath Sihanouk, left here for
Beijing by special plane Saturday morning for medical treatment in
China.
</P>
<P>
The king was seen off at the airport by dozens of senior
government leaders, parliamentarians, diplomats and members of the
royal family, among whom were Second Prime Minister Hun Sen,
Cambodian People's Party (CPP) President Chea Sim, and FUNCINPEC
President Prince Norodom Ranariddh as well as Chinese Ambassador
to Cambodia Yan Tingai.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, the king announced that during his
absence, Chea Sim will be his supreme representative to handle
related affairs.
</P>
<P>
The king had been scheduled to leave for Beijing on October 5.
At the request of senior government officials, the king agreed to
change his plans.
</P>
<P>
The important role played by the monarch helped break the
political deadlock which had lasted for more than three months
since the elections was held on July 26.
</P>
<P>
The CPP and FUNCINPEC, the two rival parties, struck several
key agreements on Thursday and Friday on forming a government at
the two-day summit meeting chaired by the king.
</P>
<P>
Doctors have suggested that the king have a medical checkup
once every three months. The king had already remained in the
country for about seven months since he returned from China on
April 12.
</P>
<P>
The monarch celebrated his 76th birthday on October 31. During
his stay in the Royal Palace, the king distributed a lot of food
relief to the poor.

Friday.
</P>
<P>
At present, Iranian exports to Bulgaria reached 70 million

<P>
BELGRADE, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Serbia Republic President
Milan Milutinovic on Friday met U.S. envoy Christopher Hill on the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Hill briefed his host on a plan formulated
under his leadership. The draft plan is expected to serve as the
basis of negotiations between Serbia and Kosovo ethnic Albanian
leaders, reported the Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
Hill emphasized that the plan reflected the essence of the
peace accord on the Kosovo crisis reached by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke on October 13.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Milutinovic agreed to examine the plan with the
members of his government delegation, so as to decide to what
degree the plan complies with the Milosevic-Holbrooke accord.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his welcome to any plan benefiting a political
solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Citing his invitation to ethnic Albanian leaders to hold talks
in Pristina next week, Milutinovic said the current top priority
is to sit down at the negotiation table and conduct direct
dialogues.
</P>
<P>
Both sides condemned the atrocities by armed ethnic Albanians
including frequent attacks on civilians, police and the
military.
</P>
<P>
They urged to contain such terrorist activities, which they
believed will not only hinder political dialogues but also destroy
the overall efforts to stabilize the Kosovo situation.

<HEADLINE> Laos Agrees With Thai Plan to Clear Up Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Laos has agreed to a Thai plan
aimed at clearing up all bilateral problems, including the
sensitive issue of border demarcation, by the year 2003, the
Bangkok Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The message from Vientiane was sent to Thailand by Lao Foreign
Minister Somsavat Lengsavad during talks with his Thai counterpart
Surin Pitsuwan in the annual joint commission meeting on
Wednesday, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Ending the problems will let the two countries fully
concentrate on a free trade scheme due to be launched by the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which both are
members, in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Both also pledged to complete economic master plans for
cooperation in electricity, communications and agro-industry, and
investment.
</P>
<P>
These agreements are due to be signed when Lao Prime Minister
Sisavat Keobounphan makes a scheduled visit to Thailand early next
year.
</P>
<P>
Laos will upgrade four border checkpoints to enable ease of
access for international visitors and clear the way for closer
cooperation, Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Kitti Wasinondh was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the most sensitive issue is still the border demarcation,
which delayed their meeting for five hours to clarify the already
demarcated land border.
</P>
<P>
The two countries put markers for 261 kilometers out of 702
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
They reaffirmed that demarcating the land border would be
completed in the next two years as planned before moving on to the
border separated by the Mekong River.
</P>
<P>
Somsavat, who also is a deputy prime minister, called for
decisive measures to end drug trafficking, illegal migration,
black marketeers and border insecurity.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean Air Force (FACH)
said Friday its ties with the British Royal Air Force could be
affected if an adverse decision is dictated against General
Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
FACH Commander-in-Chief Gen. Fernando Rojas Vender said the
relationship between the two forces could be damaged if the House
of Lords does not confirm the sovereign immunity recognized by the
British Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
"(Relations) could be affected, but let us wait and see,
because the whole process has not ended in London," said Vender.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his support of the government's stance to obtain
Pinochet's release.
</P>
<P>
Vender made these statements at the start of the military
maneuvers being held in Iquique, 1,160 miles north of Santiago,
where Defense Minister Jose Florencio Guzman also took part.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was detained in London last month at the request of
Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon, who is negotiating to
extradite Pinochet to Spain for trial on charges of human rights
violations committed during his government (1973-1990).

<HEADLINE> Aid Sought in Fight against Deserts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A top forestry official said
he hoped foreign investment or non-governmental aid can be used to
fight against China's increasing desertification, according to
today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The effort is part of a global drive amined at reducing
desertification and contributing to global forest protection, Wang
Zhibao, director of the State Forestry Administration (SFA), said
this week.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important way to fight desertification is to
work toward sustainable forestry practices and pursue a long-term
plan to cut the rate of desertification in China, which made
barren some 1,600 square kilometres of land in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Desertification kept worsening in the following years due to
the nationwide ignorance of silviculture, or tree planting, and
nonexistent provisions for ecological protection. Desertified
areas in China now cover more than 2.6 million square kilometres,
accounting for 27.8 percent of China's total territory.
</P>
<P>
Currently, forestry in China is entering a new era of
development as it is shouldering an important historical mission
at the turn of the century, Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
The primary tasks for China's forestry development are
rehabilitating and expanding forest cover as soon as possible,
increasing forest area. The country also needs to concentrate on
reducing and alleviating the negative effects of natural
disasters, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks at a press conference reaffirming China's
logging ban in the Yangtze and Yellow River valleys, which began
after it was identified as the major cause of this summer's
cataclysmic floods.

<HEADLINE> Microbes Friendly to Ecological Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Microbes, which can dissolve
crop residues into fodder, also contributes to ecological
protection.
</P>
<P>
State departments for environmental protection, agriculture,
science and technology development are considering extending the
uses of this bit of bio-technology, known as "white agriculture."
</P>
<P>
"The technology could lower the amount of corn used for fodder
and cut air pollution caused by burning crop remnants," today's
China Daily quoted official researchers as saying.
</P>
<P>
The microbes could also curb grassland degradation from
livestock husbandry.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that 700 to 800 million tons of crop residues
were produced each year across the country. Most is burned or
discarded on farm. Fumes caused by burning crop remnants can
pollute the air and even cause traffic accidents due to low
visibility on particularly smoky days.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture has banned further burning and
asked farmers to fertilize their land with crop residues.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the Beijing White Agriculture Research Institute
have developed a fermenting agent to turn such residues into
nutritious fodder.
</P>
<P>
The agent is composed of several strains of microbes, and
fodder fermented with that agent contains protein and other
elements good for the health of livestock.
</P>
<P>
Cows fed with such fodder may produce an additional 500
kilograms of milk annually, and the incidence rate of bovine
digestive diseases may decrease by 30 to 50 percent. The milk
quality was also improved, according to experiments in a number of
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Guangyao, vice-minister in charge of the State
Environmental Protection Administration, called scientists to
refine and disseminate this environmentally friendly technology to
all rural areas across the country.

<HEADLINE> Health Education Vital to Diabetes Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Effective health education
among medical professionals and ordinary people has been urged to
prevent a wide epidemic of diabetes in China, which has preyed
upon some 50 million citizens.
</P>
<P>
Diabetes and related complications have ranked as one of the
major health risks in China, following cancer and
cardiovascular and cerebral diseases, according to Prof. Li
Tianlin with the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine (CAPM).
</P>
<P>
A recent national epidemiological survey found more than 20
million citizens over 20 years old are diabetes patients. An
additional 30 million people suffer from impaired glucose
tolerance (LGT), an early stage of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that lots of patients are not diagnosed and
given early treatment due to lack of knowledge and awareness of
prevention," Li said, stressing that most of diabetes cases can be
prevented or controlled if preventive measures are taken.
</P>
<P>
The expert at the CAPM's Diabetes and Other Noncommunicable
Diseases Research Center called for an immediate action, including
avoiding improper eating habits, increasing physical exercises and
checking blood sugar levels regularly.
</P>
<P>
The call echoed in China's major media in recent days as a
publicity campaign is highlighting the World Diabetes Day, which
falls on today and is jointly launched by the International
Diabetes Federation and the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
Such efforts are considered as just the beginning of a long
road to go since a survey in Shanghai, China's biggest city, found
that only 30 percent of citizens knew some knowledges about
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
"Illnesses, death tolls and some 170 billion yuan (20 billion
US dollars) of annual medical expenditure undoubtedly pose a heavy
burden on the government," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Though China has worked out a national outline for diabetes
control in the 1996-2000 period, it still lacks united measures
for disease control and prevention, said Kong Lingzhi, an official
with the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
A five-year educational project has been started by Project
Hope, a charity organization based in the United States, and local
hospitals in Beijing, Chengdu, Xi'an, Guangzhou, Shanghai and
other major cities.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to train a certain number of doctors, nurses
and nutriological specialists, who will be responsible for
training more local professionals to provide high-standard medical
service for diabetes patients.

</P>
<P>
The Constellation Leo meteor storm takes place once every 33
years on the average, according to scientists, and the upcoming one
will be the first visible in the eastern hemisphere in a century.
</P>
<P>
The event is of great importance for the study on the evolution
of the Sun and the prevention of space disasters, he said.

HAVANA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban government Friday

<HEADLINE> Villa Boss Set to Say Farewell to Bosnich </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League club
Aston Villa have fuelled speculation linking goalkeeper Mark
Bosnich with Manchester United by acknowledging he will not be
signing a new contract with them.
</P>
<P>
He has been widely tipped to replace Peter Schmeichel at Old
Trafford after United agreed to release the Danish international
at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
Bosnich's current deal with Villa expires at the same time,
allowing him to move on a free transfer.
</P>
<P>
Villa manager John Gregory said: "Bosnich has given no
indication that he is prepared to stay with Villa. We have no
say where he will go but I don't expect him to be here next year."
</P>
<P>
It is a familiar situation for Villa, who lost defender Steve
Staunton to Liverpool last summer when his contract ended and he
was entitled to leave for nothing under the terms of the Bosman
ruling.
</P>
<P>
"No club will come in and make an offer when they know full
well that they can sign him for nothing in a few months time. It
is furtrating having one of the best goalkeepers in the world and
you cannot keep him," said Gregory.
</P>
<P>
Australian Bosnich had a brief spell with United when he first
came to England but contractual problems led to him joining Villa.
</P>
<P>
"He has shown no signs of accepting our offer because he knows
he will get more next year, whether it is at Old Trafford or
Barcelona," Gregory added.
</P>
<P>
"There is little consideration about loyalty because the
stakes are so high. It is a fact of life in football, " he
added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Team to Meet Brazilians in Internamerican Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Two-time U.S. league
champions D.C. United will play Brazilian club Vasco da Gama here
Saturday in the Interamerican Cup soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
The Interamerican Cup pits the champions from North America,
Central America and the Caribbean against the South American
champions. United won the CONCACAF representing the North; Vasco
da Gama won CONMEBOL of South America.
</P>
<P>
United will host the first game tomorrow, while the second
game is set on December 5 in Florida.
</P>
<P>
"We know it will be a difficult game," says United midfielder
Marco Etcheverry, who is Bolivian. "But we think we will have our
chances. This series will make a lot of guys better players."
</P>
<P>
Vasco da Gama also could be motivated. A Brailian newspaper re
ported the team will split $1.5 million if it wins the
Interamerican Cup and Intercontinental Cup. The latter event is
on December 1 in Tokyo vs. Spanish League champion Real Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Last December Vasco da Gama won the Brazilian championship for
the third time. Top players include goalkeeper Carlos Germano,
36-year-old captain Mauro Galvao, central midfielder Luizinho,
forward Donizete, and rising superstar Felipe.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody speaks of Felipe's marvelous moves. He has even
taken the place of Roberto Carlos on the national team," coach
Antonio Lopes says.
</P>
<P>
Lopes says:"We are a starless squad. The team itself is the
star. It's true Felipe is outstanding, but our power does not
lie in our individualities."

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- NBA players would rather
play real games for real money than pickup games just to stay in
shape, but the lockout has at least brought many of them close
together.
</P>
<P>
One team in an informal league organized by former player
Kenny Smith, New Jersey's Sam Cassell and San Antonio's Avery
Johnson featured Nick Van Excel of the Denver Nuggets, Tim Duncan
of the San Anotnio Spurts, Brent Price of the Houston Rockets,
Chris Morris of the Utah Jazz and Ron Mercer of the Boston
Celtics.
</P>
<P>
Another had Clarence Weatherspoon of the Golden State
Warriors, Otis Thorpe of the Washington Wizards and Derrick
Anderson of the Cleveland Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
"We don't look to come out here and hurt each other," says
Morris, who did not play in the league last month but still plays
pickup games three or four times a week with many of the same
players in Houston.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who played on a team in the league with Spurs
teammate David Robinson, Mario Elie of the Houston Rockets,
Robert Horry of the Los Angeles Lakers and former NBA star Moses
Malone, helps keep the daily scrimmages going.
</P>
<P>
"We have lunch together and just do a lot of talking in the
locker room and you get to know more about a guy's family and
what has made him successful on and off the court," said
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
Such sessions have taken place in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Miami,
New York, Philadelphia and Detroit and a few other cities, but
Houston is the place to play with its mixture of Dream Teamers,
All Stars and NBA hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
Among other stars who have come through Houston for a week or
two of competition, Stephon Marbury of the Minnesota
Timberwolves, David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal of the Los Angeles
Lakers, Anfernee Hardaway of the Orlando Magic and Sam Cassell of
the Net Jersey Nets.

<HEADLINE> Graf-Hingis Battle Highlights Advanta Quarter-finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- It has been almost two
years since Steffi Graf and Martina Hingis waged a five-set war
in the final of Chase Championships. Just three days before this
year's season-ending event, the two will take the court tonight i
n the quarter-finals at the Advanta Championships indoor tennis
event in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
Graf earned the 16th and final spot in next week's event in
New York after American teenager Venus Williams withdrew on
Thursday with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Graf extended her winning streak to seven
matches with a three-set victory over Russia's Elena
Likhovtseva. After battling through a series of injuries this
year, Graf won her 105th singles title and second of the year
last week in her native Germany.
</P>
<P>
Her other title came at the Pilot Pen international in
Connecticut, the United States. Graf underwent wrist surgery
after losing in the fourth round of the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, the defending champion and second seed, was ranked
fifth in the world when she lost to then top-ranked Graf in the
1996 Chase Championship final. Four months later, she displaced
Graf for the No. 1 ranking and held it for 80 weeks before
American Lindsay Davenport seized the top spot on October 11th.
</P>
<P>
Graf has won five of six meetings with Hingis.
</P>
<P>
Seven of the 16 players competing in New York next week are
doing battle in today's quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, who lost to Hingis in a thrilling three-set final
here last year, will fight fellow American and qualifier Amy
Frazier, fifth-seeded American Monica Seles will face Natasha
Zvereva of Belarus; and sixth seed Nathalie Tauziat of France
will meet South Africa's Amanda Coetzer.

<HEADLINE> Errie Calmness Grips Baghdad As U.S. Strike Nears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 13 (Xinhua) -- As a threatened U.S. military
strike against Iraq looks near, Baghdad appeared gripped in an
atmosphere of errie calmness and resignation, and of course,
defiance.
</P>
<P>
"We don't fear, we have been accustomed to this," said Tariq
Mohammoud, a taxi driver in his 30s. On the way to the press
center, Tariq chatted quietly.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. military strike may cause power cuts, price hikes,
and many other inconveniences, but we can manage," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We can get water from the Tigris, get wood from the forests
and we can eat dates," Mohammoud said, "We can survive."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have threatened military strike in
response to Baghdad's October 31 decision to halt all cooperation
with U.N. arms inspectors verifying Iraq's disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said it has complied and cooperated with the U.N. in
eliminating weapons of mass destruction, but "got nothing" in
having the U.N. economic sanctions, imposed more than eight years
ago, lifted.
</P>
<P>
It accused the U.S. of blocking the lifting of sanctions as
stipulated in the U.N. resolution 687 and prolonging the
sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
A defiant Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz turned up at a
news conference Thursday to pan Washington and refuse to bow to
military threat. Iraq "is entitled to lifting of sanctions," he
said, so the onus is on the U.S. to agree to the principle.
</P>
<P>
About half way of Aziz's news conference, the U.S. rebuked that
Baghdad was trying to shift the responsibility away from its
shoulders, and said President Saddam Hussein has no other option
than to rescind his decision and comply immediately.
</P>
<P>
The time for diplomatic efforts is over and air strikes against
Iraq could take place at any time, Washington warned.
</P>
<P>
An obvious reaction to the threat of a showdown here was that
people queued up to buy as much fuel as they could. At a gas
station, a senior military officer, who called himself Abu Aus,
said "U.S. military strikes in our eyes are just like rains in the
eyes of those whose clothes are already wet through."
</P>
<P>
Iraq was already waterlogged. During the 1991 Gulf War which
lasted 43 days and led to the eviction of Iraqi troops from
Kuwait, numerous Iraqi power stations, bridges and other
infrastructures were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Aus said Iraq was making preparations for the possible
U.S. military action, but he refused to go into details.
</P>
<P>
At the press center, a staff member who only gave his first
name Saad, said "it is better to kill us than torture us." He said
all Iraqis were fed up with the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
His words well echoed Aziz's assertion at the press conference
- it makes no big difference for Iraqis to die in hospital without
medicine and medical equipment, or to die by U.S. bombs.
</P>
<P>
However, Saad also felt his country's isolation this time
around in challenging the U.N. Special Commission over weapons
inspections. "There is no more conscience in this world," said
Saad sadly.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on Thursday's statement of the Damascus
Declaration signatory states - Egypt, Syria and six Gulf Arab
states - which held Iraqi government responsible for any
consequences if it does not reverse its decision.
</P>
<P>
In the last Iraq-U.N. standoff over U.N. arms inspectors'
access to Iraqi presidential sites in February, almost all Arab
countries voiced rejection of use of force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Also different from previous scenes, today there were no
demonstrations, no "human shields," no chanting against the U.S.,
and even not many people in sight in many places.
</P>
<P>
Few people can be seen in the al-Gazal supermarket at the heart
of Baghdad. The owner said that ordinary people do not have money
to hoard food and daily necessities in anticipation of a strike.
</P>
<P>
"How can they afford these things when their monthly salaries
are just several thousand dinars, worth only a few bucks?" he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has already pulled hundreds of inspectors, relief
workers and non-essential personnel from Iraq since Wednesday,
leaving about 50 humanitarian staff to supervise distribution of
food and medicine in Baghdad and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The top U.N. relief official in Iraq, Hans von Sponeck, has
warned that their capacities have been significantly reduced, and
the implementation of U.N. humanitarian program has slowed down.
</P>
<P>
No one knows when a military strike, if there ever is, will
start. But with resignation, the Iraqis here are certain of one
thing - no matter what happens, they are going to face more
hardships ahead.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A painful birth may make an
individual more likely to commit violent suicide in adult life,
Swedish researchers claimed Friday in the British Medical Journal.
</P>
<P>
Professor Bertil Jacobson and Marc Bygdeman from the Karolinska
Institute, Sweden, studied 645 babies born in the country between
1945 and 1980, of whom 242 committed suicide by violent means
between 1978 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
They discovered that people who subsequently committed suicide
were more likely to have been exposed to birth complications, and
were subjected to twice as many interventions at birth as their
siblings.
</P>
<P>
They also found that the mothers of these babies were, on
average, given fewer painkillers. The use of painkilling opiates
reduced the suicide risk by approximately a half.
</P>
<P>
Obstetric procedures should be chosen to minimize pain and
discomfort to the infant if an increased risk of suicide by
violent means is to be avoided, the researchers concluded.
</P>
<P>
"It seems important that an obstetric procedure, of only a
couple of hours at birth, might have a long-term protective effect
in adulthood," they wrote.
</P>
<P>
However, the researchers said that their findings still need
further corroboration.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Jones Settle Harassment Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
agreed Friday to pay Paula Jones 850,000 dollars to drop her
sexual harassment lawsuit, with no apology or admissions.
</P>
<P>
Clinton lawyer Robert Bennett said the president "remains
certain" that Jones' allegations were baseless but wanted to get
the dispute behind him. "The president has decided he is not
prepared to spend one more hour on this matter," Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
The settlement says Clinton will pay Jones within 60 days and
requires both parties to "unconditionally release each other and
representatives in connection with any claims" stemming from the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
Jones' lawyer Bill McMillan, the husband of Jones' longtime
friend and spokeswoman Susan Carpenter McMillan, approached
Bennett Thursday on behalf of the rest of Jones' legal team with
the 850,000 dollar figure, the Associated Press quoted
unidentified sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was Clinton's sworn deposition for the Jones case that led
to the impeachment hearings that begin next week in the House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by Jones' lawyers in January, Clinton denied
having sexual relations with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky. Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr alleges that Clinton
lied under oath in the Jones deposition and otherwise obstructed
justice by trying to keep his affair with Lewinsky secret.
</P>
<P>
Jones alleged that Clinton, as Arkansas governor, made a crude
advance in a room at a Little Rock hotel in 1991. Clinton has
denied her accusation, and her lawsuit was dismissed last spring.
An appeal of that dismissal was pending.
</P>
<P>
Jones, who was a clerk for the Arkansas state government when
the alleged encounter occurred, contended in her lawsuit that her
rejection of Clinton's advance later affected her job
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright ruled on April 1 that
Jones' allegations, even if true, did not add up to a "hostile
environment" case of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
Jones' lawyers had appealed that ruling to the 8th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.

<HEADLINE> Ill-timed Attempt on Manaslu Ended in Death, Leader Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 13 (Xinhu) -- Borislav Dimitrov, organizer and
leader of the Manaslu'98 expedition which ended in the death of
Bulgarian mountaineer Hristo Stanchev, is certain that the fatal
accident would not have occurred if the attempt on Manaslu had
been postponed because of the weather.
</P>
<P>
"There were six expeditions at the foot of Manaslu. All of
them decided not to climb the peak because of the weather, only
four people, Hristo included, stayed on. If they had not
misjudged the situation and had put off this serious attempt on
Manaslu, all problems would have been avoided," Dimitrov said.
</P>
<P>
"I evacuated the first camp, leaving only one tent behind
because I knew they would be tired after the descent and would
find it difficult to carry the luggage. Apart from the tents, we
carried 60 kg. I knew this would make thing easier for them,"
Dimitrov said.
</P>
<P>
"I was against the ascent, that is why I quit. I cannot stop
anyone from climbing if he wants to. Still, I am sorry that it
all ended in death," Dimitrov said.
</P>
<P>
Manaslu (8,163 meters) is the eighth highest peak in the
Himalayas and has claimed the second heaviest toll.
</P>
<P>
The group which attempted to climb Manaslu included 12
mountaineers, of whom six Bulgarians, two Mexicans and two South
Koreans, one Frenchman and one Turk. Later on they were joined
by two more climbers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Stocks Close Week on High Note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended the
week on a high note with the Dow Jones industrial average up 89
points Friday, making up more than half of the losses incurred in
the first three sessions of the week.
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip barometer rose 89.85 to 8,919.59 thanks to the
news that the International Monetary Fund approved an aid package
of 41.5 billion U.S. dollars for Brazil with an aim to check the
contagion of the global financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Plus a merely 5.92 points gain Thursday, the Dow is still on a
negative 56 points this week, against an advance of 610 points for
the prior eight session winning streak.
</P>
<P>
Broader market indicators also posted gains except for the
technology-laden Nasdaq index which fell 3.82 points due to profit
taking.
</P>
<P>
Investors are not so certain about next week's market mood as
the U.S.-Iraq standoff on the arms inspection in Iraq heightened
and whether the Federal Reserve will announce a cut of interest
rates at the regular meeting Tuesday is in question.
</P>
<P>
On the New York Stock Exchange, decliners slightly led
advancers with trading volume down to 600 million shares from 689
million previously.

WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Lawyers for U.S. President
Bill Clinton and Paula Jones agreed Friday to a settlement of
Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against the president, with a
850,000-dollar payment coming from the president and no apology.

"Paula is very pleased that it's finally over," media reports

<HEADLINE> Nuts Eaters Have Good Hearts, Research Finds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Eating nuts on a regular basis
could dramatically reduce women's chances of getting coronary
heart disease, U.S. doctors said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dr Frank Hu and colleagues from the Harvard School of Public
Health in Boston, the United States, have studied the effects of
eating nuts on over 86,000 women aged 34 to 59 in the U.S. from
1980-1990.
</P>
<P>
The results of the 10 year study, published in the British
Medical Journal, showed that those who ate nuts more than five
times a week were 35 percent less likely to suffer from coronary
heart disease.
</P>
<P>
Even after taking account of other factors which could affect
health, such as general diet and exercise, the researchers found
that the reduction was still significant.
</P>
<P>
The researchers believed the protective effect of nuts may be
due to the unsaturated fats that they contain which have
beneficial effects on serum lipids, which in turn help to reduce
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
They also suggested that other potentially protective
constituents in nuts may include vegetable protein, magnesium,
vitamin E and potassium.

<HEADLINE> Obuchi Ends Russia Trip With "Intellectual Breakthrough" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi left here Friday at the end of a three-day official visit
to Russia, the first one by a Japanese premier in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Although little progress was made on the disputed Kuril
islands, the two sides reached "intellectual breakthrough" in
bilateral relations, Obuchi and Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
Such breakthrough should now be backed by boosting economic
cooperation, Itar-Tass quoted them as saying.
</P>
<P>
A Moscow Declaration, signed separately by Obuchi and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, confirmed "their determination to make
every effort to sign a peace treaty by the year 2000."
</P>
<P>
The disputed Southern Kuril Islands, known as the Northern
Territories in Japan, have been a sticking point barring the
signing of a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Moscow Declaration, Yeltsin's spokesman
Dmitry Yakushkin said no special status for the South Kuril
islands is going to be discussed with Japan, but Russia is ready
to consider economic interaction in the islands and visa-free
travel of Japanese citizens to the Kurils.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that Yeltsin's no-show at the official dinner
Thursday night in honor of Obuchi was agreed at their meeting
Thursday morning and had no link with his health.
</P>
<P>
Some observers linked Yeltsin's absence at the dinner to his
health problems. Yeltsin returned to Moscow last week from the
Black Sea resort of Sochi, where he took a vacation prescribed by
his doctors to recuperate from "serious fatigue" in the wake of a
bout of bronchitis.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Obuchi "agreed in principle on allowing very
simplified, virtually free visits to the islands by Japanese
citizens who are former residents of the islands and their
families."
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the two sides signed a document on the establishment
of a Japanese-Russian investment company "to contribute to direct
investments in Russia by Japanese companies, including joint
ventures, with support from the governments of Russia and Japan."
</P>
<P>
Besides Yeltsin and Primakov, Obuchi also met many Russians
across the political spectrum, such as Duma communist faction
leader Gennady Zyuganov, former Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly
Chubais and Krasnoyarsk Governor Alexander Lebed.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the two sides also signed four documents on
cooperation in tourism, environmental protection, and post and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi also visited Moscow University and was awarded an
honorary doctorate.

<HEADLINE> Annan Shocked by Reported Killings in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Friday said he was shocked by reports of killings by
government forces of innocent civilians in Mutambu commune in the
rural part of Bujumbura, capital of Burundi, early last week.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his spokesman's office, Annan said, "I
take note of the statement by the government that an
Inter-Ministerial Commission has been established by President
Buyoya on the incident and look forward to an early report."
</P>
<P>
"I expect that the perpetrators of this crime will be
identified and brought to justice," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative that all violence and attacks directed at
civilians come immediately to an end and that all parties involved
in the Burundi conflict ensure the full respect of international
humanitarian law and humanitarian principles," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi army killed more than 100 people, mostly Hutu
civilians, in retaliation for a Hutu rebel attack on a camp for
Tutsis, reports quoted survivors as saying.
</P>
<P>
The attack, which took place on the night of November 3-4,
was the deadliest since a third round of peace talks ended last
month with little progress.
</P>
<P>
In Bujumbura, military spokesman Col. Isaie Nibizi said
civilians had been reportedly killed in Rutovu, about 30
kilometers southeast of the capital, but he had no details. The
military spokesman declined to comment on who was to blame,
reports said.

<HEADLINE> North Atlantic Assembly Session Closes With Heated Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EDINBURGH, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Assembly
ended its 44th Annual Session Friday after heated debates on the
future role of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
Resolutions at the assembly's Standing Committee and five
special committees were passed, after the parliamentarians debated
on a wide range of issues concerning NATO's future strategic
concept, the recasting of Euro-Atlantic security, NATO's
enlargement, security in South-Eastern Europe, nuclear safety,
nuclear weapons proliferation and Russia's economy.
</P>
<P>
Though not covered by any of the resolutions, the legitimacy of
using force to deal with challenges not included in Article 5 of
the North Atlantic Treaty represented the most controversial
issue, particularly against the backdrop of the recent Kosovo
crisis and the potential pending attack against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
William Roth, president of the assembly, delivered a special
report entitled "NATO in the 21st Century" to the plenary session,
and conclusions and recommendations arising therefrom will be
presented to NATO governments and parliaments for deliberation.
</P>
<P>
While the North Atlantic Assembly is no official body of NATO,
its opinion expressed mostly in the form of resolutions is
expected to exert influence on the alliance's decision-making
process.
</P>
<P>
NATO's Secretary-General Javier Solana and General Wesley
Clark, supreme allied commander Europe, addressed the session.
Both stressed the need for NATO to adapt to the fastly changing
security environment in the Euro-Atlantic area and noted that the
coming months in the run-up to NATO's summit in Washington next
April will be crucial for revising the alliance's strategic
concept.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair made a speech at the session
Friday, too, stating his government's position on NATO's future.

<HEADLINE> Starr Sends Material on Willey to Judiciary Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr Friday sent evidence involving the Kathleen Willey matter to
the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
The fresh evidence concerning Mrs. Willey that was sent by
Starr does not amount to a formal referral accusing President Bill
Clinton of wrongdoing, as the one Starr sent in September did.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it allows the committee to determine whether Willey's
allegation of sexual impropriety against the president should be
included in the inquiry, media reports quoted unidentified sources
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the new information included testimony of key
witnesses and other evidence from the Willey investigation that
had been left out of Starr's earlier referral, which accused
Clinton of 11 offenses that Starr contends are impeachable. Willey
and several of her friends testified before Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
Starr has been investigating whether Clinton lied under oath
when he denied making a crude sexual advance toward Willey during
a 1993 encounter in the Oval Office, and whether others tried to
intimidate the former White House volunteer after she went public
with her allegations.
</P>
<P>
Willey became a witness in Paula Jones' sexual harassment
lawsuit against Clinton and testified before the grand jury
investigating Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Willey told her story publicly in an interview on CBS' "60
Minutes" last March. The president has adamantly denied the
allegations and the White House has released letters showing she
remained friendly with Clinton after the alleged incident.

The financing is designed to mitigate the economic and social
impact of international financial crises on the countries of Latin
America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, which will be forwarded to all the IDB's
governors for their final approval, authorizes the IDB's Board of
Executive Directors, as an exceptional measure and for a period of
one year, to approve loans that exceed the traditional limits of
the IDB for sector loans and for financing to the most developed
countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the emergency financing is to strengthen the
monetary reserves of the countries, support programs that are
designed to assist the most vulnerable sectors of society, and to

<P>
MOSCOW, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev left here Friday on an official visit to Syria and Egypt
amid rising tension in the region over the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Settlement of the Middle East crisis and the situation
concerning Iraq, which faces U.S. and British threat of force
following its suspension of cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors,
are expected to top the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The visit will last until next Tuesday, the Itar-Tass news
agency quoted the Defense Ministry's press service as saying.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein a personal letter, saying that use of force may be
carried out unless a political decision is reached promptly.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin expressed profound concern over the situation with
Iraq, Yeltsin's spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The decision of Baghdad to stop cooperating with the U.N.
Special Commission dealt a serious blow to the normalization
process," Yeltsin noted in the letter.
</P>
<P>
However, Yeltsin said "Russia categorically objects to a
scenario involving the use of force," Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The problem should be settled through interaction between Iraq
and the United Nations, including the U.N. Security Council and
the secretary-general, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Put Sanctions on 300 India, Pakistan Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government said on
Friday that it will apply sanctions against more than 300 Indian
and Pakistani government agencies and private companies for their
alleged nuclear ties.
</P>
<P>
Under the sanctions, the targeted agencies and companies would
be barred from buying U.S. goods, announced the U.S. Commerce
Department.
</P>
<P>
"Today's announcement specifies Indian and Pakistani entities
believed to have been involved in Indian or Pakistani nuclear,
missile, and military programs," the department said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The United States imposed sanctions on India and Pakistan after
the two countries raced nuclear tests in May in defiance of an
international ban on nuclear tests signed by other nations.
</P>
<P>
But the United States scaled back the sanctions when it found
they were hurting U.S. farmers.
</P>
<P>
Among those listed for the sanctions in India were the Defense
Research and Development Organization in New Delhi, the Department
of Energy and the Indian Institute of Science, the Fertilizer Corp.
and India Rare Earths Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Among those in Pakistan were Pakistan Ordnance Factories as
well as the People's Steel Mills.

early stage, but Space Minister Lord Sainsbury said the prospect
of a British astronaut was a real possibility.
</P>
<P>
"If the right project comes, we'll go for it. I wouldn't say
it's absolutely top priority but there is a real chance that it
might happen," the minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
For years, the British government has been reluctant to send
people into space, calling it a waste of money.
</P>
<P>
Although the prospect of a British astronaut in orbit would be
many years away, the facts that it is being discussed at all
indicates a major shift in Britain's attitude to space flight, the
BBC said.
</P>
<P>
Space scientists are encouraged that the preliminary talks had
taken place.
</P>
<P>
They said that it would be inspiring to the nation's youth at a
time then they are ignoring science and technology as never
before.

<HEADLINE> Countries Pledge $121 Million to Meet UNHCR 1999 Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pledges were made at a meeting of the General Assembly for
the Announcement of Voluntary Contribution to the 1999 Programs
of UNHCR by the representatives of China, Thailand, Hungary, the
Untied States, Belgium, Turkey, Sri Lanka, Ghana, Malaysia,
Austria, Algeria and Switzerland. UNHCR's estimated needs for
1999 is at 842.1 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugee, Sadako Ogata, said that over the last three years, the
UNHCR had progressively reduced its financial requirements, from
1.4 billion dollars in 1996 to 995 million dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, annual contributions had failed to meet those
targets, leading to the repeated readjustment of budgets
established on the basis of needs to match funding projections,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Ogata said reducing its budget had left the UNHCR not able to
meet some of the real needs of refugees, returnees and other
displaced persons.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Discover 1000th Pulsar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- An international team of
researchers has just discovered the 1000th pulsar within our
Galaxy since the first few were discovered in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers from the UK, Australia, Italy and the U.S. made the
discovery by using the 64-metre Parkes Radio Telescope in
Australia equipped with a new "multibeam" receiver system,
according to a press release issued Friday from the University of
Manchester, Britain.
</P>
<P>
The powerful new "multibeam" receiver, built as a joint venture
between the Australia Telescope National Facility and the
University of Manchester's Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories,
gives the telescope 13 beams capable of scanning the sky
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to this new, state-of-the-art system, the survey is
discovering new pulsars at a rate more than 10 times greater than
any previous search has achieved - about one for every hour of
observing time.
</P>
<P>
It has already added more than 200 new pulsars to the nearly
800 known when the survey began about a year ago. By the end of
the survey, in around a year, it is expected that over 600
additional pulsars will have been discovered.
</P>
<P>
A pulsar is the collapsed core of a massive star that has ended
its life in a supernova explosion.
</P>
<P>
Weighing more than our Sun, yet only 20 kilometres across,
these incredibly dense objects produce beams of radio waves which
sweep round the sky like a lighthouse, often hundreds of times a
second.
</P>
<P>
Pulsars make exceptional clocks, which enable a number of
unique astronomical experiments. Signals from distant pulsars can
also be used to probe the conditions in the depths of our Galaxy
and even help increase our understanding of the evolution of the
Universe.

<HEADLINE> Former Azeri President Charged With Libel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Former Azeri President Abulfaz
Elchibei, now the chairman of the opposition People's Front, has
been charged with libel and defamation for a recent statement on
incumbent President Heydar Aliyev.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, he will face up to six years in prison, Interfax
reported Friday in a dispatch from Baku, the capital of
Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
The investigation may take up to three months.
</P>
<P>
Elchibei, president of Azerbaijan in 1992-1993, said recently
that during the Soviet period, Aliyev, then a senior official in
the USSR government, was involved in the creation of a network of
the Kurdish Workers Party, which Turkey sees as a terrorist
organization.
</P>
<P>
Elchibei and other opposition leaders are now calling for
annulling the results of the October 11 presidential elections in
which Aliyev was re-elected for a second term.
</P>
<P>
Elchibei spent two years in prison during the Soviet era after
being convicted of "libel against the reality of the Soviet Union"
in 1975, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Albright Says U.S.-DPRK Accord Implemented as Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Friday said that despite concerns about an
underground construction site in the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK), the 1994 agreed framework is implemented as
expected.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the agreed framework is doing what it's
supposed to do, which is to freeze their nuclear materials
program," and "we are at this time satisfied," Albright told a
news conference before leaving on a trip to Asia.
</P>
<P>
Albright's statement softened a senior State Department
official's earlier public warnings. The official told reporters
Tuesday that the U.S. has some "pretty serious doubts" about
whether the DPRK is living up to that deal.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1994 agreement between the DPRK and the United
States, Washington agreed to provide Pyongyang with two advanced
nuclear power reactors and alternative energy supplies in return
for the latter freezing its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
If that assurance is shattered, U.S. obligations under the 1994
accord "cannot be sustained" and "the other things that we are
doing would pretty much collapse," the U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
However, when asked if the United States would really pull out
of the 1994 agreement, Albright pointedly did not repeat the
threat.

<HEADLINE> Crocodile-Like Dinosaur Unearthed in Niger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A previously unknown
species of dinosaur Suchomimus tenerensis has been unearthed in
Tenere desert of Niger by an international team of scientists,
reported the Science magazine Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new species of dinosaur with huge, curved claws and a
skull like a crocodile's, ran on two legs, and was about 36 feet
long, 12 feet high at the hip and weighed about 5 tons.
</P>
<P>
The newly unearthed dinosaur, living 100 million years ago in
early Cretaceous sediment, would have been a fearsome animal
that probably hunted fish as well as land animals.
</P>
<P>
Owing to its long and narrow head strongly resembling that of a
crocodile, it was named Suchomimus borrowing from the Greek word
for crocodile.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Lack Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- European stocks regained some
ground in late trading Friday after Wall Street stocks got off to
a good start.
</P>
<P>
But bourse activity was dampened as tensions between Iraq and
the U.S. mounted and the possibility of military action in the
Gulf grew.
</P>
<P>
The major indexes in Asia turned in a stronger performance, but
that wasn't enough for nervous European markets to post early
gains.
</P>
<P>
In London the FTSE 100 inched up 14.2 points, 0.3 percent, to
close at 5,463.2.
</P>
<P>
However, concern about the Iraqi situation was good news for
the crude price and oil stocks, with BP 16.5 up at 916, Shell
10.25 better at 364/75, and Enterprise Oil 9 ahead at 404.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Xetra DAX ended little changed after the volatile
day's trade. The Xetra DAX closed down 2 points at 4,643.80.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, CAC-40 index closed up two points at 3,562.23. Oil
stocks Elf and Total outperformed the market as the threat of a
Gulf war lead to an increase in crude oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Zurich's SMI was the poorest performer, dropping 0.7 percent,
49 points, to 6,703.9.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said many investors are still concerned about Europe's
economic outlook for the coming months, and were therefore
consolidating their positions.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Expected to Grow in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy is slowing,
but still growing with no real threat of a recession on the
horizon, according to a latest quarterly survey of American
business economists.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Business Economists said in its
report that it expected the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) to
grow by 3.6 percent this year and 2.1 percent in 1999 compared
with 3.8 percent growth in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The prediction is brighter than in the previous weeks.
</P>
<P>
As the U.S. financial market suffered from serious turmoils
in August and September, many U.S. and foreign economists
had expected the U.S. economy to grow less than 2 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
However, there is now a general feeling among the 29-member
Association that the economic impact of the August-September
stock-market declines is less likely to be as significant as
initially thought.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the economists of the Association surveyed
expect the U.S. economy to ease into a "soft landing" from its
heights in recent years, posting 2.5 percent growth or lower in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the rate cuts, most of the economists polled
expect the U.S. Federal Reserve Board to lower the federal funds
rate, the rate at which banks make short-term loans to each
other, between half and a full percentage point by mid 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Board cut the rates in late September and mid October. The
rate is currently 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The low rate is widely believed to be favorable to the
continuing growth of the U.S. economy.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin's Envoy Says No Malice on Chechens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Valentin Vlasov, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya set free Friday after
three months of captivity, said he harbors no malice toward
Chechens despite what happened to him.
</P>
<P>
Vlasov, abducted on May 1 and lost 15 kilograms in captivity,
will stay in a Moscow hospital for some time to recover,
presidential press secretary Dmitry Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
"I bear them in Chechnya no malice for the thing that happened
to me. We ourselves create conditions for what has happened and is
happening in Chechnya," Itar-Tass quoted Vlasov as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the federal authorities "have done practically nothing
to help the economic stablization" in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
Chechnya has been plagued by numerous kidnappings in the past
few years. According to Russian Deputy Interior Minister Vladimir
Rushailo, about 700 people are still kept hostage there.
</P>
<P>
He told the NTV "Hero of the Day" program that hostages include
servicemen, police officers and civilians.
</P>
<P>
The abduction has become a criminal business in Chechnya,
Rushailo said.
