<HEADLINE> Canadian Finance Minister Says No to Bank Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Finance Minister Paul
Martin said "no" to the country's two proposed bank mergers here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I am announcing today that the bank mergers will not be
allowed to proceed because they are not in the best interests of
Canadians," Martin said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The mergers would lead to an unacceptable concentration of
economic powers in the hands of fewer, very large banks," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"They would result in a significant reduction of competition.
And they would reduce the government's policy flexibility to
address potential future prudential concerns," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"This is a decision that reflects the government's commitment
to ensuring strong competition in the financial services sector,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Bank of Canada, the largest in the country, proposed
to merge with the third largest Bank of Montreal in January, and
the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Toronto-Dominion Bank
followed suit three months later.
</P>
<P>
The four large banks had said that the mergers were vital to
keeping them more competitive in the rapidly changing global
market.
</P>
<P>
But a report released Monday by Canada's superintendent of
financial institutions rejected the argument that bigger is better
and a guarantee of financial success.
</P>
<P>
"It is not possible to make generalized statements as to
whether larger banks are financially stronger than smaller banks
or whether mergers of financial institutions increase or decrease
their financial strength," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The record is mixed. There are examples of both increased and
decreased financial strength," the report added.
</P>
<P>
Martin's decision Monday has slammed the door on these
mega-mergers between Canada's large banks, at least for a year.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the immediate priority must now be to
focus on establishing an appropriate policy framework for the
financial sector for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"The government will not consider any merger among major banks
until the new policy framework is in place," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"But even then, new proposals will first have to demonstrate,
in the light of the circumstances of the day, that they do not
unduly concentrate economic power, significantly reduce
competition or restrict our flexibility to address prudential
concerns," he noted.

<HEADLINE> PNC Members Revoke Anti-Israeli Clauses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA CITY, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton said that members of the Palestine National Council (PNC)
have done "a good thing, a remarkable thing" by reaffirming the
annulment of anti-Israeli articles in their national charter.
</P>
<P>
Almost all PNC members stood up and raised their hands to
reaffirm the revocation of provisions calling for Israel's
destruction.
</P>
<P>
This was a magnificent show of Palestinian support for the
peace process. "You raised your hands, you stood up high," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
"By doing this, you stand up not only against what is wrong,
but also for what is right," he said. "Your decision touches the
people of Israel," he said, with his remarks greeted by a long
applause by the members.
</P>
<P>
Clinton noted that five years after the historic Oslo accords
were signed, many benefits of the peace agreement remain remote
for many Palestinians, but stressed that the PNC decision would
help advance the troubled peace process.
</P>
<P>
This also put an end to the prolonged dispute over Palestinian
charter between Israel and the Palestinians. In a rare quick
response, the spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said the Israeli government has accepted the PNC
decision.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had insisted that the PNC vote to ratify the
annulment of the articles calling for the elimination of the
"Zionist regime" in the covenant, the de facto Palestinian
constitution drafted in 1964.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Arafat praised Clinton's role in the
peace-making between Israel and the Palestinians, saying his visit
will definitely boost the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinian people's commitment to peace has
already been established, but the continued settlement activities
by Israel and its refusal to release Palestinian prisoners have
reduced mutual trust, which he said should be the base of peace.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, accompanied by Arafat, was greeted with long-time and
warm applause by the participants when they entered the convention
center.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address, PNC Speaker Salim Zanoun said the
Palestinians have fulfilled their obligations called for by the
recent land-for-security deal with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian people will be committed to peace, he said.

<P>
ROME, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Top officials Monday denied
corruption charges by IOC member Marc Hodler, former world ski
chief, in Sestriere, Italy, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Holder had claimed over the weekend that Fiat had provided
more than a hundred cars to influence the voting for the 1997

</P>
<P>
But the claims were hotly denied by Alberto Zunino, managing
director of Sestrieres Spa, the company which runs the ski resort.
</P>
<P>
"My opinion is also that of Fiat," he was quoted as saying.
"We consider what we have read to be an insult. We are deeply
indignant about these allegations which are completely false."

representative to the United Nations and other international
organizations at Geneva, Qiao Zonghuai, presented his credentials

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Leaders Decide to Admit Cambodia at Date to Be Decided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have agreed to admit Cambodia into
the regional grouping without setting the specific date for the
admission.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN heads of state and government "decided to admit
Cambodia into the ASEAN as the 10th member," Vietnamese Foreign
Minister Nguyen Manh Cam told reporters after leaders from the
nine ASEAN countries held consultations here Monday night.
</P>
<P>
However, Cam did not give the time when Cambodia will actually
become an ASEAN member, saying only that ASEAN foreign ministers
will organize a special admission ceremony in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
Attending the consultations were Brunei Sultan Haji Hassanal
Bolkiah, Indonesian President B.J. Habibie, Lao Prime Minister
Sisavat Keobounphan, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad,
Myanmar Prime Minister Than Shwe, Philippine President Joseph
Estrada, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, Thai Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai and Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van
Khai.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Khai said the ASEAN foreign ministers
will make arrangements "as early as possible."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan of Thailand, which urged a
delay in Cambodia's admission, also told reporters that "the time
has not been decided yet."
</P>
<P>
The consultations, a last-minute effort for Cambodia to join
the ASEAN in time for the Sixth ASEAN Summit to be held Tuesday
and Wednesday, came after ASEAN foreign ministers failed to reach
consensus on the matter at their meetings last week as the member
countries were divided over Cambodia's accession.
</P>
<P>
Host country Vietnam and some other countries favored
Cambodia's immediate admission while others such as Thailand and
Singapore asked for a delay until the political situation is more
stable in the country.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN had decided to admit Cambodia together with Laos and
Myanmar in July last year, but the admission was deferred after
armed conflicts broke out between the forces of the then First
Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun
Sen, resulting in Ranariddh's ouster.
</P>
<P>
The countries favoring Cambodia's admission argue that a
coalition government was already established in the country in
November, with Hun Sen as the sole prime minister, and the United
Nations restored the country's seat earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
However, Singapore and Thailand would like to wait for more
time, saying the conditions set for Cambodia's accession have not
been fully satisfied yet, including the amendment of the Cambodian
Constitution and appointment of senators.

ATHENS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Deputy Foreign

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Should be Encouraged by Irish Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus should be encouraged by
the peace agreement on Northern Ireland, said Desmond O'Malley,
chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Irish
Parliament here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
O'Malley, who was heading an Irish parliament delegation, said
after meeting with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides that the Good
Friday agreement signed in April and the difficulties in its
implementation were part of their discussions.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which will end the 30-year-long bloody conflict
in the divided British province, preserves Northern Ireland's
links with Britain while building its closer ties with Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Drawing "some parallels" between the solution of the Northern
Ireland problem and the one in Cyprus itself, O'Malley said this
"should be a source of encouragement to everyone on this island
that what did appear intractable in Northern Ireland only a few
years ago has now actually been solved by the political will and
with the assistance of the European Union (EU) and the U.S."
</P>
<P>
O'Malley also expressed full support for Cyprus' bid for full
membership of the EU, saying that Cyprus should not be excluded
from the group because of the political problem on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in 1974 following a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
O'Malley said that "Ireland like other small states in the
E.U. is anxious that a country like Cyprus which is fully in the
European tradition would be able to join as a full member."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus along with Slovenia, Estonia, Hungary, Poland and the
Czech Republic started substantive accession negotiations with the
EU last month.
</P>
<P>
O'Malley and his delegation concluded a six-day visit to Cyprus
on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Gore Calls on Congress to Censure Clinton, Not Impeach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
Monday called on Congress to censure President Bill Clinton instead
of impeaching him in connection with the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
"There ought to be a censure, not impeachment," Gore told
reporters at an unrelated White House event. "The Republican
leadership is forcing this rejection of any compromise and forcing
this vote that the American people do not want."
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives is expected to start debate
Thursday on four articles of impeachment approved last week by the
House Judiciary Committee. They include two counts of perjury, one
of obstruction of justice and one of abuse of power in the
Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
Gore pledged to do "anything and everything I can that is
appropriate and effective" to press for a House vote on censure
as an alternative to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
"I believe it's very unfortunate that the leadership of the
House of Representatives has made a decision to reject compromise
and force a vote only on impeachment and not give the members of
Congress a chance to vote their conscience," Gore said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not in keeping with the wishes of the American people.
It is not following the wisdom of the American people," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Bank for Development Sold 51 Pct Stake to France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 14 (Xinhua) - A 51 percent stake by the
Romanian Bank for Development (BRD) is sold to the French group
Societe Generale for 200 million U.S. dollars, as official
document was signed here Monday.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the most important privatizations in the last
nine years in the country.
</P>
<P>
The document was signed by Radu Sarbu, president of Romania's
chief privatization body -- the State Ownership Fund, and Philippe
Citerne, the first deputy-president of Societe Generale. Romanian
Prime Minister Radu Vasile and Governor of the National Bank Mugur
Isarescu attended the event.
</P>
<P>
Around 8 percent of Romania's foreign trade is currently
operated through the BRD, experts said. By unitary policies of
maintaining and attracting customers, and by adapting permanently
to the market's conditions, the bank will operate 12 percent-15
percent of the country's foreign trade within the next three
years, they said.
</P>
<P>
The infrastructure by the BRD includes 165 units, out of which
106 are new or modernized outlets. At the same time, the bank has
set up and developed an adequate database system. In 1999, the
bank will be financed through an entire computerized system.
</P>
<P>
The Banker magazine of the United Kingdom this autumn ranked
the BRD the 315th among the biggest 500 commercial banks around
Europe.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Faces Challenges of Peace, Economic Crisis in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Monday that the United Nations faces challenges of
international peace and security and economic and social crisis in
the coming new year.
</P>
<P>
Annan told a press conference, "In the coming year we face a
double challenge. There is perennial challenge of international
peace and security. And there is the challenge of economic and
social crisis, which really means the challenge of globalization
and global governance."
</P>
<P>
None of the crisis in Africa, the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq
has been resolved, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The best we can say is that in Kosovo, and in Iraq, all-out
war has been avoided for the time being," he said. "But unless
people abide by their commitments, and unless they redouble their
efforts to find peaceful solutions, we have every reason to fear
the worst in 1999."
</P>
<P>
"These crises take up an enormous amount of the organization's
time," he said. "It might be tempting to leave the economic and
social issues to others. But I am convinced we cannot afford to do
that."
</P>
<P>
The connection between the two challenges is too clear, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Unless we tackle the underlying distortions and imbalances in
the global economy -- unless we start to provide the kind of
`global governance' which is needed -- we must expect more
conflicts and even more intractable ones," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Economic and political security are, and always have been,
closely interconnected," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief told his end-of-year press conference that
"incredibly enough, this year -- my second as secretary-general --
has gone even faster than the first. I suppose it has been even
more eventful."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan listed "some more welcome events" in the
outgoing year, which "were the fruit of strenuous efforts over a
long period," he said.
</P>
<P>
They were the agreement on the Statute of the International
Criminal Court, the entry-into-force of the Ottawa landmine ban,
the elections and formation of a new coalition government in
Cambodia -- which has just resumed its seat in the General
Assembly, and the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, he added.

<HEADLINE> Full-Scale Civil War May Break Out: Angolan FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Foreign Minister
Venancio da Silva Moura said Monday that the Angolan peace
process is at a crucial point and a full-scale civil war may
break out at any moment.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the ambassadors to the southern African from China,
France, Britain and from the observer states, namely, the United
States, Russia and Portugal on the fierce fighting between the
government troops and the rebel UNITA forces, Mura said that it
was the rebels who first launched the attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan foreign minister lashed some foreign reports by
saying that the Angolan government troops had only taken
defensive measures and did not attack.
</P>
<P>
Mura noted that the UNITA troops were equipped with dozens of
tanks, various kinds of missiles and long-range artillery. This
has proven once again that they did not disarm and deceived the
United Nations and the international community, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister pointed out that the resolution of
imposing sanctions upon the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) adopted by the U.N. Security
Council has not been implemented properly and some countries are
still providing weapons and financial assistances to the rebel
group.
</P>
<P>
Mura finally stressed that a full-scale civil war may break
out again and the Angola peace process would end in failure
unless the U.N. firmly insists on its stance against the UNITA's
war policy.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. special representative to Angola Issa Diallo also
called upon the international community here Monday to take
emergent actions to seek ways to normalize the situation in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
"The developments are going against peace. So the
international community needs to take actions as quickly as
possible," said Diallo.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government Sunday admitted for the first time that
the government forces have been engaged in fierce fighting with
UNITA forces. It blamed the United Nations and international
community for the worsening situation.
</P>
<P>
Joao Batisata De Matos, Chief of General Staff of the Angolan
army, said that what the government forces are doing is a
response to the actions taken by the rebel troops, the Angolan
News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating situation in the country, the chief of
general staff said, is a result of the passive stance of the
United Nations over UNITA's refusal to implement the Lusaka Peace
Protocol.
</P>
<P>
He said that the international community has been condemning
the government forces for its large-scale military presence in
central part of the country, while the UNITA forces are
conducting massive military build-up there.
</P>
<P>
De Matos stressed that the government forces are capable of
controlling the situation and accomplish its task of safeguarding
the Lusaka Peace Protocol.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Revoke Anti-Israeli Clauses in Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA CITY, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians took a
decisive step Monday as hundreds of Palestine National Council
(PNC) members stood with their hands raised to reaffirm the
annulment of anti-Israel provisions in their national charter.
</P>
<P>
Visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton, while addressing the
meeting, praised the PNC for doing "a remarkable thing." The
Israeli government was quick to express acceptance of the PNC move.
</P>
<P>
This paved the way for a three-way summit between Clinton,
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later Monday. The summit will
possibly be held at the Erez border crossing between Israel and
the Palestinian self-rule Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Almost all PNC members stood up and raised their hands to
reaffirm the revocation of provisions calling for Israel's
destruction. This was a magnificent show of Palestinian support
for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"You raised your hands, you stood up high," Clinton said. "By
doing this, you stand up not only against what is wrong, but also
for what is right."
</P>
<P>
"Your decision touches the people of Israel" on the street, he
said, which was followed by a long applause by the PNC members.
</P>
<P>
This also puts an end to the prolonged dispute over the charter
issue between Israel and the Palestinians. Netanyahu had insisted
that the PNC vote to ratify the annulment of the articles calling
for the elimination of the "Zionist regime" in the covenant, the
de facto Palestinian constitution drafted in 1964.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's visit to Gaza, the first by a sitting U.S. president
to areas under Palestinian autonomy, gives a boost to the morale
of the Palestinians and is seen as a recognition of their
aspiration for an independent state.
</P>
<P>
Talking with Arafat at a luncheon earlier, Clinton said "for
the first time in the history of the Palestinian movement, the
Palestinian people and their elected representatives now have a
chance to determine their own destiny on their own land."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's presence at the PNC meeting was the centerpiece of
his three-day visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas, which
started Sunday, and a key element in the implementation of the
recent land-for-security deal signed by Arafat and Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's spokesman said the Israeli government has accepted
the way PNC revised the charter. The Israeli government had linked
a three-way summit with the outcome of the PNC meeting.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman congratulated Arafat on the PNC
decision and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai described it as a
"positive step."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Arafat stressed that the Palestinians are
committed to peace but the continued settlement activities and
the refusal to release Palestinian prisoners by Israel have
eroded mutual trust, which he said is the basis for peace.
</P>
<P>
He said the principle of land-for-peace is the basis not only
for the peace-making between Israel and the Palestinians, but also
for a solution to the conflict between Israeli and Syria and
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that five years after the historic Oslo accords
were signed, many benefits of the peace agreement remain remote
for many Palestinians. However, he stressed that the PNC decision
has showed the Palestinian commitments to peace and would help
advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He called on Israel and the Palestinians to eliminate mistrust
and hatred, and to move beyond the current situation, in which he
said there were a lot of "mistrust, misunderstanding and
mis-steps."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu put the recent peace deal on hold last week amid
violent clashes in the West Bank sparked by Israel's refusal to
release Palestinian political prisoners and what he said was
Arafat's unilateral statement on the declaration of a Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
While demanding the PNC take a formal vote on revising the
charter, Netanyahu has said that such a move alone would not be
enough to end the redeployment freeze.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with local TV after the PNC meeting, senior
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat urged Netanyahu not to look for
excuse to avoid the implementation of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israel has carried out the first of three withdrawals in line
with the agreement last month. The second stage of Israeli troop
redeployment is due to start this weekend.
</P>
<P>
The PNC had voted in April 1996 to revoke the anti-Israel
clauses in the Palestinian charter and the former Israeli Labor
government had accepted the vote.
</P>
<P>
But when Netanyahu came to power one month later, he said the
PNC vote was not complete and demanded the PNC convene again.
</P>
<P>
In advance of Monday's 600-member PNC vote, the Palestinian
Central Council, a smaller leadership body with 124 members, voted
overwhelmingly last Thursday to reaffirm an Arafat letter to
Clinton early this year declaring that all the anti-Israeli
clauses of the charter were revoked.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Launch Second Satellite Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will put its second
communications satellite, NileSat 102, into orbit in 1999, said
Egyptian Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif Monday.
</P>
<P>
A contract will be signed before the end of this year for the
manufacture and launching of the satellite, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The satellite will carry 12 space channels transmitting 84
digital television channels to Africa, the Middle East and
southern Europe, said the news agency.
</P>
<P>
The satellite will be basically devoted to the African
continent in an effort to boost joint cooperation in the media
field, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
It will be made with new technology which allows mixing and
compressing channels on the satellite instead of being operated by
ground control center, he said.
</P>
<P>
The satellite will be developed by the French Matra Markoni
company in about 12 months and launched by an Ariane rocket at the
French Korou Space Center in South America, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
NileSat 101, launched in April, has 50 general and specialized
television channels with a presumed life span of 16 years.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has signed contracts with a number of Arab and African
countries to lease its space channels.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Continue Central Role in Globalization: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations, as
the only global organization in the world, will do its utmost to
bring all countries into discussion of the globalization process,
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Annan told a press conference here that "the United Nations has
the convenient power to bring everybody to discuss the issue" of
global economy and globalization process.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N., as the only global organization with the sort of
convenient power we have, should be able not only to ensure that
all states know what changes have been discussed, but also to open
up a debate and encourage them (all members states) to participate
in the discussions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who described the globalization as "the dominant feature
of our times," said that the global economic and financial crisis
is one of the main challenges facing the world body in the coming
year.
</P>
<P>
He repeatedly stated that the United Nations bears "special
responsibility" in the globalization process, which has seen the
developing countries, the least underdeveloped countries in
particular, are being marginalized in the world economic community.
</P>
<P>
"In the past 18 months, there were quite a lot of discussions
about the world financial system, or what some people called the
world financial architecture," he said.
</P>
<P>
Three discussions were held under the U.N. auspices on the
world economy since the outbreak of the Asian financial crisis,
which has left no corners of the world immune to the negative
impact of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The discussions were held respectively in April and July and in
the form of a high-level dialogue on the world economy in
September on the world economy.

MOSCOW, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia needs to overcome the
consequences of the crisis and to create a sound legislative and
institutional basis for attracting investors, Russian Prime
Minister BBBgeny Primakov emphasized Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the Consultative Council for Foreign
Investments in Russia, Primakov said that favorable investment
conditions should be created for both foreign and Russian
investors because "the investment process should be based on
economic rationalism, competition and a sound legal footing."

After the meeting, Primakov told a press conference that Russia
will simplify bureaucratic mechanisms, as well as customs
practices.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are plans to create "a strong state
insurance company which would insure against political threats."

foreign investors who have made direct investments in the real
sector of the economy has withdrawn from our market despite the
crisis."
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the presence of Western banks on the Russian market
and Western capital investments. We are grateful to the members of
the Consultative Council for Foreign Investments, who head major
Western companies, for not leaving us when the crisis broke out in
Russia in August," said Primakov.

<HEADLINE> Annan to Focus on U.N. Role in New Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Monday that he would spend much of next year on
his report to the General Assembly, to be convened in the year
2000, on the U.N. role in the new century, but he will not focus
on the U.N. reform campaign.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference, "Much of next year will be devoted
to preparing the report on `the United Nations in the 21st
century,' which I have promised to submit to the Millennium
Assembly -- the 55th session of the General Assembly -- in the
year 2000."
</P>
<P>
As part of the preparations, the United Nations is going to
hold informal events or hearings in various regional centers,
involving member states as well as non-governmental organizations
and the private sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope these events will throw up many new and useful ideas on
the objectives of the United Nations in the decades ahead, in all
five areas of its work, peace and security, economic and social
affairs, development cooperation, humanitarian action, and of
course human rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, "neither the Millennium Assembly nor my report to it
will focus mainly on U.N. reform," he said. "We want to
concentrate on the long-term role and purposes of the
Organization." "But of course that presupposes that reform must
continue," he added.
</P>
<P>
Annan, the first black African to become the U.N. chief, has
championed a course of reform in the world body, including
streamlining the system, and keeping a smaller budget.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased with what has already been achieved. I think
there is no doubt we already have a much more coherent and
purposeful system than we did two years ago," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But I am still looking for further action on such issues as
result-based budgeting, personnel management, and time limits for
new mandates," he said. "I hope 1999 will see decisive progress on
those issues."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan urged those countries which are in arrears
with their contributions to make "prompt payment" of their back
dues. At present, the United States is the largest owner of its
U.N. dues, and it saved its voting right in the General Assembly
next year just by paying the minimum amount of money the U.N.
Charter requires.

<HEADLINE> Annan on Comprehensive Review of Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- It would be decided by
the Security Council of the United Nations on whether or not to
have a comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with the U.N.
resolutions, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the end-of-year press conference, Annan said the council
should observe its obligations it had made in its resolutions and
lift the sanctions against Iraq once it got disarmed.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in
charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction would
report to the council on the level of Iraq's cooperation with the
United Nations arms inspectors this week and the report would be a
fair and objective one.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that for its part, Iraq should cooperate fully and
unconditionally with the United Nations if it wanted to get the
comprehensive review.
</P>
<P>
Annan said there might be conflicts at the Security Council on
this matter because one or two countries might disagree, and that
did not mean the Security Council would not move ahead and do what
it had promised in its own resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq promised to resume full and unconditional cooperation with
the United Nations on November 14 and the Security Council
promised to conduct the comprehensive review once it cooperated
fully. Iraq expected the comprehensive review would lead to easing
or lifting of the U.N. sanctions which has been in place since
1990.

<HEADLINE> African Summit Last Chance for Peace in DRCongo: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) warned Monday that the African summit this week would be
"the last chance" to seek peaceful solutions to the four-month
crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
DRC Foreign Minister Jean Charles Akuto told Egypt's Middle
East News Agency that if the summit fails to reach a settlement,
force would be "the sole option" of DRC "to restore democracy" in
the central African country.
</P>
<P>
Akuto reiterated his country's readiness to negotiate with all
parties to restore security and stability in DRC.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of African Unity is scheduled to hold a summit
in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, Thursday and Friday on the DRC issue.
</P>
<P>
DRC government troops have been fighting since August against
rebels allegedly supported by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
But DRC denied the existence of rebels, insisting that it is
invaded by foreign forces and calling for Rwandan and Ugandan
withdrawal from its territory.
</P>
<P>
Akuto was accompanying DRC President Laurant Kabila on a
three-day visit to Egypt. They left for home Monday.
</P>
<P>
The official termed Kabila's visit as "very successful," saying
his talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak dwelt on promotion
of bilateral relations in the fields of agriculture, trade,
industry and energy.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Monday that Egypt and
DRC have reached three agreements, which will be signed on the
sidelines of the Ouagadougou summit.
</P>
<P>
The agreements are on preventing dual taxation, protecting
investment and enhancing trade, Moussa said.

<HEADLINE> Angola, U.N. to Discuss Withdrawal of Observers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Minister of
Territorial Administration Faustino Muteka said Monday that his
government will discuss with the United Nations about the
withdrawal of the peacekeepers from the country.
</P>
<P>
Muteka, also head of government delegation to the joint
commission for the Angolan peace process, pointed out that "the
U.N. mission to Angola has nothing to do here now," and the Angolan
government will take up the responsibility of protecting the
people and bringing them the peace they deserve.
</P>
<P>
The minister played down the role of the blue berets, the U.N.
peacekeeping forces, in the peace process in the war-torn
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
"They (blue berets) failed to find that the UNITA did not
demilitarize its troops at all and ignored the reports by the
Angolan government," said Muteka.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had sent notes many times to the U.N.
observers mission, accusing UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi of
refusing to implement the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government Monday admitted that the government
troops recently had fierce fighting with the forces of the rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) with
tanks, missiles and long-range artillery involved.

<HEADLINE> Official Warns of Alarming Air Pollution in Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Deputy Health Minister
Ali Bar Sayari on Monday warned of an "alarming" air pollution in
the Iranian capital, calling on the people to stay away from
central city.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), Sayari
said that dangerous noxious gases have increased 10 folds in
Tehran over the past four days as a result of stable weather and
occurrence of reversion phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
He said that the inversion phenomenon which has escalated the
air pollution would continue till Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The official said the pollution has reached an alarming level
as the volume of carbon monoxide in air has increased to 18 PPM,
twice as many as the standard volume.
</P>
<P>
He warned people, especially the elderly, children and those
suffering from allergies, to stay away from central Tehran where
pollution has gone "beyond dangerous levels."
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately even in a normal situation over 500 tonnes of
hydrocarbons, 120 tonnes of nitrogen monoxide, five to 20 tonnes
of lead from car emissions enter the air in the capital city
every day, he said.
</P>
<P>
Following the serious air pollution during recent days, Tehran
authorities shut down elementary schools in Tehran and nearby
cities of Shahr Rey and Shemiranat on Monday to protect children
from the air pollution.
</P>
<P>
The education department of Tehran province announced on Monday
to close all elementary, secondary and high schools in the three
cities upon a recommendation made by the Environment Protection
Organization.

<HEADLINE> Iraq FM: Prolonging Sanctions Against U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Prolonging the economic
sanctions on Iraq is not in conformity with U.N. resolutions,
rather it is out of political motives, said Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf made the remark at the second conference of Non-aligned
Students and Youth Organization held here.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq's response to the international initiatives since last
February was to achieve the main goal of lifting sanctions, but
the American administration insists on prolonging it," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq has fully cooperated with the United Nations
Special Commission (UNSCOM) and the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) in arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq following its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait cannot be lifted unless U.N. arms inspectors verify that
Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, 880 UNSCOM teams have inspected 811 Iraqi sites and
installed 16 camera systems to monitor Iraqi industrial
establishments, he said, adding that 13,500 tonnes of chemical
materials and 400 missiles have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Laboratory tests in Switzerland and France proved that Iraq did
not weaponize the lethal nerve gas VX, said Sahhaf.
</P>
<P>
He said that the international community needs to be informed
of the facts concerning disarmament in Iraq and must defend Iraq's
legitimate rights and confront disinformation campaigns launched
against Iraq to distort the facts.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler will submit a report Tuesday to
the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on whether Iraq has kept
its promise of full cooperation with U.N. arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
In mid-November, Iraq announced unconditional resumption of
full cooperation with U.N. arms inspections it suspended three
months ago, narrowly escaping a U.S.-led punishing air strike.

KHARTOUM, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The ministerial conference of
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) on refugee problems in
African ended here Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
The two-day event endorsed a Khartoum declaration on refugees
and its appended recommendations.
</P>
<P>
The conference urged the OAU member states to approve
comprehensive policies to tackle the fundamental causes of the
problems of refugees and internal displaced people.
</P>
<P>
It called for enhancing the OAU role in solving disputes and

BRUSSELS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
provided humanitarian aid of 5.89 million European currency units
(about 6.95 million U.S. dollars) for six Asian countries and
regions, the European Commission said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the EU's executive body, said the Asian
countries and regions that have received the humanitarian aid for
various projects are the Democratic People's Republic of Korea

<HEADLINE> De Beers Sales Drop by 28 Percent in 1997/98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The sales of rough gem
diamonds by De Beers in 1998 registered 3.345 billion U.S.
Dollars, 28 percent less than the previous year's 4.840 Dollars,
the diamond giant said in a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sales in the second half of 1998 were 1,645 billion
Dollars, seven percent less than that during the same period in
1997, said De Beers.
</P>
<P>
It said that trading conditions were difficult throughout the
year and the expectations that sales in the second half would be
higher than the first half failed to materialize.
</P>
<P>
"Good levels of retail sales of diamond jewelry in the
United States and to a lesser extent in Europe have been
insufficient to compensate for lower sales in Japan and East
Asia," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
In the U.S., retail sales during the first half of 1998 were
some seven percent higher than the previous year. Early
indications are that sales during the important Christmas season
will also be up compared with last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the company said, retail demand in Japan, the second
largest market, is some 20 percent below the 1997 level in Dollar
terms.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's polished diamond imports have been running at
about 40 percent below 1997 levels.
</P>
<P>
Owing to poor sales figures, De Beers' headline earnings
slipped by 33 percent in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The low level of sales in the second half will also impact
results for the current financial year to December 1998, it
added.

Romania's central bank (BNR)has had made a number of decisions in
connection with the introduction of the single currency in the
European Union's member states beginning January 1, 1999, BNR
director Adrian Vasilescu said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vasilescu said the central bank had decided that the rates of

single currency unit. The single currency will be also used in the
reports issued by the General Directorate of Monetary and Hard
Currency Policy, he added.
</P>

The new currency will affect only the Romanian businessmen in
the Euro zone and those whose trade is dominated by the single
currency unit, Vasilescu said.
</P>

According to statistics, the EU is the most important
commercial partner of Romania, with the bilateral trade making up

this year will reopen Tuesday, the central bank announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Daido T.S. Ballali, the governor of the Bank of Tanzania

directors were foreign nationals.
</P>
<P>
Other conditions include de-linking of the operation of the

</P>
<P>
The BOT governor said that the steps of restructuring and
strengthening the capital base have been taken and will be

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Supreme Leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Monday condemned the removal of
anti-Israeli clauses in the Palestinian national charter.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of preachers on the eve of the holy
month of Ramadhan, Khamenei said the U.S. attempt to confront
the Islamic Republic of Iran and throw the cause of Palestine
into oblivion is doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Israel, which make use of traitors and
low-spirited people have attempted to cross out the principle of
struggle against the Zionist (Israeli) criminals from the
Palestinian national charter, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of members of the Palestine National Council and other
Palestinian leadership bodies reaffirmed the annulment of the
anti-Israel clauses in the Palestinian charter at a meeting in Gaza
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader also blasted the U.S. for its efforts to
"sabotage the current state of affairs of the Iranian nation
and government."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. employs every means including propaganda machine,
economic sanctions, supporting sabotage activities in Iran and
taking advantage of the espionage services, to make Iran insecure
in a bid to hinder its progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he condemned the recent mysterious killings of
famous writers in the country, saying that the killings were
engineered, directly or indirectly, by the global arrogance.
</P>
<P>
During the past one month, four Iranian writers and a
veteran opposition leader Dariush Forouhar along with his wife
were mysteriously killed in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that someone has attempted to portray Iran as an
insecure country and the western media are working hard on this in
a bid to show that the Iranian government and its judicial and
security authorities are unable to provide security for its people.
</P>
<P>
The murder of Iranian citizens, whoever they might be, is a
crime committed against the national security, he said.

MOSCOW, December 14 (Xinhua) -- A regular session of the
Consultative Council for Foreign Investments in Russia held here
behind closed doors on Monday adopted a special communique,
according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov told the session that
the August 17, 1998 decisions of the government of the Russian
Federation and the Central Bank became the catalysts of the
negative processes. Russia is in crisis.
</P>
<P>
Under the current circumstances the key tasks facing the
Russian government is to "ensure the operation of life-support
systems and reduce social tension," the communique says.
</P>
<P>
The Council discussed concrete measures, which include tax
reform, bringing accounting practices in line with international
standards, developing the financial sector and the securities
market, enhancing investment insurance, perfecting customs
procedures, removing trade and non-trade barriers for Russian
exports, invigorating foreign investments in the Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government, in cooperation with the parliament,
will adopt the Civil Code and laws on foreign investments in the
Russian Federation, on the list of industries, on the introduction
of legislative acts, on concession agreements concluded with
Russian and foreign investors, and on free economic zone.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of these laws will create a national regime and
stable conditions for foreign investors, settle disputes with
neutral international arbitration, the freedom of profit
repatriation and state guarantees for the foreign investments, the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the government will continue its efforts to
attract foreign investments and to improve organizational forms of
this work.

WASHINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) have agreed to
continue their joint search next year for the remains of American
soldiers missing in action during the 1950-53 Korean War, the
Pentagon announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement for a total of six joint search operations
between April and November of next year was reached following
four days of talks that began in New York last Wednesday, the
announcement said.
</P>
<P>
"We have hammered out an agreement that take us far beyond
our three previous years' operations," said Bob Jones, deputy
assistant defense secretary for POW/Missing Personnel Affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We formalized the concept of a joint investigation team to
locate and interview witnesses to accelerate the pace of
recovery long before our excavation teams begin their work. This
concept gives us the potential to recover more remains by using
our people more efficiently," he added.
</P>
<P>
It will be the fourth consecutive year that the United States
has conducted recovery operations in the DPRK with the help of
DPRK teams. In nine joint operations over the past three years,
U.S.-DPRK teams have recovered remains believed to be those of
29 U.S. troops from the 1950-53 war.
</P>
<P>
The agreement reached in New York also included two joint
archival reviews in which U.S. officials will be granted access
to documents in the DPRK relating to U.S. personnel lost or
captured during the war.

<HEADLINE> Annan Still Confident of Lockerbie Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday voiced his confidence again in the Libyan
move to hand over the two suspects of the 1988 Lockerbie
airliner bombing.
</P>
<P>
Annan told a press conference that "My sense is that we are
near a decision and I think they will move in the right decision.
My sense is that they have realized they have come to the end of
the road. And I think they will move in the right direction."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief made the statement following his December 5
talks with Libyan leader Muammar Gadaffi in a bid to press Tripoli
to surrender the two suspects for the trial in the Netherlands. He
has described the talks as "fruitful and positive."
</P>
<P>
The two Libyans were accused of planting a bomb aboard Pan Am
flight 301, which exploded in mid-air over Lockerbie, Scotland,
killing a total of 270 people.
</P>
<P>
At issue is where the two suspects, if convicted, to serve
their sentences. Libya, which has accepted in August the U.S.-UK
proposal to hold the trial before a Scottish court in the
Netherlands, is against a joint proposal by Washington and London
to have the two serve their sentences in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Libya is currently holding a session of the People's Congress,
the nation's top legislative body, which would have to endorse any
decision by Gaddafi to surrender the two men, Abdel Basset Ali
Mohammed Al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah.
</P>
<P>
But Annan, in his response to a question, said that he believed
such obstacles had been clarified and that Libya was aware of the
10th anniversary of the bombing next Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to predict when the handover would take
place, just repeating his previous statement that it would not
take "an inordinate amount of time."
</P>
<P>
U.N. sanctions, imposed in 1992 and tightened in 1993, would
be suspended automatically once the two arrived in the
Netherlands, said a Security Council resolution.

<HEADLINE> New Camp in W. Tanzania to Be Used for DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) plans to use a new camp in west
Tanzania's Kigoma Region next month to accommodate refugees from
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Jean Durieux, head of the UNHCR Kigoma sub-office, told
reporters over the weekend that the agency expects to open the
Lugufu camp in Kigoma district because the Nyarugusu camp in
Kasulu district will be full by the end of this month with 50 new
arrivals every day on average.
</P>
<P>
Durieux said the Nyarugusu camp has over 17,000 Congolese
refugees, while its holding capacity is 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The Lugufu camp in Kigoma district is presently holding about
9,000 Congolese refugees who entered the country in 1996, the
UNHCR official said, adding that with the on-going wars in the
DRC, the process of repatriating these refugees to their country
is halted.
</P>
<P>
"If the influx rate of DRC refugees continues to rise, by mid
next year we will need a new camp because even the Lugufu camp
whose capacity is 20,000 will be filled," he said.
</P>
<P>
Durieux said his office has requested the government to
allocate a contingency site in case the influx rate kept on
rising, but has yet to receive any responses.
</P>
<P>
He explained the DRC refugees cannot be taken to Nduta camp in
Kibondo district because they cannot be mixed with those from
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese refugees at Nyarugusu camp, some 160 kilometers
northwest of the Kigoma town on Lake Tanganyika, have formed
their own internal governing structure to maintain security and
order, Durieux said.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Home Affairs working at the
camp, Charles Nswila, said that the camp has been divided into 12
villages in which a man and a woman are elected as the head.
Seven zones which has two presidents each are formed on the basis
of these 12 villages.
</P>
<P>
He said the system has been very helpful in resolving their
problems and only few cases were delivered to police at the camp
for handling.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns Americans in Gulf of Potential Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
warned American diplomats and citizens in seven Gulf states of
potential attack on U.S. targets, possibly in the next 30 days.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley told reporters on
Monday that the warning was "based on information we deem to be
credible and serious."
</P>
<P>
U.S. embassies in Kuwait, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Saudi
Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain and Yemen warned Americans at the weekend
that they have "information indicating a strong possibility that
terrorist elements are planning an attack against U.S. targets
in the Gulf, possibly in the next 30 days," Foley said at a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
He refused to be more specific about the threat but implied
that any U.S.-related facility -- private or government -- could
be at risk.
</P>
<P>
"All Americans should remain alert to any suspicious activity
and take precautionary steps to reduce the profile and
vulnerability of any U.S. facilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The embassy reminds Americans to maintain a high level of
vigilance and to take appropriate steps to increase their
security awareness and to lessen their vulnerability,"
by maintaining a low-profile and varying times and routes of
regular travel, he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Clears Aid for Kosovo, Bosnia-Herzegovina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
here Monday that it had cleared humanitarian aid worth a total of
11.597 million ECUs for projects to assist victims of conflict in
Kosovo and Bosnia Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
The aid, managed by a EU aid agency, the European Community
Humanitarian Office (ECHO), will enable international and
non-governmental organizations to carry out the certain projects
over the Winter, the European Commission said.
</P>
<P>
According to the commission, the EU's executive body, the
latest grant of 10 million ECUs (11.8 million U.S.dollars) brings
the total provided for the crisis in Kosovo this year to 19
million ECUs (22.4 million U.S. dollars). This aid will help all
those displaced with food, health care and shelter.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that conflict in Kosovo led to about 300,000
people being displaced. Many left Kosovo for Montenegro, Albania,
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Turkey and other parts of Serbia. But many still stayed in Kosovo
itself and face hardship this Winter.
</P>
<P>
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Winter temperatures can plunge to
-20 degrees, with snow until the end of April, the commission
said. There are still more than 800,000 internally displaced
people, and some groups are particularly vulnerable. The EU grant
of 1.579 million ECUs (1.86 million U.S.dollars) will provide
fuel, Winter clothes as well as enabling repairs to electricity
and water supply systems.

<HEADLINE> Israel Welcomes PNC Decision on Revoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed Monday the reaffirmation by the
Palestine National Council (PNC) of the annulment of anti-Israel
clauses in the Palestinian charter but demanded more Palestinian
steps.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said at a news conference here that the PNC decision
to reaffirm the revocation of the anti-Israel provisions is "a very
important and positive step" which will help move forward the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this was the first time that the Palestinian
leadership have declared publicly to their people that all the
provisions in the charter calling for the destruction of Israel
have been null and void.
</P>
<P>
"It's an important day for the state of Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister also described this move only as the
first step and insisted that the Palestinians take more measures
to fulfill their obligations.
</P>
<P>
He made a list of measures the Palestinians need to take
before Israel agrees to hand over more land in the West Bank to
them, including stopping anti-Israel incitements, collecting
illegal weapons and arresting terrorists.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Israel would not release those Palestinian
prisoners "with bloods on their hands."
</P>
<P>
His acceptance of the PNC decision has cleared a final
obstacle to a three-way summit with Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat and visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the summit will take place Tuesday
morning at the Erez border crossing between Israel and the
Palestinian-rule Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting at the Shawa Center in the afternoon, almost all
PNC members stood up and raised their hands to show their support
when asked by Arafat to reaffirm the nullification of anti-Israel
clauses in the charter.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that by rejecting the offensive clauses "fully,
finally and forever," the PNC, the Palestinian parliament in
exile, has sent "a powerful message (of peace), not to the
government, but to the people of Israel."
</P>
<P>
"You've touched the people of Israel, you've reached out to
their heart there," he said, with his remarks greeted by a long
applause by the members.
</P>
<P>
The PNC meeting is the centerpiece of Clinton's three-day
visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas, which started Sunday,
and a key element of the recent land-for-peace deal signed by
Arafat and Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The reaffirmation put an end to the prolonged dispute over the
Palestinian charter between Israel and the palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The PNC voted in April 1996 to revoke the anti-Israel clauses
in the Palestinian charter and the former Israeli Labor
government has accepted the vote.
</P>
<P>
But when Netanyahu came to power one month later, he said the
PNC vote was not complete and demanded the PNC convene again.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister put the recent peace deal on hold
last week amid violent clashes in the West Bank which were
sparked by Israel's refusal to release so-called security
prisoners and what he said was Arafat's unilateral declaration of
a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with local TV after the PNC meeting, senior
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat urged Netanyahu not to look
for excuse to avoid the implementation of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israel has carried out the first of three withdrawals in line
with the agreement last month. The second stage of Israeli troop
redeployment is due to start this weekend.

<HEADLINE> Global Financial Turmoil Blamed for Turkey's Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Finance Minister
Zekeriya Temizel said here Monday that Turkey is being influenced
by an external financial crisis and should focus on getting rid of
this panic-driven crisis mood.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Temizel said that "the Turkish
economy is not in a crisis now, but it was significantly affected
by an external crisis."
</P>
<P>
Temizel and State Minister Isin Celebi explained detailed
economic measures that were decided in the cabinet and were
announced by caretaker Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
Temizel said the crises that erupted in East Asia and Russia
scared international investors and that as as a result, capital
started flowing to secure countries from risky markets.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey was affected by this crisis because it was put in the
same category with other risky emerging market economies," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "what is important is voicing and
discussing problems and looking for a solution within the
framework of social consensus. And this is what we are trying to
do."
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish economy is not a mandated one. The idea that all
intervention power belongs to the state and that the state can
convert all the negative things into positive things is wrong,"
added the minister.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Celebi said that the reason for the current
difficult situation is both the global crisis and structural
problems in the economy which started in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said that the problem should not be an issue of political
conflict, adding that although companies demand solutions to their
specific short-term problems, the government has to consider the
interests of the whole country and future generations.

<HEADLINE> ECB Says Euroland Money Growth at 4.8 per cent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Central Bank (ECB)
Monday said that money growth expansion currently poses no
inflationary dangers.
</P>
<P>
Less than three weeks before the launch of the single currency
euro in 11 European countries, the Frankfurt-based ECB said in its
first comprehensive statistical report about the money supply
situation in "Euroland", that in October the annual growth rate
was 4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The average for the months of August, September and October was
just 4.5 percent, the ECB noted.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, the annual growth in money supply in
the 11 countries ranged between 3.5 and 5.5 percent. This trend is
"largely compatible with the ongoing price stability in the euro
region", the ECB said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said that in October the money supply stood at
over 4.25 trillion European Currency Units (2.65 trillion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The 11 euro-states are all but four - Britain, Greece, Denmark,
and Sweden - of the 15 European Union members.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Speed Up Economic Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The member countries of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plan to speed up
their economic integration by advancing the timetable for
implementing the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA).
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters on the first day of a two-day ASEAN summit
here Tuesday afternoon, Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam of
Vietnam, which is chairman of the summit, said the "developed
members" of the regional grouping will fully implement AFTA by the
year 2002, instead of the original 2003, when member countries
would cut their tariffs to 0-5 percent. However, new members would
be granted "an extremely flexible" schedule and timetable.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also discussed measures to promote intra-ASEAN
investment by giving investors from other member countries
national treatment while efforts would be made to obtain
investment from outside the region.
</P>
<P>
In regard to the financial and monetary sectors, the leaders
considered measures to increase short-term capital movements, Cam
said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also raised the idea of a common ASEAN currency,
but as it will take some time for the ASEAN to get such a
currency, the leaders have instructed officials and experts "to
study very carefully the issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese foreign minister said the leaders also stressed
the need for intensified cooperation between the ASEAN countries
and international and regional organizations in areas such as
infrastructure including the building of a trans-ASEAN railway
from Singapore through Malaysia, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam to
South China.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also discussed the development of sub-regions such
as the Mekong Basin, noting that sub-regional cooperation will be
a "very substantial contribution" to poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
In order to carry out these projects, the leaders stressed the
need of coordinating policies at both macro and micro levels,
according to Cam.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government will continue their meeting
Wednesday morning and are expected to adopt the Hanoi Declaration,
the Hanoi Plan of Action and other documents submitted by their
foreign and economic ministers before the conclusion of the summit
at noon.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Vietnamese foreign minister said that Cambodia
is already a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) although an admission ceremony is yet to be held.
</P>
<P>
"The ASEAN leaders have decided to admit Cambodia as the 10th
member of ASEAN. This is a very clear and definite decision by the
ASEAN leaders, meaning Cambodia is the 10th member of ASEAN," Cam
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, there is a procedural question to be solved
and the ASEAN leaders have instructed their foreign ministers to
arrange an admission ceremony in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
"So my understanding is that although the admission ceremony
has not yet occurred, Cambodia can be considered the 10th member
of ASEAN," he added. "I understand the admission ceremony will be
organized at the earliest possible time."
</P>
<P>
However, at the open session of the Sixth ASEAN Summit Tuesday
morning, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen did not sit together
with leaders from the other members as his country enjoys only
observer status.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese foreign minister said the ceremony may take
place in one or two weeks or in one month, but Cambodia is now an
ASEAN member.

<HEADLINE> ADB Supports Civil Service Reform in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) approved on Monday a technical assistance grant of 630,000
U.S. dollars to the Nepalese government to help it reform the
civil service, the bank said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The principal focus of the technical assistance project will
be to lay the groundwork for a broad reform of the civil service.
The project will be based on previous studies of the government
and other donors, especially the 1992 report of the Government
Administrative Reform Commission," the bank said in press release.
</P>
<P>
It said that the technical assistance will support preparatory
activities leading to specific reforms in the civil service.
</P>
<P>
"Upon completion of these activities, a time-bound Action Plan
for civil service reform will be prepared," the bank said. "It is
keeping with the bank's anti-corruption strategy, an action plan
for strengthening the capacity of constitutional bodies will also
be developed."
</P>
<P>
The bank said that if the Nepalese government is committed to
implementing the time-bound action plan, it would consider
providing a civil service reform policy-based assistance.
</P>
<P>
The technical assistance project is expected to start in
January 1999 and finish at the end of that year, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the total size of Nepal's civil service is
estimated at 100,000 to 140,000 people, or approximately 0.57
civil servants per hundred population, which is relatively small
by developing country standards.
</P>
<P>
It noted that a number of studies described the civil service
as being politicized, inefficient and ineffective.
</P>
<P>
The Government Administrative Reform Commission had concluded
that the civil service was seriously overextended and its sphere
of operations needed significant reduction, the bank added.

WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer prices edged
up moderately in November as inflation remained temperate in the
economy, the Labor Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Price Index, the so-called core inflation rate,
rose just 0.2 percent last month after an identical increase in
October. This is the fifth consecutive month of this modest
reading. So far this year, the inflation rate is rising at an
annual rate of 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. consumers have got benefits from the world economic
chaos, which has sent the prices of a number of goods, including
oil, down to their lowest levels in a decade. Although food prices
rose slightly by 0.1 percent in November, the prices of
vegetables, oranges, pork and poultry all showed declines.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 15 (Xinhua) -- China will try to repeat their
victory at last year's Asian Women's Soccer Championships when
they meet DPR Korea again in Thursday's Asiad soccer final.
</P>
<P>
China booked their berth in the final after beating Japan 3-0
in a one-sided match which saw the Chinese team totally outplayed
their Japanese opponents.
</P>
<P>
Just 9 minutes into the match, Sun Qiming opened the scoring
for the Chinese team while captain Sun Wen assisted forward Jin
Yan for the second goal some 23 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
The third goal of the match came minutes into the second half
when veteran Liu Ailing beat the Japanese defenders and
goal-keeper several meters in front of the goal.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Ma Yuanan was satisfied with his players'
performance but warned they should take the DPR Korean team
seriously in the final.
</P>
<P>
In last year's Asian Championships, China beat DPR Korea 2-0
for the title.
</P>
<P>
The DPR Korean team entered the Asiad final after beating
Chinese Taipei 6-5 with a penalty shoot-out. The two teams fought

<HEADLINE> Canadian Secondary HIV Victims Get Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Canadians infected with the HIV
from tainted blood will each receive 240,000 Canadian dollars
(156,000 U.S.dollars) in compensation, the Ottawa Citizen
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The federal-provincial government compensation scheme could
cost 48 million Canadian dollars (31 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The lump-sum payments will go to a group of people, the
"secondarily infected," who have often been overlooked in the
tainted-blood tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this decade, federal and provincial governments
provided compensation packages for AIDS victims who got the
disease directly from blood supplies.
</P>
<P>
The federal package gave 120,000 Canadian dollars (78,000
U.S. dollars) over four years, while a provincial scheme
guaranteed 30,000 Canadian dollars (21,000 U.S. dollars) a year
for life.
</P>
<P>
But those who were secondarily infected did not qualify for
either program and have waged a persistent campaign ever since for
similar treatment.
</P>
<P>
Johanne Decarie, who lives in Hawkeshury, east of Ottawa, has
been at the forefront in pushing for extended compensation.
</P>
<P>
Decarie was infected with tainted blood in 1985. Later, she
unknowingly infected her husband, Bill, and gave birth to an
HIV-positive girl, Billie Jo, now nine years old.
</P>
<P>
"I'm relieved they will finally be recognized as victims of a
system that failed them," she said, "It's been a long wait, a long
battle."

made concerning what the special economic zone would be able to
achieve in 20 years. He said the deeping of reform has allowed
other Chinese cities to the narrow gaps and virtually reduce for
economic zones.
</P>
<P>
The city urgently needs to upgrade its industries and
accelerate urban construction, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
"Shenzhen is currently drafting plans for the construction of
the Futian downtown area. The new area will include a 320,000
sq.m. square and will rank second only to Tian'anmen Square in
terms of size." said Zhang, "The city is expected to allocate
several hundred million yuan for the project."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
attended today's national conference on finance and noted that
China's economic development during 1999 will depend on public
finance.
</P>
<P>
The fulfillment of budgeted revenues and expenditures for 1999
will be vitally important for strengthening the relationship
between reform, development and stability, said Li.
</P>
<P>
China must carry out an active fiscal policy in order to
increase domestic demand and ensure moderate economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Top priority should be placed on ensuring adequate funding for
infrastructure projects and fulfilling budgeted targets for
expenditures. General purpose funding should be reduced by a wide
margin, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He called on financial departments at all levels to alter
operating concepts, find new sources of revenue and reduce
expenditures in order to fulfill financial tasks set for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Reform of tax collection management will be proceed in a
rational manner, and the government faces a significant risk
related to the practice of redefining fees as taxes.
</P>
<P>
The leader said effective measures must be adopted to introduce
a tax system suited to the development of a socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
Departments of finance, taxation and planning should join in a
three-year campaign to devise a system which will halt
collection of illicit fees, according to Li.

<HEADLINE> Euro Expected to Promote Sino-European Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The euro, which will be
launched on New Year's Day 1999, is expected to greatly promote
trade between China and all European nations, including members of
the Europan Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Experts attending today's opening session of an international
seminar on the possible impact the euro will have on the Chinese
economy and financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Yang Zilin, vice president of the China Industrial and
Commercial Bank (CICB), addressed the long-term point of view and
noted that the euro will have a positive impact on Sino-European
trade relations. He also noted that a stable and reliable euro
will provide a good vehicle for the further development of
Sino-European trade.
</P>
<P>
He added that the emerging euro will provide greater
convenience for Sino-European trade settlements, reduce risks
related to exchange rate risks and lower risk management costs.
</P>
<P>
"The euro will also help alleviate China's overdependence on
Sino-U.S. trade, and help to develop a more diversified foreign
trade structure needed to increase exports," according to Yang.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Wenming, director of the European Division under the
International Trade Institute in Beijing, said the euro will
simplify trade settlements between China and the EU and in turn
reduce costs and risks related to exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
"It will be no longer necessary for Chinese enterprises to
open offices in all EU countries, with a single office serving the
needs of all EU members," said Zhou, adding that expanding role of
the euro in trade settlements will reduce China's dependence on
the US dollar.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for the first nine months of this year show that the
total trade volume between China and EU countries hit 33.89
billion US dollars, up 16.6 percent on the 1997 period. The export
volume grew 21.7 percent to end the period at 20.27 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The EU ranks as China's fourth largest export market and second
largest supplier for imported goods.
</P>
<P>
Yang said the euro will also help EU members increase
investments in China and allow the latter to expand its
participation in the European capital market.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese enterprises will be able to make better use of the
unified European capital market by issuing bonds in euro to raise
funds at a comparatively low cost. Qualified listed enterprises
can also issue shares to raise funds on the European capital
market," according to Yang.
</P>
<P>
The experts also pointed possible unfavorable influences the
euro will have on Sino-European trade, including intensified
regional protectionism, increased costs for enterprise upgrades
and risks involving exchange rates.

<HEADLINE> China Wins Two Volleyball Golds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 15 (Xinhua) -- China became the biggest
winner in Asiad volleyball matches as its men's and women's teams
defeated their archrivals South Korea in both finals on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the women's final, the Chinese spikers took revenge of the
South Korean team, who beat China in the 1994 Hiroshima Asian
Games and last month's world championship in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese overpowered the South Korean team 3-1 in last
Friday's preliminary round match. But despite the victory, Lang
Ping, the Chinese head coach, said that neither of the two teams
has the absolute power to win the gold.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's match proved what she said, as the two fought a hard
battle before the Chinese won 15-6, 13-15, 15-8 and 15-13.
</P>
<P>
"The South Korean team is great in controlling the rhythm,"
Lang said after the match, "but our players also made the best
performance."
</P>
<P>
"We met our expectation," said Lang, who was famous as the
spiker of Chinese team when it took five successive titles in
World Championship, World Cup and Olympic Games in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In the third place playoff, Japan beat host Thailand for the
bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese men's team, as the newly-crowned Asian champions,
won a much easier match against South Korea 15-7, 15-11, 10-15 and
15-9.
</P>
<P>
The head coach, Wang Jiawei, who was also a spiker, said though
as the champion of Asia, China will not remain what they are.
</P>
<P>
"Instead, we will march on, march on to the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, according to Yuan Weimin, President of the Asian
Volleyball Federation, volleyball in Asia is becoming weaker, as
"the best men's team in Asia only holds the 13th place in the
world."
</P>
<P>
In the bronze medal match earlier on Tuesday, Chinese Taipei
defeated defending champion Japan 3-2.

<P>
Their men compatriots, winners in the Asian Championships and
the best Asian squad ranked 13th in the World Championship, also
swept aside South Korea 15-7, 15-11, 10-15 and 15-9 to regain the
title lost to Japan four years ago in Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
"We're gald that our volleyball players have regained their
Asian titles, but we cannot indulge ourselves in the victories as
we still do not have the clear dominance in Asia," said Yuan
Weimin, former head coach for the Chinese women team who currently
serves as the president of the Asian Volleyball Federation.
</P>
<P>
"Winning the Asian Games is not the end but the beginning for
our men volleyball players," said head coach Wang Jiawei, a former
ace spiker who took the helm of the national team after the
Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
In another team event of the day, the Chinese quartet of Wang
Haibin, Dong Zhaozhi, Lin Liang and Liu Yuntao outbeat their
Japanese peers 45-35 to take the men's team foil fencing title.
</P>
<P>
However, from the track and field which produced the most of
six golds of the day, China bagged home two through its women
athletes while Japan got three, all through its men competitors.
</P>
<P>
After three-day competitions, China still lags behind 8-9 in
the gold tally against Japan in the athletics where 23 out of 43
gold medals have been grabbed away.
</P>
<P>
Li Xuemei and Koji Ito, winners in the women's and men's 100
meters respectively, anchored vicotries for their countries in the
4x100m relays on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Li led the Chinese women's quartet to the win in 43.36 seconds
because "we are much stronger than the others and I am very
confident despite a weak health after being hospitalized for the
whole last night due to a fever."
</P>
<P>
Koji, who set an Asian record of 10.00 seconds in the men's
100m semifinals, sealed the win for the Japanese foursome in 38.91
while the Chinese was out of rhythm in the third batch.
</P>
<P>
China had its other athletics gold through 39-year-old Li Meisu
in the women's shot put who once retired in 1988 and backed to the
field last year, while Japan won two more through Yasunori
Uchitomi in the 3,000m steeplechase and Masaki Morinaga in the
long jump.
</P>
<P>
However the most golds for Japan were from the women's karatedo
where they swept all four but one as Atsuko Wakai got the kata
title, Eri Fugioka triumphed in the 53-kg kumite and Izumi Nabeki
won the over 60-kg kumite, with Li Wan-Yu of Chinese Taipei
crowned in the 60-kg kumite.
</P>
<P>
The table tennis remains to be a Chinese castle as Wan Nan won
the women's singles in an all-Chinese final against Li Ju and Liu
Guoliang and Kong Linghui outwitted their South Korean rivals in
straight sets in the men's doubles.
</P>
<P>
In the cycling sprint semifinals of the day, China has ensured
a gold and a silver in the women's event while Japan was also
guaranteed a one-two finish in the men's final.
</P>
<P>
The women's semifinals witnessed two contests between China and
Chinese Taipei, and China triumphed as Wang Yan beat Lu Yi-Wen
while Jiang Cuihua defeated Fang Fen-Fang.
</P>
<P>
The men's sprints featured two professionals of Yuichiro
Kamiyama and Noriaki Mabuchi who triumphed for an inner bickerning
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With all the competitions concluded on Tuesday, China stands
lonely in the gold tally with 92, while South Korea who reapt only
three, ranked in a distant second with 45, closely chased by Japan
with 42.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Australian Economy Grows Strongly in Face of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Howard government has managed to turn a budget deficit of
6.3 billion U.S. dollars into a surplus this year by savagely
slashing government expenditure during the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Six interest rate cuts over the past two years by the central
bank have brought the country's interest rates to 4.75 percent,
the lowest level since the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Besides the prudent fiscal policy, low interest rates, low
inflation, and transparent financial and legal systems have all
helped the country's economy fireproof the Asian economic storm.
</P>
<P>
The figures released earlier this month by the Australian
Bureau of Statistics indicated that the economic growth
essentially came from two areas: strong domestic plant and
equipment investments and strong retail sales.
</P>
<P>
The Australia Housing Industry Association Ltd said the value
of work done on new residential buildings in the country was
expected to rise by 17 percent to 10 billion U.S. dollars in 1998,
while non-residential building activity was estimated to have
increased by 3 percent to 8.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Lower interest rates have also boosted the demand for
residential houses as it is cheaper to borrow money from banks to
buy houses.
</P>
<P>
The diversification of export markets by Australia's exporters
and the devaluation of the Australian dollar played an important
role in absorbing the negative impact of the Asian crisis on their
exports.
</P>
<P>
Australia registered an increase of 2.7 percent in the export
of goods and services in the first nine months of this year over
the same period of the last year, following an 8.2 percent growth
in its overall export of goods and services in the past financial
year ending on June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Australian exports to Southeast Asia fell by 6.2 percent, the
first slump in at least a decade, but increases in exports to the
U.S. and Europe and other new markets helped offset the fall to
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Australia's food exports climbed by 4.8 percent in the
financial year from the previous year's 10.8 billion U.S. dollars,
while exports to Asian economies rose by 1.9 percent to 6.24
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The country's minerals and energy sector continued its growth
in export revenues in the third quarter of this year by increasing
about one percent to 6.82 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists from Southeast and Northeast Asia
slumped by 17 percent during the first 10 months of this year,
while the total number of tourists coming to Australia dropped by
4.5 percent over the same period of last year to 3.3 million as
the growth in the number of tourists from the U.S. and Europe made
up some of the Asian losses.
</P>
<P>
The number of overseas students studying in Australia, who
contribute 2.1 billion U.S. dollars to Australia's economy each
year, was up by 14.6 percent to 72,183 in 1998, of which 62,689
students were from Asia.
</P>
<P>
But the central bank governor Tuesday warned Australia against
complacency, saying that in the face of an average slower world
growth predicted by the International Monetary Fund, Australia's
economic growth was likely to slow down.

<HEADLINE> Commentary Calls for Enhanced Management on Taxation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- A Xinhua commentary published
today urged China's taxation departments to tighten management on
tax collection according to law so as to accomplish the task of
increasing the tax income by 100 billion yuan by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Taxation is a major source of state revenue. Taxation
departments in the country should implement the principle of
"Enhancing tax collection and management, stopping up loopholes,
clearing balance due and punishing corruption", the commentary
said.
</P>
<P>
The volume of business tax collected across the country up the
end of last month increased by 80 billion yuan, or 12 percent
rise, compared with the same period of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
It was achieved by close cooperation between governments at
various levels and taxation departments and exposure of major
cases of tax crimes, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some localities still practise fraud, falsify
accounts and make false entry or payment. Some leading government
officials urged local governments to punish said deeds as a kind
of corruption.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Australian Economy Grows Strongly in Face of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Australia, the 14th largest
economy in the world which has close economic and trade links with
Asia, has in the past 18 months weathered the Asian economic
crisis far better than most people had predicted.
</P>
<P>
Ian Macfarlane, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, the
country's central bank, predicted Tuesday the Australian economy
would grow by 4 percent in 1998 over the previous year, compared
with 3 percent he forecast earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released earlier this month by the
Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Australian economy grew by 5
percent in the year to September with inflation around 1.8 percent
and the jobless rate at an eight-year low of 7.7 percent in
October, and 8 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
The Australian economy was up by 3.9 percent in the past
financial year ending on June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor admitted Tuesday that "Australia's
economic performance has exceeded our expectations, and, to the
best of my knowledge, the expectations of virtually all
forecasters."
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard recently also expressed
his surprise at the strength of the economy.
</P>
<P>
"We are enjoying economic growth which is even stronger than
the more optimistic of us thought possible six or nine months
ago," he said.
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, however, the Australian federal government
and leading economic forecasters painted a gloomy picture when
Asia, Russia and Latin America were in economic turmoil and the
United States' economy seemed to slow down.
</P>
<P>
They warned of slower growth in the Australian economy, rising
inflation and unemployment, arguing that the crisis would lead to
weak demand for Australian products from Asia, which buys about 60
percent of the goods and services Australia exports annually.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they said the weak Australian currency, which has
fallen by about 20 percent against the U.S. dollar since the
crisis, would push up inflation as the prices of many imported
consumer goods would go up.
</P>
<P>
Against such a background, the government in September revised
down its forecast of the growth rate for the current financial
year ending on June 60, 1999, cutting the forecast to 2.75 percent
from its budget target of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The original forecast, which was made two months before the
eruption of the Asian crisis, was 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Even the 2.75 percent forecast was once considered too
optimistic by some economists.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank, the country's biggest bank, was then
among the most pessimistic about the economy, predicting an
economic growth of just 1.75 percent for this financial year.
</P>
<P>
The latest official economic figures, however, portrayed a
totally different picture.
</P>
<P>
Government officials and the central bank attributed the strong
economic performance to the sound economic management of the
Howard government, strong domestic demand, diversified export
strategy and the country's floating foreign exchange system.

<HEADLINE> UK Cautious on Report of Lockerbie Trial in Neutral Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom on Tuesday
cautiously welcomed reports that the Libyan People's Congress had
agreed to try the two Libyan suspects of the Lockerbie bombing in
a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
"If it is true, it is good news. But at the moment it is only
a Libyan media report. We have to be circumspect unless and until
we have a formal response," said a Foreign Office spokesman,
adding that Libya must make a formal response through the office
of the U.N. Secretary-General.
</P>
<P>
Reuters reported earlier that the Libyan People's Congress, the
country's top legislative body, had expressed its agreement with a
plan for trying the two Libyan men in a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
The congress also called on the three parties involved in the
case -- Libya, Britain and the United States, to "remove any
obstacle" preventing the trial from going ahead as soon as
possible, the Reuters report quoted the Libyan television as
saying.
</P>
<P>
On December 21, 1988, a Pan Am airplane was bombed over the
Scottish town of Lockerbie, killing 270 people. The United States
and Britain accused two Libyan agents of planning and blowing up
the airliner.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the three relevant countries agreed to let
Scottish judges try the two suspects at a special court in the
Hague, Netherlands. But Libya latter refused to hand over the two
for alleged safety reasons.

<HEADLINE> China to Play Tough Semifinal Match Against Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Red cards will probably take
the Chinese toll in the Asian Games soccer semifinals Wednesday
when China faces Iran in their second encounter in five days at
the Asian Games soccer competition.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team, which brought a largely young squad to the
games, is still looking to avenge a pair of defeats against Iran
that kept the Chinese out of the World Cup in France this year.
</P>
<P>
However, in last week's preliminary round match, Iran defeated
China 2-1. The Englishman coaching China, Bobby Houghton, said
that most of his players hadn't been called to the national side
until recently and have no inherent defeatist complex against
Iran.
</P>
<P>
But the absence of ace Chinese striker Hao Haidong, who scored
a goal Monday against Turkmenistan but was sent off after
disputing a yellow card, could fatally weaken China in what would
always have been a tough game.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese will rely on the scoring talents of Li Jinyu, who
put in the other two goals in the 3-0 shutout of Turkmenistan for
a games total of six, but are again likely to suffer against the
bigger, bruising Iranians in mid-field.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian side, packed with World Cup veterans, has clearly
emerged as the favorite for gold.
</P>
<P>
In the other semifinals, host Thailand will take on Kuwait.
Thai Manager Thawatchai Sajakul told a news conference Tuesday
that Thailand's stunning quarterfinal triumph over South Korea was
a "miracle" that could be repeated and take Thailand to the
finals.

<HEADLINE> China Closer to Title Sweep in Table Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The all-mighty Chinese table
tennis team proved too strong for the rest of Asia as they
boosted their title collection to five in the Asian Games here
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
World and Olympic champions Kong Linghui and Liu Guoliang
easily won the men's doubles following the 1-2 finish by Chinese
at the women's singles.
</P>
<P>
Kong and Liu, who have been nearly invincible since pairing
up in 1995, handed a 21-17, 21-13 defeat to the South Korean duo
of Lee Chul-Seung and Oh Sang-Eun.
</P>
<P>
Liu's wickedly deceptive serves and Kong's follow-up attacks
were just too much for the South Koreans, who made the final by
nipping Chiang Peng-Lung and Chang Yen-Shu from Chinese Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Chiang and Chang finished joint third with their teammates Wu
Wen-Chia and Kuo Chih-Hsiang.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, world No. 3 Wang Nan downed No. 2 Li Ju in the
all-Chinese women's singles final.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Wang, who has won the World Cup twice, both at
the expense of Li, triumphed 21-14, 21-10, 21-10.
</P>
<P>
In the semifinals, Wang downed South Korean Ryu Ji-Hae and Li
beat 1996 Olympic silver medalist Chen Jing of Chinese Taipei,
both in four sets.
</P>
<P>
Ryu and Chen shared the third place.
</P>
<P>
Li and Wang reached the women's doubles semifinals on Tuesday,
beating the DPR Korean pair of Tu Jung-Sil and Wi Pok-Sun in three
sets.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's top duo of Park Hae-Jung and Kim Moo-Kyo
suffered an upset by Xu Jing and Chen Chiu-Tan of Chinese
Taipei, while the Chinese combination of Yang Ying and Wu Na
also crashed out, losing to South Korea's Ryue Ji-Hae and Lee
Eun-Sil in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
The other semifinal berth went to Chan Tan-Lui and Song
Ah-Sim from Hong Kong, China, who beat Japanese An Konishi and
Keiko Okazaki.
</P>
<P>
World No. 2 Liu Guoliang and No. 3 Kong Linghui both made the
men's singles semifinals. They will take on South Koreans Oh
Sang-Eun and Kim Taek Soo on Wednesday.
</P>

China has also won the men's and women's team titles and the
mixed doubles top honor.

AMMAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright promised Tuesday to provide Jordan with 200
million U.S. dollars in security assistance in addition to some
250 million dollars of annual economic aid.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who is in Amman to brief Jordanian leaders on U.S
President Bill Clinton's Middle East trip, reiterated
U.S. commitments to creating more economic opportunities for the
Jordanian people, adding that her country would also strive to
meet Jordan's security needs.
</P>
<P>
She said at a press conference that she had briefed Jordanian
Crown Prince Hassan, the Regent, on the latest developments in the
Mideast peace process, the just-concluded summit meetings between
President Clinton, Israeli and Palestinian leaders and Clinton's
visit to Gaza, the first-ever visit to Palestinian self-rule areas
by a U. S. president.
</P>
<P>
Hassan thanked the U.S government for its efforts to revive the
peace process between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Albright also paid tribute to what she called "courageous
roles" played by Jordanian King Hussein and the Jordanian
government in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Albright was scheduled to return to Israel later in the day to
join Clinton's entourage on a flight back home.
</P>

Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, is a
supporter of U.S. peace efforts in the Middle East.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League soccer
club Newcastle United confirmed Tuesday that it has been
approached about a possible 160 million pounds takeover bid for
the company.
</P>
<P>
The club did not name the company involved in the approach but
rumours suggesting Sony Corporation is the bidder.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle told the London Stock Exchange that any bid would
not proceed until the outcome of the merger inquiry into BSkyB's
takeover of Manchester United was known.
</P>
<P>
This suggests another media company may be the potential
bidder -some of which are known to be interested in Premier
League club ownership as a counter to BSkyB in future TV rights
carve-ups.
</P>
<P>
Media companies Granada, Carlton, United News &AMP; Media and Time
Warner of the United States have all been speculated as possible
bidders, along with local firm Scottish &AMP; Newcastle Breweries.
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, some analysts say controversial directors
Freddie Shepherd and Douglas Hall, majority shareholders in the
club, may be preparing a bid that would privatise the company in
their hands again.
</P>
<P>
Sports minister Tony Banks told the BBC that he had some
concerns about the possible deal and said that the government was
bound to launch an investigation into any takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
He said that football takeovers were inevitable once the clubs
joined the stock market. However Mr. Banks told the BBC: "The
football fans feel that they are not involved in the process
whatsoever. As a football fan as well as a sports minister, I
don't really believe that football can be treated like any other
economic product...to be bought and sold like motor cars of
refrigerators.There is more passion involved."
</P>
<P>
Ongoing rumours surrounding ownership of the club had earlier
resurfaced with the Daily Mail newspaper reporting that Sony had
made a 160p per share bid last week.
</P>
<P>
Shares in the club jumped 15% in early trade on the
rumours,prompting the club to make a statement to the stock
exchange.
</P>
<P>
The statement said: "The company confirms that a preliminary
approach has been made which may or may not lead to an offer for
the club."
</P>
<P>
The club said it understood that any offer would not be much
over 110p a share.

<HEADLINE> Absent Di Canio Suffering Depression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Italian player Paulo Di Canio
has failed to meet Sheffield Wednesday's deadline for his return
after suspension.
</P>
<P>
Di Canio, expected to return to Premiership action on Boxing
Day after his 11-game ban for pushing referee Paul Alcock, is
still in Italy after being granted permission to oversee his
family's return to England from Rome.
</P>
<P>
But since last week he has been absent without leave, claiming
he is suffering from stress and depression, and Wednesday have
admitted his continued absence means a serious doubt is gathering
over his Christmas date against Leicester at Hillsborough.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday manager Danny Wilson said: "He is not back from
Italy yet, and quite frankly I am not sure when he will be."
</P>
<P>
Hillsborough secretary Graham Mackrell, meanwhile, has
confirmed exactly how far out of step the 30-year-old is with the
schedule Wednesday had set for him.
</P>
<P>
"Paolo was expected to return to us from Italy last week. He
has not done so," Mackrell told The Sun newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"We have received a medical certificate from the player
stating he is unable to travel at the moment.
</P>
<P>
"We have requested, through his lawyer, he returns as soon as
possible to be examined by our medical staff.
</P>
<P>
"There is little more than a week left before our Boxing Day
game at home to Leicester. Paolo is available for that match
after his suspension.
</P>
<P>
"But, if he does not come back soon, his participation must be
in serious doubt," he said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Further Promote Financial Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS) said Tuesday that its efforts to promote
Singapore's financial sector were reaping results and it will step
up its drive to boost Singapore's standing as a premier financial
center.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Tan Chek Ming, executive
director of the Financial Sector Promotion Department (FPD) under
the MAS said despite the regional crisis and the slower economic
growth in the past year, there has been positive development in
the Singapore financial sector.
</P>
<P>
More key financial players were expanding their activities in
Singapore and more than a dozen financial institutions and
multinationals have obtained approval from MAS in the past year to
base their operational headquarters and finance and treasury
centers in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tan said that total treasury revenue for the first half of this
year hit 2.8 billion Singapore dollars (about 1.7 billion U.S.
dollars), already more than half of last year's figure of 4.6
billion Singapore dollars (about 2.8 billion U.S. dollars.)
</P>
<P>
Tan also mentioned that the Singapore International Money
Exchange attracted an average daily trading volume of around
99,200 contracts in the first three quarters of this year,
compared with 94,000 contracts in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The FPD led by Tan was set up in April 1998 and has been
assigned to foster a progressive financial sector, to enhance the
IT infrastructure and develop manpower capability for the
industry.
</P>
<P>
According to Tan, FPD's efforts covered asset management, debt
market, bond, equity, and insurance and they were focused on
external communications, monitoring systems, employment monitoring
and clearing and settlement systems.
</P>
<P>
Tan said his country will press ahead with financial reforms to
ensure a strong and conducive economic and financial systems.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Singapore carried out financial reforms through
shifting from regulation to supervision, exercising risk-focused
supervision and enhancing transparency while private sector
participation and multi-agency networking were encouraged.
</P>
<P>
Tan also said MAS will set up overseas promotion offices in New
York and London respectively in a bid to continue the momentum
toward broadening and deepening Singapore's financial sector.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore publicly
appealed to House Republican leaders on Monday to consider any
"compromise" to head off the fateful impeachment vote slated for
later this week even as the president's support eroded among
critical swing members with time running short.
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton gave a powerful boost to the cause of
Palestinian sovereignty on Monday as he became the first U.S.
president to travel to Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- As the House vote on impeachment drew closer, the ranks of
Republicans supporting President Bill Clinton's impeachment grew
on Monday and in a more ominous sign for the White House, some of
the few Republicans who have long been on the record against the
impeachment drive began to waver.
</P>
<P>
-- With President Bill Clinton as their witness, hundreds of
former Palestinian guerrilla fighters voted in Gaza on Monday to
rid their organization's charter of any clauses calling for the
destruction of Israel, knocking down a critical roadblock on the
rutted path of peace.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Royal Dutch/Shell said it would post a 4.5 billion
U.S. dollar write-off in its fourth quarter, unveiling a major
restructuring that appears to take the oil giant out of the
industry's merger trend.
</P>
<P>
-- There is a new wave of foreign takeovers of American
companies, but it isn't stirring up much of anything. While the
Japanese shopping spree provoked headlines like Newsweek's 1987
cover, "Your Next Boss may Be Japanese," the latest round of
foreign investment has sparked only small and scattered protests.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wen
Jiabao today urged the Bank of China (BOC) to assist the
government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) in
maintaining its economic growth and make all necessary
preparations for the return of Macao to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Wen praised the role the Bank of China has played in helping
maintain a stable financial market in Hong Kong and Macao and
boosting their economic development over the past years.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a discussion attended by participants to
the Bank's annual Conference concerning Hong Kong and Macao held
in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of China serves as a major commercial bank in China
and one of the Banknote-issuing banks in Hong Kong. Its branch in
Hong Kong should stick to the principle of not interfering in the
internal affairs and authority of Hong Kong and rendering whatever
help it can if it is needed, Wen said.
</P>
<P>
As the largest financial institute in Macao, the Macao branch
of the BOC serves as a major factor in maintaining the stability
of Macao, he said, hoping the branch will implement all China's
policies governing the return of Macao and make even active role
in its economic development.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 15 (Xinhua) -- China and South Korea both
enjoyed easy vicotries Tuesday in the quarterfinal round
competitions and ensured their semifinals berths with a perfect
record of 2-0.
</P>
<P>
The defending champions China trounced Kazakhstan 106-55 while
South Korea, silver medalist in last Asian Games in Hiroshima,
beat the United Arab Emirates 106-51.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines saw their dream of retaining the Asiad hoop
gold in 36 years almost ended before the semifinal when the all
amateur Thai players netted five 3-pointer to force a 36-all tie
at the inverval after a seesaw battle in the first half.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines team are good in their skills but lack of the
NBA sizes over their Thai rivals,
</P>
<P>
But the more experinced Philippines pros dominated the second
half as A. Caidic, who turned 27 on Monday, hit two 3-pointers to
spark a 19-5 run to give the Filipinos a steady lead of 57-43 in
the mid of the second half and finally won the game in 86-60.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions China had a much easier job on Tuesday as
they jumped to a 17-7 lead just five minutes into the game and
built up a 53-25 half-time lead with fastbreaking and strong
inside attackings.
</P>
<P>
Liu Qiang's two free throws gave China its biggest lead of
103-53 and Zhang Wenqi nailed a three-pointer on the buzzer to
lift China to the 53-points margin win in Group A of the
quarterfinal round.
</P>
<P>
Sun Jun, who is 5 for 5 in the feild and 2 for 2 behind the
arc, scored 16 points to lead six Chinese players in double
figures. China also outshot Kazakhstan 10-1 on the long range.
</P>
<P>
South Korea used a balanced attacking to beat the UAE by 55
points. The South Korea shot 60% in the feild and outrebounded the
UAE 27-15 for their second consecuitive win in Group B of the
quarterfinal round.
</P>
<P>
With two wins each, China and South Korea have ensured their
semifinal berths with one game in hand each.

<HEADLINE> Algerian New Prime Minister Appointed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Liamine
Zeroual Tuesday appointed National Assembly member Ismail Hamdani
as New Prime Minister to replace Ahmed Ouyahia who has resigned.
</P>
<P>
According to well-informed sources, Hamdani is expected to
present his list of cabinet ministers to President Zeroual early
next week.
</P>
<P>
Daily "Al Khabar" quotes the official sources as saying that
the new cabinet will be composed of the previous ruling coalition
with some changes.
</P>
<P>
The reports added that Ouyahia's resignation came immediately
after the National People's Assembly strongly criticized his
government's failure to implement the policy it had submitted to
the legislative assembly last year.
</P>
<P>
Ouyahia was appointed as Prime Minister in December, 1995 after
his National Democratic Rally won 155 seats in the 380-member
parliament in the elections.
</P>
<P>
He was believed as a close associate of Zeroual in implementing
the policies of economic reforms and suppressing terrorist groups
in the past years.
</P>
<P>
The sources further stated that the new government will present

The sources point out that the new government program focuses
on preparations for the presidential elections besides discharging
public affairs and preparing for the convocation of a scheduled
summit conference of the Organization of African Unity.

<HEADLINE> Polling Industry Benefits Ordinary Chinese Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Baolan, a beauty
consultant working for a Beijing cosmetics company, pays close
attention to market surveys conducted by the local media.
</P>
<P>
"Surveys provide valuable information related to popular
products. I'm convinced that surveys are much more reliable than
advertisements." said Zhou.
</P>
<P>
She said clients with higher education levels are more likely
to monitor market surveys.
</P>
<P>
Zhou's comments are substantiated by the fact that the number
of ordinary citizens exhibiting interest in statistics has
increased significantly over the past five years in line with
expanded media coverage.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Yue, chairman of the Horizon Market survey Co., said that
ordinary Chinese citizens used to depend simply on intuition
and experience, but have gradually learned to use statistics
when making consumption decisions.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's polling industry has maintained
an annual growth rate of over 100 percent since 1985.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, Close to 800 of the 2,000 polling agencies
in place by the end of 1997 conducted market surveys.
</P>
<P>
Over half of companies operated by government institutions,
multinational companies and branches of the media are based in big
cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 700 nongovernmental companies account for
over 80 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The highly efficient small companies enjoy a promising future
based on a stable market and low operating costs, Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
Various international polling organizations, including Gallup
and Land, are also bullish about the vast potential market in
China.
</P>
<P>
"China's market economy is moving towards globalization. The
current situation leaves something to be desired, but I firmly
believe the industry's prospects will improve along with the
deepening of reform," according to Fang Xiaoguang, vice-chairman
of Gallup (China).

<HEADLINE> China Expects Faster Localization of Macao Civil Servants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official stressed here
on Tuesday that more local Chinese in Macao should be made
directors of government departments, the highest rank in Macao's
civil service.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side noticed that the Portuguese-Macao government
recently appointed some local residents to serve as department
directors, Wang Xi'an, Chinese representative of the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG), said after the meeting
with his Portuguese counterpart.
</P>
<P>
"But we have reminded the Portuguese side that the percentage
of local residents acting as department directors remains fairly
low, and we expect that greater headway can be achieved soon,"
Wang Xi'an said.
</P>
<P>
According to Moitinho de Almeida, Portuguese representative of
the Sino-Portuguese JLG, told reporters that 92 percent of deputy
department directors and division and section chiefs have been
localized, promising that more government departments will be
headed by local residents.
</P>
<P>
There is only one year towards Macao's handover, so officials
from both countries should make better use of the time left to
complete the localization of civil servants in Macao, localization
of laws and the use of Chinese as an official language, Wang Xi'an
said.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting Tuesday morning, the two representatives
also discussed some legal issues and the official status of
Chinese and Portuguese.

<HEADLINE> China Restructures Futures Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- China has basically fulfilled
this year's targets for regulating the futures market, and will
continue to reduce excessive speculation in order to ensure
further consolidation.
</P>
<P>
Mergers and closures of China's futures exchanges, the focus of
1998 reform, has basically been completed and the number of
exchanges will be reduced from 14 to three in 1999, according to
official with China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), the
nation's securities watchdog.
</P>
<P>
Three futures exchanges -- Shanghai, Zhengzhou and Dalian --
will continue operations.
</P>
<P>
The number of commodities traded on related markets will be
slashed from 35 to 12 and the guarantee margin will be raised from
five percent to ten percent, according to reform plans.
</P>
<P>
China launched futures markets in the early 1990s, with related
markets experiencing rapid development due to the absence of a
complete legal framework. The number of exchanges hit a peak of
60, with the number of commodities traded falling just short of 50.
</P>
<P>
The rampant speculation which accompanied rapid and poorly
regulated development pushed the prices of some futures contracts
to irrational levels and contributed to runaway inflation in 1993
and 1994 by driving prices on spot markets.
</P>
<P>
Related events prompted the government to introduce drastic
measures to regulate the market, with related efforts gradually
reducing the number of exchanges and commodity items to the
current level.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that China will focus on improving the legal
framework governing the futures market, standardizing operations
of futures exchanges and restructuring brokerages.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged sluggishness of markets has forced many futures
brokerages to close, with the number of firms dropping from a high
of over 1,000 to only 200.

<HEADLINE> Problems in South Asia Can Be Solved Through Economic Ties: Gujral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Former Indian prime minister
I. K. Gujral said Tuesday that most of the problems facing the
South Asian countries can be effectively resolved through
accelerated economic ties and setting up of free trade zones in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on "Indo-Pak Media Dialogue" organized by
the National Media Center here, Gujral said that economics and not
politics should be the guiding force behind the policies of India,
Pakistan and other countries in the region as everyone would gain
from cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"There is a high desirability for free trade zones in the
sub-continent which would not only facilitate economic activities
among countries but also lead to increased mobility of people and
interaction among them," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the problems in the region including Kashmir issue
would be solved with trade activities, industrial tie-up and
investment beyond borders which would melt away growing mistrust,"
he further said.
</P>
<P>
Transformation in the region would not be possible without free
trade and spread of education. Right to education itself would
play a key role in sorting out most of the problems, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes Foreign Help For Flood Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- China now has a considerable
market for advanced water technology and equipment which it will
need to combat any future problems, Zhang Chunyuan, vice minister
of China's water resources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Following the worst flooding in 40 years this summer, which
devastated large tracts of the country, Chinese water experts are
keen to exchange ideas with their foreign counterparts on how to
improve their technology and equipment when they meet up during
next year's 'Water Expo China '99'.
</P>
<P>
Officials and technicians from nearly 20 countries, including
Germany, India, Australia and the Netherlands, are expected to
attend the expo according to Zhang who announced details of the
event today.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two months of flooding this summer had cost
the country 239.7 billion yuan in direct economic losses and had
revealed the inherent weaknesses in the country's water resources
technologies.
</P>
<P>
"China has increased spending on water conservation and will
actively use modern technology and equipment for flood defense
works, flood monitoring and forecasting, emergency management,
preventing disasters, waste water purification and in numerous
other fields," he said.
</P>
<P>
And he revealed that professional teams involved in water
projects will be encouraged to attend the show, which will take
place in November next year.
</P>
<P>
Li Changfan, vice chairman of the expo's organizing
committee, who is also a water ministry official, announced that
China is reviewing its action plan for water conservation which
will allow more projects to be launched over the coming years.
</P>
<P>
"This new plan should be ready by November next year in time
for the expo and demonstrates China's huge need for international
cooperation in terms of handling its water resources." he added.

MANILA, December 15 (Xinhua) - The Department of Labor and
Employment of the Philippines Tuesday urged all concerned sectors
to "keep up the fight" against child labor.
</P>
<P>
On launching an inter-agency quick action program on responding
to child labor cases, Bienvenido Laguesma, secretary of Labor and
Employment, said the program needs the support of international
institutions, non-government organizations, private sectors,
churches and socio-civic groups.
</P>
<P>
Other government officials said the move against child labor
also includes the creation of the National Child Labor Program,
which integrates the efforts of the government, the United Nations
Children's Fund and the International Labor Organization.
</P>
<P>
During the period 1993-1997, Philippine government agencies
mounted a total of 98 rescue operations, resulting in the rescue
of 317 minors employed as factory or construction workers, store
or house helpers and guest relations officers among others.
</P>

These child workers, after being rescued, are provided adequate
services, including livelihood assistance, health and

<HEADLINE> No Significant Progress Made in Three-Way Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The stalemate in the
implementation of the Wye peace accord failed to be broken at a
Tuesday summit of U.S. President Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat
</P>
<P>
After the 90-minute meeting at the Erez border crossing, the
three leaders failed to hold a joint conference, with Arafat
walking away without addressing and Netanyahu intransigently
sticking to his previous position. Clinton was the only one to
describe the three-way summit as "very good."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the Palestinian-Israeli peace accord has been got
back on track. But he added there are still several issues to be
worked out and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will return
to the region soon for further talks.
</P>
<P>
Clinton began a three-day visit to Israel and the Palestinian
self-rule areas Saturday night at a time when Israel and the PNA
ran into a dispute over the release of Palestinian prisoners,
which has incurred violent clashes and the Israeli suspension of
the implementation of the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
The summit is the first meeting of the three leaders since late
October when they hammered out the the Wye Plantation agreement
near Washington.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel should phase out its troops from
another 13 percent of the West Bank within three months in return
for tougher Palestinian actions on Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also provides that Israel releases 750
Palestinian prisoners by the end of January, 1999. Last month, 250
of them were freed, but most were common criminals, not political
prisoners demanded by the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians urged more release of political prisoners, but
Netanyahu holds that he will not free those who killed Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Violent clashes erupted as a result between Palestinian
protesters and Israeli soldiers in the West Bank, killing two
Palestinian youths and injuring 150 others.
</P>
<P>
Under the widespread clashes which were blamed on the PNA by
Israel and pressure from the hardliners in his coalition,
Netanyahu ordered to suspend further troop withdrawal .
</P>
<P>
He insisted there will be no further redeployment until the
Palestinians fulfill all their obligations. He also vowed not to
bow to external pressures to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton said the two sides has agreed to set up a formal
channel to discuss the prisoner issue.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Israel will go ahead with the second-stage troop
withdrawal under the Wye agreement as scheduled Friday, Clinton
said he hopes Israel can carry out the accord in line with the
timetable but stressed that "a lot of issues need to be worked
out."
</P>
<P>
In related development, Israeli media reported before the
summit that the Palestinian Prisoners Association has decided to
continue to organize protests if the issue is not resolved.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Council Monday revoked the clauses in
the Palestinian national charter calling for the destruction of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Despite terming the nullification of anti-Israel clauses "an
important step," Netanyahu still listed a series of demands which
he said the Palestinians have to meet before any further Israeli
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
These demands included the halt of anti-Israeli incitement, the
collection of illegal weapons, the arrest of Palestinian
terrorists and a public announcement by Arafat that he will not
declare a Palestinian state unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
According to Clinton, several steering committees on these
issues have been established at the meeting and they will meet
later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Local observers said it seemed highly unlikely that Netanyahu,
who faces a critical no-confidence motion in the parliament next
week, will carry out the second stage of withdrawals Friday to
anger the hardliners.

<HEADLINE> China Accelerates Urbanization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
today that the development of city groups, proliferation of small
cities and towns, and steady perfection of urban functions have
combined to accelerate the process of China's urbanization.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Construction Ye Rutang noted that vigorous
local economic growth has led to the emergence of city groups
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
He noted that most groups are concentrated in the Yangtze and
Pearl river deltas, as well as on the Liaoning Peninsula and in
the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan area.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that China has established 666 cities,
including 32 cities with populations of over one million people
each. Forty-three cities have population ranging from 500,000 to
one million, 192 medium-sized cities with a population of 200,000
to 500,000 and 399 small cities with less than 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Ye noted that rapid urbanization has also at least to a
certain degree improved the uneven distribution of cities between
eastern and western China. The former region accounts for 44
percent and the latter 19 percent the total number of cities.
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that even more cities are under development in
the vast western region will help to improve economic development
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The steady expansion of urbanization has been accompanied by
the strong growth of public facilities in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the urban gas usage rate has jumped to 60
percent, with the coverage of green space in cities standing
at 22.4 percent. In addition, the per capita living space for
urban residents has jumped to 7.9 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Ye predicted that China will have 800 cities by the year 2000,
with the number of small towns rising to over 60,000. He said
related growth will raise urbanization to an even more rational
level.

BANGKOK, December 15 (Xinhua) -- China secured its fourth
straight table tennis title at the Asian Games here on Tuesday as
world No. 2 and No. 3 Li Ju and Wang Nan beat their rivals in the
women's singles semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Li Ju, who plays an aggressive top spin game, ousted Chen Jing
of Chinese Taipei 22-20, 19-21, 21-11, 21-18, while twice World

</P>
<P>
Li, who will soon take over teammate Deng Yaping as the world
top-ranked player, found some difficulty in the second set as Chen
slowed down the pace with adept blocks.
</P>
<P>
From the third set, Li apparently adapted herself to her
rival's style, completing a 3-1 victory over the 1988 Olympic

<P>
BANGKOK, December 15 (Xinhua) -- World number one Ye Zhaoying
of China slumpped to a shock deafeat to little known Yonekura
Kanako of Japan in the quarter-finals of women's singles at the
Asian Games badminton on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I do not know what happed to me. I just could not concentrate
in the match," said the Chinese who was favored to win the title.
</P>
<P>
Ye, the top-seeded player in the singles event, said that she
was eager to take back the title because this was the best chance
with the withdrawal of her arch-rival Susi Susanti of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Ye got off to a excellent start with a 11-0 win in the first
game. But in the second, the Chinese changed her attacking style
to defensive which cost her the match.
</P>
<P>
Yonekura rallied back thanks to Ye's unforced errors. The
Japanese took the two games 13-10 and 11-9 respectively from 8-10
and 5-9 down in the following two games.
</P>
<P>
Ye was joined by the third seed Mia Audina of Indonesia and
fourth seed Kim Ji-Hyun of South Korea, who were both beaten in
three games by unseeded Lee Joo-Hyun of South Korea and
Eakmongkolpaisarn of Thailand respectively.
</P>
<P>
Eakmongkolpaisarn is the first Thai woman to enter the Games
semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Gong Zhichao of China is the only seeded player surviving the
second round. Gong outclassed NG Mee-Fen from Malaysia 11-7, 11-3
with ease.
</P>
<P>
To make the Chinese more painful, Liu Yong and Ge Fei from
China, who are crowned in mixed doubles in World Championships in
1997, were toppled 15-7, 15-6 by the world number two pairs
Gartabti Ttikus and Timur Minarti of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In the men's singles, top seed Sun Jun of China beat Ahn
Jae-Chang of South Korea 15-9 and 17-14 while his compatroit Dong
Jiong, fouth seeded player, revenged his two losses this season by
smashing 18-year-old Hidayat Taufik of Indonesia 15-5 and 15-13.
</P>
<P>
Sun will take on third-seeded Hendrawan of Indonesia, who
defeated Hashim Roslin of Malaysia, while Dong is to play against

<HEADLINE> Hazardous Wastes Dumped Near Sihanoukville, Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 15 (Xinhua) -- About 3,000 tons of wastes
dumped about 15 km on the outskirts of Sihanoukville were
suspected to contain chemicals hazardous to health.
</P>
<P>
So far, the hazardous wastes had already caused at least three
villagers dead. A pollution-control official also said he had
heard reports of villagers who had scavenged the area suffering
from skin rashes, diarrhea and other symptoms.
</P>
<P>
It was suspected the wastes contain some heavy metals such as
mercury, zinc, chrome or lead that could seriously affect human
health.
</P>
<P>
The wastes were reportedly imported from overseas and dumped
behind a district military police post on the outskirts of
Sihanoukville which is an important watershed and near the Ream
National Park.
</P>
<P>
Environment Minister Mok Mareth called for a parliamentary
investigation and pledged to take the offenders to court.
</P>
<P>
"We will investigate who authorized the import of toxic waste
into Cambodia in this remote area," Mok Mareth said Sunday. "Who
authorized this should be punished. The import of toxic waste is
prohibited in the country."
</P>
<P>
According to the Cambodia Daily, the wastes were shipped in 100
kilogram polyester bags labeled as originating from a plastics
company in Taiwan. The customs documents indicated the shipment
was of construction wastes.
</P>
<P>
"But if it is just construction waste, why spend all the money
for transportation to Cambodia?" Heng Nareth, deputy director of
Cambodia's pollution control department, asked.
</P>
<P>
"Cambodia is not going to become a dumping site for toxic
waste," Mok Mareth said. "If it becomes one, it will kill the
people of this generation."

<P>
MANILA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
set to declare a 45-day ceasefire with the rebel National
Democratic Front-Communist Party starting midnight Tuesday up to
January 20 next year.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo Zamora, secretary of executive, told reporters of the
upcoming truce with the rebels following a meeting of the Office
of the President Executive Committee.
</P>
<P>
Orlando Mercado, secretary of defense, also made clear that the
ceasefire does not cover regular law enforcement activities and
security functions undertaken by the police and military to ensure
peace and order.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has yet to receive indications from the
National Democratic Front-Communist Party of the Philippines-New
People's Army that it will likewise declare a suspension of
offensive military operations.
</P>
<P>
"This is unilateral on the part of government in the spirit of
Christmas, upon the recommendation on the part of the Chief of
Staff of the Armed Forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the ceasefire, the government will suspend
offensive military operations against the party and all its
factions.
</P>
<P>
Mercado confirmed an earlier statement by National Security
Adviser Alexander Aguirre that there is no need for a separate
ceasefire with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in Mindanao
because of an existing truce agreement with the rebel group.

<HEADLINE> Iran Imposes Traffic Restriction Against Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Traffic police in Tehran on
Tuesday announced an emergency traffic restriction as part of
efforts to reduce the alarming air pollution in the Iranian
capital.
</P>
<P>
The restriction in force from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. will
take effect from Wednesday until further notice, the Islamic
Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the restriction, except Friday, private cars with
even number plates must travel on even days and odd number plates
on odd days.
</P>
<P>
As of Wednesday morning, the plate number of vehicles violating
the new regulations will be registered and the violators will be
deprived of future concessions by traffic department.
</P>
<P>
All private cars and motorcycles which emit exhaust fumes due
to malfunction will be stopped and fined, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement also called on all organizations, ministries
and military forces to abide by the new regulations to ward off
further damage.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after senior health officials warned of
"alarming" air pollution in the city, which had led to the death
of some patients with heart and respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
The air pollution, which befell Tehran days ago due to the
phenomenon of air reversion in winter, has exacerbated for lack of
wind and precipitation, plus the pollutants released by the huge
fleet of battered automobiles.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that 71.2 percent of the air pollution in Tehran
is created by motor vehicles, most of which are old and not
equipped with smog-control devices.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Health Minister Ali Bar Sayari said on Monday
that dangerous noxious gases have increased ten folds in Tehran
over the past four days as a result of stable weather and air
reversion.
</P>
<P>
He also said the pollution has reached an alarming level as
the volume of carbon monoxide in air has risen to 18 PPM, twice
the standard volume.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Mohammad Farhadi Monday urged people to avoid
"unnecessary trips" and called on the elderly, children and those
suffering from allergies to remain at home.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, all elementary, secondary and high schools and
some universities in Tehran, Shahr Rey and Shemiranat, the three
major cities of Tehran province, were closed down upon a
recommendation made by the Environment Protection Organization.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December (Xinhua) -- The disciplinary committee of the
Asian Games football competition decided here on Tuesday to
suspend China's striker Hao Haidong for two international matches,
a senior Asian Football Confederation (AFC) official said.
</P>
<P>
Bobby Houghton, coach of China's men's team, was also suspended
for one international match, said Alex Soosey, director of AFC

</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the three-person panel of the
disciplinary committee headed by Asad Taqi, said Soosey.
</P>
<P>
"After hearing the referee's report, they made the decision
under concerned Fifa laws," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hao was banned for spitting in a line referee's face in a
brawl, and Houghton for using abusive languages toward referees
and an AFC official, Soosey said.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Their cases will be referred to the AFC disciplinary
committee for further action in next Febuary."
</P>
<P>
In the quaterfinal between Chian and Turkmenistan, Hao Haidong
was sent off in the 68th minute for spitting at the line referee.
</P>
<P>

<P>
NEW DELHI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- India Tuesday ruled out
moratorium on fissile material production in the country.
</P>
<P>
In his statements on on-going Indo-U.S. dialogue to both Houses
of Parliament here, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said that
India would not accept any restraints on its research and
development capabilities to maintain what he called "a minimum
credible nuclear deterrent."
</P>
<P>
"While our decision is to maintain the deployment of a
deterrent which is both minimum but credible..., the government
will not accept any restraints on the development of India's
research and development capabilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Such activity is an integral to any country's defence
preparedness and essential for coping with new threat perceptions
that may emerge in the years ahead," he said.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee told the House that flight testing of the extended
range version of India's ballistic missile "Agni," currently under
development, will be conducted fully in accordance with
established international practice.

said.

is a necessary ingredient," Vajpayee said.

<HEADLINE> 13 People Arrested on Horse Race-fixing Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen people, mostly
race jockeys, have been arrested for being suspected to be
involved in a two-million Hong Kong dollars (about 258,400 U.S.
dollars) horse race fixing scandal, anti-corruption officers said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Among these held are four serving jockeys, three serving
apprentice jockeys, four former apprentice jockeys and two
civilians, according to a statement issued by the Independent
Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) .
</P>
<P>
While the inquiries were continuing, ICAC officials said more
arrests may follow.
</P>
<P>
The jockeys and apprentice jockeys were allegedly bribed,
through a middleman who was at the time an apprentice jockey, for
being involved in manipulating the results of two races in 1996,
ICAC said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that one million Hong Kong dollars (129,200
U.S. dollars) had been paid for fixing each of the races -- race
number one on March 30 and race number six on April 14 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry was carried out following a separate investigation
last year which resulted in the prosecution of six people for
bribing jockeys to fix races.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that more than a million of Hong Kong's 6.4
million population are regular gamblers contributing to a now
prosperous industry.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Official Explains Agreement on Marcos Deposits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Tuesday dismissed claims that the move to invest the Marcos
deposits held in escrow at the Philippine National Bank (PNB)
would violate an agreement signed by the Philippine and Swiss
governments.
</P>
<P>
In an ambush interview here, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora
said that the escrow agreement allows the government, together
with the foundations under which the funds were originally
deposited in Swiss banks, to put the money into higher yielding
investments.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, he said, the 570 million U.S. dollars of
Marcos assets were allowed to be transferred to PNB.
</P>
<P>
But earlier, Rod Domingo, one of the lawyers of the 10,000
human rights victims, who won a 2.35-billion-dollar judgment in a
class-action suit against the Marcoses in Hawaii, warned that the
government may violate two diplomatic notes, should it push
through with its plan to dispose of the Marcos Swiss deposits.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said that under the signed escrow, "the Philippine
government together with the foundations, can put them (Marcos
Swiss deposits) in better yielding fund."

<HEADLINE> Another Group of Iraqi POWs to Return Home Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 15 (xinhua) -- A new batch of Iraqi prisoners
of war (POWs) and those Missing in actions (MIAs) will return to
Iraq from Iran on Wednesday under the latest agreement between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Babil daily, published on Tuesday said the State Company
for Transport had prepared first-class buses to transport the
POWs and MIAs.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Yahya al-Ani, General-Director of the
company, as saying that the company will transport the POWs in
groups from al-Muntheriyah border point to their home towns.
</P>
<P>
Iraq recently expressed optimism for closing the file of POWs
and MIAs with Iran forever as the latest negotiations with Iran in
Tehran proved successful and fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Nabd Al-Shabab weekly quoted an unnamed official of Iraqi
Foreign Ministry as saying that Iraq is more optimistic now than
any other time before towards the issue of POWs and MIAs.
</P>
<P>
Under the latest agreement, Iran will release all the remaining
registered and unregistered Iraqi POWs and MIAs, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
He said that the latest negotiations with Iran was franker and
clearer than before. "This frankness and clearness will accelerate
the process of closing the humanitarian file forever."
</P>
<P>
The official said that Iran will release the first group of
registered and unregistered POWs on Wednesday without giving exact
number, but specified that the remaining MIAs in both countries
will be announced.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries will continue their discussions and
will display the latest findings in the future meeting of the
joint Iraqi-Iranian Committee for POWs.
</P>
<P>
The POW issue left over by the eight-year Iran-Iraq war which ended
in 1988, has been a thorny problem for the two countries to restore
bilateral relations for years. Tens of thousands of military
personnel from each sides were captured during the war and most of
them had been released.

<HEADLINE> B d c 2390 China-Flu-Epidemic Flu Epidemic Sweeps Northern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- A virulent strain of flu has
swept northern China in the last seven days with hospitals and
clinics in Beijing and other cities packed with sufferers
complaining of high fevers and breathing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Japanese Friendship Hospital reported four-fold
increases of patients as the particularly vicious A-type virus,
identified by doctors as H3N2, has China's northern population in
its grip.
</P>
<P>
Last year a B-type strain of flu ran rampant at exactly the
same time according to Guo Yuanji, director of China's National
Influenza Center (NIC).
</P>
<P>
"However, compared with the B type, H3N2 can be much more
harmful," Guo said, while also predicting that the week long
outbreak may last ten more days.
</P>
<P>
"Northern China has entered the peak season for its usual bouts
of influenza epidemics," he added.
</P>
<P>
Flu experts also blamed the outbreak on recent abrupt climatic
changes in northern China.
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to catch colds since the temperature often drops
quite quickly below zero," said He Xiong, who is in charge of
influenza detection at the Beijing Epidemic Prevention Station.
</P>
<P>
China's mass media has made valiant efforts to pass on advice
from experts about people keeping away from public places and has
advised them to ventilate rooms, particularly for the elderly,
children and patients with heart problems and chronic illnesses.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Guo and his colleagues are trying to find out
if the H3N2 strain is a new mutation, which happens frequently
with the flu virus making preventive measures more difficult
than usual.
</P>
<P>
China has been vulnerable to flu for centuries and it is
claimed that the 'bug' actually originated there. Now, both
Chinese and foreign medical experts are predicting that a
large-scale influenza epidemic will occur worldwide before the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"We've received epidemic reports from provinces in northeastern
and northwestern regions of China in the last few days, which are
similar to the situation here in Beijing," Guo added.
</P>
<P>
There is no easily available flu vaccine in China so far but
Guo Yuanji said that the NIC is working closely with the Lanzhou
Biological Research Institute in an attempt to develop the
country's first flu vaccine, which he hopes will prevent another
epidemic next year.

<HEADLINE> Sound Sino-US Ties Conductive to Both, FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- As China and the United States
prepare to mark the 20th anniversary of opening diplomatic
relations, China has stressed it is ready to work jointly with the
U.S. to maintain the relations in a healthy and stable manner well
into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi made the remark at
a routine press conference today.
</P>
<P>
The actual anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties
between the two countries falls on January 1st next year. Sun
commented that over the past two decades bilateral ties have
witnessed progress despite some turns and twists.
</P>
<P>
"Promoting friendly, cooperative and mutually beneficial
Sino-US relations is the common aspiration of our two peoples, and
is in the fundamental interests of both, as well as being
conductive to peace, stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific
region and the world at large," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sun recalled how Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
U.S. President Bill Clinton have paid successful reciprocal state
visits and that both heads of state have agreed to build up a
constructive strategic partnership, giving an impetus to Sino-US
relations and taking them into a new phase.
</P>
<P>
"The course of the development of the relations between the two
countries demonstrates that the principles set forth in the three
Sino-US joint communiques are the foundation of bilateral
relations," he commented, adding that adherence to the three
communiques "has been and will be the essential guarantee for the
healthy and steady development of Sino-US ties."
</P>
<P>
Sun reiterated that China is willing to make joint efforts with
the U.S. for the continued development of such ties and hoped the
two sides could take a strategic and long-term prospective.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides should soundly look at the matters over which they
do not agree, in particular the Taiwan issue, so as to expand
common ground and develop cooperation," he said.

</P>
<P>
Esaka Mugasa said the suspect held a passport No. 215363 of
Botswana showing that his name was Kalaba Mphutshinyane born in

</P>
<P>
"He pretended that he did not speak Kiswahili language until
he was forced to concede that he is a Tanzanian," the Commander
said, adding, "the International Police (Interpol) is
investigating its legality."
</P>
<P>
Mugasa said the man Said left Dar es Salaam for Pakistan early
this month and was believed to collect the drugs in Karachi.
</P>

The convict, who is still in hospital for observation under
police monitoring, will be brought to court soon.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Disburse Eighth Loan to S. Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Tuesday approved disbursement of its eighth loan of one
billion U.S. dollars to South Korea, the Ministry of Finance and
Economy said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF made the approval after its fourth quarter policy
consultation with South Korea and the eighth loan will reach the
central Bank Korea Wednesday, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
With the latest IMF disbursement, South Korea will have drawn
19 billion dollars, or 90.5 percent of the IMF's bailout loan last
December.
</P>
<P>
South Korea signed an agreement with the IMF last December for
a rescue loan of 58 billion dollars after it was gripped by
corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of financial institutions in
late 1997. Out of the 58 billion dollars, some 22 billion dollar
are from the IMF while others from other international financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is expected to receive one billion dollars from the
IMF next year and another one billion dollars in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Alassane Quattara, IMF deputy managing director, said South
Korean economy will return to positive growth next year.
</P>
<P>
"South Korea's decision last week to start repaying money
borrowed from the IMF was a reassuring signal to the international
community that the country was emerging out of its crisis," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The severe downturn in output has begun to abate, and the
Korean won remains stable and interest rates are at pre-crisis
levels," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF official cautioned that consumer and investor
confidence remains weak and the speed of recovery will depend to a
great degree on the progress of corporate and financial
restructuring.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Forty-one out of Bangladesh's 64
districts have been identified as arsenic affected, which is
posing a serious health hazard to 62 percent of the total
population of 127 million, The New Nation daily newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Dhaka Community Hospital (DCH) authority disclosed this
Monday in Dhaka at a two-day workshop on "Arsenic Problem and
Water Resources Management in Bangladesh."

The DCH authority said that they identified 20 districts as
severe arsenic affected after conducting emergency arsenic
mitigation program.
</P>
<P>
Ground water in many parts of the country was contaminated with
arsenic which occurs naturally in alluvial and deltaic sediments
posing a serious water hazard as ground water is the primary
source of drinking water in Bangladesh, speakers pointed out at
the workshop.
</P>
<P>
The presence of arsenic has been confirmed in 41 districts of
the country though sample surveys conducted by the DCH in 60 out
of 64 districts.
</P>
<P>
Proper watershed management, utilization of huge number of
water bodies with people's participation and rain water harvesting
are needed, according to the speakers.
</P>
<P>
Safe water, nutritious food and physical exercise are the only
medicines for chronic arsenic toxicity at present, they pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
Pure water must be available to the Bangladeshi people, all
data on the catastrophe must be recorded and shared with others
coping with the problem in order to ensure a rapid solution and
prevent a repetition of the catastrophe, they stressed.

<HEADLINE> Russia Ought to Make Policy Reappraisal: UN Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia has to make a
fundamental reappraisal of its policy course which "has precisely
led to the present unpromising situation", shows the latest survey
by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE).
</P>
<P>
"The standard policy prescriptions which were followed in
Russia turned out, given the institutional setting and the
difficult initial conditions prevailing in the country, not simply
to be ineffective, but to give increasingly perverse results which
moved the country further and further away from establishing
effectual free markets and stable government," said the ECE in its
third issue of the Economic Survey of Europe to be published here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that the present Russian financial crisis
"reflects major failures in the actual Russian transformation
model."
</P>
<P>
"The Russian fiscal dilemma was made progressively more, not
less, acute by the policy mix adopted in 1995, and the actual
dynamics of the particular stabilization recipe in fact led to an
increase in the budget deficit rather than its reduction," the
survey finds.
</P>
<P>
"The perverse incentives generated by macroeconomic policy,
moreover, were magnified by the deeply flawed privatization
process which produced a private ownership structure which neither
encouraged effective corporate governance nor the efficient
allocation of resources," said the survey which focused on the
Russian crisis.
</P>
<P>
In sum, the survey said, the path taken to restore fiscal
balance in Russia since 1995 has proved to be counterproductive
and, in the end, has resulted in a disastrous financial and
political crisis.
</P>
<P>
The survey stressed that one of the critical lessons ought to
be drawn from the Russian crisis is that the role of the state
should never be downgraded and that the implementation of any set
of economic policies must be done through institutions, the state
and its public administration.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here Monday, ECE officials said that
the present Russian government has not yet found anything
effective to deal with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The major challenge for the government is to help the Russians
spend their cold winter when the country is running short of fuels,
they said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks rebounded
1.3 percent on Tuesday to put to a halt a run of three consecutive
losing trading sessions.
</P>
<P>
Even weaker U.S. and Japanese markets did not stop the Hong
Kong share prices to rise 127.63 points for a closing figure of
9,952.84.
</P>
<P>
But the market turnover registered a thin figure of 3,152
million HK dollars (404 million U.S. dollars), 150 million HK
dollars (19 million U.S. dollars) less than the previous trade
session.
</P>
<P>
The market opened weakly due to overnight falls on Wall Street,
with the key Hang Seng Index falling 20.48 points, or 0.02
percent. But it rebounded on bargain hunting with the key
barometer gaining 136.39 points to close at 9,961.60 in the
morning trading.
</P>
<P>
Among the reasons put forwards by experts was the speculation
in the market of a further rate cut of 25 basis points in the
United States later this month, which was believed to help
Tuesday's trading.

<HEADLINE> Unit Trust Sees Net Outflows of US$104M in First 10 Months 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Investment
Funds Association (HKIFA) announced Tuesday that the unit
trust industry registered net outflows of 103.99 million U.S.
dollars between January and October 1998.
</P>
<P>
Amongst the 14 fund sectors, the six Asian sectors registered
aggregate net outflows of 454.80 million U.S. dollars, HKIFA
Chairman Desmond Chan told a press conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Pacific Regional (excluding Japan, including Hong
Kong) funds and Japanese equity funds registered the highest
outflows, Chan said. They respectively registered net outflows of
143.27 million U.S. dollars and 100.50 million U.S. dollars in the
10-month period.
</P>
<P>
The remaining four Asian sectors also saw net outflows, though
the level of outflows was relatively lower. Out of the four
sectors, Hong Kong equities funds witnessed the heaviest outflows,
at 89.85 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
On reasons behind the massive outflows from Asian funds, Chan
said the sharp volatilities experienced by the Asian markets in
the financial maelstrom, as well as concerns over the short and
medium-term outlook of the regional economies have spurred
investors to shun Asian-related products.
</P>
<P>
The sectors that investors had been turning to were European
equities funds, bond funds and cash funds, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
The traditional safe haven sector -- cash funds attracted net
inflows of 80.51 million U.S. dollars in the 10-month period, Chan
said.
</P>
<P>
During the period, cash funds, European equities funds and bond
funds were the three leading sectors in gross inflows, attracting
aggregate gross inflows of 1.716 billion U.S. dollars, accounting
for 58 percent of the industry total, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
On the outlook of sales, Chan said that as the conditions in
Asia stabilize, investors have gradually increased their holdings
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
However, it is likely that the approach to Asia would continue
to be one of selective buying, with investors focusing on markets
that have more positive signs of recovery.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the next few months, bond and cash products would
probably remain as the mainstay of a typical diversified
portfolio, Chan said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Yanshan Group in east
China's Shandong Province recently signed a contract with Kiu
Tay-yu, an antique watch specialist in Hong Kong, to mass produce
tourbillon watches, known worldwide as the "King of Watches."
</P>
<P>
A special research institute on the production of the
tourbillon watch has been set up, and a production base will be
built in Qingdao, said Chen Fayou, chairman of the board of China
Tourbillon Watch Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The company will produce Kiu's watch series which combines
artistry with practicality, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kiu is the only Asian watchmaker producing tourbillon watches,
which are famous for their accuracy, elegance and perfect
craftsmanship. At present, fewer than 10 people in the world
possess the skills required to create tourbillon watches. The
present market price for a tourbillon watch ranges between
20,000-300,000 U.S. dollars.

Though China was the first clockmaker in the world, the
country's clock and watch industry has produced mainly low-grade
products in modern times. The opening of the tourbillon research
center will boost the high-quality watch production of the
country, Chen said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Sets up Syariah Judicial Department </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Tuesday
established the Syariah Judicial Department in the government to
coordinate Syariah court administration throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
A pooling of posts system would be created under the department
which would enable Syariah court officers in one state to serve in
another, Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Abdul Hamid
Othman said after launching the Department.
</P>
<P>
He said Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur and six states --
Perlis, Selangor, Pulau Pinang, Negeri Sembilan, Melaka and
Terengganu -- have agreed to implement the system.
</P>
<P>
The other seven states in the country would participate in the
system soon as the matter needed to be raised first in the various
state legislative assemblies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Such coordination is necessary as the different Syariah legal
service, judiciary and administration schemes in the states had
resulted in problems, especially in enforcing orders, he said. The
different state procedures in appointing Syariah lower court
judges, Syariah high court judges and Syariah Court of Appeal
judges had also delayed appointments, resulting in a backlog of
cases to be heard, he added.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Slightly Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar spent
in the doldrums Tuesday, pegged on either side by weak commodity
prices and U.S. stock market concerns about the impending
impeachment of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The local currency closed slightly higher after trading in a
tight range on the session.
</P>
<P>
"The Aussie will find it hard to rally too much with
commodities as weak as they are, but on the other side the market
is very concerned about U.S. markets and the impending impeachment
by the House of Reps," Rothschild &AMP; Sons senior manager Paul
Macarounas said.
</P>
<P>
The local currency, which finished at 62.05 U.S. cents from
61.85 late Monday, was also the victim of thin pre-Christmas
trading.
</P>
<P>
"It is tough this time of the year because liquidity does dry
out a bit," Macarounas said.
</P>
<P>
He said Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) governor Ian
Macfarlane's testimony to the House of Representatives Standing
Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration
offered little spark for the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
"Underlying everything, commodities are still ruling the roost
and concerns about U.S. markets and the impending impeachment are
probably acting on the other side of that, keeping the Aussie from
falling too far away," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anxiety in the White House increased as more Republicans said
they would vote to impeach Clinton and three Republican leaders
called for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
The Australian currency was buying 72.48 Japanese yen from
71.84 and 1.0272 German marks from 1.0182.

</P>
<P>
He explained that while all the other parties did not obtain
up to 5 percent of the total votes cast in at least 24 states,
one of them will be granted final registration along with the PDP
and APP by virtue of a provision of the guidelines.

elected into the House of Assembly from each of the state
constituencies.

<HEADLINE> No Plan to Replace S. Africa National Anthem: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki has said that there is no plan to change
the current national anthem.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Sowetan quoted Mbeki as saying that despite his
enthusiastic reception of a proposed new national anthem sung
entirely in English, there was no decision to replace the current
hybrid of the African classic, God bless Africa.
</P>
<P>
The newly proposed South African national anthem, which calls
on South Africans to unite and build one rainbow nation, was
apparently given a "thumbs up" by Mbeki during its recording in
Cape Town at the weekend, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the song, all South Africans must "strive to keep
the virtues of justice, peace and freedom. No culture, creed or
custom should divide them".
</P>
<P>
Mbeki was quoted as having said that the song "pointed the way
forward for ourselves as a country".
</P>
<P>
However, in a statement Monday, Mbeki's office said there was
no decision from the government to replace the current anthem.
</P>
<P>
The current South African national anthem sung in both Nguni
and Afrikaans was adopted after the 1994 election.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Leaders Call for Measures for Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asian leaders,
beginning a two-day summit here Tuesday, called for measures to
restore the region's economy to its previous glory.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech at the opening session Tuesday, Vietnamese
Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, who is also chairman of the summit,
expressed the hope that the economic turmoil "would give us
valuable lessons to design a system for warning, preventing and
handling untoward developments."
</P>
<P>
He also called for "practical economic, financial and monetary
measures" including those related to the establishment of the
ASEAN Free Trade Area and the ASEAN Investment Area, which he said
"will certainly create a synergy for us to quickly overcome the
crisis and move further forward."
</P>
<P>
The region covered by the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) used to be one of the fastest growing areas in the
world in the 1980s and 1990s before it was struck by a financial
crisis which wiped out much of the gains they had made in the
years and forced some countries such as Thailand and Indonesia to
seek help from the International Monetary Fund and other
organizations and countries.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie noted in his statement that
the summit is being held "in the midst of a crisis that is putting
the resilience of our nations and that of our association to a
severe test."
</P>
<P>
Peace gave the ASEAN nations the chance to focus on economic
endeavors that resulted in three decades of sustained economic
growth, he said, adding that "peace will once more attend the
economic recovery of ASEAN," which groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos,
Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said that in the
regional economic crisis, ASEAN economies have been badly damaged,
their wealth has been decimated and millions of people have lost
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
"But however dismal the immediate future looks, ASEAN cannot
lose its bearing and long-term optimism," he said.
</P>
<P>
He asked ASEAN countries to "reflect soberly on what ASEAN
means for each of us, how we can help each other to overcome our
economic challenges and how to position ASEAN for the rebound
which must come sooner or later."
</P>
<P>
He called for the acceleration of the pace in implementing
ASEAN's commitments to the ASEAN Free Trade Area, saying, "In the
midst of our economic difficulties, this will be a powerful signal
that we will keep our markets free, that we will remain plugged
into the global economy and that we are determined to move forward
with liberalization."
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada said ASEAN can start by
accelerating and deepening its tariff reduction program and
achieving early consolidation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area for its
consumers and export markets.
</P>
<P>
Poverty eradication was "of particular interest to the
Philippines," he said, adding that the human toll of the financial
crisis "demands urgent and concrete action."
</P>
<P>
"We must implement with fervor the ASEAN Action Plan on Rural
Development and Poverty Eradication," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said the
present circumstances "also require us to be bold and demonstrate
our resolve to forge ahead even in the face of adversity." "This
is particularly true in so far as our economic cooperation is
concerned."
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for ASEAN "to generate the dynamics of
growth in the region and increase its global competitiveness."
</P>
<P>
"We must therefore strengthen our cooperation in the fields of
education, technology and the development of our infrastructure
network," he said. "More importantly, however, we must achieve
closer and deeper economic integration."
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said at the session
that in responding to the financial crisis, ASEAN countries have
instituted various macroeconomic measures and financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to back initiatives aimed at strengthening regional
economic cooperation and consolidating the economic fundamentals
of ASEAN member countries and support greater economic integration
and the acceleration of the ASEAN Free Trade Area.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar leader Than Shwe expressed the confidence that ASEAN
countries will be able to overcome the present difficulties and
that "our region will again rise up to resume its rightly position
as the most economically dynamic region of the world."
</P>
<P>
Brunei Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah and Lao Prime Minister Sisavat
Keobounphan in their speeches also called for unity among ASEAN
members to overcome the current economic difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Soldiers' Involvement in Killing S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho police Tuesday
confirmed that three South African farmers were shot dead by
members of the Lesotho Defense Force (LDF) in the rugged southern
district of Quthing on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Speaking from the capital of Maseru, Lesotho police spokesman
Sekoateng Serabele said police received a report of the incident
on Monday evening and visited the area Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Serabele disputed reports that the South Africans were on a
mission to retrieve stolen livestock, saying the men crossed the
border to steal livestock.
</P>
<P>
Serabele said he assumed the bodies of the three South
Africans were still in Lesotho. He was still awaiting reports
from police in the area and had no information on two South
Africans who were reportedly wounded in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Serabele said according to reports, a group of armed men from
Matatiele in Eastern Cape, South Africa, crossed into Lesotho on
Saturday night and raided a cattle post.
</P>
<P>
The men seized about 64 sheep and goats and drove them in the
direction of Matatiele, Serabele said.
</P>
<P>
Basotho villagers alerted members of the LDF who were on
patrol in the area.
</P>
<P>
The LDF patrol followed the alleged thieves and before they
left Lesotho territory there was an exchange of gunfire in which
the three South Africans were shot dead, Serabele said.
</P>
<P>
The LDF soliders captured the animals and returned them to
their owners.
</P>
<P>
Serabele said the rest of the group fled.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Continue to Fall in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices in Tokyo fell for
the fourth straight trading day on Tuesday, stirred by the banking
sector's decline following the temporary nationalization of Nippon
Credit Bank (NCB), with the key Nikkei index once slipping below
14,000 for the first in over a month.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 100.43 points, or 0.71
percent, from Monday's close to end at 14,011.19.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 11.04 points or 1.00 percent to
1,089.27.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section went up to an estimated 410
million shares from Monday's 319.71 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Yasuda Trust Bank was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Concern is growing that the value of a bank share might become
zero suddenly after investors saw NCB shares were removed from the
stock market, and this heavily weighs on the banking sector, a
dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Bank shares faced strong selling pressure, while
export-oriented high-tech blue chips moved lower due to the
overnight tumble on Wall Street and the yen's recent surge against
the U.S. dollar, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers far exceeded
gainers 804 to 327, with 172 issues remaining unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Expert: "Y2K Bug" Could Lead to Navigational Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The "millennium bug" of
computer could lead to navigational equipment failure as the
shipping and maritime industries are lagging considerably behind
worldwide efforts to eliminate the problem, a U.S. senior official
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Central banks and telecommunications firms around the world had
made considerable progress in updating financial systems and the
aviation industry was beginning to move more aggressively, but the
shipping industry had "escaped attention," said John Koshinen,
chairman of President Bill Clinton's council on the millennium
problem.
</P>
<P>
He noted that 95 percent of all goods coming into the United
States arrived by sea.
</P>
<P>
Koshinen also urged specialists and officials, who are
participating in the first global conference on the 2000 computer
bug, to press their respective governments to deal the Y2K problem
in all fields, including shipping industry.
</P>
<P>
The Year 2000 problem -- also called Y2K and the millennium bug
-- occurs as some computer programs, especially older ones, may
fail when the date changes to 2000. Because they were written to
recognize only the last two digits of a year, such programs could
read the digits "00" as 1900 instead of 2000.
</P>
<P>
No one really knows what will happen at century's end, and
predictions vary wildly from financial instability to civil
disorder.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Insists Palestinian Compliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu insisted Tuesday that the Palestinians have to
fulfill their obligations in the recent land-for-peace deal before
Israel further carries out its pending troop withdrawal from the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference after a three-way summit with Visiting
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat at the Erez border crossing, Netanyahu
reiterated his positions that Israel would not release Palestinian
prisoners who killed Israelis.
</P>
<P>
He also demanded that the Palestinians take measures to stop
incitement against Israel, collect illegal weapons and give up
plans to declare a Palestinian state unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a speedy redeployment as soon as the
Palestinians fulfill all their obligations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said Israel would not bow to external pressures to
make concessions on its internal issues.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Jerusalem would remain undivided capital
of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Clinton told American reporters that the meeting was
"very good," and the peace process has been back on track.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israeli government has reconfirmed its commitment
to the pullout but that there were still several issues to be
worked out.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel media reported that no progress had been made.
Arafat left for Gaza without talking to reporters.

<HEADLINE> Israel Reaffirms Water Commitments to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon reassured on Monday that Jordan that it remains committed
to water clauses in the peace treaty signed by the two countries
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Sharon sent an official clarification to Jordan on statements
by Israeli Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan that his country
will re-examine waters deals signed with the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Sharon said in the letter that his country will stand by all
its commitments in the peace accord with Jordan and shall continue
cooperation with the kingdom on various issues, including water.
</P>
<P>
The letter, delivered to Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul
Ilah Khatib by Israeli Ambassador to Jordan Oded Eran monday,
was apparently a response to Jordan's demand for an explanation
from the Israeli government on the Israeli Agriculture minister's
statements.
</P>
<P>
The peace treaty between the two countries guaranteed an 215
million cubic meters of water to Jordan a year through new dams, a
treatment plant and diversion projects.
</P>
<P>
However, of the total 215 million cubic meters promised by
Israel, Jordan is currently receiving only about 60 million cubic
meters, according to the Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
Official figures showed that Jordan, with an annual
population growth rate of 3.5 percent, will need 1.2 billion
cubic meters of water per year between 1998 and 2000. The
kingdom's water resources will only amount to 960 million
cubic meters a year.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Businessmen in a four-side
meeting to discuss a proposal for possible cooperation on the
divided Cyprus have agreed to facilitate contact between Greek and
Turkish Cypriots on the island.
</P>
<P>
The four sides, involving Turkey, Greece, Greek Cypriots and
Turkish Cypriots, voiced their stands in a statement issued at the
end of the two-day meeting Monday, local Daily News reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that "the participants reaffirmed their
desire for contact and cooperation to increase" steps to relax and
eventually lift all restrictions on the free movement of people,
goods and services, and the value of participation by members of
both communities in non-governmental international meetings.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was held in Turkish largest city of Istanbul,
was the second of its kind in the 35 years. It was organized by
Columbia University's International Conflict Resolution Program
and the International Peace Research Institute of Oslo.
</P>
<P>
"I am encouraged by the spirit of what I have seen at this
meeting," said U.S. presidential envoy for Cyprus Richard
Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" in 1983, which is only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been prodding the rival four sides to find a
peaceful solution to the Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> Mini ECOWAS Summit to Discuss New Govt in Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar has arrived in Lome, Togo, for a mini-summit
of the Economic Community for West African States (ECOWAS) on
Guinea Bissau on how to solve the crisis in that country.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit which began Monday is expected to review
the progress in the implementation of the Abuja peace accord
signed on November 1 by the two parties to the seven-month crisis
in Guinea Bissau during the 21st ECOWAS Summit in Abuja,
according to a Nigerian Tribune report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources said the Lome summit would concretize the
already existing peace accord and also evolve new measures to
move forward in peaceful settlement of the Bissau crisis.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace accord, the west African peace-keeping force of
ECOMOG will deploy a special task force in Guinea Bissau to take
over from Guinean and Senegalese troops which have been in that
country at the invitation of President Joao Bernardo Vieira.
</P>
<P>
A high-level ECOMOG team visited the country last month to
evaluate the logistic requirements for deploying an interposition
force in that country.
</P>
<P>
Four west African countries of Niger, Togo, Benin and Gambia
have pledged a total of 1,450 troops for the peace-keeping mission
in Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord also provides that a government of national
unity will be formed soon in the country and presidential
elections be held no later than March 1999.
</P>
<P>
Former Chief of Army Staff General Ansumane Mane led a
rebellion against President Vieira in June after he was sacked by
the latter for alleged involvement of senior army officers in
arms smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reached a cease-fire agreement in August after
negotiations brokered by ECOWAS and the Community of
Portuguese-Speaking Countries and reaffirmed the agreement on
November 1 in Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Steps Up Battle To Save Coral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Excessive coral mining by
fishermen around south China's tropical island of Hainan has
destroyed over 50 percent of the region's fragile reefs since the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics more than 20,000 hectares have
been wiped out and now in a bid to prevent further loss the
provincial government has banned the mining of coral reefs in its
waters.
</P>
<P>
It has also forbidden the sale or distribution of coral
by-products, such as lime, and introduced penalties for those who
transgress.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 400 varieties of coral reefs along the
Hainan coastlines, and more than 600 small islands in the South
China Sea are made up of coral.
</P>
<P>
Marine experts point out that waters rich in coral reefs are
vital to the stability of the sea's ecology and they also act as
barriers to prevent flooding of coastal areas by dispersing heavy
waves, as well as helping to keep sea-water clean.
</P>
<P>
A recent report released by the Nairobi-based World Research
Institute warns that coastal development, overfishing and
pollution, as a result of both land and marine based activities,
are threatening the future of nearly 60 percent of the world's
coral reefs.
</P>
<P>
Reefs occupy less than 0.25 percent of the earth's total
marine environment, yet they are home to more than half of all
known marine species, the report reveals.
</P>
<P>
It also points out that the most threatened reefs are found in
southeast Asia, where an estimated 82 percent are considered to be
at medium or high risk.
</P>
<P>
Now the Hainan provincial government is trying to persuade
fishermen to take up planting crops or marine focused projects
such as fish farming.
</P>
<P>
Already the new policy seems to be having an effect. After
hearing of the problem Xu Wenming from Dongge Town near Wenchang
city in south China's Hainan Province, has wound up his 15 year
old coral mining business and pulled down his lime-kiln.
</P>
<P>
"I now plan to plant peppers on the hills near my house and
raise some chickens," he said happily, his new future already
mapped out.
</P>
<P>
And in the last two months since the coral ban was imposed
more than 150 families who have traditionally worked the coral
reefs have stopped.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan May Have 1.5 Million Surplus Cotton Bales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is likely to have
1.5 million surplus bales of cotton in fiscal 1998-99 (July 1-June
30) instead of 2 million bales projected earlier, an official
source said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Cotton Assessment Committee of the Food Ministry had
earlier announced a yield of 11 million bales of cotton in the
current fiscal year, but it later revised the output to 10.5
million bales.
</P>
<P>
The committee was considering cutting down the cotton
production to 10 million bales, and as a result 1.5 million
surplus bales would have to be available because the local
consumption is 8.5 million bales, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet has allowed
cotton export of 500,000 bales during fiscal 1998-99 and it is
expected that a new decision on cotton export will be made soon.

ADDIS ABABA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Minister of Health
Lamisso Hayeso said an estimated two million people in Ethiopia
are affected by malaria every year.
</P>
<P>
This year traditionally safer areas including Addis Ababa have

conditions, the Ethiopian Herald Tuesday quoted Vice-Minister
Lamisso as telling local journalists.
</P>
<P>
Lamisso said the epidemic has shown a declining trend in the
past few days while preparations have been underway to undertake
massive spraying of anti-mosquito chemicals in the states hit
hardly by the epidemic and to import DDT and other chemicals.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the Ministry of Health had issued an early
warning last year but could not produce the expected results due
to lack of adequate control systems.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that a consignment of anti-malaria medicines
donated by the World Health Organization (WHO) has already
arrived at Addis Ababa airport where it is due to be distributed
to all parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-Minister urged the various government departments at
all levels, health institutions, and non-governmental
organizations to work concertedly in the fight against the
epidemic.
</P>

About 40 million of Ethiopia's 58 million people live in

planning act, saying that only seven percent of Lusaka's
buildings have been constructed by registered contractors.
</P>
<P>
The Post newspaper Tuesday quoted council president Francis
Ndilila as saying that there is rampant disregard of the act
resulting in poorly constructed buildings in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Ndilila has called for the strict enforcement of the act to
attain sound development of the cities in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said it is shocking to see that despite the act being in
place, law enforcers have left the increasing emergence of shanty
compounds unchecked.
</P>
<P>
It is clear, said Ndilila, that the law enforcers have been
benefiting from illegal buildings.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to immediately implement policies on
selected liberalization if the local industry is to survive.
</P>
<P>
"We have liberalized entirely to the point that people are now
coming and just playing here as our local industries cannot
compete with them," said Ndilila.
</P>
<P>
While this is the case in the region, he noted that the
government has been heavily taxing the local industries, making
their products uncompetitive.
</P>
<P>
"We are not saying that government should scrap tax because we
know the state needs the funds," he said, adding, "What we are
asking for are incentives that will make us competitive."
</P>
<P>
The official said high taxation has led to local contractors
being more expensive compared to other regional competitors while
they are equally as good as their foreign counterparts.

items in leading Egyptian newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Monday the
Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement must be implemented without
any conditions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered Wye River Accord, which was signed in
Washington in October, stipulates that Israel withdraws its troops
from another 13 percent of the West Bank in return for tougher
Palestinian actions against Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the
suspension of implementing the accord due to the pressure from the
hardliners in his coalition and the mounting violence in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Moussa dubbed as sheer procrastination Netanyahu's request to
shelve the execution of the deal because of domestic problems.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President is shuttling between Israel and the Palestinian
self-rule area to convince the two sides to stick to the terms of
the deal.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Moussa said Monday Egypt and the Democratic Republic of
Congo have agreed upon three agreements during the visit of
Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The agreements cover prevention of dual taxation, investment
protection and bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
The DRCongo has been plagued by fightings between forces loyal
to Kabila and the rebels. Egypt has helped broker a cease-fire
between the Congolese government and Uganda and Rwanda, the rebels'
backers.
</P>
<P>
Kabila wrapped up his three-day visit to Egypt Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Minister of Information Safwat Al-Sherif said
Monday that Egypt will sign a contract before the end of this year
for the manufacture and launch of another Egyptian satellite.
</P>
<P>
The new satellite, which will be built by French Matra Marconi
company, is expected to be put into orbit in 1999. The satellite
will carry 12 space channels which will transmit 84 TV channels
under the digital system and its transmission will cover the
African continent, the Middle East and south Europe.
</P>
<P>
The first Egyptian satellite was launched on April 28.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli government Sunday night raised the issue of the
Israeli spy Azzam Azzam, currently serving a 15-year term in an
Egyptian jail, with Clinton during his visit to the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Following a dinner banquet hosted by Netanyahu for Clinton,
Netanyahu arranged a meeting between Clinton and the family of the
convicted Druze spy.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted Clinton as promising to do his best to
guarantee the release of the Israeli spy.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu to Close Small Thermal Power Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province
has decided to close small thermal power plants over the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
The provincial electricity bureau recently issued a directive
that all plants operating three generators with installed
capacities of less than 100,000 kw each should cease operations by
the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Local sources note that the province's generating units with
installed capacities at that level account for a third of the
total.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities issued the directive in answer to the fact
that small thermal plants create serious pollution and waste large
amounts of coal.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has attempted to ease energy
shortages in recent years by constructing large efficient
generators and placing limitations on smaller units.
</P>
<P>
Small thermal power plants supplied 20 percent less power
during 1998 than in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The local official in charge of the power construction said the
rapid development of power construction in recent years has ended
the situation in which insufficient power supply hindered economic
development. Large generating units can easily fill the gap
resulting from the closure of smaller plants.

generating power.
</P>
<P>
The project, partially funded by the World Bank, was completed
33 days ahead of schedule, said an engineer in charge of its

Construction of the project began in 1994. It will eventually
be able to generate electricity and control flooding and menance
of ice runs, in addition to diverting water.
</P>
<P>
The facility will have six generating units with a combined
capacity of 1.08 million kw. In 1999, three more generating units
will be added.
</P>
<P>
On completion in 2000, the project will be able to provide 1.2
billion cu.m. of water for Shanxi Province, 200 million cu.m. for
Inner Mongolia, and 2.75 billion kwh of electricity to north
China, annually.
</P>
<P>
This project is also financed by Shanxi Province, the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Chinese Ministry of Water
Resources, with total investments of 12 billion yuan (about 1.4
billion U.S. dollars), of which 400 million U.S. dollars will be
covered by loans from the World Bank.

JERUSALEM, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton at last brought Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat for a
three-way summit Tuesday morning at the Erez border Crossing
between Israel and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The summit came less than one day after the Palestinians took
a decisive step on the peace process as hundreds of members of
the Palestine National Council (PNC) and other leadership bodies
convened and reaffirmed the annulment of anti-Israel provisions
in the Palestinian charter.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which linked the holding of a three-way summit with
the outcome of the PNC meeting, welcomed the PNC decision to
revoke the anti-Israel charter.
</P>
<P>
But Aviv Bushinsky, spokesman for Netanyahu, told Israel TV
before the start of the summit that he was still doubting about
whether the Palestinians will fulfill their other obligations
before Friday, the day when Israel is scheduled to carry out the
second of three withdrawals from the West Bank stipulated in a
recent peace deal.
</P>
<P>
While describing the PNC decision on revising the charter
as "an important step" on the Palestinian side, Netanyahu said
Monday it was only the first step and "other compliances" are
needed before Israel begins to implement the accords.
</P>
<P>
He put the pending troop withdrawal on hold last week amid
widespread clashes in the West Bank, which were sparked by
Israel's refusal to release Palestinian political prisoners, and
what he called Arafat's unilateral declaration of a Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
Bushinsky said Israel had not changed its positions on all
these issues.
</P>
<P>
Israel media reported Monday that the U.S. would propose a
compromise calling for a two-week time-out in the implementation
of the peace accords to enable the two sides to smooth over
their differences.
</P>
<P>
But Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said at a late
night briefing in Jerusalem that the U.S. is still hopeful the
redeployment will take place on schedule.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Countries Begin Summit in Hanoi (2) ... further development." </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his key-note speech, Khai stressed unity among ASEAN
members, describing it as "the key to ASEAN's success."
</P>
<P>
He called on all member countries "to make joint efforts to
resolve outstanding issues, so that ASEAN's younger generations
can advance, hand in hand, and free of misgivings, into the new
century in great strides and durable harmony."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the economic problems facing the region, Khai
stressed, "Although the current economic turmoil has deprived us
of many of our hard-earned gains, the social, economic and
cultural foundations that each of our countries has put in place,
plus our great potentials and advantages, give us grounds to be
confident that the internal strength of each country and the
region, coupled with external cooperation, are the forces which
will steer the ASEAN ship through the turbulent seas into the 21st
century."
</P>
<P>
He urged ASEAN countries to "mobilize to the maximum all
internal resources inherent in each country" and asked other
countries to "take into account characteristics of the recipient
countries to spare them from social disturbances and impediments
to economic recovery" while providing support and assistance to
affected nations.
</P>
<P>
He called for the reform of international financial and
monetary institutions and ways to curb monetary speculation
"detrimental to many economies and the global economy as a whole."
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese prime minister welcomed the recent formation of
a new coalition government in Cambodia and said the ASEAN leaders
have come to a decision to admit the country as the 10th member of
the regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
He added that the leaders have instructed their foreign
ministers to organize a special admission ceremony in Hanoi.
However, he did not mention the time of the admission or ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"The decision makes it possible to fulfill the vision of
ASEAN-10, enhances ASEAN's strength and international standing and
contributes, in an important way, to strengthening peace,
increasing cooperation and promoting development in Southeast
Asia," he declared.
</P>
<P>
Attending the opening ceremony was also Prime Minister Hun Sen
of Cambodia, which enjoys observer status in the regional
grouping.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN leaders Monday night failed in their last-minute
effort to immediately admit Cambodia just in time for the country
to attend the summit as a full-fledged member after their foreign
ministers reached no consensus on the matter at their meetings
last week as the member countries were divided over Cambodia's
accession.
</P>
<P>
Host country Vietnam and some other countries strongly favor
Cambodia's admission while others such as Thailand and Singapore
asked for a delay until the political situation is more stable in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN had decided to admit Cambodia together with Laos and
Myanmar in July last year, but the admission was deferred after
armed conflicts broke out between the forces of the then first
prime minister Norodom Ranariddh and second prime minister Hun
Sen, resulting in Ranariddh's ouster.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state and government from other member countries also
spoke at the opening session Tuesday morning before holding a
closed-door session in the afternoon.

<P>
ZHENZHOU, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Authorities in central and
west China have issued a series of policy incentives recently to
encourage the development of the high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
Henan Province in central China has decided to establish a
special fund for the high-tech industry from the year 1999. It
will allocate 50 million yuan in 1999 and 2000, respectively, for
its high-tech programs.
</P>
<P>
The province has given other preferential policies like tax
reduction and exemption, while simplifying customs procedures for
high-tech enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi Province in northwest China has spent 30 million yuan
each year in the industrialization of high technologies. The
province also speeds up the development of Xi'an and Baoji
high-tech zones.
</P>
<P>
Experts pointed out that provinces in central and west China
should upgrade traditional industries and improve the industrial
structure to promote local economy.

<HEADLINE> Survey: U.S. Executives Ignorant of Energy Cost Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. corporate executives
are unaware of the massive cost-saving possibilities of installing
energy-efficient electrical equipment, said a survey report Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the national survey of CFO (chief financial officer)
Magazine readers last August, most of the executives who responded
felt they had little control over electrical energy costs and more
than half stated they were not involved at all in their company's
energy decisions.
</P>
<P>
The survey was sponsored by the Energy Cost Savings Council
(ECSC), a coalition of manufacturers, utilities, industry groups
and government agencies working together to inform American
business leaders about the bottom line benefits of upgrading
buildings with new electrotechnologies.
</P>
<P>
According to ECSC, survey results revealed most financial
executives still considered energy costs a fixed expense, and knew
little about energy management as a means of cutting operating
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
Citing estimates made by the U.S. Department of Energy, ECSC
said that only about one-third of U.S. companies were using
state-of-the-art electrotechnologies, ranging from more
energy-efficient lighting and transformers to HVAC (heating,
ventilating and air conditioning) systems and completely automated
building systems which monitor and control energy consumption.
</P>
<P>
Financial executives usually believed that the capital
investment to upgrade their buildings was too high. But according
to ECSC, investments in energy-efficient electrical products
upgrades, which can reduce energy costs by up to 50 percent
annually, can be recouped in as little as two to three years.

<HEADLINE> Sixteen Giant Salamanders Stolen from Chongqing Zoo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen of the seventeen
giant salamanders in southwest China's Chongqing Zoo were stolen
on December 10.
</P>
<P>
A zoo official said the stolen salamanders are above ten years
old on average, and the remaining one is female and over 40 years
old.
</P>
<P>
He said that giant salamanders, which are state-protected
amphibious animals, live in rivers and streams at an altitude of 200
to 1,000 meters in water about 20 C.
</P>
<P>
He said he's worried about the fate of the stolen animals
because of the winter weather in Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
Local police said the thieves may have first climbed over the
two- meter-high wall around the salamander hall and pierced open
the wooden gate with a sharp knife. The police have made public
two telephone numbers in hopes of getting information about the
case.
</P>
<P>
The Chongqing Zoo, located in the western suburbs, is home to
120 species of rare animals, including giant pandas and
golden-hair monkeys. Eight cases of the theft of rare birds and
animals have occurred since early this year, which, analysts say,
is related to the local people's taste for wild animals and the
fashion of keeping pets.

<HEADLINE> Hughes Buying U.S. Satellite to Strengthen Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Hughes Electronics Corp.
announced Monday it will buy U.S. Satellite Broadcasting Co. for
1.3 billion U.S. dollars in cash and stock in a move to strengthen
its position as the largest U.S. satellite television service.
</P>
<P>
Both companies are pioneers in direct broadcast satellite
technology, which now has about eight million customers in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The purchase, expected to be completed between March and June
of next year, will add about 800 million to 900 million dollars to
Hughes's revenues in the first year and reduce annual costs by 160
million to 180 million dollars as the two companies consolidate
redundant operations, such as billing, customer service and
broadcasting centers, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The combined company will become a stronger competitor to cable
operators, analysts said. Hughes's DIRECTV plans to expand its
185-channel programming lineup to more than 210 channels through
the addition of the premium channels owned by U.S. Satellite
Broadcasting Co.
</P>
<P>
The deal had been widely expected following last month's move
by DIRECTV's rival EchoStar Communication Corp. to buy the
satellite television assets of News Corp Ltd. and MCI WorldCom
Inc., analysts said.

BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- A two-year-old pelican slipped
out of its home Monday afternoon at the Beijing Hundred Birds
Garden and disappeared into the northern section of the city.
</P>
<P>
While a group of workers were busy clearing the small river
where the pelicans live, the little bird flew out through a hole
in the huge net over the river.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guozhen, one of the bird keepers, said the pelican is a
species on China's second-class protection list, and this male
bird was introduced into the garden last year from the Shanghai
Zoo.
</P>
<P>
It was last seen flying in the direction of the Asian Games
Village in the northern part of the city. A few of the garden
staff members later drove to nearby rivers and lakes in search of
the lost bird.
</P>
<P>
The birder keepers have called on residents to keep an eye out
for the young pelican, and also announced that a hotline had been
set up to take information from the public.

<HEADLINE> World Food Program Aid Projects Fruitful In Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The projects under the World
Food Program's Chapter 3779 in western Hubei Province have been
completed recently and have played a remarkable role in promoting local
agricultural production and improving the lives of farmers.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest free-aid project the WFP has provided to
China. It began in 1991 and is aimed at developing agriculture in
western Hubei, expanding local irrigation systems, planting trees,
building roads and training personnel.
</P>
<P>
The water conservation component, which constitutes most of the
program, has increased the planting area of rice by over 1,100
hectares, the irrigation area by nearly 20 percent, and rice
output by 90 percent per hectare.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this project, 3,100 hectares of trees were
planted, bringing the forest coverage in the region to 45.9
percent in 1997, from 36.7 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 kilometers of rural highways and roads were also
completed, which has helped accelerate the development of the local
market economy.

<HEADLINE> China Finds Seven White-fin Dolphins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Calculating from current results, China now only has less
than 100 white-fin dolphins," predicted Wang Yamin, an official
from the Fishery Department of the Ministry of Agriculture. China
found 23 white-fin dolphins in a similar activity last year.
</P>
<P>
The seven-day-long activity started from December 4, with
results of finding five dolphins in central China's Hubei
province, one in Hunan province and a young one in east China's
Jiangxi province.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that the finding of the young dolphin is of great
importance to the protection of the species.
</P>
<P>
The white-fin dolphin is a unique animal living in China's
Yangtze River and has been put under the state primary protection.
</P>
<P>
In the past century, because of the development of the
Yangtze, the deteriorating of the water quality in the river and
the decreasing of fish species, the number of the dolphins
decreased by a large margin. The illegal fishing tools also
killed dolphins in a large quantity.
</P>
<P>
To protect dolphins, the country has set up two state-level
protection zones in Hubei province. However, Wang said he
worried about the fate of dolphins.
</P>
<P>
"The natural protection zone can provide only part of the
protection as the water quality of the Yangtze is still
deteriorating," Wang said, adding that scientists want to move
the dolphins out to a safe new home, but the out-of-date fishing
technique restricted the launching of such a plan.
</P>
<P>
Scientists also found some 1,500 black finless porpoises,
another animal under the state protection, during this
monitoring.

<HEADLINE> Australian Economy Survives Asian Crisis: RBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Australia's economy survived
the Asian economic crisis in 1998 but was set for slower economic
growth, Australia's central bank governor said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ian Macfarlane, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia,
boosted his predictions for economic growth in 1998 to four
percent, from three percent he forecast earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The economic outcomes for the past year had been pretty good,
the governor said in a speech to an Australian parliamentary
committee Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"Australia's economic performance has exceeded our
expectations, and to my knowledge the expectations of virtually
all forecasters".
</P>
<P>
But he warned of a slowdown next year due to the weaker outlook
for the world economy.
</P>
<P>
The governor said the country's economic growth was likely to
come in at 2.5 to 3.0 percent in the 1998-1999 financial year
ending June 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
He predicted inflation was likely to come in at two percent at
the end of the year while the current account deficit looked set
to average five percent of gross domestic product in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Asian crisis had hit at a time when the Australian economy
was in good shape, with strong growth and low inflation in
mid-1997.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Shrimp Exporters May Suffer Huge Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Frozen shrimp exporters of
Bangladesh may suffer a loss as high as 1.28 billion taka (26.4
million U.S. dollars) this year, President of Bangladesh Frozen
Shrimp Exporters Association (BFSEA) Golam Mostafa said.
</P>
<P>
The huge loss was mainly a result of declining prices in the
buyers' market by 30 to 40 percent, Mostafa said in southeastern
Chittagong Monday, press reports here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He demanded financial assistance from the government to
modernize the processing plants to meet the needs of quality
frozen shrimps from the buyers, particularly those from the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
Shrimp exporters in the country had been passing through
hardships in the past two years, and the situation began to
aggravate in July this year with a sharp fall in price in the
international market, Mostafa said.
</P>
<P>
Shrimps worth 3.77 billion taka (77.7 million dollars) now
piled up in Bangladesh, according to the BFSEA president, because
of the fierce competition from other shrimp exporting countries
and the inability of the country's small producers to maximize
output at lower cost.
</P>
<P>
Some 77 shrimp processing factories out of the 123 had already
closed down due to the shortage of working capital in the last
couple of years, and plant owners refused to take fresh loans as
they could not repay the existing loans of 1.50 billion taka (30.9
million dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh usually exports shrimps worth 2 to 3 billion taka
(41.67-62.5 million U.S. dollars) during the peak season from
September to October, but this year only 500 to 600 million taka's
(10.41 to 12.50 million dollars) worth of shrimps were exported,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
The country's shrimp production this year might fall by as much
as 40 percent to around 15,000 tons from last year's 25,000 tons,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1.5 million professional fishermen in
Bangladesh, and the export of frozen food, both fish and shrimp,
contributes about 8.7 percent to the country's total foreign
exchange earnings.

<HEADLINE> Thai Sugarcane Farmers Demonstrate for Higher Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Thai sugarcane
farmers from the northeast demonstrated outside the Government
House here Tuesday to press demand for higher prices.
</P>
<P>
Police cordoned the streets leading to the House, but there was
no report of clashes between the demonstrators and police.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul, taking charge of
government affairs during the absence of Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai who is in Hanoi attending an ASEAN summit, canceled a
scheduled interview with Xinhua reporters because of the
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
One of his secretaries said Bhichai had to cancel the
interview, originally scheduled for mid-Tuesday, because he was
fully occupied and because the streets leading to the Government
House were cordoned.
</P>
<P>
The sugarcane farmers demanded a guaranteed price of 630 baht
(17.5 U.S. dollars) per ton. Monday the farmers gathered in front
of Industry Minister Suwat Liptapallop's house, parking 120 trucks
and pickups in front of it, causing traffic jam in the area.
</P>
<P>
The farmers accused the government of "ignoring the plight of
cane planters" by making a decision to fix the cane price at 470
baht (13 dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
They threatened to lean "an army of thousands" of planters on
trucks laden with cane crops to Bangkok if the government failed
to meet their demand.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Hit by Storms, Cold Snap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Two strong storms combining
cold winds and heavy rains hit Cambodia in the past few days,
causing serious damage to houses and villagers.
</P>
<P>
The first storm, called Fair, struck Sihanoukville Friday and
Saturday, while the second storm, dubbed Faith, assaulted the same
coastal area early Sunday. The high winds and heavy rains brought
by the storms destroyed 25 houses and seriously injured one
villager, the Cambodia Daily Tuesday quoted the provincial police
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Following the storms, temperature plunged to 16.4 degrees
Celsius in the highlands, the lowest temperature in Cambodia since
1993. In Phnom Penh, temperature dropped to 18.7 degrees Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists attributed the unusual cold snap to two typhoons
that swept through Southeast Asia and to the worldwide abnormal
weather phenomenon known as El Nino.
</P>
<P>
The storms were expected to fade Tuesday morning, but
cooler-than-normal weather will continue into next year, said an
official of the meteorology department.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of families living on riverbanks, by roadside and
near railroads have been subjected to cold winds and rain
battering their flimsy shacks. Many people had to cover themselves
with a mosquito net because they had not enough blankets and
clothes.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the cold weather is harming agriculture, too. By
this time of the year, normally 80 percent of rice crops should be
harvested. But this year, only 20 to 30 percent have been
harvested. And many crops were damaged by strong winds and heavy
rains.

YANGON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- An intercountry meeting on
integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) is being held
here to discuss the implementation of tactics of the IMCI of
United Nations agencies.
</P>
<P>
The four-day discussions, which began Monday, cover the
implementation of the IMCI of the World Health Organization (WHO)
and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in 1996 and
maternal health care service.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Deputy Health Minister Dr. Mya Oo pointed out that the
rate of outbreak of pneumonia, diarrhea, measles and malaria
diseases drops in Myanmar due to vaccines.
</P>
<P>
The diseases are reportedly causing death of children under
five especially in the developing countries due to malnutrition in
them.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting are altogether 33 delegates from eight
Southeast Asian nations and 11 observers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar has launched the National Immunization Days
(NIDs) for three years since 1995 with 5.33 million or 96
percent, 5.5 million or 99 percent and 5.503 million or 97
percent children under five receiving polio immunization
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The number of reported poliomyelitis cases in 1988 was 60 but
there was only nine cases in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with the WHO, the UNICEF, the UNDP (United
Nations Development Program), the Japanese and Australian
governments as well as non-governmental organizations, the first
day of this year's Myanmar NIDs activities was launched last
Saturday, targeting 5.8 million children under five to be given

<HEADLINE> China Protects Environment While Building Railways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The construction of the Xi'an to
Ankang railway line in northwest China has not affected the
historic sites in the city of Xi'an or the scenery in the Qinling
Range, but rather has added to their beauty.
</P>
<P>
Not far from the mausoleum of Qin Shihuang, the first emperor
of China, a 4,000-meter-long rainbow bridge spans a large stretch
of farmland.
</P>
<P>
One construction company manager said the building of the
bridge is intended to protect the original landscape and farmland.
</P>
<P>
Li Henian, chief designer of the railway, said that 364 million
yuan was budgeted for the protection of environment along the
railway, of which 90 million has been used for debris removal, 18
million for polluted water and emission treatment, and 1.5 million
for planting trees and grass.
</P>
<P>
But in actual operation, he said, many construction companies
exceeded their budgets in order to pass inspection by local
environmental protection authorities.
</P>
<P>
The debris from the Qinling tunnel, the longest railway tunnel
being built in China, must be hauled some 15 kilometers away and
dumped into a specially designed site, which eventually will be
turned into farmland.
</P>
<P>
The polluted water from the tunnel construction site first
flows into a treatment pool before it is released into the valley,
and, Li said, more than one million yuan has been spent on the
treatment of polluted water from the tunnel alone.
</P>
<P>
To avoid the scenic spots in Zhashui County in the middle of
the Qinling Range, the railway is designed to extend in a
round-about way, which added to the cost of the railway, but left
the scenic surroundings untouched.
</P>
<P>
The 268-kilometer-long Xi'an-Ankang railway, linking the
Lanzhou-Lianyungang railway in the north and the
Xiangfan-Chongqing railway in the south, is scheduled to be
completed on October 1, 2000, when it will form another
north-south trunk railway line.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) decided Monday to disburse 1.022 billion U.S. dollars
to South Korea under a 21 billion dollars loan approved last year.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the decision, IMF Deputy Managing Director Alassane
Ouattara said in a statement that South Korea "continues to make
commendable progress in its efforts to achieve economic recovery."
</P>
<P>
"The severe downturn in output has begun to moderate and there
are encouraging signs that the Korean economy will return to
positive growth during the course of next year," Ouattara said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the confidence of both consumers and
investors remained weak as "there was little room for complacency."
</P>
<P>
And the speed of the recovery would "depend to a great degree
on progress in corporate and financial restructuring," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 21 billion dollars loan approved on December 4 last year is
the largest single loan in the IMF's history, and the decision
Monday brings IMF's disbursement to a total of 19 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The next credit tranche is due in three months later. The IMF
loan is part of a 58 billion dollars international rescue package
including loans from the World Bank and the Asian Development
Bank.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Probe has Little Effect on Clinton Ratings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The impeachment debate last
week in Washington D.C. did little to change public opinions of
President Bill Clinton in the rest of the United States, according
to a new poll.
</P>
<P>
The poll conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People
and the Press found that two-thirds of American adults thought
President Clinton should not be impeached and removed from office.
</P>
<P>
Although more than half of those polled said they were unhappy
with the way the president had handled the congressional
investigation into his affair with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky, 61 percent still approved of the job he is doing
as president.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of respondents disapproved of the way
Republicans in Congress have handled the impeachment issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll, also released Monday,
indicated that about six in 10 Americans opposed impeachment
</P>
<P>
Seventy-one percent said Republicans are pursuing impeachment
for political reasons, compared with 61 percent who said Democrats
are acting out of political motivation.
</P>
<P>
Only one in three Americans closely followed last week's
impeachment debate and the votes by the House Judiciary
Committee. Nearly two-thirds said the media was paying too much
attention to the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Pew poll was based on telephone interviews with 1,201
adults who were interviewed from December 9- to 3. The margin of
error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll was based on interviews with 865
adults on December 12 and 13. The margin of error is plus or
minus four percent.

<HEADLINE> Feature: an American Doctor with a Mission in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 15 (Xinhua) -- A golden rule is always
followed in Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital in Hangzhou: emergency
patients will always be given top priority no matter their
financial situation.
</P>
<P>
The hospital has maintained this rule even though its budgets
have been hit because of unpaid fees and this has not shaken the
determination of Gordon Hadley, president of the American section
of the hospital, ex-vice president of Loma Linda University in
California and a former employee with WHO.
</P>
<P>
Most of the hospital's windows are tightly shut to enhance the
air conditioning system. "And there are quite a lot of patients
with terminal diseases here, so closing windows can also prevent
some desperate patients from jumping out to commit suicide. We
must be responsible for their safety as well as their health,"
said Mr Hadley.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Hadley is so considerate even with the minute details."
This is the kind of remark often be heard in this internationally
sponsored hospital. He even once found a sheet covered in oil
stains and cleaned it in his own washing machine, so the story
goes, according to a clerk in the hospital laundry.
</P>
<P>
Doctors and nurses can never predict when this 77-year-old
veteran doctor will appear on an unscheduled inspection. A
favorite time is during night shifts when he will also try to
solve any problems on the spot.
</P>
<P>
"This American gentleman not only brings us his medical skill,
but more importantly, his personal philosophy which dictates that
life should be cherished in any format," commented Professor Wu
Jinming, president of the Chinese section of the hospital and Mr
Hadley's long time partner.
</P>
<P>
Mr Hadley's daughter and son-in-law are also his colleagues
here, their expertise is in gynecology and emergency care.
</P>
<P>
The greatest sense of accomplishments for Mr Hadley comes, he
insists, from how others value his contribution and dearly
cherishes the West Lake Friendship Prize awarded to foreign
experts like him by the Zhejiang provincial government.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Home-coming astronauts
aboard space shuttle Endeavour released two satellites into space
Monday from the orbiting spacecraft's open cargo bay.
</P>
<P>
One of the two satellites was the result of a joint project of
the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and
the Argentine National Commission on Space Activities.
</P>
<P>
Designed to track whales, it would help test techniques to be
used in the future to follow endangered whale populations.
</P>
<P>
Another satellite, MightySat-1, was made of composite materials
rather than the customary aluminum alloys, so that scientists
could test the viability of composites in space.
</P>
<P>
Other experiments were also aboard the Department of Defense
satellite, including an advanced solar cell using heat rather than
light from the sun to make electricity.
</P>
<P>
Endeavour and its crew members are scheduled to land at Kennedy
Space Center, Florida, on Tuesday night.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Legislative Body to Meet Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian legislators have
decided that the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), the
country's highest legislative body, should meet once every year,
the Indonesian Observer reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 1,000-member MPR currently assembles once every five years
to select a president and a vice president. It also issues state
guidelines and decrees, in addition to evaluating the president's
accountability speech.
</P>
<P>
All four factions of the House of Representatives agreed Monday
that the MPR must convene more than once every five years, in line
with the people's growing political awareness.
</P>
<P>
Budi Harsono, a legislator from the Armed Forces (ABRI)
faction, who presided over the meeting Monday, said the
recommendation to change the frequency of the MPR meetings will be
submitted to the leaders of the House in January.
</P>
<P>
"The proposal is aimed at empowering the MPR," Harsono said.
</P>
<P>
He said it would make a lot more sense if the president had to
present an annual accountability speech, rather than give one
every five years.
</P>
<P>
"And we, the legislators, would correct any mistakes made by
the president. We would try to correct the president before he
deviates too far," he added.

<HEADLINE> World's Agro-Chemical Giants to Help China's Grain Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen major international
agro-chemical companies have formed an alliance to pool their
expertise to assist China's efforts to produce a better and safer
food supply, according to the China Pesticide Association (CPA).
</P>
<P>
The Crop Protection Association of China (CPAC), which was
recently set up in Beijing, will work with Chinese organizations
such as the State Bureau of Petroleum and Chemical Industries, the
Ministry of Agriculture and the CPA to introduce advanced crop
protection technologies to China.
</P>
<P>
The members of CPAC are AgroEvo, American Cyanamid, BASF,
Bayer, Dow, DuPont, Elf Atochem, FMC, Monsanto, Novartis,
Rhone-Poulenc, Rhom and Haas, Sumitomo, Uniroyal, and Zeneca,
which all have investments in China.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, CPA President Wang Luxian
said: "Scientific, safe and effective use of pesticides and other
crop protection methods should play a key role in the sustained
growth of China's agricultural sector."
</P>
<P>
China is the world's second largest producer of pesticides, but
still lags a long way behind the developed countries in product
structure, use of technology, the scale of operations, and basic
knowledge of crop protection, especially among those at the
working end, Wang commented.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that 30 percent of China's grain
growth in 1997 was attributed to the introduction of new
technology; compared to 60 percent among nations using advanced
agricultural techniques.
</P>
<P>
Guilford Ide, CPAC president and China Agro Business Manager of
DuPont Agricultural Chemicals Ltd., based in Shanghai, said, "With
22 percent of the world's population and seven percent of the
world's arable land, China has the greatest responsibility of any
nation to ensure an abundant and safe supply of food for its
population."
</P>
<P>
The CPAC is a member of the Asia-Pacific Crop Protection
Association, a subsidiary of the Global Crop Protection
Federation.
</P>
<P>
According to Ide, CPAC will focus on sponsoring initiatives and
activities to promote the responsible use of crop protection
technology; facilitating development and research in this area;
protecting related intellectual property rights; and providing
examples of environmental stewardship.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the application of state-of-the-art crop protection
mechanisms in agricultural production will help to consolidate and
improve the status of Chinese products on the world market.

COLOMBO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The government of Norway has
provided a grant of 940,000 U.S. dollars to Sri Lanka for a
leather complex in the south of the country, the official Daily
News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The project at Bata-Atha in Hambantota district will expand the
leather industrial sector without causing any damage to the
environment, create employment and alleviate poverty, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The leather production sector in Sri Lanka has not been
developed in keeping with the pace of that in other Asian
countries. The report said it was mainly because of the
restrictions placed on the industry for environmental
considerations.
</P>
<P>
Most leather tanneries in Sri Lanka are confined to small units
in Colombo suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly the new project will seek to relocate the tanneries
in one industrial estate with a hi-tech effluent treatment plant
to minimize adverse effects on the environment, said the report.

of the single currency would make sure members do not seek to
resolve problems by themselves.
</P>
<P>
Dini said that the European Plan for Employment, which was
adopted at the summit, is "a new social pact based on policies and
objectives which can be quantified and verified".
</P>
<P>
He added that the details of this new pact would be hammered
out over the next six months.
</P>
<P>
Dini also underlined the need for a common European defense
policy, saying, "The Union can have no real foreign policy without
a defense and security entity."
</P>
<P>
The clear guidelines for defense policy will be ready by the
end of next year, he said.

<HEADLINE> China's State-Owned Enterprises Reduce Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- China's on-going reform of
medium-sized and large state-owned enterprises has witnessed
remarkable progress this year, according to Zheng Silin,
vice-minister of the state economic and trade commission.
</P>
<P>
Zheng said Monday that the government has promoted a group of
capable personnel to be leaders of these enterprises, with a
number of unqualified managers removed from office.
</P>
<P>
"Of the 100 major pilot enterprises enjoying reform, 84 have
dispersed investment to different investors and 39 have been
listed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zheng added that a number of successful companies including
Changhong, Legend and Haier, have become stronger, enabling them
to compete fairly with overseas companies. "Many medium-sized and
small companies have also reaped more profits." he said.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that the reforms in the textile, coal and oil
industries have also scored notable achievements. The oil
industry, for example, reported a profit of 615 million yuan in
October.
</P>
<P>
Zheng said that the government has also enhanced its efforts
for making arrangements for laid-off workers and for improving the
management of many enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has decided to help the bulk of
state-owned enterprises become much more financially viable in the
next three years," he added.
</P>
<P>
"However, next year is a key period, and the government will
try to score substantial achievements in sorting out the financial
mess of many state-owned organisations," Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the focus will be placed on major industries.
"For example, we plan to reduce losses in the textile sector by
three billion yuan next year."

MADRID, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Spain on Monday denied that the
extradition of former Chilean leader General Augusto Pinochet
requested by a Spanish judge would affect its relations with Chile.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a plenary session of the senate where he presented

Spain wished to keep its relations with Chile "as intensive as

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Ministers at Odds on Civilian Militia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Justice Minister
Muladi said the government cannot commence its program to form
civilian militia units until a law endorsing the plan is enacted
by legislators.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after attending a hearing of House of Representatives
Commission I for security and defense Monday, Muladi said he will
advise President B.J. Habibie and Armed Forces (ABRI) Commander
General Wiranto to prepare a bill on the civilian militia.
</P>
<P>
"I insist that the program must not be implemented, because
there is no law for it. But if the government thinks the program
is really urgent, well, I think there must at least be a
government regulation," national newspapers Tuesday quoted Muladi
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the plan to form a civilian militia must be
outlined in a law, because it relates to the rights and
obligations of every citizen.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Article 20 of the 1982 Law on National
Defense stipulates that the establishment of trained civilians for
security purposes should be regulated by law.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said Sunday that the government plans to arm thousands
of civilians with batons and shields to help security for next
year's general election, and to cope with the recent spate of
lawlessness in the crisis-ridden country.
</P>
<P>
He said the first phase of the recruitment process is to take
place in January 1999, and will be under the command of the
National Police.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto is already facing strong public criticism over the
mobilization last month of 125,000 untrained civilians to help
security for the special session of the People's Consultative
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Human rights activists, legislators and analysts criticized the
deployment of these civilian guards as they regularly ended up
brawling with residents and student protesters.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Indonesia has been rocked by violent unrest,
including clashes between troops and students, and religious and
economic riots that have damaged scores of places of worship.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, December 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior Panamanian
congressman blasted the United States on Monday for including his
country in a blacklist of nations that were failing to fight the
drugs trade.
</P>
<P>
The United States was motivated to include Panama on its list
because of the failure of bilateral talks to set up a multilateral
anti-drugs center in Panama, Alberto Aleman Boyd, head of the
Panamanian Congress Anti-Drug Committee, said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. decision announced this weekend was
"arbitrary" and contrary to evidence that Panama had implemented
an anti-drugs policy.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Panamanian authorities seized 14.2 tons of marijuana,
and this year had confiscated about two tons of cocaine sent by
Colombian cartels to the U.S. and European markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past four years, Panama's narcotics police seized over
74 tons of drugs, mostly cocaine and marijuana, sending nearly 400
traffickers to jail.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Sydney 2000 bidding committee
will not be included in IOC's ongoing investigation which will
focus on the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Games, International
Olympics Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch confirmed in
Lausanne, Switzerland on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The words meant Sydney 2000 officials have distanced
themselves from allegations of bribery and corruption.
</P>
<P>
IOC's inquiry derived from its senior official Marc Hodler's
claims that cities bidding to stage the Olympic Games have paid
for votes.
</P>
<P>
Australian IOC executive board member Kevan Gosper said: "I
was on the bidding committee and we were never involved in any
bribery or corruption. No one ever approached me and I don't know
any of my colleagues who were either."
</P>
<P>
Gosper countered reports in the Sydney Morning Herald that
Sydney secured some African votes for cash.
</P>
<P>
As for Salt Lake City, Samaranch said on Monday IOC was
investigating the city because it had proof.
</P>
<P>
Salt Lake City chiefs have admitted that the Games officials
once presented tuition assistance and athlete training programs
to six direct relatives of IOC members during the bidding
process.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Chang'an Airlines based in
northwestern tourist city of Xi'an will become the first to
introduce the new Yun-7-200A passenger aircraft, after signing a
contract with the Xi'an Aircraft Manufacturing Corp.
</P>
<P>
The Yun-7 series are the first China-made passenger aircraft
and constitute the largest fleet in China. Since first introduced
in 1984, they have had a clean safety record of 600,000 hours.
</P>
<P>
It has taken 10 years to develop the new Yun-7-200A model,
which has a Canadian engine and US-manufactured propeller and
navigation facilities as well as a range of new China-made
innovations, according to the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
The 52-60 seater is 24.7 meters long, 29.2 meters wide, with
a maximum cruising speed of 456 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
While it meets the international standards for safety, quality,
economic efficiency, comfort and maintenance, the Yun-7-200A only
costs about two thirds of a similar foreign aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The Chang'an Airlines, which operates about 30 domestic routes,
is one of the major users of the Yun-7 series. It has ordered two
Yun-7-200A aircraft and they will come into service early next
year.

WASHINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- There was little to
celebrate at the NBA annual Christmas party held today in New
York as the lockout threatened to cancel the season.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner David Stern said: "We're still hoping to make a
deal, so we haven't contemplated that yet. But obviously that
would affect the situation dramtically."
</P>
<P>
Tuesday will be the the third missed payday for the players.
</P>
<P>
The league said more than 100 employees have been laid off
since the lockout began, cutting the staff to about 750.
</P>
<P>
Almost all league employees have been ordered not to speak to
the media regarding the lockout. However, some workers said they
were not concerned about having to find employment elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The league and the union met Saturday but broke off after less
than 30 minutes, one of their shortest meetings during the 5
1/2-month-old labor dispute. There are no scheduled talks between
the sides.

GUANGZHOU, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The price revolution has
been playing a decisive role in China's transformation of its
formerly rigid central economic planning into a market-oriented
economy.
</P>
<P>
A mere 20 years ago, the price of almost any commodity in
China was not determined by market demand but by the government.
</P>
<P>
This policy was originally introduced in order to cope with the
shortage in supply, but in reality it aggravated such shortages
since it had a negative effect on the enthusiasm of the workers.
</P>
<P>
The government set the prices for 91.3 percent of the country's
farm produce in 1979, 97.2 percent of the commodities handled by
the retail sector in 1978, and 100 percent of important raw
materials before 1978.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the supply of major daily necessities, ranging from
grain, cloth and meat to matches, were rationed. Consumers even in
big cities had to queue for what products were available.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Province, authorized by the central government to
introduce special and flexible policies 20 years ago, was the
first region in the country to challenge this rigid pricing system.
</P>
<P>
In 1979, this coastal province in south China raised the price
of grain, which had been undervalued for a long time, along with
other agricultural products. This paved the way for the gradual
price liberalization of all agricultural products, and eventually
those in the industrial sector followed suit.
</P>
<P>
These 'revolutionary' reforms proved to be a success, and saw
the average farmer's per capita income in the province increase
to 644.71 yuan (about 77.67 US dollars based on the present
exchange rate) in 1987, from the relatively meager figure of
193.25 yuan in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Following Guandong's success in restructuring prices, a trial
project adjusting the cost of all agricultural products was
introduced in 1985 throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> Reform Review: Price Reform Triggers a Revolution (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1992, the state monopoly for the buying and selling of grain
was ended, as was grain rationing. It wasn't long before the price
setting of consumer products generally was freed up throughout
China.
</P>
<P>
However, in the more strictly controlled manufacturing sector,
Guandong introduced a twin-track reform policy. This allowed
enterprises to set the price for part of their products depending
upon production quotas.
</P>
<P>
It had good reasons for this cautious approach as unfettered
price reforms can easily trigger off price hikes. In 1980, the
retail price index rose by 8.5 percent in Guangdong compared with
the eight percent rise recorded in the preceding 28 years.
</P>
<P>
However, provincial officials moved forward with enthusiasm and
sought ways to introduce a series of new regulatory measures. They
set up reserves for major new commodities and established a "price
risk fund" which helped overcome several waves of rather large
price hikes.
</P>
<P>
Increased production brought about by the reforms also helped
offset the aftermath of price hikes. While the living expenditure
price index of workers rose by 80.64 percent in Guangdong in 1987,
the gross agricultural and industrial output value increased by
over 300 percent and workers' wages by over 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
With an ample market supply, prices eventually became stablized
and between 1978 and 1997, the retail price ratio grew at an
annual rate of 8.2 percent in Guangdong, while the GDP increased
by 14.2 percent, sales revenue by 17.9 percent and wages by 15.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
The price reform has also helped end the supply shortage which
has long dogged the whole country. According to the State
Administration of Internal Trade, in the first half of this year
there was an adequate supply of more than 600 varieties of major
commodities and in some instances there were excesses.
</P>
<P>
"To an extent, the success of China's economic reform lies in
the success of price reform," experts have said.

<HEADLINE> Vieira Fined for His V-Sign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League club
Arsenal midfielder Patrick Vieira has been found 20,000 pounds
for gesturing at fans following a stormy game at Sheffield
Wednesday in September.
</P>
<P>
The French international was found guilty of misconduct by a
Football Association disciplinary panel, following a hearing in
Birmingham but no suspension was imposed.
</P>
<P>
He was also warned about his future conduct but was cleared of
an alleged assault on a police officer in the players' tunnel.
</P>
<P>
"It's important for us that Patrick escaped suspension. He's
only just come back from injury and it would be a real body blow
if he had gone out of the side again," said Arsenal manager
Arsene Wenger.
</P>
<P>
FA spokesman Steve Double said: "Vieira admitted to the
commission that he made the V-sign in response to racial abuse
from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
"As he went down the tunnel he felt himself grabbed from
behind by an unknown assailant. He said he had broken free
without realising it was a police officer.
</P>
<P>
"The commission heard supporting evidence from club officials,
including Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. The commission ruled
that Vieira was guilty of misconduct in relation to the gestures
to the crowd, but not guilty in relation to any alleged assault
against a police officer."
</P>
<P>
Vieira was fined 3,000 pounds in July after a confrontation
with West Ham's Ian Pearce after an FA Cup replay four months
earlier.

An early report said for holding the peace talks, the Colombian

UNITED NATIONS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday met with Klaus Naumann, chairman of the
Military Staff Committee of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), and Annan said the talks between the two sides "were
excellent," U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.

During the meeting held at the request of the NATO general, the
two sides discussed the current situation in the Serbian province
of Kosovo, the relations between NATO and the United Nations, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held as hundreds of NATO combat troops and
engineers fanned out across Macedonia over the weekend to build
camps as bases from which to rescue international monitors in
nearby Kosovo should the fragile ceasefire break down.
</P>
<P>
Annan warned in Paris last week that any regional group should
not use force against any sovereign state without consultation
with and approval from the U.N. Security Council.
</P>

The U.N. chief was apparently referring to a unilateral
decision made by NATO to threaten the use of force against

<HEADLINE> China, Bumper Harvest in 1998: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Despite this summer's
disastrously heavy floods, China expects its 1998 grain output to
have reached the second highest yield ever, almost on a par with
the record results of 1996, according to Wan Baorui, vice-minister
of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Wan announced Monday that China's total grain output will have
surpassed the year's target of 492.5 billion kilograms.
</P>
<P>
He released the figure in his annual report on the country's
agricultural situation during an inspection meeting by the
deputies of the National People's Congress in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said that thanks to the Party's basic policies being
implemented in rural areas, farmers have been able to stabilize
their planting and maintained a forward momentum in the
development of agriculture and the rural economy.
</P>
<P>
However, Wan did reveal that grain output in the badly
flood-stricken areas around the Yangtze, Songhua and Nenjiang
rivers was affected, but that output in other regions has either
stabilized or even increased.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that although cotton output this year fell by
300,000 tons, it was still enough to meet the market demands.
</P>
<P>
Edible oil and sugar production are estimated to have grown by
500,000 tons and four million tons respectively; meat and egg
output risen by four and three percent respectively over the the
previous year; and aquatic products are expected to reach a level
of 38 million tons.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the first 10 months of the year, the added
value of township enterprises reached 1,732.5 billion yuan, an
increase of 16.9 percent over the same period last year. The value
of export-oriented products amounted to 520.6 billion yuan, a rise
of 10.7 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
Wan also revealed that more than 70 percent of villages have
extended the term of farmland contracts with farmers and in
general terms the burden on rural communities has been much
relieved compared to 1997.

<HEADLINE> Britain Faces EU Court Action Over Environmental Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
decided to make an application to the European Court of Justice
against Britain for its failure to adopt legislation covering
Gibraltar in respect of a number of EU environmental directives.
</P>
<P>
European Commission announced this case here on Monday, which
shows Britain should implement directives in Gibraltar. For some
time, there has been a significant backlog of such directives
awaiting implementing legislation in respect of the territory,
said the commission, the EU's executive body.
</P>
<P>
Though Britain has made some progress recently in clearing the
backlog, its legislation is still lacking for several directives,
one of which, Directive 94/67/EEC, is on the incineration of
hazardous waste.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the directive's objective is to ensure that
specified measures and procedure are in place to prevent or reduce
as far as possible negative environmental effects arising from
hazardous waste incineration. The directive addresses the
pollution of air, soil, surface and groundwater and risks to human
health, and aims to achieve a high level of environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, Britain has sent a draft legislation on this
regard, but has not yet sent any adopted legislation, the
commission said while pointing out that the major EU island member
has also not implemented the other three EU directives, which
reflect the 15-nation bloc's concerns about air traffic noise.
</P>
<P>
The EU commission considers it important that all directives
are implemented in time and throughout the territory where they
are applicable.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Rebound over New Prospects of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Oil markets rebounded on Monday
after major producers, including Venezuela, professed to consider
fresh supply cuts to shore up record-low prices.
</P>
<P>
Benchmark Brent climbed back into double figures to end 34
cents firmer at $10.16 a barrel, half a dollar above a fresh
12-year low struck on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The market rose early on news that oil ministers of big
producers Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico would meet on
Thursday in Madrid to talk about ways of rescuing prices wallowing
at 12-year lows.
</P>
<P>
That news raised prospects for another round of production
restraint to sweep prices up from a 12-year floor.
</P>
<P>
Reuters quoted a Gulf source familiar with Saudi thinking as
saying that fresh volume cuts and extensions of existing
reductions would both be up for discussion.
</P>
<P>
Also, state Petroleos de Venezuela head Luis Guisti said his
government was considering fresh output cuts, but he expected
prices to stay low in the medium term, Reuters said.
</P>
<P>
More support came from a statement by Saudi Arabian King Fahd
supporting a recent call by Crown Prince Abdullah for action by
OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) and non-OPEC
states to shore up markets.
</P>
<P>
But analysts cautioned a sharp rally remained highly unlikely
in view of a stubborn overhang of stocks and simmering differences
within OPEC about compliance with existing pledged cuts.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Turkey Makes no Decision on Iran Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States
believes that Turkey has not made any decision to bring natural
gas by a pipeline from or through Iran, the State Department
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is our understanding ... that Turkey has made no decision
to bring gas from or through Iran so long as Turkey's
requirements can be met from other sources, specifically from a
trans-Caspian alternative," spokesman James Foley told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
He was dismissing a report from the Washington Post, which,
quoting U.S. and Turkish officials, said on Sunday that Turkey
had decided to defy the Clinton administration by completing a
natural gas pipeline from Iran.
</P>
<P>
"The United States and Turkey are committed to creating an
east-west transportation corridor, including a trans-Caspian
gas pipeline from Turkmenistan and a main export oil pipeline
from Azerbaijan. Neither of these pipelines would carry Iranian
resources nor transit Iranian territory," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has vigorously promoted a pipeline through
Central Asia that bypass Iran, which Washington still regards as
a country hostile to it.

<HEADLINE> UK Output Prices Hit Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The prices of UK manufactured
goods leaving factory gates have fallen by a record amount which
highlights the difficulties facing the industry.
</P>
<P>
The year-on-year figures for November published by the Office
for National Statistics showed prices producers obtained for their
goods fell by 0.5 percent, the biggest fall since records began in
1958.
</P>
<P>
However, economists said the figures suggest UK inflation
remains subdued, which could lead to further cuts in the cost of
borrowing to stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
"This type of data does tend to confirm the wisdom of the
acceleration of rate cuts by the Monetary Policy Committee," said
James Stewart at Weavering Capital.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to see any upside pressures to inflation. Given the
inflation and output data we have seen I would not be surprised at
all to see at least a 50 basis point cut in January," he added.
</P>
<P>
The MPC slashed rates by 50 basis points last week to 6.25
percent, bringing the total amount of easing to 125 basis points
since October.

LONDON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- European markets closed
slightly down Monday in the wake of a weakening dollar as Wall
Street registered the likelihood of U.S. President Clinton's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
UK shares had an indifferent day, hit also by falling share
price in Asia and a poor start for U.S. shares on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
A gloomy survey which showed that confidence among Japanese
businessmen had slumped, saw share prices in London tumble by more
than one percent in early trading.
</P>
<P>
However, the FTSE 100 index of leading shares recovered and by
the close was down just 7.2 pints at 5534.5.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt's shares were mixed as thin volume contributed to
sharp price moves amid pessimism about Japan's economy and worries
about the stability of the dollar against the German mark.
</P>
<P>
The Dax finished 13.34 points lower at 4522.86. Dealers said
most big stock moves were technical recoveries on losses sustained
last week.

In Paris, the CAC-40 had a quiet day with trading volume of
just 8.7 billion francs. There was little corporate news to
provoke traders concerned about preparations for the euro.

<HEADLINE> There Is Not Much for U.N. to Do in Angola, Annan Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said on Monday the United Nations could not do much in
Angola, where a civil war has resumed in recent months, and the
Security Council would soon have to decide whether the world body
still had a role to play in the African country.
</P>
<P>
"There is a war. The United Nations can't do much because we
don't have many people in the field," Annan told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a 1,000-member U.N. observer mission that
has been trying unsuccessfully to halt the unravelling of a 1994
agreement aimed at ending nearly two decades of conflict between
the Angolan government and the rebel UNITA.
</P>
<P>
In the early days of the peace process, the U.N. troop presence
numbered more than 7,000.
</P>
<P>
"We have to regroup our peacekeeping forces for the purpose of
their own security," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council soon will be obliged to decide whether
the U.N. has a role to play or not. If we cannot retain contact
with all parties, can we really play a role?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
There had been no direct contact with UNITA leader Jonas
Savimbi, "So we really have to give a comprehensive review of what
is occurring in Angola and our position there," the U.N. chief
said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council earlier this month renewed the mandate of
the U.N. Observer Mission in Angola, known as MONUA, until
February 26, 1999. It said it would continue to adjust the
deployment and structure of the force in accordance with security
conditions and its ability to carry out its mandate.

Gaza (Palestine) -- Palestinians rolled out red-carpet Monday
for U.S. President Bill Clinton as he arrived here for a one-day
visit to Gaza, the first-ever visit to the Palestinian areas by a
sitting U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
Many Palestinians view the foot-setting by the U.S. president
on the Palestinian territories as a symbol of an indirect
U.S. recognition of the Palestinian aspiration for an independent
state.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat
warmly welcomed Clinton on the unblemished runway after his Marine
One landed at the newly-opened airport, which was decorated by a
blizzard of American and Palestinian flags.
</P>
<P>
The national anthems of both the U.S. and Palestine were played
by an guard of honor.
</P>

After private talks at the VIP lounge in the main building,
Arafat and Clinton cut red ribbons at a ceremony officially
inaugurating the airport, which opened last month as a fruit of
the recent land-for-peace deal with Israel. (Clinton-Visit)

GAZA CITY -- The Palestinians took a decisive step Monday as
hundreds of Palestine National Council (PNC) members stood with
their hands raised to reaffirm the annulment of anti-Israel
provisions in their national charter.
</P>
<P>
Visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton, while addressing the
meeting, praised the PNC for doing "a remarkable thing." The
Israeli government was quick to express acceptance of the PNC move.
</P>
<P>
This paved the way for a three-way summit between Clinton,
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday morning. The summit will
possibly be held at the Erez border crossing between Israel and
the Palestinian self-rule Gaza Strip. (BC-Gaza-Clinton 5th

<HEADLINE> Tsohatzopoulos, Holbrooke Hold Talks on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos Monday held talks with visiting U.S. presidential
envoy on Cyprus, Richard Holbrooke, on ways of breaking the
impasse of the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after their talks, Tsohatzopoulos said that the result
of the talks was "a difficult issue to pin down," according to the
semi- official Athens News Agency (ANA).
</P>
<P>
He added that both sides elaborated on the prospects that each
side saw as realistic.
</P>
<P>
U.S. ambassador to Greece Nicholas Burns, who also attended the
talks, described the meeting as "excellent and useful."
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, along with U.S. State Department coordinator for
Cyprus Thomas Miller, is now having a working dinner with Greek
Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos and they are expected to
discuss Greek-Turkish relations and Cyprus, especially U.S.
efforts to avoid a crisis by finding a way for Nicosia to cancel
its planned installation of Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen its defense capacity, Cyprus decided earlier last
year to purchase the Russian missiles, but U.S. and some European
countries have opposed the deployment of the missiles, saying that
this would increase the tension on the divided island republic.
Turkey also openly threatened to use force to prevent the missile
deployment.
</P>
<P>
While insisting that the missiles will be deployed as planned,
the Cyprus government has expressed the willingness to postpone
the missile deployment only if there is substantive progress on
Nicosia's proposal to demilitarize Cyprus and if there is a
resumption of U.N. sponsored talks for the island's reunification.

<HEADLINE> New EU Members Strengthen Environment Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
Monday expressed here its views that the accession of Austria,
Finland and Sweden to the integration bloc has resulted in
strengthened EU environment protection standards.
</P>
<P>
In its newly adopted Communication, a kind of shaped policy
document, the European Commission said when the three countries
joined the EU on January 1, 1995, a special provision allowed them
to keep certain different national health and environment
provisions for four years. The period of the provision, the Review
Clause in the Act of Accession, will end on December 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
During this period, the EU reviewed its own health and
environmental standards accordingly, in close cooperation with the
three new members. The Communication said in almost all cases, the
review process resulted in the adoption of strengthened
environmental standards throughout the EU, for example on sulphur
in petrol, mercury in batteries and labelling of dangerous
substances.
</P>
<P>
Following the adoption of the Communication, EU Environment
Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard said: "The review process
demonstrates that the EU has been able to ensure a high level of
environmental protection and health standards for the citizens in
Ausria, Finland and Sweden."
</P>
<P>
The commission said that in the accession negotiations with the
three countries, the environment and health were important and
sensitive issues due to their high level of protection in these
states.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows that the review proved to be a success in
protecting the environment and human health, according to the
European Commission.

LONDON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- British government announced on

</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said elections for a
25-member Greater London Authority, which would supervise the
Mayor's activities and be required to approve his budgets, would
take place on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Prescott told the Parliament the Mayor would have "real powers

</P>
<P>
Functions would include coordinating London's transport
system, including its huge underground railway network, making
major decisions on planning, and helping to tackle the city's
environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
London has been without a city-wide authority since 1986
when a Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher abolished
the Greater London Council (GLC), which at that time had a
reputation as a hotbed of radical socialism.
</P>
<P>
The new Mayor and Authority will mark a third step towards
devolution of power from central government since the Labor
government came to office last year.
</P>
<P>
Bills to set up separate parliaments for Scotland and Wales
have already been passed and elections for the two bodies are
due to take place next May.
