<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ In what seems a game of home run cat-and-mouse, Mark
McGwire is playing Tom to Sammy Sosa's Jerry.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa, of the Chicago Cubs, homered on Sunday afternoon to
tie Mark McGwire for the home run lead, at 54 all, only to have
McGwire _ almost exactly seven hours later _ blast one out of Busch
Stadium on Sunday night. The seventh-inning hit off the Braves
right-handed relief pitcher Dennis Martinez traveled an estimated
501 feet to dead center field.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did McGwire take sole possession of the home run lead,
but he also gave the Cardinals an 8-7 lead in the game, since there
were two runners on base when he struck the blow. The lead stood up
as the Cardinals took the final game of their series with the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire also drew closer to catching Roger Maris' single-season
record of 61 homers, set in 1961. McGwire has 26 games left in the
season, Sosa has 25. Sosa has moved to within a home run or two of
McGwire several times in the last few weeks _ after McGwire had
held the lead for virtually the entire season _ and even went ahead
once when the two teams played about two weeks ago. But each time
Sosa makes McGwire uncomfortable, McGwire unloads.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, on Aug. 19, Sosa went one ahead of McGwire, only to
have McGwire hit two in the same game to regain the lead. This is
as good a race as anything seen at Churchill Downs or Belmont Park.
McGwire was asked after the game how he felt about ``it''?
</P>
<P>
   ``What, the win?'' he said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   He understands that the greatest interest is not in the
Cardinals' victories at this point _ they are eight games under
.500 and out of contention. ``It feels good to come back and win a
game, feels even better doing it against one of the best teams in
the National League,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Sosa, McGwire said, ``I can only take care of myself.''
He added: ``I don't see the homer thing as a challenge between me
and Sammy. You don't get an Oscar at the end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   But he knows the stakes, of course. It is for the most heralded
record in American sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a great year, what a historical year,'' he said.
``Wouldn't that be something if both Sammy and me hit _ what is it?
_ 62 or 63 homers each? Well, we just have to see what happens.
Sept. 27 is the finished product'' _ that is, the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited for Sammy,'' McGwire added. ``He's having a
magical season. Way better than I'm having. He's got a higher
batting average, he's driven in more runs and his team is in the
race for the wild card in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire handicapped himself on Saturday when he argued so
belligerently on a called third strike in the first inning that he
virtually forced Umpire Sam Holbrook to throw him out of the game.
So he was not around to fully respond at the plate to Sosa's 53d
homer on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire made up for it on Sunday night, after walking and
hitting a single and a double in three trips to the plate. The home
run was also his first in the four-game series against the Braves.
He had not hit a home run since Wednesday, against the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire became only the second player in National League history
to hit 55 home runs in a season. Hack Wilson set the record of 56
with the Cubs in 1930. McGwire hit 58 home runs last season, but
only 24 of those were with St. Louis. He hit 34 with Oakland in the
American League, before being traded to the Cardinals on July 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals play Monday night in Florida against the Marlins,
while the Cubs return home to play Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire also drove in his 119th run, giving him a career high.
The record for runs batted in appears fairly safe for Wilson, who
holds that one, too. He knocked in 190 runs in his remarkable 1930
season.

SLUGGISH DEFENSE AWAKENS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The USC defense spent the summer preparing for the
four-receiver, one-running-back formation that Purdue threw at the
Trojans on Sunday in the Pigskin Classic at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   They knew quarterback Drew Brees would keep the Trojans'
defensive backs busy all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did know,'' USC defensive coordinator Bill Young said.
``They just do an awful good job of (executing).''
</P>
<P>
   Make that a good job for one half. And, as USC defensive back
Daylon McCutcheon said after the Trojans' 27-17 victory: ``Great
teams do great things when the game is on the line. And the game is
on the line in the fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The great things in the second half included an interception by
middle linebacker Chris Claiborne, which set up the go-ahead field
goal, an interception and forced fumble by cornerback Antuan
Simmons and overall spirited play from the Trojans secondary.
</P>
<P>
   But in the first half, it was all Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   Brees, the undefeated prep quarterback from Texas, looked very
comfortable in his first game as a starter. The 6-foot-1, 204-pound
sophomore completed 18 passes in 27 attempts for 148 yards and had
touchdown passes of 3 yards to Gabe Cox and 9 yards to Cliff
Jackson as Purdue led 17-10. It would have been worse if Simmons
hadn't blocked a field-goal attempt with 1:17 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Eight receivers caught passes for the Boilermakers before
intermission and many times Brees would patiently roll out while
waiting for receivers to get open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made an average quarterback look like an All-American,''
Simmons said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half, we were like a new team,'' USC safety
Rashard Cook said. ``Our defense was flying around and flying to
the ball. We played like we expected ourselves to play.''
</P>
<P>
   USC's defensive backs were outstanding in the second half.
Simmons had nine tackles and set up the clinching touchdown with
his forced fumble. Ife Ohalete, who played nearly every defensive
play in the final three quarters after Grant Pearsall left with a
twisted knee, had seven tackles and two pass breakups. Cook had
seven tackles, Ken Haslip had three pass breakups and McCutcheon
had three tackles and two pass breakups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure we'll play against a better secondary all year,''
Purdue coach Joe Tiller said.
</P>
<P>
   Brees was 12 for 25 for 100 yards in the second half and was
intercepted by Claiborne and Simmons. The Boilermakers rushed for
39 yards after intermission and never got closer than the Trojans'
47-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest defensive play of the second half came late
in the fourth quarter when Brees' pass bounced off the shoulder
pads of the Boilermakers' Randall Lane and into the hands of a
diving Clairborne at Purdue's 27-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That play was all about heart,'' said McCutcheon, who had
tight coverage on the play.
</P>
<P>
   But, McCutcheon, being a three-year letterman, is well aware
that one scorching Sunday afternoon doesn't make a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only one game,'' said McCutcheon, who nearly entered
his name in the past NFL draft. ``It's important to win the opening
game, because it sets the tone for the season. But we have a long
way to go.''

   MAINZ, Germany _ After nearly a millennium of relative
obscurity, a medieval German nun has been born again into a state
of celebrity sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   Entire industries have grown out of the renaissance in the
popularity of St. Hildegard von Bingen, a Benedictine abbess,
writer, composer and holistic healer who seems to turn up
practically everywhere this year, from Cologne to New York, exactly
900 years after she was born.
</P>
<P>
   In concert with a full year of international birthday
commemorations, some of St. Hildegard's two dozen pieces of choral
music, now on compact discs, top some music charts.
</P>
<P>
   A brisk Rhineland tourist trade thrives in her honor, with one
glossy brochure urging pilgrims to ``tour Hildegard's historical
sites by motorcycle.''
</P>
<P>
   A chic publishing boom has filled some European bookstores with
reissues of her imagistic poetry and mystical philosophy along with
shelves of cookbooks and calendars and an estimated 1,000 other new
titles that range from theological scholarship to mass-market
paperbacks like ``Hildegard in a Nutshell.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's followers of St. Hildegard cannot seem to get enough of
the ``prophetissa teutonica,'' as one early admirer called her in
1206.
</P>
<P>
   In what some call Hildegard health care, mainstream pharmacies
in German-speaking Europe carry several brands of herbal remedies
under her name that are meant to treat everything from heart
disease to migraines.
</P>
<P>
   One firm alone, Jura KG, claims to distribute its products in
10,000 outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Fans munch St. Hildegard's whole-meal cakes, cookies and
dumplings made from the grainy dinkel flour that she recommended.
New Age adherents give symposiums on her advice for using crystals.
Southern Germany boasts a Hildegard health spa.
</P>
<P>
   In a German election year, politicians have joined bishops in
holding speeches in St. Hildegard's honor. Ministers in Bonn have
issued a Hildegard postage stamp (often sold out) and commemorative
coins.
</P>
<P>
   As a female founder of monasteries and a rebel in a
male-dominated church, she is also venerated by some women for her
distinctly feminist theology.
</P>
<P>
   Devotees of Bacchus also admire St. Hildegard, who wrote in one
of her medical texts, Causae et Curae _ or Causes and Cures _ that
``a wine that is pure cleanses the blood of its drinker.''
</P>
<P>
   In this Hildegard year, that advice has spawned Hildegard
wine-tasting seminars. At least three different brands of Rhine
wine are sold under her name.
</P>
<P>
   She even rocks. Angel Records in New York, a division of EMI
Records, produced an electronically synthesized version of her
canticles, or liturgical songs.
</P>
<P>
   After selling more than 300,000 and topping the Billboard list
for ``crossover'' productions _ a ranking of popularized classical
music _ Angel last year released a sequel called Vision II.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is Hildegard doing at the disco?'' asked one German
magazine incredulously.
</P>
<P>
   Like other celebrities, she is frequently in the newspapers.
Culture commentators and religion writers have been scratching
their heads in wonder at the popular abbess.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is being revered, commercialized and exploited as never
before,'' according to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
</P>
<P>
   St. Hildegard was born in 1098, but because her exact date of
birth was not recorded, the entire year has been opened to a
windfall of commemorations. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Ahead of her feast day on Sept. 17, pilgrims arrive daily _
sometimes 20 busloads a day _ to visit St. Hildegard's Abbey in
Eibingen on the Rhine, one of two 12th century monasteries she
founded, said Sister Philippa, a nun at Eibingen. Many visitors
come from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope will send an ambassador to the annual Eibingen
procession and mass on her feast day. Despite St. Hildegard's
powers of prophecy, which Pope Eugenius III confirmed as authentic
in 1148, it is unlikely she expected this sort of afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she was alive, she was not a pop icon by any means,''
said Benjamin Bagby, a co-founder of Sequentia, a Cologne-based
choral group that specializes in early music and has been credited
with St. Hildegard's revival.
</P>
<P>
   To rescue her from becoming a Benedictine Elvis _ as one
newspaper commented _ serious scholars and musicians like Bagby
have countered with hundreds of symposiums, lectures, concerts and
exhaustively researched museum exhibits. &QL;

</P>
<P>

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the giddy sense of celebration is
apparently shared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about every Catholic college in the country is doing
something to honor her,'' said a Northwestern University professor,
Barbara Newman, who has translated St. Hildegard's poetry and ranks
as one of the leading U.S. experts on St. Hildegard.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Lincoln Center has just performed her works to
sold-out audiences. Grace Cathedral in San Francisco is leading a
pilgrimage to Germany in time for her feast day, Sept. 17. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 120 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scholars come up with several reasons why the life and works of
a cloistered nun can loom so large across nine centuries. Perhaps
the most conspicuous stems from St. Hildegard's decision to situate
her convents in what is now some of the most heavily touristed
byways in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Eibingen monastery sits in the vineyards a few hundred
meters above the postcard town of Ruedesheim, trampled by 2.5
million tourists a year and often described as kitchy.
</P>
<P>
   Most come to drink and buy Rhine wine. It was only natural that
the local chamber of commerce created a ``1098-1998 Jubilee Year''
logo to promote a profusion of ``Experiencing Hildegard'' tour
packages. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Publishing houses also have driven her media resurrection. St.
Hildegard resonates powerfully in an era when publishing trade
groups report an unslackening demand for books and music with a
spiritual or religious theme.
</P>
<P>
   Riding the wave of New Age enthusiasm, many Hildegard fans take
from her what they want and do not bother to understand her in all
her complexity, said Gabriele Lautenschlaeger, a member of the
theological faculty at Wuerzburg University. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``She fits the slogan, `Jesus yes, church no,''' she said. &QL; 
St. Hildegard's life story also seems to fit Hollywood's dream
machine. At least two movie scripts are in the works about her,
said Paul Cremo, director of film and television projects in New
York at Sony Classical Records. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the monks in her first monastery, which she entered as
a hermit at the age of 8, her monastic life has been
well-documented. Revelations in the form of ``burning'' visions
overpowered the frail and often sick girl. She called herself a
``visio'' or mystical seer.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the charismatic abbess came to resent the domination
of monks and was ready to found her own monastery, taking 20
sisters with her. The monks fought her, partly because her status
anchored their fund-raising income.
</P>
<P>
   The secession was the first of several feuds with a
male-dominated church hierarchy that she won.
</P>
<P>
   Today many of her fans discover her first through her music,
which variously has been described as ethereal, mesmerizing,
austere, complex and exotic.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in her hymns had been dormant for about 800 years but
has proliferated over the past decade onto some two dozen compact
discs.
</P>
<P>
   Internet sites like www.Hildegard.com exist solely to sell her
music, which includes 77 canticles and a passion play that ranks as
Germany's first opera.
</P>
<P>
   Bagby at Sequentia said that publishers have a wide range of
interest in producing her music. ``Some just want to make money,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music industry,'' Bagby said, ``saw they could make a lot
of money selling something very simple and very spiritual. People
who wanted to simplify their lives, like stressed-out business
people, buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Professor Newman put it, ``Even a watered-down Hildegard
has more to offer than much of our current pop culture.'' &QL;

choral group that specializes in early music and has been credited
with St. Hildegard's revival.
</P>
<P>
   To rescue her from becoming a Benedictine Elvis _ as one
newspaper commented _ serious scholars and musicians like Bagby
have countered with hundreds of symposiums, lectures, concerts and
exhaustively researched museum exhibits. &QL;

<P>
   In the United States, the giddy sense of celebration is
apparently shared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about every Catholic college in the country is doing
something to honor her,'' said a Northwestern University professor,
Barbara Newman, who has translated St. Hildegard's poetry and ranks
as one of the leading U.S. experts on St. Hildegard.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Lincoln Center has just performed her works to
sold-out audiences. Grace Cathedral in San Francisco is leading a
pilgrimage to Germany in time for her feast day, Sept. 17. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Scholars come up with several reasons why the life and works of
a cloistered nun can loom so large across nine centuries. Perhaps
the most conspicuous stems from St. Hildegard's decision to situate
her convents in what is now some of the most heavily touristed
byways in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Eibingen monastery sits in the vineyards a few hundred
meters above the postcard town of Ruedesheim, trampled by 2.5
million tourists a year and often described as kitchy.
</P>
<P>
   Most come to drink and buy Rhine wine. It was only natural that
the local chamber of commerce created a ``1098-1998 Jubilee Year''
logo to promote a profusion of ``Experiencing Hildegard'' tour
packages. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Publishing houses also have driven her media resurrection. St.
Hildegard resonates powerfully in an era when publishing trade
groups report an unslackening demand for books and music with a
spiritual or religious theme.
</P>
<P>
   Riding the wave of New Age enthusiasm, many Hildegard fans take
from her what they want and do not bother to understand her in all
her complexity, said Gabriele Lautenschlaeger, a member of the
theological faculty at Wuerzburg University. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``She fits the slogan, `Jesus yes, church no,''' she said. &QL; 
St. Hildegard's life story also seems to fit Hollywood's dream
machine. At least two movie scripts are in the works about her,
said Paul Cremo, director of film and television projects in New
York at Sony Classical Records. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the monks in her first monastery, which she entered as
a hermit at the age of 8, her monastic life has been
well-documented. Revelations in the form of ``burning'' visions
overpowered the frail and often sick girl. She called herself a
``visio'' or mystical seer.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the charismatic abbess came to resent the domination
of monks and was ready to found her own monastery, taking 20
sisters with her. The monks fought her, partly because her status
anchored their fund-raising income.
</P>
<P>
   The secession was the first of several feuds with a
male-dominated church hierarchy that she won.
</P>
<P>
   Today many of her fans discover her first through her music,
which variously has been described as ethereal, mesmerizing,
austere, complex and exotic.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in her hymns had been dormant for about 800 years but
has proliferated over the past decade onto some two dozen compact
discs.
</P>
<P>
   Internet sites like www.Hildegard.com exist solely to sell her
music, which includes 77 canticles and a passion play that ranks as
Germany's first opera.
</P>
<P>
   Bagby at Sequentia said that publishers have a wide range of
interest in producing her music. ``Some just want to make money,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music industry,'' Bagby said, ``saw they could make a lot
of money selling something very simple and very spiritual. People
who wanted to simplify their lives, like stressed-out business
people, buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Professor Newman put it, ``Even a watered-down Hildegard
has more to offer than much of our current pop culture.'' &QL;

<P>
   MAINZ, Germany _ After nearly a millennium of relative
obscurity, a medieval German nun has been born again into a state
of celebrity sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   Entire industries have grown out of the renaissance in the
popularity of St. Hildegard von Bingen, a Benedictine abbess,
writer, composer and holistic healer who seems to turn up
practically everywhere this year, from Cologne to New York, exactly
900 years after she was born.
</P>
<P>
   In concert with a full year of international birthday
commemorations, some of St. Hildegard's two dozen pieces of choral
music, now on compact discs, top some music charts.
</P>
<P>
   A brisk Rhineland tourist trade thrives in her honor, with one
glossy brochure urging pilgrims to ``tour Hildegard's historical
sites by motorcycle.''
</P>
<P>
   A chic publishing boom has filled some European bookstores with
reissues of her imagistic poetry and mystical philosophy along with
shelves of cookbooks and calendars and an estimated 1,000 other new
titles that range from theological scholarship to mass-market
paperbacks like ``Hildegard in a Nutshell.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's followers of St. Hildegard cannot seem to get enough of
the ``prophetissa teutonica,'' as one early admirer called her in
1206.
</P>
<P>
   In what some call Hildegard health care, mainstream pharmacies
in German-speaking Europe carry several brands of herbal remedies
under her name that are meant to treat everything from heart
disease to migraines.
</P>
<P>
   One firm alone, Jura KG, claims to distribute its products in
10,000 outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Fans munch St. Hildegard's whole-meal cakes, cookies and
dumplings made from the grainy dinkel flour that she recommended.
New Age adherents give symposiums on her advice for using crystals.
Southern Germany boasts a Hildegard health spa.
</P>
<P>
   In a German election year, politicians have joined bishops in
holding speeches in St. Hildegard's honor. Ministers in Bonn have
issued a Hildegard postage stamp (often sold out) and commemorative
coins.
</P>
<P>
   As a female founder of monasteries and a rebel in a
male-dominated church, she is also venerated by some women for her
distinctly feminist theology.
</P>
<P>
   Devotees of Bacchus also admire St. Hildegard, who wrote in one
of her medical texts, Causae et Curae _ or Causes and Cures _ that
``a wine that is pure cleanses the blood of its drinker.''
</P>
<P>
   In this Hildegard year, that advice has spawned Hildegard
wine-tasting seminars. At least three different brands of Rhine
wine are sold under her name.
</P>
<P>
   She even rocks. Angel Records in New York, a division of EMI
Records, produced an electronically synthesized version of her
canticles, or liturgical songs.
</P>
<P>
   After selling more than 300,000 and topping the Billboard list
for ``crossover'' productions _ a ranking of popularized classical
music _ Angel last year released a sequel called Vision II.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is Hildegard doing at the disco?'' asked one German
magazine incredulously.
</P>
<P>
   Like other celebrities, she is frequently in the newspapers.
Culture commentators and religion writers have been scratching
their heads in wonder at the popular abbess.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is being revered, commercialized and exploited as never
before,'' according to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
</P>
<P>
   St. Hildegard was born in 1098, but because her exact date of
birth was not recorded, the entire year has been opened to a
windfall of commemorations. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Ahead of her feast day on Sept. 17, pilgrims arrive daily _
sometimes 20 busloads a day _ to visit St. Hildegard's Abbey in
Eibingen on the Rhine, one of two 12th century monasteries she
founded, said Sister Philippa, a nun at Eibingen. Many visitors
come from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope will send an ambassador to the annual Eibingen
procession and mass on her feast day. Despite St. Hildegard's
powers of prophecy, which Pope Eugenius III confirmed as authentic
in 1148, it is unlikely she expected this sort of afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she was alive, she was not a pop icon by any means,''
said Benjamin Bagby, a co-founder of Sequentia, a Cologne-based
choral group that specializes in early music and has been credited

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The flowers are back, glazed under cellophane, laid at
the railings of Kensington Palace and bearing the familiar moving
or mawkish messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Di: you will never be forgotten.'' ``Diana: in remembrance.''
``You will always be our Queen of Hearts'' _ those words written on
a card where blush-pink roses circle the serene face of ``England's
rose.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the first anniversary of the death of Diana,
Princess of Wales, time cannot weary her image, nor have all the
memorial tubs of margarine, tacky souvenirs or the infighting of
her relatives tarnished her stellar status.
</P>
<P>
   Diana, 36 when she died Aug. 31, 1997, in a Paris automobile
accident, is up there with Marilyn Monroe, confirmed as a
20th-century icon.
</P>
<P>
   One year after the sea of bouquets has been reduced to a
trickle, how can one assess an event that engulfed England and
seemed to mark a change of character from stiff upper lip to a
touchy-feely Oprah Winfrey society that Diana represented?
</P>
<P>
   And how fares a monarchy that seemed petrified and inert, as an
angry mob demanded that Queen Elizabeth quit Balmoral Castle for
Buckingham Palace and fly the flag at half staff in homage to the
disgraced princess?
</P>
<P>
   Diana's death may have seemed significant partly because it came
so soon after the election of Tony Blair as prime minister, which
was a genuine watershed in British society and a major generational
change.
</P>
<P>
   By associating himself with the ``people's princess'' and taking
control of events, Blair steadied the royal boat, although it was
constitutionally most unlikely that Parliament would have gone
through the complex motions of chucking out the monarchy and a
millennium of British history.
</P>
<P>
   But if time is the great healer, the royal family seems to have
benefited most from this process.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the shouts of the republicans have been drowned
out by the cheers for Prince William, who has turned 16 and taken
up the mantle of Diana, whom he so closely resembles. All hail the
charismatic future king!
</P>
<P>
   In this generational shift, the tetchy Prince Charles (relieved
of the constant irritant of the media-savvy antics of his former
wife) has become a benign, avuncular figure, photographed in his
English country garden or beside his children.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe the current spin, he is now as perfect a father
as he was once considered cold and uncaring.
</P>
<P>
   His prospects of marrying Camilla Parker Bowles, out of the
question when Diana was around as an injured party and scorned
wife, now look positively rosy.
</P>
<P>
   A carefully leaked story detailed Mrs. Parker Bowles' chance
meeting with William, from which she emerged gasping for a vodka
tonic. As an advance gift for his 50th birthday in November,
Charles was treated to a stage show by his sons, with Mrs. Parker
Bowles and her two children among the royal crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Spencer, Diana's brother, and the hero of the hour when his
inflamed funeral oration claimed William and his brother Harry as
the Spencers' ``blood family,'' has been the loser.
</P>
<P>
   After the press he had vilified caught him cheating on his
bulimic wife, Lord Spencer was branded a hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
   His sister's memorial at Althorp has been dismissed as a
``Dianaland,'' although it has been popular with the public. The
Spencer family will gather there Monday for a personal memorial
service.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed al Fayed, whose son Dodi was killed alongside Diana, has
become another loser.
</P>
<P>
   After supporting conspiracy theories about the car crash and
haranguing Frances Shand Kydd, Diana's mother, when they were
summoned to the Paris judicial investigation, al Fayed is losing
not only credibility but also the precious royal warrants that
adorn his Harrods store.
</P>
<P>
   So did Diana's death change anything? Or has it proved that
however good and noble a figurehead she was and remains for many
people (especially women who identified with her), the institution
of monarchy is stronger than one maverick individual?
</P>
<P>
   The resilience of the royal family and its capacity to close
ranks in crisis was proved after the abdication of 1936. But
whereas the exiled Duke of Windsor remained a perpetual outcast,
Diana, in death, has been easier to embrace than the divorced
princess who was stripped of her title and sent packing. Her memory
is back in the royal fold.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the white-haired Queen Elizabeth, a genial Prince
Charles with the sapling-tall Prince William and the extended royal
family gathered to celebrate the Queen Mother's 98th birthday last
month, it seemed hard to credit the convulsions that had shaken the
monarchy a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It is partly a natural dynastic process whereby interest moves
on to the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   Chastened by their perceived part in harassing Diana to her
death (and eager not to kill off the goose that lays the golden
crown) the media have promoted a raft of young royals _ especially
Zara Phillips, 17-year-old daughter of the Princess Royal.
</P>
<P>
   A picture of the Queen's granddaughter with a pierced tongue
alongside her cousin and buddy Prince William produced a memorable
tabloid headline: ``Spot the Stud!''
</P>
<P>
   The image of Diana herself remains as powerful as ever. But
without new pictures, the visual coverage will inevitably decline
after the current anniversary frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   That is also part of a natural public process of moving on.
Whatever feelings Diana's death defined about society, the
monarchy, celebrity or womanhood in the 1990s, that moment is over.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Santer, the bishop of Birmingham, expressed the current
mood. ``Remembering Diana is important,'' he said about the
anniversary. ``But so is letting go. It is time to let Diana rest
in peace.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 950. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In the blanket coverage given by the British press over the last
10 days, there have been some dissenting voices, including a
television program contending that the funeral and ``the mourning
after'' were far from a spontaneous outpouring of public emotion
showing a change in British character.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of England itself seems uncomfortable with the
popular beatification of Diana (think memorial candles as special
offers in the tabloid press). The anniversary was being marked by a
dignified vigil of prayer at Westminster Abbey on Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Archbishop of Westminster has even said openly that it is
time to ``get on with life and leave the kind of hype of the thing
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   And on BBC Radio, Cardinal Basil Hume, the spiritual leader of 4
million Roman Catholics in England and Wales, said, ``Diana was by
no means a saint, she never claimed to be, and it's very foolish to
pretend that she was,'' though he added, ``she was somebody whom we
all admired.''
</P>
<P>
   The royal family, which has requested that the anniversary be
used only as ``a time for personal reflection,'' will attend a
service Monday at Craithie Church on the Balmoral estate in
Scotland. William and Harry attended church services near Balmoral
on Sunday with their father.
</P>
<P>
   The 72-year-old Queen Elizabeth gave a muffled mea culpa through
a press briefing last week. An aide spoke of the royal family's
wish to absorb the lesson of Diana's ability to be in touch with
the people and to keep ``abreast of topics of public concern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The queen has listened hard since the princess died,'' the
spokesman said. ``The perception of the public was that the royal
family was not fully in touch with them. The change is one way of
making sure this can be redressed.''
</P>
<P>
   He was speaking of a ``fine tuning'' of the royal approach to
public life, which includes spending ``quality time'' with a few
individuals rather than a nod and a wave. It has produced Queen
Elizabeth's first visit to a McDonald's, a place where Diana would
famously feed her boys. &QL;

<P>
   LONDON _ The flowers are back, glazed under cellophane, laid at
the railings of Kensington Palace and bearing the familiar moving
or mawkish messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Di: you will never be forgotten.'' ``Diana: in remembrance.''
``You will always be our Queen of Hearts'' _ those words written on
a card where blush-pink roses circle the serene face of ``England's
rose.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the first anniversary of the death of Diana,
Princess of Wales, time cannot weary her image, nor have all the
memorial tubs of margarine, tacky souvenirs or the infighting of
her relatives tarnished her stellar status.
</P>
<P>
   Diana, 36 when she died Aug. 31, 1997, in a Paris automobile
accident, is up there with Marilyn Monroe, confirmed as a
20th-century icon.
</P>
<P>
   One year after the sea of bouquets has been reduced to a
trickle, how can one assess an event that engulfed England and
seemed to mark a change of character from stiff upper lip to a
touchy-feely Oprah Winfrey society that Diana represented?
</P>
<P>
   And how fares a monarchy that seemed petrified and inert, as an
angry mob demanded that Queen Elizabeth quit Balmoral Castle for
Buckingham Palace and fly the flag at half staff in homage to the
disgraced princess?
</P>
<P>
   Diana's death may have seemed significant partly because it came
so soon after the election of Tony Blair as prime minister, which
was a genuine watershed in British society and a major generational
change.
</P>
<P>
   By associating himself with the ``people's princess'' and taking
control of events, Blair steadied the royal boat, although it was
constitutionally most unlikely that Parliament would have gone
through the complex motions of chucking out the monarchy and a
millennium of British history.
</P>
<P>
   But if time is the great healer, the royal family seems to have
benefited most from this process.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the shouts of the republicans have been drowned
out by the cheers for Prince William, who has turned 16 and taken
up the mantle of Diana, whom he so closely resembles. All hail the
charismatic future king!
</P>
<P>
   In this generational shift, the tetchy Prince Charles (relieved
of the constant irritant of the media-savvy antics of his former
wife) has become a benign, avuncular figure, photographed in his
English country garden or beside his children.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe the current spin, he is now as perfect a father
as he was once considered cold and uncaring.
</P>
<P>
   His prospects of marrying Camilla Parker Bowles, out of the
question when Diana was around as an injured party and scorned
wife, now look positively rosy.
</P>
<P>
   A carefully leaked story detailed Mrs. Parker Bowles' chance
meeting with William, from which she emerged gasping for a vodka
tonic. As an advance gift for his 50th birthday in November,
Charles was treated to a stage show by his sons, with Mrs. Parker
Bowles and her two children among the royal crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Spencer, Diana's brother, and the hero of the hour when his
inflamed funeral oration claimed William and his brother Harry as
the Spencers' ``blood family,'' has been the loser.
</P>
<P>
   After the press he had vilified caught him cheating on his
bulimic wife, Lord Spencer was branded a hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
   His sister's memorial at Althorp has been dismissed as a
``Dianaland,'' although it has been popular with the public. The
Spencer family will gather there Monday for a personal memorial
service.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed al Fayed, whose son Dodi was killed alongside Diana, has
become another loser.
</P>
<P>
   After supporting conspiracy theories about the car crash and
haranguing Frances Shand Kydd, Diana's mother, when they were
summoned to the Paris judicial investigation, al Fayed is losing
not only credibility but also the precious royal warrants that
adorn his Harrods store.
</P>
<P>
   So did Diana's death change anything? Or has it proved that
however good and noble a figurehead she was and remains for many
people (especially women who identified with her), the institution
of monarchy is stronger than one maverick individual?
</P>
<P>
   The resilience of the royal family and its capacity to close
ranks in crisis was proved after the abdication of 1936. But
whereas the exiled Duke of Windsor remained a perpetual outcast,
Diana, in death, has been easier to embrace than the divorced
princess who was stripped of her title and sent packing. Her memory
is back in the royal fold.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the white-haired Queen Elizabeth, a genial Prince
Charles with the sapling-tall Prince William and the extended royal
family gathered to celebrate the Queen Mother's 98th birthday last
month, it seemed hard to credit the convulsions that had shaken the
monarchy a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It is partly a natural dynastic process whereby interest moves
on to the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   Chastened by their perceived part in harassing Diana to her
death (and eager not to kill off the goose that lays the golden
crown) the media have promoted a raft of young royals _ especially
Zara Phillips, 17-year-old daughter of the Princess Royal.
</P>
<P>
   A picture of the Queen's granddaughter with a pierced tongue
alongside her cousin and buddy Prince William produced a memorable
tabloid headline: ``Spot the Stud!''
</P>
<P>
   The image of Diana herself remains as powerful as ever. But
without new pictures, the visual coverage will inevitably decline
after the current anniversary frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   That is also part of a natural public process of moving on.
Whatever feelings Diana's death defined about society, the
monarchy, celebrity or womanhood in the 1990s, that moment is over.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Santer, the bishop of Birmingham, expressed the current
mood. ``Remembering Diana is important,'' he said about the
anniversary. ``But so is letting go. It is time to let Diana rest
in peace.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 950. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In the blanket coverage given by the British press over the last
10 days, there have been some dissenting voices, including a
television program contending that the funeral and ``the mourning
after'' were far from a spontaneous outpouring of public emotion
showing a change in British character.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of England itself seems uncomfortable with the
popular beatification of Diana (think memorial candles as special
offers in the tabloid press). The anniversary was being marked by a
dignified vigil of prayer at Westminster Abbey on Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Archbishop of Westminster has even said openly that it is
time to ``get on with life and leave the kind of hype of the thing
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   And on BBC Radio, Cardinal Basil Hume, the spiritual leader of 4
million Roman Catholics in England and Wales, said, ``Diana was by
no means a saint, she never claimed to be, and it's very foolish to
pretend that she was,'' though he added, ``she was somebody whom we
all admired.''
</P>
<P>
   The royal family, which has requested that the anniversary be
used only as ``a time for personal reflection,'' will attend a
service Monday at Craithie Church on the Balmoral estate in
Scotland. William and Harry attended church services near Balmoral
on Sunday with their father.
</P>
<P>
   The 72-year-old Queen Elizabeth gave a muffled mea culpa through
a press briefing last week. An aide spoke of the royal family's
wish to absorb the lesson of Diana's ability to be in touch with
the people and to keep ``abreast of topics of public concern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The queen has listened hard since the princess died,'' the
spokesman said. ``The perception of the public was that the royal
family was not fully in touch with them. The change is one way of
making sure this can be redressed.''
</P>
<P>
   He was speaking of a ``fine tuning'' of the royal approach to
public life, which includes spending ``quality time'' with a few
individuals rather than a nod and a wave. It has produced Queen
Elizabeth's first visit to a McDonald's, a place where Diana would
famously feed her boys. &QL;

MET'S MINAYA INTERVIEWS WITH DODGERS FOR GM JOB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Omar Minaya, the New York Mets' assistant general
manager, spoke to the Dodgers on Sunday, ending the first round of
interviews for their vacant GM position.
</P>
<P>
   Interim GM Tom Lasorda, who compiled a list of seven candidates
for the job, said he isn't sure if Gary Hughes, Florida's director
of player personnel, will be in this week. Hughes had been
scheduled for an interview before the end of the homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Minaya, 40, who made his reputation with Texas as a top scout in
Latin America, was the sixth candidate to interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have said they want a new GM in place by the end of
the regular season. The other candidates: Florida GM Dave
Dombrowski, Cincinnati GM Jim Bowden, former Yankees GM Bob Watson,
Atlanta assistant Dean Taylor, Baltimore assistant Kevin Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad thing is that all but one of these guys aren't going
to get the job,'' said Lasorda, including Hughes in the mix. ``Any
one of these guys could do what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Minaya considers himself a long shot because he never has been
the top man in running a major-league operation. But he impressed
Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really liked his knowledge of so many areas of the game,''
Lasorda said. ``Farm director, assistant GM, head of scouting
overseas. All of those are the kinds of areas we were looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   Hot bat: Mark Grudzielanek entered Sunday's game batting .250
(27 for 108) with no walks and just four runs since arriving in a
July 31 trade with Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Although Grudzielanek was starting to warm up, hitting in seven
of his past eight games, Sunday was his best effort with the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek went 3 for 3 with two runs. His seventh-inning
double was his first extra-base hit since Aug. 9 against
Pittsburgh, a stretch of 74 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an offensive player,'' hitting instructor Mickey
Hatcher said. ``He has gotten 200 hits in a season and made
All-Star teams. He's been pressing, but tonight he just relaxed and
did what he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Catcher Tom Prince learned he was playing just
minutes before game time. Charles Johnson could not get his arm
loose and was scratched. ``It was either sit from the beginning or
risk getting hurt during the game,'' said Johnson, rested for
Saturday's game after playing Friday night. ``It isn't anything
serious.'' ... Not only did he have a key two-run double in the
seventh, Prince threw out Edgardo Alfonzo attempting to steal in
the fifth. Prince has thrown out 10 of 22 baserunners this season.

GRIFFEY'S TWO HOMERS FUEL M'S ROUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ken Griffey Jr. returned to the home run record chase
Sunday and Bill Swift departed the Mariner starting rotation with
one of his best performances of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But their postgame moods were remarkably different following the
Mariners' 13-3 victory over the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Swift was happy with what he did _ holding the Yankees to two
runs and five hits over 62/3 innings. Griffey uttered his usual
``no comment'' when asked if his 46th and 47th homers proved that
his powerful swing is back and Roger Maris' single-season record
(61) is reachable.
</P>
<P>
   Only his bat sounded off in the series finale.
</P>
<P>
   The game was a total reversal of the first two in the series,
when the Yankees scored early and often and won both to clinch a
postseason berth. Griffey's three-run blast to right field in the
second inning off Yankee starter Hideki Irabu put Seattle in front
by seven runs, erasing most of the drama from the two teams' last
meeting of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team went quietly. Just when it appeared their rivalry
had cooled off:
</P>
<P>
   -- Two batters were hit by pitches, prompting a bench- and
bullpen-clearing (but incident-free) gathering near the mound;
</P>
<P>
   -- Mariner shortstop Alex Rodriguez and Yankee left fielder Chad
Curtis exchanged words after a play at second base;
</P>
<P>
   -- And one of the 55,341 fans jumped out of the left-field seats
carrying a football, running into center field to get Griffey's
autograph.
</P>
<P>
   The fan got a signature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an NFL ball and I signed it,'' Griffey said. ``He
already was in trouble, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Two security guards wrestled the fan to the ground, roughed him
up and carted him away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him running toward Junior and I thought about going
after him,'' said left fielder Shane Monahan, describing the
fifth-inning incident. ``But he had a `Griffey' jersey on so I
didn't think anything bad would happen. I figured I'd let the cops
take care of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a tad hard on the guy. They gave him a `chicken
wing', bending his arm behind his back and kicked him a few times
in the ribs.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey and Monahan were a tad hard on Yankee pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Each had two hits. Griffey drove in five runs. Monahan drove in
three.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his third-inning verbal battle with Curtis, Rodriguez
had three hits and scored twice. Joey Cora, Russ Davis and David
Segui chipped in two hits apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team showed some character, and Bill Swift did a great job
of pitching,'' manager Lou Piniella said. ``I'm proud of this
group; the way they got kicked around for two days and came back
shows character.''
</P>
<P>
   But the focus of the day fell on Griffey's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting four homers in August coming into this series,
Griffey hit three in three games. He hit 12 homers in September
last season to finish with a career-high 56.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he stayed back on the ball better the past three days
and kept his back (left) shoulder in,'' Mariner hitting coach Jesse
Barfield said. ``Can he break the record? If they pitch to him. Of
the three guys, (Sammy) Sosa is the best bad-ball hitter. Junior
and (Mark) McGwire hit strikes for home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Piniella, ``Junior hits them in bunches. Let's hope he
stays hot. He's got 47 and we've got a month to go. Let's see what
happens. I'd like to see it happen for a few people. Records are
made to be broken. This is getting exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Swift bored the Yankee fans for most of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off horrendous back-to-back starts, the right-hander went
to work with a four-run lead after Rodriguez, Segui, Davis and Rob
Ducey drove in first-inning runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they were tired, or I made good pitches,''
said Swift, who is being moved to the bullpen for the remainder of
this season to open a spot in the rotation for Mac Suzuki. ``I'm
happy with the way I pitched and it's a good way to go out (of the
rotation).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think long relief is going to be better for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Paniagua, Swift's replacement in the seventh inning,
started the late-game fireworks when he unintentionally drilled
Scott Brosius in the back with a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius left the game but wasn't seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee reliever Mike Buddie retaliated in the top of the eighth,
hitting Ducey in the leg immediately after throwing an identical
pitch that sailed between the batter's legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm out there to play baseball, not fight,'' Ducey said when
asked if he thought about charging the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you get two guys hit, it's serious,'' Brosius said.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Curtis touched off a brief scuffle when he failed
to slide as the Mariners turned an inning-ending double play.
Curtis veered off as he approached second base and Rodriguez took
exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in the heat of battle and I thought he should have slid
or gotten out of the way sooner,'' Rodriguez said. ``No big deal.''

LONG HAUL PAYS OFF FOR JOSEPH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Two years ago, Kerry Joseph was the No. 3
quarterback with the Cincinnati Bengals. Last summer, he was a
running back with the Washington Redskins until being released on
the final roster cut.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Joseph was one of five safeties retained by the Seahawks
when they cut their roster to 53 players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long road for me. I've been through a whole lot,''
Joseph said. ``After I got cut at running back, I kind of went into
the tank. I wondered if my football career was coming to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph's improbable journey included a side trip to the World
League this spring, where the former McNeese State quarterback
played safety for the league champion Rhein Fire and did it well
enough that the Seahawks decided to sign him the week before
training camp opened.
</P>
<P>
   Another mild upset was Robert Wilson beating out sixth-round
draft choice Bobby Shaw for the sixth wide receiver spot. Wilson
did it with his special-teams performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last three games, Robert Wilson has probably been our best
special teams player,'' coach Dennis Erickson said. ``We kind of
discovered him by playing a lot of people there during the
preseason and all of a sudden he stood out.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson never played special teams until he signed with the
Seahawks as a rookie free agent last year, when he spent most of
the season on the practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the guys who are here were big-time players at their
schools, so they didn't play special teams,'' said Wilson, who has
been sharing a room at an Eastside motel with Shaw since the team
returned from its Eastern Washington University training camp.
``It's something you have to learn to do. It's desire. It's
toughness, because you're going to get knocked down and knocked
out, but you've just got to keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph and Wilson overcoming long odds and stiff competition to
earn roster spots were the upside to a day when eight players had
to be cut.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson dislikes making any cuts, but Sunday's were the hardest
since he became Seahawks coach in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to release some pretty good football players,''
Erickson said.
</P>
<P>
   Included in Sunday's cuts were linebacker Michael Barber, who
started games the past two seasons; defensive lineman Carl Hansen
and Shaw, this year's sixth-round draft choices who could be
re-signed to the practice squad Monday; and running back Michael
Black and cornerback Joey Eloms, promising rookie free agents who
also could end up on the practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   Also released: guard Chris Brymer, defensive end Reggie Lowe and
center Greg Bloedorn. The Seahawks made eight cuts because they had
a World League exemption on last week's cut to 60 for Bloedorn, who
agreed to an injury settlement before being released.
</P>
<P>
   The moves, and any the club might make this week, are tied to
the Seahawks having less than $200,000 left under their salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Barber's $400,000 salary and special-teams performances that
were only adequate made him a casualty. There also is less than a
50-percent chance the Seahawks will claim a player who was released
by another team, and if they do, it will probably be a younger
player who could be signed for the NFL minimum.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Joseph and Wilson playing their way onto the
roster, another slight surprise was keeping four tight ends. The
Seahawks used their 53rd spot at that position because Deems May
also can be used as a third fullback and Itula Mili, a sixth-round
draft choice last year, has too much potential to pass on or try to
sneak through waivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down the road Itula could be really, really good,'' Erickson
said. ``We obviously didn't want to put him out there because we
would have never gotten him back.''

KARL TAKES ON ANOTHER UNDERDOG ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ What, you ask, was George Karl's greatest fantasy,
before signing a juicy $20 million deal with the Milwaukee Bucks
over the weekend?
</P>
<P>
   To coach Michael Jordan and the Bulls to the 1999 NBA title _
assuming there is a 1999 season in this locked-out, tuned-out NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Getting that gig in Chicago would have been one heck of a way
for Karl to prove his ability to handle the pressure, to win the
big one.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, with a chance to let His Airness do his thing, what
a way for Karl to sling a little humble pie into the faces of
Sonics owner Barry Ackerley and club president Wally Walker _ the
two fellas who labeled Karl ``The Incredible Leaking Man'' at his
dismissal proceedings in June, then sent Karl off to find work
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Which Karl did this weekend, to the tune of a whopping $5
million a year. It is the kind of career-affirming salary that puts
Karl in the same economic league as Rick Pitino and John Calipari
and the other heavy hitters of NBA coaching.
</P>
<P>
   The funny thing is, despite the juicy deal with the Bucks, not
much has changed for Karl. His wife will probably still have to bug
him to go deposit his paychecks or find some worthwhile tax
shelters.
</P>
<P>
   And even Karl would have to admit that, more than rebuilding a
perennial loser, he would rather be coaching Jordan and the
Jordanaires to their seventh title in nine seasons.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, his 6{ seasons in Seattle seemed to point Karl
in the direction of a better job in a bigger market, or at least
with a team already on the move up.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Terrell Brandon and Ray Allen are two great young
players, but Karl _ whose taste for winning is best fed by
competitive, committed veteran players _ would rather have a
wunderkind like Tim Duncan and David Robinson with whom to attempt
a title in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Or Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Or Patrick Ewing and Allan Houston at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Karl craves many things, not the least of which is to be
considered the most creative, forceful leader of NBA players in an
era where egos and salaries and expectations have gone mad.
</P>
<P>
   But now Karl will have to settle for something else. He will
have to prove he has the patience, tenacity and stomach to do what
Pitino is trying to do in Boston; what Calipari is doing in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   He will have to do what he has already done in Albany, N.Y.,
where he coached a CBA team named the Patroons to a championship
and incredible win record.
</P>
<P>
   He will have to do what he already tried in Cleveland and Golden
State, two other perennial losers.
</P>
<P>
   He will have to do what he has already done in Spain, with a
club team called Real Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   He will have to do what he was brought in to do by former Sonic
general manager and wheeler-dealer, Bob Whitsitt.
</P>
<P>
   So while Karl dreamed of the Bulls and titles and NBA glory, he
will settle for another challenge.
</P>
<P>
   And this makes perfect sense, even for a man who dreamed of
coaching the world's greatest player on one of the NBA's greatest
dynasties to yet another title.
</P>
<P>
   Because if nothing else, George Karl is an underdog. He is the
second-chance coach whose insecurities are matched only by his
healthy ego _ a combination that gives him color and an edge and
energy that are both taxing and fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   His players will love him and loathe him, just like other places
where his certain sort of anxious magic have worked.
</P>
<P>
   Now even Karl understands he has a tough task at hand. Judging
from how things are going for the Celtics and Nets _ two other
franchises trying to overcome years of futility _ Karl's job should
be at best frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Bucks owner Herb Kohl and general manager Bob Weinhauer
truly give Karl carte blanche _ the way Pat Riley was handed the
Heat franchise in Miami and told to do whatever he wants (including
tamper and infuriate the NBA commissioner) _ Karl has a few long
and winding seasons ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing Karl likes the bratwursts and beers in his new town.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing Karl thinks he better identifies with the
working-class, hard-working atmosphere of Milwaukee than the
tepidly unemotional climate in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   He will need some of those intangibles to make things feel good.
Otherwise, best pal and University of Utah coach Rick Majerus will
have to make a few extra pit stops through Wisconsin this winter,
just to keep his friend in good spirits.
</P>
<P>
   There is no amount of money that will assuage Karl's great big
love of pure and committed basketball _ which makes it somewhat
intriguing that Karl decided to leap at the brass ring of a
big-time, guaranteed contract instead of waiting for the
opportunity of a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   But if we have learned anything about George Karl, it is that he
is cat-like. He has more than one life. And all of those lives _
judging by the former ones, including his incarnation in Seattle _
are crazy and entertaining and action-packed. Karl's new ventures
are always full of thrills, verbal spills and surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Bucks make the playoffs next season?
</P>
<P>
   What do you think?

`HEROES OR KILLERS?' _ LAPD MEDALS, SUITS OFFER CONTRASTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PATRICK McGREEVY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ LAPD detectives Larry Winston and Phillip Wixon
are hero cops to many people.
</P>
<P>
   To others, they are trigger-happy killers.
</P>
<P>
   The clashing descriptions stem from the detectives' actions in
the same deadly gunbattle with robbery suspects outside a Ventura
County liquor store in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The detectives, members of the LAPD's controversial Special
Investigation Section, were seriously wounded in the close-quarters
firefight that left robbery suspect Robert Cunningham wounded and
accomplice Daniel Soly dead, with 27 gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Federal lawsuits allege the two LAPD veterans ``murdered'' Soly.
But Chief Bernard C. Parks believes the actions of Winston, 24-year
veteran, and Wixon, a 31-year veteran, qualify them to receive the
Los Angeles Police Department's coveted Medal of Valor at a
ceremony next week.
</P>
<P>
   An LAPD commendation board found that the pair displayed
``outstanding judgment and tremendous courage in the heat of a
deadly gunbattle with two vicious criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the robbers' parents charge the detectives shot
without warning and without identifying themselves as police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There comes a time when it is okay to call these brutal
misanthropes what they are, and that is murderers,'' reads one of
the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   That Winston and Wixon evoke such strong and contrasting
reactions is not surprising given the controversial history of the
Special Investigation Section.
</P>
<P>
   The detectives _ the first members of the 23-year-old unit to
receive the LAPD's highest honor _ dismiss the lawsuits'
allegations as untrue and irrelevant, and say they are proud of
their actions and the affirmation of the Medal of Valor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled to death. It's obviously the highlight of my
career,'' said Wixon, 53.
</P>
<P>
   Wixon took a bullet in the abdomen and returned to the job after
a nine-week recuperation.
</P>
<P>
   Winston, 43, who took six months to recover from a gunshot wound
to his groin, said he is flattered to share the Medal of Valor
ceremony this year with 17 officers who participated in the 1997
North Hollywood bank shootout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm honored, but there isn't a person in the (SIS) unit that
isn't worthy of it as far as I'm concerned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the SIS put Soly, 27, a fugitive parolee, and Cunningham
under surveillance, they were suspected of 24 armed robberies at
small businesses in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley and portions of
neighboring Ventura County.
</P>
<P>
   They financed a heroin habit by bursting into liquor stores and
fast-food restaurants with guns and their faces covered with ski
masks or bandannas. The heists grew increasingly violent as they
hit victims to force their compliance, police allege.
</P>
<P>
   Police caught a break when Soly's girlfriend tipped them off
that he had robbed a Pizza Hut in Simi Valley in Ventura County
while she sat in the car. But the investigation stalled without
enough evidence to arrest the pair so the SIS was brought in to
track them.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of July 26, 1995, eight undercover detectives
followed Soly and Cunningham to Southwest Liquor and Deli in the
quiet community of Newbury Park.
</P>
<P>
   The detectives said they saw the suspects get out of a white
Toyota Supra and pull bandannas over their faces before entering
the store, according to an LAPD report on the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Winston and Wixon decided to arrest the suspects when they
emerged from the store and were clear of bystanders, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives said the robbers got about $600 before they were seen
putting handguns in their waistbands as they ran to their car.
</P>
<P>
   Wixon, Winston and Detective Brian Davis moved in with their
cars to pin the robbers' car, but Cunningham stood up through a
sunroof and began shooting at Wixon and Winston, according to the
commendation report.
</P>
<P>
   Wixon was shot in the abdomen as he tried to jump out of his
car.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling to breathe, Wixon regained his composure and fired
several shotgun rounds at Cunningham, said the LAPD report, which
added that the suspect ducked back into the vehicle and continued
firing at officers.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Winston was hit in the groin by a shot from
another detective, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he lay wounded on the ground, Winston saw the suspects
continuing to fire,'' the commendation report said. ``Though
seriously wounded, Winston fired several more rounds at the
suspects'' in an effort to draw their attention away from his
wounded partner.
</P>
<P>
   Wixon said Soly began revving the engine of his car and pushing
against a police car, which Wixon feared would be pushed back onto
his wounded partner, the report said. The detective stood up,
exposing his position, to confront the driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to save his and his partner's lives, Wixon fired at
the driver and then held his weapon on the passenger while other
SIS detectives took the suspects into custody,'' the commendation
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite claiming in a criminal trial that the officers fired
first, without warning, Cunningham was held responsible for Soly's
death and was convicted of murder, robbery and the attempted murder
of three police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham is serving several life sentences in prison.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   As a result of this case, 24 other robberies _ blamed on
Cunningham, Soly or both _ were solved, cases closed.
</P>
<P>
   In awarding Wixon and Winston the Medal of Valor, and also
awarding SIS detective James Harris a distinguished service medal,
the commendation board concluded: ``The utter disregard for their
own personal safety displayed by these three detectives in order to
assist and protect their fellow officers is a tribute to all
members of the Police Department and to the entire law enforcement
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura County prosecutor Donald Glynn wrote to the LAPD that
the public owes the SIS detectives ``a debt of gratitude for their
continuing efforts to control the worst of the worst criminals in
our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Yagman, the attorney pressing the lawsuits, declined to
comment on the detectives' actions being honored with the Medal of
Valor.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit filed on behalf of Armand and Betty Soly, the
parents of Daniel Soly, Yagman alleges that the plainclothed
Winston and Wixon fired first into the suspects' car, without
identifying themselves as police officers, and that the suspects
returned fire in self-defense, not knowing that their attackers
were police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without announcing themselves as police (they) opened fire
with approximately 15 shotgun blasts and shots from handguns; all
with the intent of taking the law into their own hands, and
murdering the occupants of the vehicle,'' the lawsuit alleges.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also names the police chief, mayor, police
commissioners and City Council members, alleging they all tolerated
``a custom of excessive force.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy City Attorney Cory Brente, who is defending the officers
in the suit, said the detectives did not get a chance to identify
themselves before Cunningham shot Wixon.
</P>
<P>
   He said the criminal jury that convicted Cunningham of murder in
Ventura County did not buy Cunningham's claim that he was unaware
it was the police approaching them in several cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who else drives on the wrong side of the road and comes up
fast in front of you after you've committed a robbery?'' Brente
said. ``It's the police.''
</P>
<P>
   In arguing for acquittal in the criminal trial, Cunningham's
defense attorney urged a jury to send the message that SIS should
be disbanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``By their finding, the jury stated unequivocally that these
officers operated properly,'' Glynn wrote to the LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Barkat, who owns Southwest Liquor and Deli, said Wixon
and Winston deserve the medals for showing bravery in confronting
suspects who they knew were armed and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really appreciate what they did,'' Barkat said. ``They had
followed them. They knew something would happen. They did a very
good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston said he is not losing sleep over the lawsuits, knowing
the unit's actions will be defended by the city.
</P>
<P>
   Both detectives acknowledge that their work is dangerous, but
neither said it was hard to decide to return to the SIS when they
left the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be downright scary,'' Winston said. ``I had second
thoughts about whether I was going to come back to police work. But
when I made up my mind I was coming back there was no other place I
wanted to go (but SIS).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best job in the Police Department. There's a lot of
satisfaction. It's the kind of people we get off the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Wixon also said the shootout in Newbury Park in Ventura County
did not discourage him from staying with the SIS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the scaredest I've ever been, but it was scary,''
Wixon said. ``It's not much fun getting shot.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``Police work is dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   In deciding to stay with SIS, Wixon said he balanced the
experience of the Newbury Park shootout against what he says is the
esprit de corps of the SIS and the times he has put violent
criminals in jail or rescued innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the self-satisfaction of doing a good job, of getting a
kid back from kidnappers. The entire unit deserves an award for the
kind of work they do every day.''

DODGERS BEAT METS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As Gary Sheffield was being helped into the
trainer's room Sunday night, Jose Vizcaino remembered that game
nine weeks ago when his right ankle looked so bad he cried.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield was headed to the hospital after turning his left
ankle in an eighth-inning rundown during the Dodgers' 4-2 victory
over the New York Mets. But Vizcaino, who hasn't played since his
injury, forced a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``No swelling, that is a great sign,'' said Vizcaino, who
sprained his ankle June 21 and might not play again this season.
``Mine got so big I couldn't believe it. That doesn't mean Gary
won't be out, but I think we'll get him back.''
</P>
<P>
   With 25 games to play and trailing the Mets and Chicago Cubs by
seven games in the wild-card race, the Dodgers still are hoping.
</P>
<P>
   They played perhaps their most inspired game in weeks and gave
the crowd of 44,746 something more to think about than a postgame
concert with the Village People.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when relievers Jeff Shaw and Antonio Osuna were
exhausted and unavailable, former Met Dave Mlicki (8-6) pitched the
Dodgers' first complete game in more than two months.
</P>
<P>
   It also came in a game Eric Young said the team looked very down
until his two-run single tied the game 2-2 with two outs in the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I was flat,'' Young said. ``We needed a lift and we got
one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers got another when reserve catcher Tom Prince, a
last-minute substitute for Charles Johnson, doubled home two more
runs in the seventh that gave the Dodgers their first victory in
the series.
</P>
<P>
   Prince was the first batter to face Turk Wendell, who took over
for Mets starter Masato Yoshii (5-8).
</P>
<P>
   But with a season of disappointments, the focus was on
Sheffield, who wasn't expected to play Sunday after spraining his
left thumb on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Sheffield) is a gamer in every sense of the word,'' manager
Glenn Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield wasn't the only big-name player injured.
</P>
<P>
   Former Dodger Mike Piazza, who was 10 for 16 in his past five
games, left in the third inning after Young fouled a ball off his
right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's not all right, he couldn't play,'' said Mets manager
Bobby Valentine. ``I think it's muscular. The trainers will let us
know tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Piazza, the Mets generated little offense against
Mlicki.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Baerga homered with one out in the second and Edgardo
Alfonzo added another to open the third.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo, who won Saturday's game with a home run off Shaw, also
beat the Dodgers Aug. 2 with a ninth-inning double.
</P>
<P>
   But Mlicki settled down and did not allow a runner to second the
rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really didn't mean any more playing my old team,'' said
Mlicki, 7-2 since joining the Dodgers on June 4. ``I knew we had a
tired bullpen so I just got on a roll and kept on going.''
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki got the runs he needed in the seventh when Bobby Bonilla
opened with a single to right. Mark Grudzielanek, who had his first
three-hit game as a Dodger, doubled to left. Bonilla came racing
around third, but third-base coach Joey Amalfitano put on the
brakes.
</P>
<P>
   That got rid of Yoshii, who now has just one victory in his past
16 decisions, but Prince was waiting. He hit a ground-rule double
that bounced into the lower stands near the left-field foul pole.
</P>
<P>
   But the mood changed in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   With Sheffield at third and Raul Mondesi at first, Mondesi was
picked off first. He got caught in a rundown but was tagged out by
Baerga, who then threw to the plate. Mets catcher Jorge Fabregas
got Sheffield hung up. Sheffield stayed alive for several moments
as Fabregas threw to Alfonzo to make the tag.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sheffield's last attempt to stop he caught his left foot
in the turf and went down. He writhed on the ground in pain and had
to be helped off the field by trainer Charlie Strasser and hitting
instructor Mickey Hatcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprains are better when they are on the outside of the
ankle,'' Vizcaino said. ``That seemed to be where his was. He is
too good to lose. We sure all hope we don't.''

McCUTCHEON TURNING INTO LOUD LEADER 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB MIECH  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC cornerback Daylon McCutcheon has seen enough
mediocre play by the Trojans in his career. But he hasn't heard
enough, which he plans to change as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most versatile USC football player, McCutcheon
showed off his agility Sunday afternoon against Purdue with a bevy
of big plays in the Trojans' 27-17 victory before 56,623 at the
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would mess up in the past, and I'd sit there and sit
there, and wait and wait, and nobody would say anything,''
McCutcheon said. ``And then there's two or three games left in the
season, and it's too late to say anything because it doesn't
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't wait for that. I'll get it done, and I won't stand for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCutcheon admitted that he had a big mouth against the
Boilermakers, which he will use as he sees fit throughout the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, we're a family,'' McCutcheon said. ``When you're a
family, you'll get yelled at by your mom or your dad, and you'll
get mad at your brothers or sisters. But deep down, you know I'll
be the first to be there in bad times. I'll be on you, I'll jump on
you.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I make a mistake, I want guys to jump on me. And when
you do well, I'll be the first to congratulate you.''
</P>
<P>
   None other than Chris Claiborne, a junior linebacker considered
to be the most talented USC front-line player, took heat from
McCutcheon on a day when the on-field temperature hit 118 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's showing more leadership this year,'' Claiborne said of
McCutcheon. ``And it is rubbing off on a lot of guys, and me. He'll
get on us, and I was listening to him a lot (on Sunday). I was
messin' up, and I take it as nothing but constructive criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   McCutcheon, 21, shut down every Purdue receiver who went up
against him at his left corner slot, he rushed every Boilermakers
punt from the left end and he returned a kickoff 25 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's special,'' said defensive end Sultan Abdul-Malik. ``He
can play offense and he can play special teams. You want your best
players out on special teams, and he's definitely one of our
best.''
</P>
<P>
   McCutcheon, who wears No. 1 on his uniform, said he just wants
to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do anything they want me to,'' he said. ``I just stand on
the sideline and wait for my number to be called. I wouldn't mind
running a few routes and catching a few passes, whatever they want
me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He nearly caught one against Purdue deep in Boilermakers
territory at the end of the third quarter. But he did get an assist
when he popped the ball from wide receiver Randall Lane's hands,
and Claiborne snatched it just before it hit the ground.
</P>
<P>
   USC took over at the 31-yard line, and four plays later senior
kicker Adam Abrams booted a 45-yard field goal that gave the
Trojans the lead for good at 20-17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Chris had just talked on the sideline, about how one of
us had to come up with a play,'' McCutcheon said. ``(Secondary)
coach (Dennis) Thurman talks all the time about how, when it gets
heated, how the good players make plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the crowd yelling, but I thought it was just because I
had stripped the ball from the receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   McCutcheon hopped from a television interview to a room for a
radio show, talked with one reporter in an equipment hall and then
met a dozen or so writers at his locker stall.
</P>
<P>
   That's where his younger brother Marcus, 14, had been waiting
for 40 minutes or so. Marcus McCutcheon will begin playing football
on the frosh-soph team at Huntington Beach Edison High this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he had a pretty good game,'' Marcus said of his older
brother. ``He could have picked one pass on the sideline, and
another had to be thrown just perfectly in the end zone. It wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he wants to play some offense, but mostly he wants to
win. After the intrasquad scrimmage, he talked about being more of
a leader. And he's showing it. He's a great role model.'' &QL;

PAYOFF POTENTIAL FOR HIGH TECH GREAT, BUT IT'S EASY TO GET BURNED

   LOS ANGELES _ The numbers are staggering in their simplicity:
Anyone who put $10,000 in Microsoft stock in 1986 would have $2
million now.
</P>
<P>
   Bought $10,000 worth of Amazon.com a year ago? It's worth
$84,300 now. Waited until Jan. 1 to buy America Online? Your
$10,000 is now worth $31,271.
</P>
<P>
   The fact of the matter is, technology stocks, especially
Internet companies, are hot. Despite last week's sell-off,
technology stocks remain the darlings of the investment world and
as alluring to Wall Street as the apple was to Eve.
</P>
<P>
   But the tech world can bite back.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, shareholders of MRV Communications saw their
holdings fall 14.8 percent in Thursday's big sell-off and then 52.6
percent on Friday when the company announced quarterly earnings
wouldn't be as strong as first believed. MRV makes
telecommunications equipment.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just one example. Shares of Shopping.com lost 67
percent of their value from Monday through Friday last week; shares
of computer chip maker LSI Logic Corp. have lost 59 percent of
their value in a year.
</P>
<P>
   So how does one find the golden stock amid all the dross? Here's
advice from mutual fund managers, analysts and professional
investors who make a living trying to distinguish the real gold
from fool's gold.
</P>
<P>
   Tip No. 1 _ Look for a fast-growing market and pick out its
leading companies.
</P>
<P>
   The market's revenues should be growing in double-digits, and
the higher the growth rate the better, said Peter Rogers, director
of technology research at Volpe Brown Whelan &AMP; Co., a San Francisco
investment banker.
</P>
<P>
   One such market, he believes, is the communications sector,
which includes the Internet, wireless and digital switching
equipment areas.
</P>
<P>
   Look for companies whose own growth rates are outpacing the
market overall. That means they are grabbing market share, Rogers
said.
</P>
<P>
   When a company's product sets the standard for the industry,
such that other products and services have to be compatible with it
and it would cost a ton to switch to another system, you've got a
possible winner, according to the book ``The Gorilla Game: An
Investor's Guide to Picking Winners in High Technology.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Microsoft did. It set the standard for PC operating
systems first with its MS-DOS and then Windows, defeating Apple and
IBM's OS/2 system.
</P>
<P>
   In communications equipment, Cisco, Lucent, 3Com and Ascend are
the choices of Gerard Hallaren, co-manager of the $1.1 billion
Invesco Strategic Technology Fund in Denver, whose 10-year average
annual return is 21.78 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the software and data services market, he likes America
Online and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Tip No. 2 _ Consider slower-growing industries, but pick out
innovators.
</P>
<P>
   Even in mature markets, investors can find a winning stock if
the company has innovative new products or services.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Rogers said the graphics software sector is a $3
billion market that is barely expanding. But an innovative company
called Visio has grown an average of 70 percent a year since 1995,
taking business away from competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Tip No. 3 _ Determine whether the market's growth rate can
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Is the market's expansion a short-term deal _ such as the Y2K
service sector _ or will it continue to grow? Is the rate of growth
of new users increasing?
</P>
<P>
   The market's potential must be broad-based, its growth expected
to spin forward into the future. One such area is the Internet, as
technologies, services and products continue to support and expand
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Tip No. 4 _ Once a promising company is identified, examine its
product cycles.
</P>
<P>
   The company must continue to introduce new, innovative products
relatively quickly, Rogers said. Don't pick companies that depend
on just one product without much in the way of innovation. That
makes them vulnerable to rivals.
</P>
<P>
   For Internet companies that don't have traditional products, an
important yardstick is their ability to attract visitors, said
Derek Brown, an Internet analyst at Volpe Brown Whelan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Top tier companies like Yahoo!, Excite and Lycos had enormous
run-ups (in their stock prices) because they are the leading
aggregators of consumers online,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors should also look at the strength of the company brand
and the value of its distribution partnerships, said Brown, citing
Disney's investment in the search engine Infoseek and NBC's
interest in Cnet, a network of news and technology Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   However, not everyone agrees with this strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, which is doubling traffic every 100 days, is still
in its early stages and promising companies today might not be the
leaders tomorrow since the landscape changes quickly, said Michael
Murphy, author of ``Every Investor's Guide to High-Tech Stocks and
Mutual Funds'' and editor of the California Technology Stock Letter
in Half Moon Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone remembers successful companies like Cisco, but they
forget about the scores of losers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turf is littered with them,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   In the rapidly changing Internet sector, early winners may be
pushed out. He cites First Virtual Holdings, whose online payment
system generated initial excitement. But when the paradigm of
paying over the Internet changed, the company lost favor. Its stock
is now at $2 from an initial public offering price of $9.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a lot of good ideas out there, and sometimes investing
in a good idea works out,'' Hallaren agreed. ``But this is a very
competitive world, so we concentrate on companies with good
fundamental revenue and earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy's law: Wait until a company achieves good sales and
profit growth, then invest in them.
</P>
<P>
   Tip No. 5 _ Evaluate the company's competitive position, its
financial strength and the quality of its management.
</P>
<P>
   Find out how well the company stacks up against its rivals,
Rogers said. Does it have dominance? Or is it barely keeping ahead?
</P>
<P>
   Also, buy into a company if its sales and pretax profit growth
rates are at least 15 percent a year each, Murphy said. In
addition, companies should spend at least 7 percent of revenues on
research and development.
</P>
<P>
   That's because intellectual assets _ such as patents and
technical knowledge whose values are not listed on the balance
sheet _ not brick and mortar, are key factors in the success of a
technology company, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of focusing on the stock's price-to-earnings ratio,
which measures the relative expensiveness of a stock, Hallaren
prefers the price-to-sales ratio _ market capitalization divided by
sales in the prior four quarters. The higher the ratio, the higher
the expectation of a bright future for the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have two companies with the same P/E, both are in the
same industry, but one is priced at five times sales and the other
at two times sales, the one with five times sales is a much more
efficient company,'' Hallaren said.
</P>
<P>
   Price-to-earnings still matter, but quality takes precedence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking to buy good things, not cheap things,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephen Marchel, a 36-year-old stockbroker, is a modern-day
nomad. Over the past five years, he has bought and sold three
homes. So when he went to buy a $560,000 house in New Jersey a year
and a half ago, his mortgage broker introduced the idea of a
no-cost mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Marchel's paying $10,000 in closing costs, his broker
added about an eighth of a percentage point to his interest rate.
``I didn't expect to be in this house long,'' Marchel says. ``So it
made sense to keep up-front costs as low as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The no-cost mortgage is the latest financing and refinancing
strategy to hit the U.S. housing market, which has been one of the
hottest in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   With mortgage rates nearly the lowest they've been in 20 years
and with personal incomes rising, homes are selling in record
numbers. This has made the mortgage-lending business extremely
brisk _ and competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the no-cost mortgage. The idea emerged in the early 1990s,
when some lenders' 30-year fixed-mortgage rates fell as low as 6.8
percent. It came back with a bang early this year, when rates
started to slide again, most recently to 6.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``No-cost mortgages have been around,'' says Keith Gumbinger,
vice president at mortgage research firm HSH Associates in Butler,
N.J. ``They've come out at times of particularly high refinance
activity coupled with low interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the no-cost mortgage works: Borrowers pay no points,
no closing costs, and no fees for appraisals, credit checks, or
legal services.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they have two options: They can tack those fees on to
the loan _ that is, a $200,000 mortgage becomes $210,000, $10,000
being the closing costs.
</P>
<P>
   Or they can increase the interest rate by three-eighths to
five-eighths of a percentage point, depending on the size of the
mortgage (the bigger the loan, the smaller the increase).
</P>
<P>
   So instead of doling out $10,000 in closing costs and fees on a
$200,000 mortgage with a 7 percent interest rate, you could pay no
costs and fees and get a 7.5 percent rate.
</P>
<P>

   ``There's really no downside to a no-cost mortgage,'' says
Richard Roll, president of the American Homeowners Association.
``It minimizes the up-front cost, and all the interest in
deductible.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a no-cost is more expensive through the life
of the mortgage. Bumping the interest rate up from 7.08 percent
(the current average rate, according to HSH) to 7.58 percent on a
$200,000 mortgage will add about $70 a month, or $25,000 over 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   For whom does this make sense? For people like Marchel, who
don't stay in their homes for very long _ they won't have to pay
all that extra interest.
</P>
<P>
   When Doug Miller, who has been commuting between Denver and San
Francisco since founding a computer-software company two and a half
years ago, decided to refinance his home, the no-cost option
worked.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of paying $2,000 in closing costs, he increased the
interest rate by three-eighths of a point. The higher interest
costs will be negligible, since he is selling his house so he can
move to San Francisco permanently.
</P>
<P>
   No-cost mortgages also make sense for people who would rather
invest in stocks and bonds than in a down payment for a house or
for people whose money is already in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have to cash stocks out to come up with $4,000 (in
closing costs), you'll have to pay capital gains and it's no longer
going to be a performing asset,'' HSH's Gumbinger says. ``That may
not be the best allocation of your assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Who's offering no-cost mortgages? Mostly mortgage banks and
brokerage houses, plus banks and savings and loans that have big
mortgage-lending divisions.
</P>
<P>
   But be careful: Some lenders claim to offer no-cost mortgages
but actually provide a rebate _ not a bad deal except that while

   Stephen Marchel, a 36-year-old stockbroker, is a modern-day
nomad. Over the past five years, he has bought and sold three
homes. So when he went to buy a $560,000 house in New Jersey a year
and a half ago, his mortgage broker introduced the idea of a
no-cost mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Marchel's paying $10,000 in closing costs, his broker
added about an eighth of a percentage point to his interest rate.
``I didn't expect to be in this house long,'' Marchel says. ``So it
made sense to keep up-front costs as low as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The no-cost mortgage is the latest financing and refinancing
strategy to hit the U.S. housing market, which has been one of the
hottest in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   With mortgage rates nearly the lowest they've been in 20 years
and with personal incomes rising, homes are selling in record
numbers. This has made the mortgage-lending business extremely
brisk _ and competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the no-cost mortgage. The idea emerged in the early 1990s,
when some lenders' 30-year fixed-mortgage rates fell as low as 6.8
percent. It came back with a bang early this year, when rates
started to slide again, most recently to 6.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``No-cost mortgages have been around,'' says Keith Gumbinger,
vice president at mortgage research firm HSH Associates in Butler,
N.J. ``They've come out at times of particularly high refinance
activity coupled with low interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the no-cost mortgage works: Borrowers pay no points,
no closing costs, and no fees for appraisals, credit checks, or
legal services.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they have two options: They can tack those fees on to
the loan _ that is, a $200,000 mortgage becomes $210,000, $10,000
being the closing costs.
</P>
<P>
   Or they can increase the interest rate by three-eighths to
five-eighths of a percentage point, depending on the size of the
mortgage (the bigger the loan, the smaller the increase).
</P>
<P>
   So instead of doling out $10,000 in closing costs and fees on a
$200,000 mortgage with a 7 percent interest rate, you could pay no
costs and fees and get a 7.5 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
   That might not sound like a good deal, but remember: Interest
costs are tax-deductible; closing costs are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really no downside to a no-cost mortgage,'' says
Richard Roll, president of the American Homeowners Association.
``It minimizes the up-front cost, and all the interest in
deductible.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a no-cost is more expensive through the life

$200,000 mortgage will add about $70 a month, or $25,000 over 30

   American scientists claim they've found the bit of the human
brain that decides whether or not a thing is worth remembering.
Though lots of brain areas hum into action when looking at a view
or a photograph, it's only the right pre-frontal lobe that decides
whether or not to log it in the memory banks.
</P>
<P>
   That at least accounts for President Clinton's selective memory
for what he gives young women. It's because of his right
pre-frontal that he's still being asked about the dress, the
brooch, the hatpin and the volume of Walt Whitman's poetry that he
allegedly gave Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It's not prevarication or mendacity that he's guilty of here,
just that darned wayward lobe.
</P>
<P>
   But of all the gifts Clinton ``could have given'' the lovely
Monica, the most significant is that volume of poems. There's an
eerie conjunction between the shaggy-bearded seer of American
letters and the clean-cut lothario of the Oval Office that has not
been properly explored until now.
</P>
<P>
   The President's admiration for Whitman goes beyond a literary
appreciation of his immensely long, meandering rhapsodies of
Americana. Clinton also gave his wife a volume of Whitman as a
wedding present.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible he dishes out Walt's collected works to any
females he feels attracted to, as a warning of what they may expect
to encounter at his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's most famous poem is ``Song Of Myself,'' an epic burst
of crowing narcissism. It doesn't take much hindsight to see how
Clinton might identify with it.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Whitman actually asks, ``Have you outstripped the
rest? Are you the President?'' And we can imagine Bill striding the
swirly carpet of the White House, book in hand, nodding vigorously,
before going on to the section containing the words, ``Divine am I
inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touched
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Got that, girls? There's nothing grubby or degrading about
anything you may be asked to do, since the presidential droit de
seigneur enables it.
</P>
<P>
   Those who've read Christopher Hitchens' revelations about what
Clinton and Monica got up to in private _ the ``unconsummated oral
sex'' she performed on his clothed and vertical frame, followed by
Lewinsky's stepping back, removing her kit and doing a little dance
to encourage her inamorata to pleasure himself _ may marvel at the
one-sided nature of the business.
</P>
<P>
   And now that she's told the grand jury how he fondled her both
upstairs and down (as I'm afraid we used to say in our teens), you
may wonder why he didn't go the whole hog.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, it seems, is also in Whitman's poem. ``I merely
stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,'' he writes. ``To
touch my person to someone else's is about as much as I can
stand.''
</P>
<P>
   It all becomes startlingly relevant, as Whitman/Clinton
describes someone performing nameless indignities on him: ``On all
sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs / straining the udder
of my heart for its withheld drip / behaving licentious toward me,
taking no denial... Unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare
waist...''
</P>
<P>
   Blimey! There's even a moment when, pre-climatically, he cries,
``Enough! Enough! Enough!... Stand back!'' _ as Clinton undoubtedly
directed his raven-haired intern.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a poem that doubled as an instruction manual
in the erotic proclivities of the First Philanderer, it's this one.
</P>
<P>
   How poignant that it even prefigures his own remorseful
confession _ that ever after he was so comprehensively shafted by
Linda Tripp, Kenneth Starr and Lewinsky herself, he had to admit it
was his own fault.
</P>
<P>
   How do those other lines of Whitman go? ``I am given up by
traitors, I talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am
the greatest traitor.'' &QL;

   Those who've read Christopher Hitchens' revelations about what
Clinton and Monica got up to in private _ the ``unconsummated oral
sex'' she performed on his clothed and vertical frame, followed by
Lewinsky's stepping back, removing her kit and doing a little dance
to encourage her inamorata to pleasure himself _ may marvel at the
one-sided nature of the business.
</P>
<P>
   And now that she's told the grand jury how he fondled her both
upstairs and down (as I'm afraid we used to say in our teens), you
may wonder why he didn't go the whole hog.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, it seems, is also in Whitman's poem. ``I merely
stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,'' he writes. ``To
touch my person to someone else's is about as much as I can
stand.''
</P>
<P>
   It all becomes startlingly relevant, as Whitman/Clinton
describes someone performing nameless indignities on him: ``On all
sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs / straining the udder
of my heart for its withheld drip / behaving licentious toward me,
taking no denial... Unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare
waist...''
</P>
<P>
   Blimey! There's even a moment when, pre-climatically, he cries,
``Enough! Enough! Enough!... Stand back!'' _ as Clinton undoubtedly
directed his raven-haired intern.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a poem that doubled as an instruction manual
in the erotic proclivities of the First Philanderer, it's this one.
</P>
<P>
   How poignant that it even prefigures his own remorseful
confession _ that ever after he was so comprehensively shafted by
Linda Tripp, Kenneth Starr and Lewinsky herself, he had to admit it
was his own fault.
</P>
<P>
   How do those other lines of Whitman go? ``I am given up by
traitors, I talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am
the greatest traitor.'' &QL;

<P>
   BUFORD, TEXAS _ Roll into Buford, a town that straddles the
Interstate 10 about 40 miles east of El Paso in the Texas desert
and there is no mistaking you have arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``NON-STOP BEAUTIFUL LADIES'' flickers one sign in garish red
neon, perched high on a giant pilon. ``ADULT BOOKS'' says another
across the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Most towns would announce themselves a little differently.
Perhaps a notice about church services, about the proud record of
its high school sports teams, or information about a sister-city in
some village in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Buford does not bother with any of that. There is no school and
the only church is a mobile one _ a converted trailer truck parked
in a gas station courtesy of Truck-Stop Ministries, Inc. of
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Buford, in other words, is a place long on carnal distractions,
making it massively popular with the hundreds of truck drivers who
pull in here every night, and very short indeed on civic niceties.
And for that, it may be about to pay a very high price.
</P>
<P>
   If the fathers of the surrounding El Paso County have their way,
Buford may soon be headed for the Texas history books. They want
this dump gone.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is about to send in the bulldozers (although the
landscape might benefit from it). But, in its latest maneuver to
impose its own tough ordinances on the fast-multiplying sex
businesses here, the county is moving to have Buford declared null
and void.
</P>
<P>
   It can do so, it says, because even though Buford was
incorporated as a city in 1962, it never held elections to chose
local officials as is required by law.
</P>
<P>
   Notice of the town's threatened extinction is contained in a
copy of the legal writ from the El Paso District Attorney's Office
pinned on a notice board inside Petro, the biggest of Buford's gas
stations.
</P>
<P>
   The action is titled, ``The State of Texas v. the Unknown
Pretend Mayor of the Purported City of Buford.'' It goes on to
argue that since Buford indeed has never had any elected officials,
it does not, in fact, exist.
</P>
<P>
   It concludes, ``As the incorporation of the purported City of
Buford appears to be void, the Unknown Returned Buford officials
are subject to being removed from their offices, and the franchise
of the purported City of Buford is subject to being declared
void.'' In other words, bye bye Buford.
</P>
<P>
   Or, more accurately, bye bye the Red Parrot, the Green Door,
Sals _ little more than a shack described by one resident as a
``rickety titty bar'' _ and the other five or six other sex
establishments in town.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over Buford began back in March, when police raided
the Green Door and the Red Parrot and arrested several of their
workers. The owners were told they were in violation of county
codes that forbid sex businesses from operating within 1000 feet of
homes, schools, churches and of each other.
</P>
<P>
   The owners replied that because Buford was incorporated as a
city, the codes did not apply to them. Hence county's writ.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the city of Buford is declared void, then we have every
right to enforce the law in this area,'' said Assistant Country
Attorney, Edie Castello. ``If not, if we don't have the authority,
it will be open season for strip clubs to open over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Randall, the minister who holds services every Sunday
morning for a handful of drivers in his trailer truck, welcomes the
initiative. It is not just the sex shops themselves, he says, but
the prostitution that has sprung up in the parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot them set it up with the ladies on their CB radios even
before they get here,'' he explained on Sunday as he busied himself
topping up tiny plastic beakers with red wine and snapped crackers
into a bowl for communion. ``We are surrounded by garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   In the sex shops themselves, they are defiant. ``They don't want
us around,'' growls Ernie, the manager of the Green Door that
offers ``California-Style Private Booths'' for movie viewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I don't know if they can do this. We declared a
township and I don't know if they can just wipe us out.'' He adds:
``We are completely out of the way and hidden out here, so I don't
see we are doing harm to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners of the businesses have hired their own lawyer who
will argue that what the County is doing is itself illegal. For the
city to be de-incorporated, says Sergio Gonzalez, approval would
first have to be granted by 51 percent of its 50-odd permanent
residents in a town referendum.
</P>
<P>
   There is one other possible course of action for Buford _ to do
what it was supposed to do 36 years ago and actually hold those
elections before the county can enforce its writ. But who, one
might ask, would want to be mayor of a place such as this? Ernie
for Mayor? Not even he is interested. &QL;

ANGELS PLAY SPOILER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The call came through to Helen Robinson, the legendary
Red Sox switchboard operator who has known them all, from Don Aase
to Al Zarilla, so no one had to tell her the identity of the voice
on the other end during Sunday afternoon's 8-6 loss to the Anaheim
Angels.
</P>
<P>
   After being serenaded by the crowd of 31,476 on his 80th
birthday, Ted Williams was calling to say thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told Helen he was deeply touched,'' said Sox broadcaster
Sean McDonough, who had informed the Fenway fans that Williams was
watching at home before leading them in the singing of ``Happy
Birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams's fondest wish before he dies, he said, is to see the
Sox win the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only got one wish, too,'' said Mo Vaughn, whose three-run
home run in the fifth inning drew the Red Sox within a run, 7-6,
but wasn't enough to prevent the Angels from taking the rubber
match of this three-game set and the season series, six games to
five.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of all the great players in the past. You've got a lot
of great players who have been in this clubhouse and stepped out on
this field. When we do win it, we will be doing it for the present
team and all the guys who put their time in making the Red Sox what
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Vaughn reminded his listeners, the Sox are not yet
a playoff team. Their lead in the wild-card race, after the Texas
Rangers also lost Sunday, remains eight games with 28 to play. But
even though the Angels, who lead the AL West by three games over
Texas, could be a first-round opponent in a rematch of their
memorable '86 showdown, Vaughn wanted no part of that discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Especially after the Red Sox lost their first series since
dropping two of three to the Indians in Cleveland July 21-22. This
was their 12th series since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't gotten there yet,'' Vaughn said. ``They haven't
gotten there yet. The playoffs are a whole different thing. It's
not for us to look at. We still have to take a game-by-game
approach. If you relax or slack off, an eight-, nine-, 10-game lead
can drop that fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Red Sox took a 2-0 lead two batters into the bottom
of the first, as Darren Lewis tripled into the left-field corner
and John Valentin followed with his 18th home run and second in two
games, off Angels starter Jeff Juden of the Salem Judens.
</P>
<P>
   Party time? Not so fast. The Angels tied the score in the second
against Sox starter Tim Wakefield on Garret Anderson's 305-foot
home run just inside the Pesky Pole, Anaheim's first extra-base hit
of the series after 21 straight singles.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, the Angels parlayed two walks, two passed balls, a
bunt single by Darin Erstad, a 55-foot roller by Tim Salmon down
the third-base line that stayed fair, newcomer Gregg Jefferies's
two-run double to the gap in left-center, and an infield out for
four runs and a 6-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That whole inning started with a leadoff walk, then two passed
balls, then another walk,'' said Wakefield (15-6), losing for the
first time in seven decisions since the Indians beat him July 21.
``I've always prided myself on damage control. But they got that
dribbler off the plate for a run, I made a good pitch to Jefferies,
and he doubled in two runs. I couldn't stop the bleeding today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels added a seventh run off Wakefield in the fourth when
Gary DiSarcina was hit by a pitch, took second on a wild pitch, and
scored on Erstad's bloop single to center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of a crazy game,'' Vaughn said. ``They got a lot of crazy
hits off Wake. A lot of guys on base, and the one big hit by
Jefferies.''
</P>
<P>
   Play was held up in the middle of the fourth for the serenading
of Teddy Ballgame. Nomar Garciaparra, the first batter after play
resumed, launched his 28th home run just to the right of the
420-foot sign, and an inning later Vaughn followed with a mammoth
442-foot drive well up into the center-field bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   But Angels reliever Shigetoshi Hasegawa (7-3) shut out the Red
Sox on one hit for the next 3 1/3 innings, striking out Valentin
with a runner on third to end the seventh, and DiSarcina's infield
hit that glanced off Garciaparra's glove and rolled into short
center field accounted for the Angels' final run in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the key to the whole game was Hasegawa,'' Jimy
Williams said. ``He shut us off, he shut us down.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Sox slouch toward September with 79 wins, one more
than they had all of last season, with one game left in August. One
month left in the regular season, and wishing season begins.
</P>
<P>
   And everyone in New England knows what else happened the year
Teddy Ballgame was born. Who knew the wait would be 80 years and
counting?

PATRIOTS MADE IT THROUGH SAFE AND SOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Thankfully for the Patriots, the most
dangerous time is over.
</P>
<P>
   With Saturday night's meaningless 24-7 victory over the
meaningless Philadelphia Eagles came the end of the meaningless
season. As most people understand, the only thing that can give the
exhibition season meaning is if your players start being carted off
on stretchers, an event that has bad meaning for both the people
involved and the team that employs them.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Pete Carroll's Patriots, that did not happen
this summer, and that is the best thing any team can get out of
meaningless season. Thus, when New England travels to Denver to
open its season next Monday night, Drew Bledsoe will be healthy and
Terry Glenn will be healthy and Bruce Armstrong will be as healthy
as a guy can be after he's played pro football for nearly a dozen
years and Ben Coates will be healthy and everyone else on offense
who matters will be healthy, and that is a healthy situation.
</P>
<P>
   Across the line of scrimmage, Willie McGinest will be healthy
and Ty Law will be healthy and Ferric Collins will be healthy and
Lawyer Milloy will be healthy and Ted Johnson will be very healthy
after signing his new contract and everyone else who matters on
defense will be healthy, and that is an even healthier situation.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation is, rookie running back Robert Edwards and
cornerback Tebucky Jones might even be healthy. Steve Israel won't
be healthy, of course, but that is no longer a news bulletin now,
is it?
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, one thing seemed evident about these New
England Patriots after they made their final cuts Sunday, and that
was this: They may not have a running game but they have something
more important. They have the most talent in the AFC East, and that
talent is healthy. And that means the rest of the division is
looking at a serious problem when the Patriots come into their
towns, because in the end, it is talent that wins in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches are important and schemes are important and coaches with
schemes are especially important, but coaches with schemes but no
talent end up with teams that are unimportant. Those coaches end up
with teams that resemble the exhibition season. They become
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   So, all things being equal and all hands (and knees) being
healthy, what might you look forward to this season from the
Patriots?
</P>
<P>
   You might expect another 10-6 season, at worst, and 11-5 at
best.
</P>
<P>
   You might expect another AFC East title, at least one home game
in the playoffs, and 4 1/2 months to brag that your team is better
than their team as long as their team isn't in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Might you expect a Monday night win to open the season? Probably
not, at least not if you go by what you see, as the football
philosopher Bill Parcells likes to say.
</P>
<P>
   If you do that, you must go by the historical evidence until
something happens to alter that reality, and the evidence indicates
New England hasn't beaten the Broncos in Denver since the Roosevelt
Administration ... Teddy Roosevelt's administration.
</P>
<P>
   If the question is, are the Patriots talented enough to beat the
Broncos in Denver next Monday night, the answer is yes. That is
especially true now that these Broncos have an offensive line that
is replacing 60 percent of its starters, a rookie starting at
strong safety, and a quarterback who should have quit while he was
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But if the question is, will they do it, history says no. That
said, the normal response from these Patriots would be to argue
that that was then and this is now and it's all history and this is
a different team and so forth and so on. But the fact of the matter
is that these Broncos have beaten these Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The last three years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   By an aggregate 105-24.
</P>
<P>
   And they're healthy, too.
</P>
<P>
   But don't lose heart over this, because anything can happen in
football if you have talent. And the Patriots have at least as much
of that as the Broncos, with the exception of one position. And you
know what position we're talking about, so let's not beat a dead
horse (or a dead running game) any longer.
</P>
<P>
   The key thing to remember about next Monday, though, is that it
is Week 1, not Week 18, which means it is one game, not one and
done. The Patriots' season opener is not as meangingless as an
exhibition game, but it is the next best thing, because if they win
it means nothing if they don't keep winning and if they lose it
means nothing as long as they don't keep losing.
</P>
<P>
   What means more is that when you look at the Colts and the Bills
and the Jets and the Dolphins, you do not see a team that is better
than the Patriots, so who cares what happens in Denver in the long
run? New England's AFC East rivals are not better on offense and
not better on defense and not better on special teams, so what's
left to debate about, local cuisine?
</P>
<P>
   Any of those teams might beat the Patriots in a game because
anything can happen when a ball is shaped the way a football is.
But none of the teams in the AFC East can honestly argue this
morning that they wouldn't trade their 53 guys for Carroll's 53
guys. So while any one of them might beat the Patriots in an
afternoon, none should beat them in a season.
</P>
<P>
   What we have here in New England with a new season dawning is a
playoff team. Nothing that happens in Denver short of injuries will
change that, win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   Now all they have to do is go give those facts some meaning.

IRWIN'S MONEY IN THE BANK 
</HEADLINE>
 CLASSIC-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL HARBER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, Mass. _ Maybe they should rename the PGA Senior Tour
the Hale Irwin Retirement Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, who didn't play his best golf and complained about his
shot-making, gutted out a 4-under-par 68 Sunday for a 15-under 201
and a two-stroke victory in the BankBoston Senior Classic at
Nashawtuc CC. It was his sixth victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The victory pushed Irwin over the $7 million plateau in Senior
Tour earnings, making him the fifth player to reach it. Irwin, who
counted BankBoston among his nine 1997 titles, also joins Don
January (1983-84), Chi Chi Rodriguez ('86-88), and Bob Charles
('89-90) as the only champions to successfully defend a title at
Nashawtuc.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't come easy.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Sigel, who won one of his two US Amateur titles at The
Country Club in Brookline in 1982, blitzed the front nine, shooting
a 6-under 30. Hot nines are Sigel's specialty. He fashioned the
Senior Tour's best nine-hole score this year when he ran in seven
consecutive birdie putts at the Bell Atlantic Classic for a
sparkling 27.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's front nine wasn't a record setter, but it was music to
his ears _ his six birdies gave him the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The front nine was pretty neat,'' said Sigel. ``I guess my
putter has some feelings. It doesn't want to go in the closet.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Sigel opened the door for Irwin by making two bogeys
down the stretch. He failed to get up and down from a green-side
bunker on No. 16, missing a 4-footer for par. After making a heroic
birdie on No. 17, Sigel hooked his tee shot into the junk along the
left on the par-5 18th and never recovered. ``I wasn't prepared for
the driver at 18,'' said Sigel, who shot a 66 to finish with a 203
total, good for second place. ``I had hit 3-iron off that tee all
week, so it was a weird feeling, even though I feel it was the
right shot. I thought I had a chance to win. I had to have some
help from the leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Second-round co-leader Joe Inman (71) and David Graham (68) tied
for third at 204, while Norwood's Allen Doyle (69) and Al Geiberger
(71) tied for fith at 205.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin opened the door early, and if anyone on the leaderboard
had put together a great round, the tournament was for the taking.
Sigel's 66 and John Jacobs's 66 (tied for 36th at 214) were the
best rounds of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin started off with a bogey 5 on the opening hole _ his only
bogey of the week _ and luckily saved par on No. 3. ``I was more
bothered by my par on the third hole than I was by my bogey because
I hit it so poorly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have the start I hoped to have. Thankfully, my
putting pulled me through and I hit some opportune iron shots,''
added Irwin, who hit a 6-iron to 20 feet and knocked it in on the
365-yard sixth hole. He drilled a 25-footer for a birdie 2 on the
200-yard eighth to get back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   But it was on the back nine where Irwin won the tournament and
Sigel lost it. While Sigel was KO'd by a pair of bogeys, Irwin
drilled three birdies to put away the title. Irwin needed only a
tap-in on the 538-yard 10th hole for a birdie 4 to go to 13-under.
</P>
<P>
   He fired up a 6-iron to 6 feet on the par-4 12th and knocked it
in to go to 14-under and take the lead from Sigel.
</P>
<P>
   On the 15th, he nearly holed his 9-iron and drained the 3-footer
to go to 15-under and essentially put the champagne on ice.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he cautiously two-putted his way home in even par.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third time this season that the reigning PGA Senior
Tour Player of the Year has successfully defended his title. He
also did it at the PGA Seniors' Championship and the Las Vegas
Seniors Classic. This was the 19th official Senior Tour victory in
his career, tying him for seventh place with Gary Player on the
all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the wins are wonderful,'' said Irwin. ``What is
particularly pleasing is to come back to a place where you've won.
Nashawtuc is a great little course. This is one of the best events
on the Senior Tour.'' He should say so. He has finished first twice
and second once in his three appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin collects $150,000 for his victory, increasing his 1998
earnings to $2,251,750. If he continues his current success, he
could become golf's first $3 million winner. ``I was wondering when
somebody was going to mention that,'' said Irwin. ``It will be a
pretty hard chore to get to $3 million. I'll have to keep up this
level of play if I'm going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   His level of play has been spectacular. He has not been out of
the top five in 16 starts this year. His average tournament check
has been a whopping $140,734. ``I'll probably play in six, maybe
seven more tournaments,'' said Irwin, who doesn't want goals like
passing the $3 million dollar mark affecting his game.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, all he has to do is play his normal game and his
retirement fund will get even bigger.

CHANG LEAVES HAARHUIS BROKEN MAN 
</HEADLINE>
 PRO CHAMPIONSHIPS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Just eight points of the 130 played were the
difference in the match. Michael Chang won 69, Paul Haarhuis 61
Sunday in their title battle at the MFS Pro Championships at the
Longwood Cricket Club, a 6-3, 6-4 Chang triumph.
</P>
<P>
   It was that even. Chang, the fourth seed and 22d-ranked, won his
first tournament in 13 months, since he claimed the Legg Mason
Classic in Washington. This was his third final since then and the
seventh time in eight matchups that Chang, who has overcome
tendinitis in his left wrist as well as a knee injury, has defeated
the 85th-ranked Haarhuis, who got into the tournament through a
wild card.
</P>
<P>
   The deciding factor in the match, played before 6,800, was that
Chang held his serve six times in break situations, while Chang
broke Haarhuis twice in five sets. Chang became the first American
to take the title since 1984, when Aaron Krickstein won it.
</P>
<P>
   Chang now has won 32 career titles; this was his 20th on the
hardcourt. He also grabbed a check for $45,000. Haarhuis, who was
appearing in his first final in 2 1/2 years and is known mainly for
his doubles play, earned $26,000. At the same time the players'
rankings changed _ Chang is now 20th for Monday's US Open and
Haarhuis will be in the low 60s.
</P>
<P>
   There were two break chances for Haarhuis in the fifth game of
the first set and one more in the seventh game. Then, in the second
set, there were three more, two in the second game and another in
the eighth. Chang, who has 341 wins on hardcourt, leading all
active players, held off each break point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was trying to be a little bit tougher on those
points,'' said Chang. ``Obviously, you don't want to get to that
situation, but if I'm able to go out and hit a service winner, then
all the better. It makes it easier.''
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh game of the first set, with the score 30-all,
Haarhuis belted a forehand up the line that landed wide, and he
followed that with a backhand into the net. That made it 4-2,
Chang. Then Chang served for the set in the ninth game, giving up
just one point while winning on an ace to the forehand side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to change that much in the second set because I
felt the first set I was just as good,'' Haarhuis said. ``I had my
chances, I created chances. I just didn't come up with the right
shots at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second set, Chang got past Haarhuis in the ninth game,
Haarhuis double-faulting, the shot floating quite wide. ``I just
mistimed it, I guess,'' Haarhuis said. ``I went for a deep second
serve. I guess I hit the frame with the ball.'' That made it 5-4,
Chang. In the 10th game, at 30-all, Chang socked a forehand passing
shot cross-court, and then he punched in an overhead winner for the
match.
</P>
<P>
   The two had had some practice sessions together during the week,
and Chang figured it would be a difficult matchup. One of their
previous matches was a five-setter in the 1993 Wimbledon opener, a
Chang victory.
</P>
<P>
   All the pressure was on Chang; he was the seeded player. And
there was the huge gap in rankings. But Chang didn't look at it
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having been in this situation before, I don't think about
rankings,'' Chang said. ``He got a wild card into this tournament,
but he normally would have been able to get straight into it. But
his wrist was hurting and he was out two or three months off that,
and that's why his ranking has dropped.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt comfortable through the whole match, until I was
match-point down,'' said Haarhuis. ``He just played the big points
better. I had more break points but I didn't convert on a single
one and he converted twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we flipped a coin and it falls the other way, I would have
won. My other matches I felt he was the better player and today I
didn't feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Haarhuis and partner Jacco Eltingh defeated Chris Haggard and
Jack Waite in doubles, 6-3, 6-2, to share the winners' check of
$21,830.

FOES QUESTION GORDON'S TIRES 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ The winning crew chief and the second-place owner
did not exchange any punches. And, as far as we know, there were no
reporters ``snooping around'' Jeff Gordon's Chevy Monte Carlo,
looking for a bottle of androstenedione. So at least this is not a
story of the New Hampshire International Speedway becoming the site
of a midafternoon talk show. But that's not to say the necessary
elements weren't in place Sunday. They were. You don't have to be
Oprah, Montel, Jerry, or Sally to recognize jealousy and
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   You already know that no one frisked Gordon after he won his
ninth Winston Cup race of the season, an improbable victory at the
CMT 300. Nope. NASCAR officials didn't touch the man when it was
over. But they were very interested in his tires. That's right.
Gordon has 17 top five finishes (more than anyone) and 10 straight
top five finishes (more than anyone), but it's not because of the
silver-tinted Nikes he wore as he drove his car at 127 miles per
hour.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the shoes; it was the tires.
</P>
<P>
   Tires. That's what Gordon's crew chief, Ray Evernham, and Jack
Roush _ the owner of second-place finisher Mark Martin's car _ were
talking about near the track's garages after the race. But it
wasn't the kind of talking that friends do, unless they are friends
who want to end their relationship. Evernham didn't like that Roush
went on the radio after the race and suggested that there was
something foul about his crew's tire changing. He also didn't like
it when NASCAR officials impounded his tires and would not allow
him to break down his pit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to get off my race team's back,'' Evernham said
before leaving the track. ``It disgusts me that a grown man
(Roush), supposed to be that intelligent, is not paying attention.
Why do they keep trying to take wins away from my guys?''
</P>
<P>
   Roush and others couldn't understand how Gordon won this race.
We're talking about a man who immediately lost his pole and quickly
fell to 17th place. To make things worse, he noticed that his car
was ``tight.'' So his crew adjusted the air pressure in his tires
and, during a pivotal pit stop, decided to loosen it by changing
two right-side tires instead of all four. That means, late in the
race, Gordon was speeding on two good tires rather than four. He
was going just over 127 on lap 278, 22 laps from the finish. A
skeptic would say he should have been finished. If you tried
traveling at 65 m.p.h. on the Mass. Pike with two good tires, you
would find yourself in the breakdown lane, waiting for the Triple A
tow trucks. That didn't happen with Gordon. It was just the
opposite. He had the nerve to roll into victory lane with a smile _
and a flat tire.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after, the howls started to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they don't find anything, is (Roush) going to stand up
and say, `Those guys just beat us?''' Evernham said. ``Is that
what's going to happen? I don't like people screwing with the race
team. They do whatever they can to take away the feeling my guys
have in victory. When it's all said and done and they don't find
anything _ and they won't _ is he going to apologize for saying the
things he said on the radio?''
</P>
<P>
   We can tell you that there were 90,000 people here and that a
poll of the crowd may have revealed that 89,000 couldn't stand
Gordon. It would not be surprising if many people rose at 5 a.m.
and crept through hours of traffic on a two-lane road just for the
chance to boo Gordon. Two hours before the race, two men walked
outside the stadium with a huge flag that read, ``Jeff Gordon's
Crying Towel.'' Gordon says lots of fans write him letters and give
him encouragement. A few of them were here, courtesy of the Make A
Wish Foundation. The majority, we presume, watched the race on TV.
</P>
<P>
   This always happens with champions, no? The officials always
treat them better. They are always allowed to create their own
standards. They must be pumping their bodies with illegal
substances and ... pumping/deflating their tires with illegal air.
Or maybe Gordon is corking his tires. Perhaps his voice sounded
kind of funny Sunday because there was helium in his tires,
simultaneously making his car go faster and tweaking his vocal
cords.
</P>
<P>
   Really, if Roush truly wants to scale his frustration, he could
start a Dealing With Jeff Gordon Peer Group. This is a driver, only
27, who has broken many hearts on Sunday afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe that kid won another race?'' Dale Earnhardt
said. ``Two tires and away he goes. I don't know how he does it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Hamilton said he saw country singer Jerry Reed before the
race. ``What was his big song? `When You're Hot, You're Hot'?''
Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is hot. He is so hot that people are targeting his tires,
expecting to find something more than hot air. Gordon will tell you
that he probably shouldn't have won. Midway through it, he just
wanted to sneak in the top 10. Then he thought of the top five.
Later, he sat up in his seat and said, ``Shoot, we can win this
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He did. It was his fifth win in his last six races. He left here
Sunday on his way talking about his next race in Darlington, S.C.
Maybe someone there will accuse him of having a gamecock in his
tires. Another theory, much more unpopular, is that Gordon is the
best at what he does.

ODD-MONGERING WILD BUNCH HAS FAR-OUT COOKOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ALEX ROTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You know it's a Wild Bunch party when you're
handed a glossy resume from a guy with a live python wrapped around
his neck.
</P>
<P>
   Or when you spot a transvestite in thigh-high leather boots
discussing the film business with a man whose body piercings
include a hoop ring through his upper gum.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was barbecue day for the Wild Bunch, a loose group of
bikers/actors/entertainers, many with tattoos and body art, who
provide Hollywood with a healthy supply of movie villains and
wackos.
</P>
<P>
   Snippets of small talk included ``Weren't you in that Jeep
Cherokee commercial?'' and ``Try to guess the size of my new pet
rat.''
</P>
<P>
   Turtle was there, and so were Smokey, Doc, Big Jackie and Lady
Di (a man). There were women without teeth and men without eyebrows
and people who could claim dual memberships in the Hells Angels and
the Screen Actors Guild.
</P>
<P>
   The group has about 140 members who specialize in playing
rough-and-tumble types, mainly as movie extras. Most have two
things in common: a desire to succeed in the film business and a
physical appearance that tends to make children gawk.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, I scare people,'' admitted Mistress Eva, a
leather-G-string wearing transvestite who hovers at 6 feet 7 inches
when wearing his high-heeled boots.
</P>
<P>
   He said his professional opportunities have exploded since he
began showing up to casting calls as a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cost me my marriage,'' he added, fingering his nipple
rings. ``But the experiences I've had, I wouldn't trade for the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The group was formed three years ago by aspiring actors Rico
Bueno and Ron Traylor, and its members have had roles in such films
as ``Waterworld,'' ``Face/Off'' and ``Escape from L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   And they've been getting a lot of publicity lately. Saturday's
barbecue attracted a People magazine reporter, a British journalist
and a Korean television crew.
</P>
<P>
   Among the entertainers who showed up Saturday were a
professional fire breather, an actor who plays a cackling fiend in
a Pacific Bell caller ID commercial, and a man who stars as a
vampire lord in the new Wesley Snipes movie, ``Blade.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor in ``Blade'' is named Erl, and his body decorations
include rings in his ears, tongue, gums, back of neck, stomach,
nipples and nose bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Just for the heck of it, he also had an operation on his stomach
to create a vertical flap of flesh that protrudes above his
bellybutton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just call it a handle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He's done most of his own body art himself, including tattoos on
a particularly sensitive area below his waist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hardest thing I've ever done in my life,'' the 60-year-old
former truck driver said. ``I put myself in shock a couple of
times. Really painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Shred, professional fire breather and certified animal
wrangler, attended the barbecue with his 12-foot pet python, Eve.
</P>
<P>
   The snake has made appearances in several films and is always a
picture of equanimity, Shred said. The same can't be said for some
of the people who encounter her.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Eve got loose on a set where most of the extras weren't
told a snake was being used in the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was mass havoc,'' Shred recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's barbecue was a mellow affair compared to the
``clothing optional'' bashes of the past, host Kerri Tobin said.
Tobin described one recent party as ``an all-out flesh fest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We earn the name, definitely,'' he said. ``You don't get to be
in the Wild Bunch without earning it.''

CHANG A POPULAR CHAMPION 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ It runs in the family: running.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Chang's 96-year-old great-grandmother in Guangzhou,
China, trots up the stairs to her fifth-floor walk-up apartment
several times a day, and might be on the tennis tour herself if she
had a better serve.
</P>
<P>
   If his grandparents hadn't run out of the People's Republic in
1949 a few steps ahead of the Mao Zedong takeover mob, Chang
wouldn't have been born in the USA and might be living in Shanghai
instead of serving tennis balls at such game rooms as Longwood
Cricket Club.
</P>
<P>
   It was Longwood Sunday where Chang reclaimed the oldest
professional tennis tournament (the MFS Pro, born the US Pro in
1927) for the natives. Most people thought MFS stood for Meddling
Foreigners' Sunroom, and couldn't remember the last time an
American won a tourney that was launched on a vacant lot in
Manhattan 71 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it was Aaron Krickstein out of Detroit, outpointing the
Argentine Jose Luis Clerc way back when a president lied about
inappropriate behavior with Iran and Nicaragua and was considered a
hero _ 1984. In fact, since the tourney went bust in New York and
relocated in The Bean in 1964, only three other US citizens have
made it all the way: Bob Lutz and Jimmy Connors, 1972 and 1973,
Eddie Dibbs in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean that Bostonians don't have a broader view.
They've loved such foreign victors as Rod Laver, Bjorn Borg, and
Guillermo Vilas. But somehow the crowds all week at Longwood seemed
to be pulling for Chang, who makes road-runners seem dodo birds.
</P>
<P>
   They took him to their hearts for a couple of reasons. He is a
tiny guy with a large ticker who's had to stick up for himself
against bullies like Ivan Lendl, Stefan Edberg, and Pete Sampras,
and has done it very well, a David with racket instead of sling.
Sometimes he beat up on them by making them look like statues,
running them right out of the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   And the folks recognized him for what he's been, a genuine
champion _ French Open ruler in 1989 _ with 32 titles in his kick,
a candidate one day for the Hall of Fame, a guy who wouldn't
understand ``quit'' if he could find it in a dictionary. Chang was
a name everybody knew as Longwood and MFS struggled to run a good
tournament, worthy of Boston, after seven years of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   But aficionados also saw Chang as a sneakered replay of another
diminutive French boss, Napoleon, and wondered if he's swerving and
groping toward his own latter-day Waterloo. Napoleon burst from
exile for an 1815 comeback that didn't work. Chang, exiled from the
winner's circle for 13 months, ended his driest spell in a decade
(fading from No. 2 to 22) with his 6-3, 6-4 victory over Paul
Haarhuis Sunday, and senses comeback. But was it really?
</P>
<P>
   Too soon to tell. Only 26, Chang, like Jim Courier and others
for whom every point is a baseline war, may be battled-out. He
might be a tennis version of a game, milling prizefighter who
doesn't own a knockout punch to make shorter work of his foes, and
finds his body more susceptible to injury.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was a joyful afternoon for those many who admire
Chang's first-class spunk, sportsmanship, and spirited pursuit of
the best he can be _ as well as elusive tennis balls he hunts down
like a bird dog on speed.
</P>
<P>
   He was good-natured even when he accepted one of his prizes, a
wristwatch. Isn't that the traditional retirement gift?
</P>
<P>
   However, Chang's legs, which have carried him farther, faster,
than Betty Grable's took the actress, aren't retired. That was
obvious as he made the Dutchman, the best little Haarhuis in the
Netherlands, hit too many balls.
</P>
<P>
   The customers applauded warmly as Chang talked about his
astounding French Open triumph of 1989. ``I believe God wanted me
to win that, to give the Chinese people, half a world away,
something to feel good about at the time of Tienanmen Square.''
</P>
<P>
   Chang, speaking openly about his faith, makes some
uncomfortable. Not me. He's so clearly sincere.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think God wanted him to win Boston?'' a woman said. ``What
about his lousy 13 months without a win?''
</P>
<P>
   Her companion answered, ``You've heard of Job, haven't you?''
</P>
<P>
   Conditions aren't exactly Jobian for Chang. He left town with
$245,000 stuffed in his pockets, and ``new confidence for the US
Open.'' Moreover, two young women in the south stand hoisted a
sign: ``Michael _ will you marry me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some other things to do at the moment,'' he smiled
politely.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't know God's plans for the US Open, but is thankful to
have this edge on Job: Bank checks have come into use since that
time. If Chang had to carry all that money in cash, he might run
himself into a hernia.

DON'T LET RECENT WOES THROW YOU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The questions must have seemed strange to Nomar
Garciaparra after the day he had at the plate at Fenway Park
Sunday. Only a few people wanted to talk about his 28th home run
and the double he hit against the Anaheim Angels. Most wanted to
ask him about his 23d error of the season. Was it a sign of fatigue
or, worse, a slump?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is absolutely not, if you ask any opponent who has
seen Garciaparra perform this season. He is considered a prime
candidate for the American League's Most Valuable Player award. But
what about those who have seen his high level of play day after day
and find it painful to see him go through a blip in the field?
Garciaparra isn't too crazy about it, either.
</P>
<P>
   While his offense is going strong, Garciaparra has made six
errors in the last nine games, 10 in the last 27. How can this be?
A year ago, in winning the Rookie of the Year award, he made only
21 errors the entire season. Here are a few thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   First, let it be said he doesn't have a sore shoulder. He might
have earlier in the summer, but with his work ethic how could one
tell? He missed nearly three weeks in May because of the injury but
has played in 116 of 134 games. No one would blame him if he asked
for a day off, but you know he won't.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there's nothing wrong with his throwing mechanics. His way
of throwing over the top is difficult to execute. But until lately
he'd been right on target.
</P>
<P>
   And last, if he takes time off, who will carry the offensive
load? Since July 23, when Garciaparra and Mo Vaughn swapped spots
in the order, Garciaparra moving to cleanup, he has been on fire,
batting .478 with 11 home runs. Vaughn has hit .352 in that time,
and their success has rubbed off on John Valentin, who is making a
strong late-season surge as the No. 2 hitter. The Red Sox need
their shortstop's bat and his leadership. The rash of errors won't
help his MVP bid, but he probably doesn't care about that, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a special player,'' said Jimy Williams. The errors
are ``the way he plays,'' added the manager. ``I'm not worried
about the throws he makes. I had Tony Fernandez back in Toronto,
who used to throw balls on the run like that. He's the only other
guy that could run to that foul line or third base and then throw
back and get guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``A slump? It can happen. Balls can take a little hop at the
end. Sometimes you're thinking one way and all of a sudden the ball
moves you into an off-balance position. You don't worry about
Nomar. You know his fire. You know his work ethic. He goes out and
plays hard every day.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting that Garciaparra is falling apart at the
seams. He is a student of baseball. A great hitter with power who
can run like a deer. His arm is strong. And he probably knows his
body better than the trainers or the doctors. But he is also human,
and thus susceptible to a down period entering the final month.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the errors come from trying too hard. He sets very high
standards, the kind that are almost impossible to live up to every
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough when you've made so many spectacular plays so early
in your career,'' said Vaughn. ``Things can get into your head.
He's just got to play the game the way he's always played the game.
I don't really think there is a problem. Still, you can't take
things for granted. As fast as you go up, you can go down just as
fast. If you don't come out on the field intent on being focused
and playing your game, it can beat you up. You have to stick with
what you know and what got you here.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra is not lacking for theories on the subject, but he
prefers to let his bat and glove do the talking. In the fourth
inning, he came to the plate as the leadoff man. The scoreboard
flashed a sign that said, ``Happy 80th Birthday Best Hitter That
Ever Lived,'' referring to Ted Williams. Garciaparra promptly hit a
home run. Maybe he thought the sign was referring to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that it felt pretty good,'' said Garciaparra of
the home run, which put him within two of his rookie season total.
``The first thing I said when I approached the dugout was, `Happy
Birthday, Ted!' It was nice to do that. He means a lot to all of
us. He's a guy who loves to hit. He loves to talk about it. You can
tell by the way he talks about it, his heart and soul are into this
game.''
</P>
<P>
   You can tell by the way Garciaparra talks, his heart and soul
are into the game, too. And throwing errors are the least of his
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main concern is going out there and trying to win,'' he
said. ``I'm happy with a victory, upset with a loss. There will be
ups and downs, and you have to deal with everything. Fielding
slumps? You got to battle through things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning is all everybody wants. It's all we've been focused
on. If we don't believe that, we should pack up and go home right
now. You can tell by the way we play our hearts out on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra in a slump? Don't count on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just know he's a great player,'' said Angels manager Terry
Collins. ``I know he's made some errors, but he's a gamer. Those
kinds of guys grind it out. Even if they're hurt, they never admit
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I like about him is that after an error, he will
never lay back on the next ball. He will never goose a ball to
first base. He plays the game all out, every play, every day. I
like this guy as well as any of the others around, and I've got a
great one.''
</P>
<P>
   And so do the Red Sox.

   For years, baseball cards have helped fans express their
devotion to their sports heroes. Now, an inventor with a love of
baseball promises to update the age-old pastime in a highly
computerized fashion.
</P>
<P>
   It all began when Marty Marion, an advertising executive named
after a St. Louis Cardinals shortstop of the 1940s and '50s, was on
a flight from Los Angeles to New York. Sitting next to him was a
7-year-old kid who spent the entire flight playing with his space
alien trading card.
</P>
<P>
   Marion watched the boy repeatedly animate and flip the card in
the air. Eventually, he realized that for the kid, the card was a
true-to-life friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I thought it would be a great idea if I could make
trading cards come to life electronically. I quickly started to
work on the idea of taking video and audio and embedding it on a
trading card on a computer,'' Marion says.
</P>
<P>
   With $300,000 of his own money, Marion started a company called
CyberAction Inc.. (www.cyberaction.com), based in New York's
Silicon Alley.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, visitors to the Web site can purchase
baseball, soccer, and celebrity cards that exist only in digital
format.
</P>
<P>
   A pack of four digital baseball cards costs $3.95. The cards
feature audio and video clips of players _ for example, a 1920s
film of Babe Ruth, or a 1990s video of Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   By flipping the card electronically, you can play sports trivia
games, see a player's entire lifetime statistics, hear the crowd
cheer or boo, and drag and drop images to create an electronic
poster of your favorite player.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors can order and download cards online. Next year, the
site expects to initiate online trading. Serious collectors will
appreciate the fact that the first-ever digital baseball cards have
an official license from Major League Baseball and are distributed
in limited editions.
</P>
<P>
   The technology behind all the fun and games is a system
developed by CyberAction. Collectors of the digital baseball cards
download software that allows the encrypted and video-enhanced
cards to be fully activated, organized, viewed and ultimately
traded.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also signed licenses with Major League Soccer
for digital soccer cards and with Universal Studios for ``Xena:
Warrior Princess'' and ``Hercules'' cards.
</P>
<P>
   The developers have high hopes to expand the menu of
CyberAction. Targets for agreements include the National Football
League, National Basketball Association, and TV shows ``Baywatch''
and ``Star Trek.''
</P>
<P>
   While some may applaud the introduction of a new and improved
baseball card, for others perhaps the most interesting part of
Marty Marion's invention is his claim to have created a business
model that expects to turn a profit on a 100 percent digital
product that has no traditional manufacturing costs, no real-world
retail outlet and virtually no incremental production costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we have sold enough cards to pay for the initial
development and creation cost for the first set, duplicating the
electronic file to fulfill customer orders is simple and done at no
cost other than the royalties we pay the licensor,'' Marion claims.
</P>
<P>
   If he succeeds, it will be a triple play! &QL;

PATRIOTS TRADE JONES AND JELLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ When a player signs a three-year, $3 million
contract with a $500,000 signing bonus, it ensures him a
significant role with the team.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran wide receiver Brian Stablein became an exception to that
rule Sunday. He had his contract terminated in a surprising move,
after the Patriots discovered that he was an insurance policy they
didn't need.
</P>
<P>
   Stablein, one of five cuts and part of an eight-man reduction by
the Patriots to get to the NFL roster limit of 53, saw limited duty
during the exhibition games after an impressive training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Also looking for work Monday are Phil Dawson, who made three
straight field goals in place of the injured Adam Vinatieri; the
team's fourth-round draft pick, defensive tackle Leonta Rheams;
cornerback Kato Serwanga, and veteran fullback Marrio Grier.
</P>
<P>
   The team also made two trades. It dealt popular veteran
defensive tackle Mike Jones, who had been with the Patriots for
five years but wasn't expected to make the roster, to the St. Louis
Rams for a fifth-round pick in 2000, and sent receiver Dietrich
Jells, who caught two touchdown passes Saturday night against the
Eagles, to Philadelphia, also for future considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Devin Wyman (knee) joined rookie linebacker Ron
Merkerson on injured reserve.
</P>
<P>
   But the surprise was Stablein.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the Patriots signed Stablein, they were unsure
whether Terry Glenn would return to full strength from a broken
collarbone and an injury-filled '97 season. They also thought they
might deal Vincent Brisby, who had demanded a trade because of his
falling down the depth chart, but that deal never materialized
because the Patriots were asking for at least a second-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn has come back strong, as evidenced by his three receptions
for 71 yards in the 24-7 exhibition win over Philadelphia. And
Brisby has been competing for a starting job with Shawn Jefferson,
though it appears he's on the short end at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The player who seemed most upset by the signing of Stablein was
Troy Brown, who felt his 47 receptions and fill-in work for the
oft-injured Glenn should be rewarded in some way. Brown, who in
another rather surprising move started Saturday night over
Jefferson and Brisby, wound up having a brilliant exhibition
season, also replacing Dave Meggett on punt returns.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots also drafted Wisconsin receiver Tony Simmons in the
second round.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, New England elected to go with only five receivers
and four tight ends (Ben Coates, Lovett Purnell, Rod Rutledge, and
long-snapper Mike Bartrum).
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have to pay all of Stablein's $500,000 signing
bonus but none of the remainder of the contract. They also are rid
of Jones's contract, which was for approximately $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   With Jones and Rheams gone and Wyman on IR, the Patriots will go
with eight defensive linemen: Chad Eaton, Willie McGinest, Mark
Wheeler, Henry Thomas, Chris Sullivan, Brandon Mitchell, Ferric
Collons, and rookie Greg Spires.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots also kept seven linebackers: Chris Slade, Todd
Collins, Ted Johnson, Tedy Bruschi, Vernon Crawford, Bernard Russ,
and Marty Moore. The team went with six last year, but Moore
fractured a rib cage Saturday night and will miss 4-6 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are also going light at cornerback. Serwanga's
departure leaves the team with Tebucky Jones and veteran Steve
Lofton as backups to Chris Canty and Ty Law. The Patriots are also
carrying Steve Israel, who still is unable to play.
</P>
<P>
   Grier had been a special teams fixture for the past two seasons,
but he was expendable with the additions of fullbacks Tony Carter
and Chris Floyd, both of whom have performed well on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   The team also kept rookie center Jason Andersen, a seventh-round
pick from Brigham Young, giving them 10 offensive linemen. Player
personnel director Bobby Grier belives in keeping as many big guys
as possible, and in Andersen's case he's keeping a third center
behind Dave Wohlabaugh and Heath Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 19 draft picks in the last two years, 17 have been kept.
Only receiver Tony Gaiter and Rheams have been cut. Rheams should
be re-signed to the practice squad, as should Serwanga, if they
clear waivers. The five-man squad should be named by 4 this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The cutting of Dawson indicates the team is reasonably assured
that Adam Vinatieri will be able to return from a groin pull that
has sidelined him for a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Management could not be reached for comment concerning the cuts,
but there may be a tweak or two of the final roster as other
players around the league clear waivers.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, the Patriots will have nine new faces this season.

WEINKE BACK FOR OLD COLLEGE TRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ When he came back for the second time,
he did what they told him. ``Sing a song,'' they said. He sang.
``Pick up the equipment,'' they said. He picked it up. ``Get
this,'' they said. He got it. With a smile on his face, laughter in
his heart, knowing that the time was coming when the upperclassmen
and veterans would listen to him. Seek his advice. Look for and
accept his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Accept it? Now they're embracing it. His career stat line says
Chris Weinke is only a sophomore, with only 13 passes thrown, seven
completed. Hardly the kind of resume a team with aspirations for
the national title would want from its starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   But then you move on down the resume. First, check the birthdate
_ July 31, 1972.
</P>
<P>
   1972? That would make Chris Weinke 26 as he lines up under
center for the first time in 1998 when Florida State begins its
season against Texas A&AMP;M in Monday night's Kickoff Classic at
Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Now it makes sense, this air of confidence Seminoles coach Bobby
Bowden has when talking about his quarterback. ``Chris Weinke
doesn't scare me,'' says Bowden, who had to go to Plan B this
spring when projected starter Dan Kendra tore up his knee and was
lost for the season. ``In fact, I never felt so good about a
sophomore quarterback in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk to Weinke, listen to his story about why he is back at
Florida State, where he first started as a college player eight
years ago, and you would feel confident too.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to him talk about his plans, how he wants to be the next
in a series of good-to-great QBs who have come through the Florida
State system. Hear what he has to say about his decision to give up
a career in baseball and chase another in football and it all makes
sense, sounds so plausible that when Seminoles quarterback coach
Mark Richt says, ``Chris Weinke is an NFL prospect,'' it rings
true.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the 6-foot-5 inch, 225-pounder about it and he doesn't
disagree. ``It took me six years to figure out what I want to do,''
said Weinke, who spent six seasons in the Toronto Blue Jays
organization.
</P>
<P>
   One day Weinke looked in the mirror and told himself a trip to
The Show was not coming any time soon. Sure, he was 25, but instead
of being a young prospect, he was getting closer to the aging
veteran that Kevin Costner played in ``Bull Durham.''
</P>
<P>
   Each season that passed, the outcome became more obvious.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to move on to something else. Money was not a
problem. He had taken the $300,000 the Blue Jays had given him when
he signed and invested it wisely, mainly in real estate. At 25, he
was, on paper at least, a millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   What did he want to do? Sure, he could move into the business
world, but he was still a kid, still wanted to play games.
Football? He had come out of high school in Minnesota as a hot-shot
quarterback everyone in the country was chasing, including Florida
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me,'' said Richt, with a smile, ``and asked about
coming back. I told him sure, but there were no guarantees he would
be a starter. He came back anyway. That showed me something, told
me something about him as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinke said he had no doubts about his decision. He was coming
back to Florida State on a work-study program. He wanted to learn
how to be an NFL quarterback. Going to classes and getting a degree
were part of the overall master plan, but he came back for the
football.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden was amazed. ``Guys have left before,'' he said. ``They
say, `I want to go play baseball.' I say fine, and in two years,
they come back after meeting Mr. Curveball or something like that.
But Chris was gone six years. I didn't expect to see him back.''
</P>
<P>
   What Bowden saw was not some wide-eyed freshman. ``None of that
hoo-rah stuff works on him,'' said the coach. ``You tell him this
is the job that's got to be done and he goes out and does it.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinke said his only concern was the physical aspect of the
game. ``Could I still do it?'' he said. ``Mentally, I knew I could
handle it. But I had questions about how I could handle the other
part. The first spring I was rusty, no question about it. But I
felt I was getting better every day. It was a whole new learning
process. I felt I could do anything they asked me to do, if I
worked hard enough.''
</P>
<P>
   At Florida State the path to success has been fairly consistent
for quarterbacks. Come in and sit for a year or two, maybe redshirt
a season, play a year of backup, and you'll get your chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kendra, a wild and crazy QB from Pennsylvania, was the next
in succession and he had two more seasons awaiting him. Weinke sat
and watched last season and was prepared to do the same this year.
</P>
<P>
   All of that changed in the spring game when Kendra went down
with a knee injury that was going to sideline him at least for the
summer and probably the entire year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even before that, I was telling myself to get ready to play,''
said Weinke.
</P>
<P>
   Kendra started on rehab and then decided he wouldn't make it
back in time for the start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the job was Weinke's. So much so that Kendra is
talking about playing fullback when he comes back.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke has gone about things like a businessman. He has bonded
with his teammates, particularly his offensive linemen. He has
taken on a leadership role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a unique situation,'' he said. ``I've been through more
than 90 percent of the sophomores. Maturity plays a major role in
my mind. I think it's important for me to be leader. I look forward
to that opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden says he is totally confident in one of the most
inexperienced quarterbacks ever to play for him. ``Let me tell you
something,'' he said. ``When you stand in that batter's box against
guys who throw 90-mile-an-hour fastballs, there's no reason to
think he can't stand in the pocket. And that's the way he has
responded.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M, with a better than average defense and a hunger that
comes with having fallen out of the Top 10 in recent years, will be
an indicator of what to expect from the Seminoles, and from Chris
Weinke.

NEW RESOLVE, SAME RESULT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ The Revolution showed some signs of
rejuvenation in Walter Zenga's first game as coach Sunday. But they
did not have enough defensive substance to hold off the Miami
Fusion, and a 3-2 loss buried them deeper in Major League Soccer's
Eastern Conference cellar.
</P>
<P>
   Diego Serna scored the Fusion goals, including the winner in the
80th minute after the Revolution had rallied from a two-goal
deficit. Serna scored twice in the first half, and the Fusion
nearly had several more goals before the Revolution tightened their
defense in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't change anything for the second half,'' said Zenga,
who wore shorts, a short-sleeved shirt, and a baseball cap with his
trademark Spiderman logo. ``They changed on the field. They kept
possession of the ball and tried to make something better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when a new coach arrives, things can get better. But
I don't have a magic wand. Last year, I was a coach on the field.
But if I make a player play well, the credit should go to the
player, not to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution, who trail Miami by 9 points for the final
Eastern playoff spot, reverted to their goal-giving ways early.
They had been outscored, 12-3, in the last three games before
Thomas Rongen was replaced by Zenga.
</P>
<P>
   Serna and Paulinho McLaren, veterans of the Colombian and
Brazilian leagues, had no trouble solving the Revolution's offside
trap in the first half. They broke through several times, thanks to
the passing of Kris Kelderman and Carlos Valderrama, easily
slipping past their markers. Central defenders Brian Dunseth and
Richard Goulooze were either too slow to react or were out of
position, and defensive midfielder Ivan McKinley struggled to keep
up.
</P>
<P>
   The Fusion mostly attacked to the Revolution's left side, with
Serna going directly at Janusz Michallik. Serna scored in the 17th
and 28th minutes, causing the Revolution defense to become more
cautious. When the Revolution offense needed another attacker,
players were wary about advancing.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution set the tone in the second half, tying the
score on Edwin Gorter's deflected drive in the 56th minute and Raul
Diaz Arce's left-footed volley in the 74th. Imad Baba had three
near-misses and Joe-Max Moore sparked the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga's substitutions 10 minutes into the second half also had a
positive effect, as the Revolution scored a minute later. But Dahir
Mohammed had just as much trouble staying with Serna as Michallik.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were without personality in the first half and I tried to
change the face of the team,'' Zenga said. ``Everyone played at 110
percent. At halftime, I said everything and nothing. They had lost,
5-1 and 6-1, and when that happens the players lose concentration
and think it doesn't matter if they lose again. I wanted to
transfer my mentality to them, because I don't like to lose, and in
the second half we changed mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga, the Revolution's goalkeeper last year, alternately sat on
the bench and stood, consulting assistant coaches Sid Mazzola and
Pete Simonini. His final substitute, Jair, had a chance to tie the
score but shot high in the 81st minute.
</P>
<P>
   But though Moore had one of his best performances of the season,
the Revolution could not match the athleticism and enterprise of
Serna. On the winning goal, Serna overpowered Mohammed just inside
the penalty area, dodged a sliding tackle attempt by McKinley, then
played a one-two with Valderrama. That forced goalkeeper Ian Feuer
to commit, and Serna then kept possession in the goal area and
scored into an open net.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a difficult player to cover,'' Michallik said. ``I gave
him too much room on the first goal, and he is the kind of player
who can take advantage of it. But it was good the way we fought
back, in these conditions, on their turf.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; UFdots &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Zenga is adjusting to life as a coach. He retired in December
after a nearly 20-year career as a goalkeeper, though he plans to
return to play for the Revolution next year. Asked during Sunday's
postgame news conference how he felt in his first game as a coach,
Zenga said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer is my life. Every time I do something new in my career,
I don't win. So this is normal. I am only looking to improve the
team in the next five games.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga conducted the press conference in English but afterward
was interviewed in Italian and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Had he lost in his first game as a player, also?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a manner of speaking,'' Zenga said. ``In Italy, that
is a way of getting a point across.''
</P>
<P>
   While playing for the Italian national team, Zenga lost only
seven games in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moore had an inspired second half in one of his best
performances of the season for the Revolution, who visit the New
York/-New Jersey MetroStars Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though it was hot and it was hard to run, we worked hard,''
Moore said. ``We started stringing something together in the second
half and continued to work hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a little more space in the second half, I felt sharp. I
hadn't been playing as well as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the team found extra motivation in the second half,
Moore said:
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't have enough motivation from the beginning,
soemthing is very wrong.''

POOR FINISH MAY HAVE GRAHAM PACKING HIS BAG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, Mass. _ It was a struggle and Lou Graham knew it.
</P>
<P>
   He had just signed his scorecard _ another 80 _ to swell his
54-hole total to 242, a gruesome 26 over par and 41 strokes behind
BankBoston Classic winner Hale Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's nightmare was a continuation of last weekend's
nightmare, which was a continuation of the previous weekend's
nightmare, which was, well, you get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   These are tough times for Graham, who over an illustrious PGA
and Senior PGA Tour career has won six times, including the 1975 US
Open, and has earned more than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   So Graham, who Sunday at Nashawtuc Country Club turned in his
second dead last finish in as many weeks, has gone home to
Nashville to think about his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be it,'' said Graham, who in '75 overcame an
11-stroke deficit after 36 holes and then beat John Mahaffey in a
memorable US Open playoff. ``I don't know if I'll be coming back or
not. Right now, I have no reason to come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no excuses why I'm playing so poorly. Besides, people
don't want to hear excuses. I've just been terrible all year and
I'm not seeing any improvement from one week to the next. If
anything, things are just getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   So, just how bad has Graham been?
</P>
<P>
   Consider this. At Nashawtuc, he had rounds of 82, 80, and 80 and
over the 54 holes had 26 pars, 21 bogeys, four double bogeys and
only three birdies _ two of them on Sunday's back side. There were
only three rounds of 80 or better at this year's Bank Boston;
Graham had all three. And this came on the heels of last week's
Northville Long Island Classic, in which he went 27-over 243.
</P>
<P>
   In 15 Senior Tour appearances, his best round is a 74 and he has
13 rounds of 80 or better. He missed the cut in the PGA Seniors
Championship and withdrew from the Pittsburgh Classic. He hasn't
had a finish higher than 71st and his earnings are a paltry $9,279,
including the $500 he won here.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, 60, was on top of his game and raking in the dough in
the late 1980s and 1990-91, before a wrist injury, which eventually
required surgery, slowed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can't use that as an excuse,'' he said, sitting in his
automobile dejectedly discussing his recent woes. ``The wrist is
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``What isn't fine, though, is my game. My driving is bad, my
iron game is bad, my wedge game is bad. The only part of my game
that has been decent is my putting. Not great, but decent.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the longer I play this way, the harder things become. It's
difficult enough to play this game without having to think about
your swing and what you might be doing wrong while you're in the
middle of your swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start doing that and every shot becomes work, every shot
becomes 100 percent pure effort. You can't play golf that way.''
</P>
<P>
   And no one knows that more than Graham, who Sunday bolted the
course less than 20 minutes after dropping in a 5-foot putt for a
par on his 54th hole of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is supposed to be fun, not work, and that's what it's
become,'' he said. ``When that happens, it's time to think about
other things.''
</P>
<P>
   And what, if anything, has Graham learned from this year-long
stretch of misery? ``Let me tell you, this is a very humbling
game.''

GORDON QUIETS LOUDON CROWD WITH VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
 300-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Judging from the hostile reception he got during
the driver's introduction before Sunday's Farm Aid on CMT 300 at
New Hampshire International Speedway, you would have been correct
to assume that Jeff Gordon, the two-time and defending NASCAR
Winston Cup champion, was the most scorned man at the track.
</P>
<P>
   Vilified by those critics who have struggled with the incredible
success of his meteoric Winston Cup career as driver of the No. 24
Dupont Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Gordon gained a measure of
satisfaction Sunday by turning the jeers to cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost.
</P>
<P>
   When he was introduced over the track's public address system as
the repeat winner of the Sunday's race, marking his ninth Winston
Cup triumph of the season and third overall at NHIS, Gordon was
loudly booed by those among the crowd of 90,000 who would have
preferred to have seen anyone else but Gordon soak up the glory in
Victory Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Runner-up Mark Martin, whose car owner, Jack Roush, accused
Gordon's team of cheating and demanded that NASCAR impound the 24's
last two sets of tires, would have been the people's choice. Maybe,
even, third-place finisher John Andretti would have been treated to
a warmer reception.
</P>
<P>
   But the people were muted when Gordon scored a stunning comeback
victory to maintain his 67-point lead over Martin in the Winston
Cup championship, 3,597 to 3,530.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if I wasn't winning it might be a different
reaction,'' Gordon said, when asked if winning helped insulate him
from all the booing. ``I think when you are winning, it's much
easier to let that stuff roll off your back. I've said it before,
but I'd love more than anything to have those boos, or whatever
their remarks are, to be cheers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I have a lot of fans out there who are cheering,'' he
added. ``They tell me every week, they write me and all types of
things, and that makes you feel good about what you are doing. But
when you are winning, you don't pay as much attention to those
types of things (booing). Actually, I think it's inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's inspiring to the team and myself and everybody to
go out there and win and do it more. It almost fires us up.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Gordon submitted an inspired effort Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who become the first Winston Cup driver to win from the
pole position at NHIS, richly deserved every penny of his $205,400
payday after he got hung out to dry by the single-file draft on a
restart and stumbled from second all the way to 17th on Lap 84.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like a pinball,'' Gordon said. ``Those guys were just
using me up. There was no way you could get back to the inside.
Everybody was looking for that, especially on those restarts. I
would go down in the corner and drive in easy, but I would lose the
front end or slide the back in. Once you got wide, you were in big
trouble. On fresh tires, we just had trouble trying to keep the
thing on the bottom of the racetrack.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, nevertheless, fought his way back into the Top 10 on Lap
136, got into Top 5 with 100 laps to go and, after pitting under
caution on Lap 233, got some quick pit work from his Rainbow
Warriors on a two-tire stop that enabled him to emerge from the
pits with a lead.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a furious challenge from Martin and Andretti, Gordon
never surrendered the point in leading the final 67 laps. The fact
Gordon managed to stretch his lead over cars with four fresh tires
_ in a car that had just two fresh right-side tires _ prompted
Roush's suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping short of calling upon NASCAR to have Kenneth Starr
mount an investigation, Roush charged that Gordon's crew chief, Ray
Evernham, illegally had tampered with the tire when he adjusted the
air pressure on the winning pit stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we did put something in the tire,'' said Evernham, who
expressed his digust at Roush's allegations. ``We put in air.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was all it took to deflate any hopes any driver had of
beating Gordon to Victory Lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a pattern this year,'' said Gordon, who will be
eligible for another $1 million Winston No Bull 5 bonus in the next
race at Darlington, S.C. ``We've been getting stomped the first
two-thirds of the race and the last third, Ray and my pit crew pull
me out. I don't know what the deal is. Other than a few races, we
really haven't been the dominant car. Of course, you look at today,
with the circumstances where I got knocked back, we pretty much
fought our way back all day long. You look at a guy like Jeff
Burton (the repeat winner of the July 11 Jiffy Lube 300 who
finished fifth) and it took him 25 laps to get to the front. It
took us a lot longer than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just amazing the way the races are coming down and the
way we're winning races today.''

PIT STOP PIVOTAL FOR GORDON

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Eight-point-two. Another Jeff Gordon Winston Cup
win took nearly three hours but turned on 8.2 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Evernham once again made the call and Gordon and the Rainbow
Warrior team once again ran with the call and made the crew chief
look like the Red Auerbach of the racing world.
</P>
<P>
   There were 67 laps left in the Farm Aid on CMT 300 at New
Hampshire International Speedway Sunday and coach Evernham called
for his team to put two tires on Gordon's car for the sprint to the
finish.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his rivals put on four tires, which would give their
cars more grip for the stretch run, and others took on two.
Evernham wanted to gain position on the track. He figured the car
might handle even better with only two new tires.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon went into the pits in fifth place. His team put on the
two tires and filled his car up with gas in 8.2 seconds. He came
out of the pits in first.
</P>
<P>
   And when the race was over Gordon had held off Mark Martin and
all other contenders and was soon in Victory Lane celebrating his
sixth win in his last eight races.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors joined him there. They put on their Winston Cup
baseball hats for one team photo. Changed into their CMT hats for
another. Then their DuPont Automotive Finish hats and their Pepsi
hats.
</P>
<P>
   And when Gordon and Evernham moved on to a press conference,
several of the Warriors took the long walk back to the end of pit
row to clean up. Their uniform shirts tied around their waists,
giving way to Refuse to Lose tees, they loaded up carts and folded
chairs and broke down computers.
</P>
<P>
   A pickup-load of their tires were gone by now _ NASCAR officials
had commandeered them to check them out _ and most of their
competitors long since had cleared out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can check out anything they want,'' said Andy
Papathanassiou, a onetime Stanford football player and now in
charge of the guys who go over the wall each Sunday for Gordon's
team. ``Until they do a psychological examination of Jeff Gordon,
they're not going to find the secret of our success.''
</P>
<P>
   In the press conference Evernham and Gordon took turns touting
the team.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the track, Papathanassiou, too, talked team. He talked of
year-round workouts and lifting and practices for the pit guys.
Talked of drowning out crowds and cars and going about business in
the pits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff is a tremendous talent,'' Papathanassiou said. ``The way
things work for us, all sides reinforce the others. We know we have
a good car and Jeff knows he can drive it hard. If the car and
driver are good, we don't want to be backing it up in the pits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be a good pit crew and be the worst part of this team
and I don't want to be the worst part of anything,'' he said. ``I
don't want just the driver or the car taking this team to victory,
I want to contribute to this team and the other guys do, too.''
</P>
<P>
   They are guys like jackman Barry Muse and front tire carrier
Jeff Knight. Rear tire carrier Darren Jolly and front tire changer
Shane Parsnow. Like rear tire changer Mike Trower and gas man Mike
Belden and catch can man Chris Anderson. Like Patrick Donahue of
South Portland, Maine, who works behind the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year we're taking fifth-place cars to wins,'' Gordon
said. ``It's just unbelievable. That's just chemistry. You keep
hearing everybody talk about team chemistry, and that's what that
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Driver. Car. Coach. The players in the pits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about a two-tire stop is you have half as much time
to beat someone out and you still need the same distance to
leapfrog someone on the track,'' Papathanassious said.
</P>
<P>
   The 8.2 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good,'' he said. ``Real good.''

QUEST WILL CONTINUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Saturday's running of the $750,000
Travers Stakes at Saratoga raised more questions than it answered
about the 3-year-old division. When Coronado's Quest held on grimly
to repulse Victory Gallop by a nose, what had been a two-horse race
between Real Quiet and Victory Gallop for the sophomore
championship became a three-horse affair.
</P>
<P>
   Which should be the front-runner? How about Real Quiet, who won
the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness and came within a nose of
winning the Triple Crown in the Belmont Stakes? His negatives are
that he is on the shelf with sore stifles and is not expected to
race again until the Malibu Stakes at Santa Anita Dec. 26. Should
it be Victory Gallop, second in the Derby and Preakness and the one
who denied Real Quiet the Famed Triad? Working against him is the
fact that he has lost the Haskell and the Travers to Coronado's
Quest. And what of Coronado's Quest, who has won five straight
stakes since April 11? He did not compete in the Triple Crown, when
horses build strong reputations.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, trainer Bob Baffert was successful in doing with
Silver Charm, who also won the Derby and Preakness but lost the
Belmont by a short margin to Touch Gold, what he is trying to do
with Real Quiet this season. He held Silver Charm out until the
Malibu and his strategy worked. His horse won the coveted Eclipse
Award as Touch Gold ran against older horses in the Breeders' Cup
Classic and fared poorly, running ninth and last. The fact that
Silver Charm ran second in the Malibu, and never faced an older
horse all year, did not keep him from winning the hardware.
</P>
<P>
   However, Real Quiet is not as charismatic as Silver Charm and is
not nearly as popular. For him to get the votes that Silver Charm
did, Coronado's Quest and Victory Gallop would have to fail against
older horses. So, they probably will continue to run against each
other until they have to play their cards against their elders at
the Breeders' Cup at Churchill Downs Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Coronado's Quest, off at 7-5 ($4.90 to win) under Mike Smith,
became deeply entrenched in the championship fray when he hit the
wire in 2:03 2/5 for the 1 1/4-mile Travers. Victory Gallop, the
6-5 choice, and Alex Solis were an inch away, and Raffie's Majesty,
an 11-1 shot ridden by Jorge Chavez, was just a nose behind Victory
Gallop in as a thrilling a finish as imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great race, but it was probably better for TV than it
was for me,'' said Shug McGaughey, trainer of Coronado's Quest, who
was emotionally drained after the race. ``We have three options
now. We could go in the Super Derby ($500,000, 10 furlongs, Sept.
27 at Louisiana Downs). We could go in the Woodward ($500,000, 9
furlongs, Sept. 19 at Belmont, but against older horses). Or, we
could go in the Pegasus ($500,000, 9 furlongs, Sept. 25 at
Meadowlands, restricted to 3-year-olds). We just want to do what's
best to get our horse to the Breeders' Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   A former bad boy, Coronado's Quest was an absolute gentleman
Saturday. Had he wasted any energy on antisocial behavior, he would
not have been able to prevail, considering his scant margin of
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coronado's Quest is doing fine,'' said McGaughey. ``He'll get
a couple of days off, then we'll probably get the tack back on him
( &UR; tomorrow &LR; ). He'll let me know in the next few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop deserves points for consistency. He had been
first or second in his last 11 races (six wins, five seconds) and
the most likely scenario is that he and Coronado's Quest will stage
another battle in the Super Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just thankful that he ran so well,'' said Elliot Walden,
who trains Victory Gallop. ``He ran a great race once again. It
would have been nice to have seen him come out on top. We are
looking toward the Super Derby, but nothing is etched in stone.''

</P>
<P>
   1. THERE IS A WAY OUT OF THE RUSSIAN CRISIS ``Today they
(President Yeltsin and his entourage) seem to be waking up to
what's happening,'' writes Mikhail Gorbachev, former leader of the
Soviet Union and Nobel Peace Prize winner. ``Continuing to cling to
power while closing their eyes and plugging their ears could be
self-defeating. The appointment of Chernomyrdin as acting prime
minister is therefore likely to signal the beginning of the process
of transferring power to an heir apparent. We are witnessing
Yeltsin's political sunset.'' 1,000 words. 
____________________________________________________________________
__ 2. IMAGINING RUSSIA WITHOUT YELTSIN Five years ago, the
so-called reformers running Russia concluded that three things were
essential for economic growth : a stable exchange rate, low
inflation and the re-election of Boris Yeltsin. The challenge was
to achieve each as quickly as possible, after which the economic
transformation would be largely secured. But it was a trap. By
Grigory Yavlinsky. 800 words. (Economist Grigory Yavlinsky is
leader of the Yabloko Party, a democratic reform party in Russia.)
_____________________________________________________________ 3.
``YELTSIN IS AT THE END OF HIS ROPE'' - ALEXANDER
</P>
<P>
   LEBED INTERVIEW The bitterly besieged Boris Yeltsin had no
choice but to bring Viktor Chernomyrdin back as prime minister,
according to retired General Alexander Lebed, even though
Chernomyrdin bears partial blame for Russia's current crisis.
Lebed, the former hero of the Afghan war and now governor of the
Krasnoyarsk district, says that Chernomyrdin will be hard-pressed
to avoid an explosion of popular wrath as matters go from bad to
worse. Still, he adds, ``Our only hope lies in the very man who got
us into this mess.'' From Der Spiegel. 1,000 words. Q&AMP;A format.
(English translation available.)
_____________________________________________________________ 4.
HUN SEN STAGES AN ELECTION Cambodia's new leader, Hun Sen, got the
world's endorsement for an election that was neither free nor fair.
The voting would not have happened at all if not for the cajoling
of foreign diplomats and how the world will treat Cambodia now is
not yet settled. The international community pushed Hun Sen to
adopt the trappings of democracy, but even those may evaporate
completely, once the world turns away. By Tina Rosenberg. From The
New York Times Magazine. 2,500 words.
</P>
<P>
   5. SPIELBERG BASHES INTELLECTUALS Steven Spielberg's film
``Saving Private Ryan'' has one false and creepy note, writes
Nicholas Lemann. From SLATE. 500 words. 6. TWO MEN IN A TUB Being
an astronaut is glamorous, exciting and dangerous. It can also be
tedious and undignified, particularly if you're preparing to build
the International Space Station. By Mary Roach. From Discover.
1,500 words + photos. (Also available in Spanish.) 7. RING-A-ROSES
Sisters, the closest of friends, share a bond that transcends time,
notes Kirsten Chapman, the youngest of three sisters. When her
sister Sonja died suddenly at 36, her world shrank. But, Chapman
discovered with wonder, the magic circle does survive. From New
America News Service. 1,000 words.
_____________________________________________________________ 8.
SEARCHING FOR ROOTS WE NEVER HAD The search for family roots is a
common phenomenon. People want to see where they came from in order
to understand and appreciate themselves better. But sometimes the
world has changed so rapidly that the real roots and old family
connections no longer exist. By Herbert Stein. From SLATE. 1,000
words.
_____________________________________________________________ 9.

   A. HOW DO TERRARIUMS WORK? How to make a self-contained
ecosystem or 'terrarium' (a miniature indoor garden in a sealed,
transparent container.) 1,000 words + photo . B. GROWING AND
COOKING PEPPERS : Since Columbus took both hot and sweet peppers
back to Spain from America 500 years ago, they have found their way
into cooking all over the world. Tips + recipes. 1,500 words +
photo. C. WATER GARDENS : If you have ever spent time gazing into a
lake, exploring tidepools along the coast or watching a stream
tumble over pebbles and stones, you know how calming and relaxing
water can be. To enjoy that experience every day, add a water
garden to your home. (It's easier than you might think, explains
Martha Stewart.) 1,000 words + photo.

10. HURRICANES AND GLOBAL WARMING Global warming as a result of
increasing levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is one
of the major environmental challenges today. If, as some experts
predict, hurricanes become more frequent as a result of global
warming, they will themselves contribute to transferring more CO2
into the atmosphere from the oceans. By Eleanor Lawrence. Nature
News Service. 600 words. (N/A France and Spain.) Embargo 1800 GMT
Wednesday, Sept. 2.

   &UR; ROUND ROCK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Michelle Huneven. Vintage Contemporaries, $13.
</P>
<P>
   This lively tale focuses on two men, both recovering alcoholics,
living at a halfway house in rural California, and the woman
violinist with whom they both become involved. Their struggle
implies that spiritual healing requires facing past truths and then
getting on with life, one day at a time. Last year in the Book
Review, Valerie Sayers called this an ``immensely likable first
novel.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOW WE LIVE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Sherwin B. Nuland. Vintage, $14.
</P>
<P>
   Using the voice of both teacher and storyteller, a surgeon
attempts the daunting task of explaining how the human body works
and what happens when something goes wrong. His account, originally
published in hardcover as  &UR; THE WISDOM OF THE BODY &LR; , is full of
``fascinating tales of surgical pitched battle'' told ''in forceful
and terse prose,'' F. Gonzalez-Crussi wrote here in 1997. In the
dreamlike  &UR; JUDITH'S PAVILION: THE HAUNTING MEMORIES OF A
NEUROSURGEON &LR; , by Marc Flitter (Warner, $12), a physician recalls
his many successes and failures, and the struggles of the patients
whose lives have transformed him. The writing ``is as elegant and
delicate as his surgery,'' Abraham Verghese said here last year.
```Judith's Pavilion' lingers with the reader long after the book
is over.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ONCE A DANCER ... &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Allegra Kent. St. Martin's, $16.95.
</P>
<P>
   The renowned ballerina, who flourished under the wing of George
Balanchine, surveys her eccentric life and career and tells how she
managed to cap off each success with a compensating failure. Last
year our reviewer, Joan Acocella, found much of this memoir to be
``witty, fast-paced, full of deft omissions, wonderful
catchings-up.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIVING AFTER MIDNIGHT: A NOVELLA AND STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Lee K. Abbott. Ohio State University, $16.95.
</P>
<P>
   The characters who populate this collection of short fiction
tend to be ordinary Americans who share a hot-wired pop-culture
awareness and a fascination with the magic and mysteries of
language. ``The quality of these stories is uniformly high,''
George Garrett wrote here in 1991. ``The level of excellence is
extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A COUNTRY OF STRANGERS: BLACKS AND WHITES IN AMERICA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By David K. Shipler. Vintage, $15.
</P>
<P>
   The author, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and former
correspondent for The New York Times, talks to a lot of black and
white Americans and discovers an uneasy racial divide in which each
side knows precious little about the other. The result is an
``engaged and engaging'' book that ``provides something that
statistics alone will not: the rich fabric of the everyday workings
of race in this nation,'' K. Anthony Appiah said here in 1997. A
former federal judge examines the interaction between racial
injustice and the law dating to Colonial times in  &UR; SHADES OF
FREEDOM: RACIAL POLITICS AND PRESUMPTIONS OF THE AMERICAN LEGAL
PROCESS &LR; , by A. Leon Higginbotham Jr. (Oxford University, $15.95),
finding that the legal system perpetuates the notion of inferiority
even today. This ``is a carefully researched and impressively
documented book,'' Yale Kamisar wrote in these pages in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ABOUT YVONNE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Donna Masini. Penguin, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   A professor at New York University who suspects her husband is
having an affair is gradually driven to the edge of insanity by her
jealous fantasies. Last year in the Book Review, Maggie Garb called
this a ``haunting novel of sexual obsession'' and a fresh critique
of contemporary Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BEGGAR AND THE PROFESSOR: A SIXTEENTH-CENTURY FAMILY SAGA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie. University of Chicago, $15.
</P>
<P>
   By drawing on the correspondence and memoirs of three
generations of an upwardly mobile Swiss family in the 16th century,
this kaleidoscopic history adds color and texture to our
understanding of the Renaissance and Reformation. The author is
``an erudite and elegant chronicler of early modern times,'' Eugen
Weber said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OFF MINOR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By John Harvey. Owl/Holt, $11.
</P>
<P>
   In this moody British police procedural, Inspector Charlie
Resnick tracks down a child rapist and killer in the grubby
industrial city of Nottingham. Harvey reveals ``the devastating
impact of murder on everyone it touches,'' Marilyn Stasio wrote
here in 1992. ``No one escapes the glare of the author's insights
or the warmth of his compassion for the pathetic frailties of human
nature.'' An earlier mystery featuring the jazz-loving Inspector
Resnick,  &UR; CUTTING EDGE &LR;  ($11), revolves around a baffling series of
surgical mutilations of staff members at a teaching hospital in the
Midlands. ``Harvey creates characters of astonishing psychological
diversity,'' Stasio said in these pages in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GOD OF IMPERTINENCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Sten Nadolny. Penguin, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   The hero of this comic fable is Hermes, the Greek god of
thieves, who is freed after 2,000 years chained to a volcano and
sent on a mission to the brave new world of french fries, golf and
channel surfing. His adventures make for whimsical ``post-modernist
beach reading,'' Bill Christophersen wrote here in 1997.

 RETHINKING THE BAN ON POLITICAL ASSASSINATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, August (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1985, during a flurry of terrorist attacks on
Americans abroad, John McMahon, then deputy director of Central
Intelligence, stared at a startling document sent to the CIA by the
National Security Council staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We received a draft secret executive order telling us to go
knock off terrorists in pre-emptive strikes,'' McMahon recalled in
an interview. ``I told our folks to send it back and tell them:
`When the president revokes the executive order which precludes CIA
from assassinations, then we'll take this on.' That hit the guys on
the NSC staff. They went ballistic.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate McMahon recounted has been going on for a generation:
Should the United States try to assassinate terrorists and tyrants?
</P>
<P>
   Since 1976, when an executive order outlawing such killings took
effect, the answer has been no, and five presidents have stuck to
it. The order says, ``No person employed by or acting on behalf of
the United States government shall engage in, or conspire to engage
in, assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   The ban followed a national revulsion at murder plots hatched at
the White House against people like Fidel Castro. ``Americans were
repulsed by the efforts of CIA in the 1960s to assassinate foreign
leaders,'' said Jeffrey Smith, a former general counsel at the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   The argument is raging again. The ``kill 'em all _ let God sort
'em out'' school of counterterrorism has been revived by the
attacks on U.S. embassies in Africa, which have been attributed to
the wealthy Saudi exile Osama bin Laden and his Islamic acolytes.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, said, ``There should be nothing that should not be on
the table'' when it comes to fighting terrorists. Former CIA
officer Reuel Gerecht wrote in The Wall Street Journal: ``In the
war against terrorism _ against those who are killing Americans _
the U.S. must be willing to kill terrorist chiefs. The only way to
stop Mr. bin Laden is to kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   A skillful assassination would arguably be a more efficient
means of counterattack than the cruise missiles fired at bin
Laden's base camps in Afghanistan. Those missiles killed a
significant number of Pakistani guerrillas training to fight Hindus
in India, but seem to have left bin Laden and almost all of his
anti-American followers unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the difference between killing lots of people with
missiles and killing one with a sniper's rifle? All the difference
in the world, say former CIA officers and current military and
diplomatic officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ban on assassination has been widely supported by
virtually everyone in the executive branch, from the military
through the CIA's clandestine service,'' Smith said. ``First,
assassination clearly invites a direct retaliation against not only
the president but other senior government officials and private
Americans. Second, we have adequate authority to engage in military
actions or covert actions involving the use of lethal force without
targeting a particular individual for assassination. Third, it is
just not in keeping with American values.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House can authorize CIA officers and Pentagon
commandos to use lethal force in operations against people like bin
Laden and his supporters without specifically calling for their
deaths. That authority was underscored by a 1996 law passed by
Congress, signed by President Clinton, and cited as justification
for the cruise missile attacks on Afghanistan and Sudan. It says,
``The president should use all necessary means, including covert
action and military force, to disrupt, dismantle and destroy
international infrastructures used by international terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Clinton has signed a secret order authorizing the use
of lethal force against bin Laden's organization, according to
administration officials. What that means _ and this is a fine
line, but a bright one _ is that the president has given spooks and
soldiers the power to try to destroy bin Laden without giving a
direct order to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   There are precedents. The 1985 draft that shocked McMahon was
part of a secret presidential order authorizing the overthrow of
Col. Moammar el-Gadhafi of Libya, former intelligence officials
say. ``It was clear we were going to use lethal force,'' one said.
``If the use of that lethal force in mounting a coup led to
Gadhafi's dying, we would not be distressed.'' The United States
later bombed the Libyan leader's headquarters, killing his
daughter. Some people in the intelligence community feel the 1988
bombing of Pan Am 103 over Scotland, which killed 270 people, was
Gadhafi's revenge.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is how to fight terrorism without acting like
terrorists. ``To begin to behave like terrorists undermines our
role as a leader in respect for the rule of law and respect for
human rights,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the United States has dealt with the problem by openly
declaring war and defining bin Laden and his group as military
targets. Its tools are missiles and spies, not the poison-tipped
ballpoint pens and cigar-chomping Mafia hitmen that the government
tried to use against Castro of Cuba in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   (And just last week, the government indicted seven
Cuban-Americans on charges of plotting to do what the CIA tried to
do 35 years ago _ kill Castro).
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did in clear and careful daylight, in good conscience,
on the question of assassination is in my view correct,'' said
Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering. ``It distinguishes us
from those who adopt assassination and terror as a weapon.''

 CHINESE BEWILDERED BY LEWINSKY FUSS

<P>
   BEIJING _ The Clinton sex scandals have received widespread
coverage in the popular Chinese press, and quickie books
chronicling the president's troubles are best-sellers at subway
stands. As a result, pictures of President Clinton, Monica Lewinsky
and even Linda Tripp are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   A story that had been a quiet fascination among a few became a
bit of a media frenzy last week when Clinton admitted he had an
inappropriate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Many newspapers
carried front-page articles. The Communist Party newspaper, The
People's Daily, reported the development, but the gist of the story
was that Clinton should be allowed to get on with his work.
</P>
<P>
   In the popular Chinese view, Ms. Lai Wen Si Ji, as she is known
here, is seen as a bit player in what many regard as Clinton's
tragic and inexplicable downfall. Tragic because Clinton is
extremely popular here, especially since his state visit this
summer. And inexplicable because the Chinese fully expect that
political leaders will have wives and girlfriends too. So what's
the big deal?
</P>
<P>
   Most people know Ms. Lewinsky's face. And readers of livelier
newspapers like The Beijing Youth Daily, know her name and that she
was a White House intern as well. But beyond that she is more or
less a cardboard temptress who many hold responsible for a hero's
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two of them used to have a good relationship, but now she
stands up and charges him like this,'' said a 30-year-old secretary
near the Jian Guo Men subway station who gave only her surname, An.
``It's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton's live televised speeches in Beijing this summer,
most Chinese consider him smart, dashing and debonaire.
</P>
<P>
   In an informal poll, some called Ms. Lewinsky glamorous but
others wonder why Clinton would have fallen for someone ``not
nearly as pretty as Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese responded well to Clinton's televised confession of
Aug. 17. They overwhelming support Clinton's plea for privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his own business and has nothing to do with politics,''
said Yu Liping, as she headed home from her job at a state
publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   One radio journalist who has covered the matter, and who
requested anonymity, said: ``This just doesn't make sense. We
always think of America as such an open and free-thinking society.
But in this regard, you are much more conservative than us.''
</P>
<P>
   So as some Americans cry for blood, the Chinese _ who are given
little information about their leaders' personal lives but suspect
much _ believe Clinton should be left alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are too critical,'' said Yu Xiaowei, a
Beijing bookseller. ``Having a few girlfriends is not a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Chinese leaders have had dozens,'' he added, pointing to
Chen Xitong, the former mayor of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen is perhaps not a role model whom Clinton wants to
emulate. In August he was sent to jail for 16 years for misusing
public funds and improper financial dealings.

 IN LATIN AMERICA, `THE CONSTITUTION IS WHAT I SAY IT IS'

<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ There is an argument to be made that the
favorite pastime of Latin American politicians is neither soccer
nor baseball, but tinkering with their countries' constitutions.
</P>
<P>
   Take Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladares. He doesn't
like the prohibition against immediate re-election that has existed
here since Theodore Roosevelt engineered Panama's breakaway from
Colombia nearly a century ago, so Panamanians are trudging to the
polls Sunday, Aug. 30, to vote on a measure that would allow him to
seek a second consecutive term next year.
</P>
<P>
   Given the track record of some of their neighbors, Panamanians
can consider themselves lucky. The Dominican Republic has had 32
different constitutions in just over 150 years, while Haiti, its
neighbor on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, has had 24 since
1804. Venezuela is South America's champion, with 25 separate
charters in 187 years, and in Central America, El Salvador,
Honduras and Nicaragua have each had 14 constitutions since
splitting from Spain early in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The constitutional history of Latin America is the most
convulsive in the world,'' said Jose Luis Cordeiro, a Venezuelan
economist and journalist who is the author of a recent book, ``The
Second Death of Bolivar,'' that examines the region's propensity to
replace its charters. ``Constitutions seem to have become like
shirts, not even suits, which rulers put on and take off at their
whim.''
</P>
<P>
   To many Latin Americans, the roots of the phenomenon can be
traced to colonial times. In those days, kings in Madrid or Lisbon
and their viceroys were fond of issuing edicts that seemed lofty on
paper but which rulers and their distant subjects knew could never
be enforced. From that experience came a proverb still used across
Latin America to describe the prevailing attitude toward laws and
decrees: ``I obey, but I do not comply.''
</P>
<P>
   In such an environment, constitutions have come to be seen as
statements of aspirations rather than binding declarations of
principles. Latin American constitutions tend to be lengthy
documents with dozens of chapters and scores of articles, written
in florid language that promises more safeguards and services than
their U.S. counterpart while specifying more obligations. Panama's
current charter, for instance, has 322 articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Constitutions in our countries tend to be a rigid compilation
of regulations or a type of detailed administrative code, more
formal than real,'' said Miguel Antonio Bernal, a prominent legal
scholar and political commentator here. ``They exist not to
guarantee rights, but to legitimize abuses, to allow whoever is in
power to leave the reflection of his own interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The end result for the average citizen, of course, is antipathy
mixed with cynicism, as each ruler imposes a constitution tailored
to his own needs and recruits jurists willing to bend to his will.
Another proverb popular in Latin America warns that, ``He who makes
the law makes the loopholes.'' Or as a member of the Panamanian
Supreme Court, put it recently in a lecture to law students here,
``The constitution is what we, the judges, say it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout modern Latin American history, the issue of
re-election has been inextricably linked to that of constitutions.
Since the typical caudillo, or strongman, always wants to modify or
replace the existing charter with one of his own, one country after
another has thought it logical to prevent the emergence of such
strongmen by writing constitutions that simply forbid any president
from serving two consecutive terms. Thus, the Mexican Revolution
took as its slogan, ``Effective suffrage and no re-election.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's heads of state, though democratically elected, persist
in seeking to mold their societies and institutions to their own
desires. Perez Balladares is by no means an aberration: over the
past five years, other ``modernizers,'' including Alberto Fujimori
of Peru, Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina and Fernando Henrique
Cardoso of Brazil, have all sought, and gained, constitutional
changes that allowed them to seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Peru's Congress on Aug. 27 told Fujimori, the originator
of the trend, that he could go after a third term without getting
public approval in a referendum..
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing is the revival of the old Latin American
tradition of caudillismo in technocratic clothing,'' said Ricardo
Arias Calderon, a former vice president of Panama. These new
leaders ``say they have found the magic formula and are the only
ones who know how to apply it,'' he said. That is dangerous,
Calderon added, because ``in Latin America, unlike North America, a
president is almost a king during his reign'' and thus has the
means to impose ``a civilian dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are few signs that Latin America's procession of
constitutions is about to stop. Colombia, Paraguay and Peru have
all approved new charters since 1990, and with the United States
and Latin America formally committed to a hemispheric free trade
agreement by 2005, other countries will soon be obliged to follow
suit. No one has asked him, but Cordeiro has a few words of advice
to those who will draft those texts: Less is better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience of Latin America has clearly demonstrated that
the answer to political crises is not to pass more and more laws
each time, above all if these are defective or are not applied, but
in having a few good laws that are respected,'' he said. ``If laws
are neither institutionalized nor implemented, they are useless.''

 Includes a color slide of Matt Damon and Gretchen Mol in a scene
from ``Rounders.'' 
 By JEANNE WOLF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Matt Damon is confronting the first road-block on his fast track
to fame.
 &HT;    He's one of the hottest young stars in Hollywood _ currently
basking in the box-office success of ``Saving Private Ryan'' _ not
to mention one of the youngest Academy Award winners ever. But he's
paying a price for success as he struggles to keep the media out of
his private life.
 &HT;    Last year, Damon, 27, was unabashedly and publicly affectionate
with co-star and gal pal Minnie Driver as ``Good Will Hunting''
soared to success and earned him an Oscar for Best Screenplay along
with his co-writing buddy Ben Affleck. Then, he told Oprah and a
few million viewers about the sudden end of their relationship. The
backlash taught him a lesson about the public eye.
 &HT;    In a hotel room in Beverly Hills, Damon pushes aside the plate
of raw vegetables which would have been his lunch. He's ready to
talk about his latest film, ``Rounders,'' in which he co-stars with
Edward Norton as a brilliant young card shark. But, first, he tries
to explain why he isn't talking about his love life anymore.
 &HT;    Has his frequent companion Winona Ryder stolen his heart? Could
marriage be on the horizon in his future? The strikingly boyish
actor shrugs, ``I've made the decision not to discuss personal
stuff except with my family and friends.
 &HT;    ``That's a big shift for me because I was raised to be very open
with everyone,'' he says. ``If you were close-mouthed, it usually
meant you had some problem that was getting in the way of your
personal growth. I'd read interviews with celebrities who would
suddenly clam up, and I kind of frowned on it. But, I've begun to
realize that everything I say can come back to haunt me so I can't
do it anymore.''
 &HT;    Damon visibly relaxes as the conversation turns to
``Rounders,''directed by John Dahl (1993's ``Red Rock West'' and
1994's ``The Last Seduction''), in which he and Norton are a couple
of hustlers who've made their living fleecing unsuspecting
opponents in the high-stakes underground poker clubs of New York
City.
 &HT;    Norton ends up behind bars. Damon uses his winnings to put
himself through law school _ but loses his future tuition in one
fateful game with a Russian poker-club owner played by John
Malkovich and gives up cards, determined to reform his life.
 &HT;    His resolve weakens when Norton is released from prison and
lures him back to the high-stakes world where an unpaid gambling
debt can be a dangerous liability.
 &HT;    Damon and Norton both spent a fair amount of time cruising poker
clubs in New York to develop their skills. ``I found out it's a lot
different than playing with friends where you might lose 40 bucks
on a bad night,'' Damon says. ``We saw some high stakes games, and
I realized that poker is never contingent on luck, it's always
about skill. I went to clubs and watched games that were too rich
for me.''
 &HT;    But Damon can only shrug when he reflects on how he's won big in
a tough business after turning in respectable but hardly
scene-stealing performances in his early screen years in ``School
Ties'' (1992) and ``Geronimo: An American Legend'' (1993). Even in
``Courage Under Fire'' (1996), Damon's bravura cameo on screen with
Meg Ryan was largely ignored by critics.
 &HT;    Then came ``Good Will Hunting,'' the lead in Francis Ford
Coppola's ``The Rainmaker'' (1997) and his Oscar.
 &HT;    His rise to the top was fueled by a drive reminiscent of the guy
he plays in ``Rounders.'' ``My character has a passion for poker,
and I felt a pretty clear parallel with my own passion for
acting,'' Damon smiles.
 &HT;    ``I dropped out of college and went to L.A. with my backpack to
try to make it in Hollywood,'' he says. ``I felt compelled to do it
even though it sounds like I was totally naive. This guy was happy
playing poker. I was happy acting.
 &HT;    ``Believe me, I lost count of the people who told me I was
making a big mistake. But I would have done it even if I hadn't
scored with `Goodwill Hunting.'''
 &HT;    In fact, Damon's passion for acting is reflected in his
commitment to the strict and, ultimately, debilitating diet regimen
he adopted while filming ``Courage Under Fire.'' ``I lost 41
pounds, and I didn't have any supervision at all. I did it on my
own,'' he recalls.
 &HT;    ``I thought my character needed to look almost gaunt. I really
thought it would help my performance,'' Damon says.
``Unfortunately, I nearly ruined my health. I was running 12 miles
a day, drinking pots of coffee, and simply not eating. I just
didn't waver.
 &HT;    ``When I tried to put the weight back on at the end of the
film,'' he continues, ``my stomach was a mess because I started
eating everything I could get my hands on _ things you'd never put
on the same plate like yogurt and clams. It was a nightmare. I had
to take a lot of medication and, eventually, I went back home to
Boston to recover.''
 &HT;    That was a low-point for Damon who didn't realize that, in a few
months, he'd be riding the crest of success of ``Goodwill
Hunting.'' ``Ben Affleck and I were worried that we might not be
able to act in the film,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``There was a lot of talk about other actors and we absolutely
refused. Then, I was at home on medication trying to gain weight
and I looked at the reviews for `Courage Under Fire,''' Damon says,
``and I barely got a mention. That was pretty heart-breaking. I was
really feeling down.''
 &HT;    Now, Damon has again lost weight for ``The Talented Mr. Ripley''
directed by Anthony Minghella. He's playing the title role in the
film based on Patricia Highsmith's mystery novel.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to lose about 15 pounds, because I just want to look
perfect and refined in those tailored suits that Mr. Ripley
wears,'' he says. ``Then, I'm going to lose another 15 pounds or so
when I do `All The Pretty Horses,' with Billy Bob Thornton because
I'll play a guy who's just gotten out of a Mexican prison.
 &HT;    ``But my life has changed since `Courage Under Fire,''' he adds.
``I have a nutritionist with me on the set everyday, and my hotel
room is a lot bigger.''
 &HT;    In an interview while on location in Italy, filming ``The
Talented Mr. Ripley,'' Damon reveals he'll be joined by Affleck to
work on their next script.
 &HT;    ``People keep asking if Ben and I are feeling the pressure to
duplicate `Goodwill Hunting,''' Damon says. ``I honestly don't
think we do, otherwise we'd never write another script. We'll just
give it our best shot and not worry.''
 &HT;    They will also return to the screen again together later this
year in Kevin Smith's much anticipated ``Dogma.'' ``Ben and I play
angels,'' he reveals. ``I'm the Angel of Death. Basically, we're
both trying to get back into heaven.''
 &HT;    Damon pauses to consider whether there's a downside to fame,
besides the sacrifice of his privacy. ``It's hard to grumble about
anything,'' he says finally. ``But I've been on the road almost
constantly for almost a year-and-a-half making films. I don't even
have an apartment.
 &HT;    ``I carry my clothes and stuff in a couple of duffle bags. I
have some furniture and odds and ends in storage in New Jersey, but
I'm not sure I ever want to see it again,'' Damon says. ``Who needs
an old ratty couch that I bought five years ago?
 &HT;    ``I don't even have my CD collection anymore. I gave up the car
I was leasing, because I never had time to drive it and that had
the CD player. So I gave my CDs to a friend, and he's playing them
while I'm working.''
 &HT;    Then he adds with that now famous grin, ``And you thought being
a star meant you had everything.''

CINDY CRAWFORD AND ABC GRAB ATTENTION WITH SPECIAL ON SEX 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of Cindy Crawford 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``Sex with Cindy Crawford.''
 &HT;    Sounds enticing doesn't it. ABC sure thinks so, for that's what
they've titled an hour-long special hosted by the supermodel and
slated to air Sept. 22 at 10:00 p.m. (EST).
 &HT;    ``That title must have come from some marketing genius at ABC,''
Crawford jokes. ``At the start it was kind of a joke, or just the
working title, and it stuck.
 &HT;    ``Normally, I don't like things that are titillating for the
sake of being titillating, but in this instance the title perfectly
describes what the show is about,'' she says. ``It worked, and we
couldn't think of anything else.''
 &HT;    The special marks the first result of a three-year development
deal Crawford recently signed with ABC. Chatting from her rented
vacation home in the Hamptons on Long Island, N.Y., the supermodel
explains that she didn't want to kick off her relationship with the
network by starring in a sitcom, TV movie or talk show.
 &HT;    She felt that a special would serve as a more appropriate
``get-to-know-you'' endeavor. Once she and ABC executives agreed to
team for a special, they next pondered a worthwhile subject.
 &HT;    ``I told them what I was interested in and what didn't interest
me. Like always happens in conversation, it kept coming back to
sex,'' Crawford says, knowing a thing or two about the topic.
 &HT;    Ironically, she explores a different facet of sex in the current
issue of Playboy in a 14-page spread shot by celebrity photographer
Herb Ritts.
 &HT;    ``I'm not a journalist or a sex expert, but I'm curious about
sex,'' Crawford says.
 &HT;    Brainstorming sessions generated a number of the topics explored
in ``Sex'' _ among them monogamy, AIDS, physical attraction, teens
and sex and sex in the media _ as well as the venues for discussion
of the selected topics. Crawford particularly welcomed the idea of
visiting a block party in Madison, Wis., and leading a conversation
with some of the town's residents.
 &HT;    ``We wanted to know what people were really doing, thinking and
talking about behind closed doors in Middle America,'' Crawford
says. ``The people in this cul de sac range from a young
interracial couple to a couple that's been married 55 years, from a
guy who just had an affair through the Internet, to a lesbian
couple.
 &HT;    ``The diversity of these people was amazing, and they were very
open and candid. So that's where we start.
 &HT;    ``The whole idea is that talking about sex is crucial to people
having healthier sex lives and relationships,'' Crawford says. ``It
opens up that box of `It's been 50 years since the Kinsey Report.
How far have we come?' ''
 &HT;    Crawford walked away with the impression that it's far easier to
have sex than to discuss it. Her ``Sex'' experience got her
thinking about her own sexual issues, as well.
 &HT;    ``My mother was always open about talking to me about sex, which
was interesting because her mother was not as open,'' she says.
``It let me talk with my then-boyfriend, now-husband (Rande
Gerber), too. I remember saying to him, `Are men really like that?'
or `Do guys really think this?'
 &HT;    ``I also got to explore issues that mattered to me, like sex
education. So many parents think that if you teach a child about
condoms they'll go have sex, and that's ridiculous,'' Crawford
says. ``Those kinds of things were my reasons for doing the
special.''
 &HT;    Crawford laughs. ``Now, why would ABC want me in there? Well,
look at our title,'' she says. ``It's a place, though, where I
don't mind being exploited, because I'm proud of the show.
 &HT;    ``A kid might not watch Barbara Walters if she hosted the show,
but that kid might watch me. That's fine. Not everyone reads The
Wall Street Journal or New York Times for their news, if you know
what I mean.
 &HT;    ``Maybe we're the show for those people who don't read the
Times, but we're giving you some good information and we do it
without being preachy,'' she says.
 &HT;    Crawford, as practically the whole planet knows, transformed
herself from a model with a mole into Cindy, Inc. She hosted MTV's
``House of Style'' fashion program for six years, starred in and
produced two best-selling exercise videos, wrote a makeup guide,
hosted several talk shows and award programs and starred in the
1995 action film ``Fair Game.''
 &HT;    After so many years in the spotlight, one can't help but wonder
what Crawford thinks she does for a living?
 &HT;    ``I'm a model,'' she says unequivocally. In fact, she remains an
in-demand cover girl and one of Revlon's most ubiquitous faces in
its print and TV ads. ``That's the engine that drives everything
else I do.
 &HT;    ``I still have so much momentum from the modeling. Maybe it
hasn't made the world a better place, but I think there's a place
for beauty in the world,'' Crawford says.
 &HT;    ``If it makes someone happy to look at a pretty picture of me,
that alone has value. Hopefully, people got something useful out of
the exercise videos I did, and, hopefully, they'll get something
out of the `Sex' special, too.''
 &HT;    Whether or not Crawford acts again remains to be seen. Though
she had a cameo on ``3rd Rock from the Sun'' not long ago, ``Fair
Game'' made her just that for critics who skewered her performance
as a lawyer on the run from bad guys.
 &HT;    ``I knew with that movie that I was opening myself up to
criticism,'' she says softly. ``It was fun to do once because,
honestly, who doesn't want to do a movie?
 &HT;    ``I understand the allure of acting, but I don't think it's
something that's as natural to me as modeling,'' Crawford says.
``If Martin Scorsese called and asked if I wanted to do a movie
with him, and if he said he'd mentor me and nurture me, then sure,
I'd do some more acting.
 &HT;    ``Otherwise, in order for me to make the acting work I'd have to
abandon everything else in my life right now, and I don't want it
that much.''
 &HT;    Newlywed Crawford would much rather spend time with Gerber, a
long time friend with whom Crawford became romantically involved
not long after the end of her tabloid-heaven marriage to actor
Richard Gere.
 &HT;    ``I was definitely open to remarrying and my desire for a
family, for children, has never left,'' she says. ``To me, being
married is the ideal way of doing it. I'm not saying it was easy to
get there, but I was never anti-marriage.
 &HT;    ``With Rande, he's just a nice guy. In my life there are so many
people who are fascinating and diverse, but it's nice to have
someone who's a solid person, who supports me and wants me to be
happy,'' Crawford says.
 &HT;    ``He also has his own life and is very confident. In the end,
he's a nice guy. I don't know how else to put it.''
 &HT;    Mother Nature, it's mentioned to Crawford, catches up to all her
creatures. Crawford recently turned 32, ancient in modeling circles
and approaching lateness in the game for would-be moms.
 &HT;    Growing older, Crawford admits, concerns her.
 &HT;    ``I'm curious about it,'' she says. ``The other day I was
obsessing that my knees were starting to droop. I'm a typical woman
in that I have to find faults in myself where no one else could
possibly notice anything.
 &HT;    ``In terms of a family, I thought I'd have one by now. If that's
in the cards, great, and if it's not, I guess it's not,'' she says.
 &HT;    ``So, I'm not afraid of aging. I hope I'll be strong about it. I
hope I'll be busy enough doing other things that I won't be
obsessing about it every minute.''
 &HT;    Crawford laughs nervously.
 &HT;    ``But I don't know,'' she says. ``I don't know.''

ASHLEY JUDD MAKING NAME FOR HERSELF, NO LONGER JUST A JUDD

 Includes a color slide of Ashley Judd with Ian Michael Smith in a
scene from ``Simon Birch.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    This Judd's for you.
 &HT;    Ashley Judd is beautiful, smart and she has kept her sense of
humor. That hasn't always been easy.
 &HT;    She remembers growing up a Judd, not one of The Judds. ``I
remember when I was a teen-ager and my mother and sister were on
the road in concert. I would flip over to David Letterman where our
family was his nightly fodder,'' the actress says, sipping tea.
 &HT;    She winces and recalls, ``Dave would say, `You know my fantasy
is to date the Judds. Hey, I bet you didn't know that the Judds
have another daughter, but she can't sing. And she's really ugly
and they keep her in the basement. Every once in awhile they throw
her down a canned ham.'''
 &HT;    ``It was all this crazy stuff,'' Judd says, admitting her
feelings were hurt for another reason. ``As a teen-ager, I had a
crush on the guy, which just made it worse!''
 &HT;    Judd, 30, is having the last laugh. She's gorgeous. It's true
she can't sing, but she has gotten rave reviews for acting in ``A
Time to Kill'' (1996), ``Heat'' (1995), ``Kiss the Girls'' (1997),
``Smoke'' (1995) and ``Ruby in Paradise'' (1993).
 &HT;    She doesn't live in the basement and doesn't like canned ham.
``Water and mushroom soup. Those are two of the keys to a good
life,'' Judd says.
 &HT;    Like it or not, her star power shines through the minute she
waltzes into suite at the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Mark Steven Johnson, her director in the new ``Simon Birch''
marvels that she is ``vivacious, strong and sexy.'' Womens'
magazines praise her ``feisty spirit.'' Interview Magazine dubs her
``a young Elizabeth Taylor.'' The movie opens Sept. 11.
 &HT;    Judd plays a single mother in ``Simon Birch,'' Disney's twist on
John Irving's novel ``A Prayer for Owen Meany.'' Her role is
Rebecca Wenteworth, the mother of pre teen Joe played by Joseph
Mazzello. Her son's best friend is Simon Birch, the smallest boy
ever born in one town. He's played by Ian Michael Smith, a
12-year-old Chicago native with Morquio's Syndrome, a rare genetic
disorder that causes dwarfism.
 &HT;    Judd says, ``I couldn't put the script down. It really touched
me. It's so real and dear, because it doesn't shy away from the
tragedies in life. Yet, it finds a certain calm and peace with what
God has created.''
 &HT;    Working with Smith was ``a joy,'' Judd says. ``He is a magical
child. He's free, pure and alive.''
 &HT;    Judd appreciates the free part. During her Hollywood tenure, she
hasn't had much down time. She laughs and says, ``At times, I was
so busy it got to be about sheer survival, but I like a
challenge.''
 &HT;    Judd is pretty good in survival. Born in Los Angeles, she grew
up poor in Kentucky and Nashville, attending 12 schools in 13
years. Before her mother Naomi and sister Wynonna became the
singing superstars The Judds, the three struggled to live on a
nurse's paycheck.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes when we were growing up, we were so poor that our
heritage was the only thing we had,'' Judd says, mentioning the
family's mantra at the time. ``Mama would say, `Kids, pour more
water in the soup. Better days are coming.'''
 &HT;    Did she feel deprived? ``What hurt me was seeing my mother not
being able to provide for us and how that made her feel,'' Judd
says, adding the upshot was the sisters grew even closer.
 &HT;    She laughs at the memories.
 &HT;    ``Wynonna remembers picking on me a lot and says she feels bad
now,'' Judd says. ``There's no reason for her to feel bad. I picked
on her, too.'' She lapses into mock anguish and adds, ``She would
sit on me and it hurt.''
 &HT;    And the younger sister's revenge? ``The only thing I could do is
sock Wy in the boob. It was my only course of defense,'' Judd says,
quickly stating, ``Really, we were more of a team than we were
enemies.''
 &HT;    At 14, Wy allowed Ashley to drive. ``We had a '57 Chevy. I
remember one day, I was waving to a farmer in his field and ran off
the road into a fence. Wynonna was always cool about things like
that. She wouldn't tell on me for driving the car if I didn't tell
on her for returning our canned goods to get spending money,'' Judd
says.
 &HT;    When Judd was 15, her mother and sister hit it big as country
music superstars. Ashley insists she never felt left out.
 &HT;    ``It's funny because as kids, I was encouraged to read and Wy
was encouraged to sing. We were never competitive, because we had
individual interests. It was like one kid plays soccer and the
other is on the debate team. I don't know any more simple way to
explain it.''
 &HT;    ``As grown ups, people just assume we're competitive, but what
we hope to articulate is that your identity is not about what you
do. It's about who you are.''
 &HT;    When the Judds were on the road, Ashley lived with her father.
During summers, she logged time with her mother and sister on the
road. ``I was paid $10 an hour to sweep out the tour bus,'' she
says.
 &HT;    After graduating from the University of Kentucky, Naomi Judd
thought her book smart daughter would be an anthropologist.
Surprise, surprise. Judd broke the news one day that she wanted to
act. ``Now my mother says I was an actress since I was a girl, but
I say, `No, no, no, remember mother. Acting is telling the
truth!'''
 &HT;    Judd is nothing but truthful about her experience in Hollywood.
She has gotten a slew of press for breakups with actor Matthew
McConaughey (her co-star in ``A Time to Kill'') and, more recently,
singer Michael Bolton. ``I just try to stay completely ignorant of
what the press is saying about my love life,'' she says, shrugging.
``I live my life the way I want to live it.''
 &HT;    Judd reveals that her personal life includes traveling around
the country to watch her favorite basketball team, the Kentucky
Wildcats. Lately there hasn't been much time for hobbies since Judd
has become one of the hardest working women in show biz.
 &HT;    She just wrapped the drama ``Eye of the Beholder,'' due out next
year. She also shows up next year in the thriller ``Double
Jeopardy.''
 &HT;    These days Judd is on Hollywood's A list. Maybe one of the
reasons is that she is able to hold her own with the likes of
Morgan Freeman, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, to name a few past
co-stars.
 &HT;    Is Judd ever nervous around these masters?
 &HT;    ``I laugh now. When I did `Heat,' I brought my wire-haired Jack
Russell Terrier named Goat to the set. The first time I met Al
Pacino, Goat ran into the guy's bathroom and Al came out holding
the dog and saying, `Is anyone missing something?'''
 &HT;    ``He put the dog down and she ran at his feet. This made poor Al
bump into a garbage can. What an introduction!'' Judd says.
 &HT;    After such heady moments, Judd will return to the family
homestead to regroup. She is very close with her mother and
sisters. ``My mother and I agree to disagree, and it's lovely. I
don't think parents and children can ever resolve all their
differences.''
 &HT;    As for her sister, well, no one is punching the other in the
boob anymore. Judd loves playing aunt to Wy's son and daughter. ``I
love getting on the floor and playing with the kids,'' she says.
``I do cannonball dives head first into Wy's pool to make them
laugh. I love it more than they do.''
 &HT;    But does she sing them to sleep? At least Letterman got one
right.
 &HT;    ``I probably sing fine,'' Judd says, laughing. ``But I don't
care enough to want to find out.''

 Includes a color slide of Roseanne posing for her new talk show 
 By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1998 TV Guide (Canada)  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Watch out, Rosie, Oprah and Sally! Roseanne is coming to host
talk-show television.
 &HT;    Expectations are high for ``The Roseanne Show.'' If it's a hit,
the actress-turned-gabber can expect to rake in somewhere in the
vicinity of $50 million a year.
 &HT;    Come Sept. 14, Roseanne's syndicated daily show will be aired by
King World Productions. And it's anyone's guess exactly what will
air. Roseanne, you see, is sort of vague about that.
 &HT;    Earlier this year, she poked fun at her image while hawking the
show. ``I am the most qualified person ever to host a talk show,''
she declared. ``I've got five kids by three different men ... I
came from a trailer park where I was a Jew passing as a Mormon ...
My brother and sister are both homosexual ... I have multiple
personalities, several of whom don't even know they're famous!''
 &HT;    This from a woman who had had it with television. She abandoned
her acclaimed sitcom ``Roseanne'' with a few last potshots at ABC,
at people who worked with her and Hollywood in general.
 &HT;    She even manufactured a sour send-off for the May 1997 series
finale, exploding the wacky, much-maligned winning-the-lottery
plot. In a quick, desultory voice-over, Roseanne Conner reported
that the episodes of the last season were nothing more than the sad
fantasies of a wife who had lost her husband.
 &HT;    In post production, Roseanne killed off Dan (John Goodman), just
as the final episode sentimentally celebrated the bonds of family.
Yet, for all her criticism about the industry and those who work
therein, she tried to swing a deal for a new series, sending her
character off into the Las Vegas desert, and complained when ABC
balked.
 &HT;    She high-tailed it to New York, playing the Wicked Witch of the
West in ``The Wizard of Oz'' on stage, saying she based her
performance on serial killer Ted Bundy. Despite all evidence to the
contrary, the legendarily prickly comic had not burned every bridge
in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    This was made apparent when it was announced that she had signed
for the talk show _ before ``Roseanne'' even officially died and
went to reruns.
 &HT;    Trouble is, no one has any idea which of her personalities will
show up on the new set. Although the show has had the luxury of
more than a year of pre production, no one had seen a second of
test footage a month before the debut.
 &HT;    When the series was introduced to critics this summer, instead
of screening a sampling of the show, a video bio of Roseanne was
unveiled, recalling her past glories as if she were a head of
state.
 &HT;    Los Angeles Times critic Howard Rosenberg's praise of her old
show was loftily cited _ though it wasn't mentioned, for obvious
reasons, that when Rosenberg panned a series starring her
then-husband Tom Arnold, Roseanne retaliated with a blistering fax.
 &HT;    The press conference that followed didn't unveil a Roseanne much
interested in talking. A simple question about what qualities she
admired and disliked about other talk shows and how that would be
reflected in her show was met with sarcastic reticence.
 &HT;    ``What are you asking me, really?'' she demanded. ``What do you
want to know?''
 &HT;    As specific as Roseanne got was, ``It's kind of a little bit of
everybody, a little bit of everything, it's not just _ you know,
we'll have a little bit like `Oprah' and a little bit like `Rosie'
and little bit like blah blah blah.''
 &HT;    Entertainment Weekly shuddered at her performance, forecasting
another possible trainwreck like ``The Chevy Chase Show'' or ``The
Magic Hour.'' In a follow-up interview, Roseanne scarcely managed
to assuage any fears.
 &HT;    Asked how or if she planned to bring the uncondescending,
blue-collar sensibility of her sitcom to her talk show, she
replies, ``I don't know what you're talking about.''
 &HT;    Roseanne said she hoped to incorporate recurring comic
characters, and suggested that her show would be original in a
derivative sort of way.
 &HT;    ``I had the same concerns with the sitcom,'' she says. ``We'll
have a different format _ you can't reinvent the talk show, but you
don't have to do the same thing everyone else does.''
 &HT;    She still declined to elaborate how she would employ what she
has seen on other shows. ``On the `Roseanne' show, we used every
sitcom as an inspiration,'' she says. ``Everything can teach you
something.''
 &HT;    Yet she declined to cite even one specific example, except to
say her new series wouldn't emulate late-night talk shows. ``I
don't like those,'' she adds. ``I can't stay up that late.''
 &HT;    Roseanne saved her biggest chunk of enthusiasm for her show's
set. ``It's just incredible,'' she exults. ``There's nothing like
it. My show `Saturday Night Special,' a short-lived late-night show
on Fox, had a unique set. I'm really into sets.
 &HT;    ``This one's like a house, a Victorian house,'' she continues.
``It's on a turntable, with three sets, and each one is a room.
We'll rotate the set on each segment.
 &HT;    ``One is a garden, filled with roses, another is the kitchen,
and the other is the living room. It's very Victorian, it's very
feminine. A desk is something I didn't want to do. I wanted to do
something feminine in the kitchen, which is the female center of
the home.''
 &HT;    And how would the set come into play in the talk-show format?
``We'll have guys in G-strings help prune the garden,'' Roseanne
says. ``In the kitchen, we'll have supermodels eating pie. I'd like
to have a pie-eating contest. We'll talk about food, women and
food. We'll have household hints.
 &HT;    ``We'll go to all three places with every guest,'' she
continues, correcting herself. ``It's not going to be set by Show
One. We'll do whatever works, we'll keep working on it. We know it
won't be as great as the show will be in the second or third year.
We're trying to downplay all the hype.''
 &HT;    As for the kind of guests she hoped to book, Roseanne was vague.
``We are going to talk to people who have something to say,'' she
suggests, ``who will offer us something unique.
 &HT;    ``There are a lot of people in this world and this country who
have inspired hope and higher things in people. They've done it
themelves, they've gotten themselves from a low point to a high
point,'' Roseanne says. ``I just want people to entertain me _ I'm
really an average viewer, with the same sensibilty.''
 &HT;    Roseanne concedes that there will be inevitable bugs to work
out. ``People have to see it before anything can be decided,'' she
says. ``I don't make art for critics, I make it for people. Without
people, nothing can develop. It wasn't until the third year that I
really thought `Roseanne' hit its stride.''
 &HT;    The comic says she spent the past year traveling to Hawaii, the
Virgin Islands and New York with her family, away from the
tabloids, which routinely kept readers abreast of her antics while
her sitcom rode atop the ratings. She's bracing herself for a new
round of salacious reporting.
 &HT;    ``I know that it's coming,'' she says. ``I'm trying to ignore
it, to stay centered. It's tough when you're a target. But now I'm
more mature, and I can handle it far better.
 &HT;    ``Also,'' she adds, ``I'll have a daily voice to respond to
them.'' Roseanne says that her young son Buck _ whom she had with
her third husband, Ben Thomas, from whom she split last year _ has
been an inspiration.
 &HT;    ``He's actually a great help,'' she says. ``He saw me on TV on
`Roseanne,' then pointed to me and said, `You're Roseanne!' The
pilot was on again recently, and in it, John Goodman had short
hair. He said, `It's Mom and Dad!'
 &HT;    ``He thought John was Ben. He thinks everyone's parents (are) on
TV, and in his reality, they are.''

 MOSCOW DASHES AMERICAN ILLUSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating for all needing. Originally file on Saturday, August (The Week in Review)  
(duplication warning: also sent with `i' code) 
 (bl)  
 By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The contrast is striking. With Russia on the ropes late last
week, U.S. officials were hardly forthcoming on what they might do,
offering reporters only the assurance that they were studying the
situation and urging the new Russian government to ``stay the
course of reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding President Clinton's planned trip to Moscow this week
for a summit meeting with President Boris Yeltsin, a senior
official said simply, ``We will not hit the ground with a bag of
tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Flash back to March 23, 1993. It was Clinton's first full-dress
news conference as president, and Russia was in crisis then too.
Clinton's words were, ``We are not bystanders,'' and, ``I intend to
go in there with an aggressive and quite specific plan for American
partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   The odyssey from full-throated engagement to mournful and
bewildered encouragement has been a long and messy one filled more
with failure than success. The apparent inertia may be partly a
result of distractions like the Monica Lewinsky affair. But for
some scholars, like Stephen F. Cohen, a professor of Russian
studies at New York University, it is more a direct consequence of
what he considers a foolish and self-centered ``American crusade to
transform Russia into a replica of American democratic capitalism
and junior partner in world affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   American ideology, he asserts, has ``hit the iceberg of Russian
reality,'' so it is no surprise that the policy's proponents have
nothing to say now. He says that while he too would like to see
Russia democratic and oriented to free markets, the path toward
that goal has to be more gradual, more mixed, more genuinely
Russian.
</P>
<P>
   What Russian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko has called ``the
McDonaldization of Russia'' has proved a failure, Cohen believes.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Goldman, a Russia expert at Harvard University, agrees
that U.S. policy has not been the wisest in recent years. But he
also says there is little Washington can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the patient is dying of cancer, you can pray and make him
more comfortable, but little else,'' he said. ``We gave the
Russians poor and contradictory advice, but even if our advice had
been good it would have been awfully difficult to undo 70 years of
communism and Cold War without serious repercussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Washington chooses to do in the coming weeks, it
appears to be sobered by nearly seven difficult years _ first under
President George Bush and then under Clinton _ of trying to shape
post-Soviet Russia in its own image.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there is still considerable debate as to how much the
United States has truly invested in Russian reform. There are those
who say that Washington has been far too deeply involved, that it
has been trying to micromanage a government and economy that it
poorly understands. This has turned the initial Russian love affair
with American culture and liberty into an ugly, reactionary
anti-Americanism.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of this view point to the legions of Americans sent
swarming through the Kremlin and Russian industry to proffer
advice, insist on painful ``shock therapy'' and even demand that
certain candidates fill key government jobs. While the Russian
people suffered, American advisers urged patience.
</P>
<P>
   There are others who say the problem has not been undue American
involvement in Russia but rather shortsighted disengagement _ both
materially and politically. They say Washington may have talked a
great deal about aid, but it never really spent the kind of money
needed to bail out and stabilize a nation that, after all, occupies
the largest land mass of any country in the world, has thousands of
nuclear missiles and sees itself as a great power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have given material aid only in small amounts,'' said Padma
Desai, a professor of economics at Columbia University. ``We spent
billions fighting Communism but once the Soviet Union collapsed we
were very selective in material help.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., who was chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Subcommittee on International Operations, summed up a
prevailing U.S. view on policy toward Moscow when in June 1991, six
months before the Soviet Union collapsed, he said: ``We now have
the opportunity to participate in the most fundamental change in a
major society in the 20th century and to help shape that society in
a way that will give us an opportunity to minimize our defense
expenditures.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, when the Soviet Union was collapsing,
Secretary of State James Baker organized Operation Provide Hope,
which sent hundreds of tons of food to the fracturing empire.
</P>
<P>
   For some analysts at the time, this was woefully insufficient.
Former President Richard M. Nixon circulated a memorandum in March
1992 accusing Bush of failing to recognize the significance of the
opportunity before him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are high and we are playing as if it were a
penny-ante game,'' Nixon wrote. ``The hot-button issue in the 1950s
was `Who lost China?' If Yeltsin goes down, the question `Who lost
Russia?' will be an infinitely more devastating issue in the
1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   Anders Aslund, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace in Washington, argues that it was Bush, in
fact, who lost Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big mistake was when the Bush administration did not
support Russian reforms in 1991 and 1992,'' he said. ``They were in
a total financial mess and they tried to do all the right things.
The United States didn't provide them with a cent. Instead they
held this conference on humanitarian aid like they were discussing
Sudan or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why such a course was chosen, Aslund speculated that
``Bush thought that to win re-election in November he could not be
seen helping other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Others assert that Clinton has been too doggedly pro-Yeltsin,
supporting the Russian leader when he had the military storm the
Parliament in 1993, bombed and attacked the breakaway republic of
Chechnya and drafted what some consider an authoritarian
constitution. They say Clinton's support rendered U.S. talk of
freedom and democracy hollow and paved the way for reactionary
forces to rise again. This was worsened, according to this line of
thinking, by American insistence on expanding NATO to include
Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, thereby adding to Russia's
sense of isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Most scholars, however, say the question of who lost Russia is
the wrong one, first because it is not yet lost and second because
Russia's future does not depend wholly on U.S. policy. Moreover, no
one really knows what it means for a major nuclear power ``to go
under.'' Russia's sheer size and remaining military might mean that
the United States will always feel the need for involvement.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a sentiment emerging that Russia may have to
be dealt with more on its own terms. There are differences over
NATO, Bosnia, Iran and Iraq but they should be seen as reflecting
differing interests and histories rather than as disobedience by a
junior partner. If the path to a market economy includes temporary
price controls or some level of state industry for a while, that
does not have to augur a return to communism, some scholars insist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much has been accomplished so far,'' said Desai of Columbia.
``The army has been cut from 4 million to 1.5 million, defense
expenditure is down, assets are freed, trading is open. The issue
now is how much of this can be retained.
</P>
<P>
   ``What policy modifications are we willing to make? Are we still
singing the same old pure-market tune? People are suffering. We
can't just say, `Take the consequences.' Russia still matters. It
always will.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he first arrived to study in the United States, Ashim Datta
was unfamiliar with the microwave oven.
</P>
<P>
   One evening, Datta, who had never seen such an oven in his
native India, wrapped his dinner in aluminum foil, placed it in the
university microwave, and punched ``high.'' Sparks flashed and
smoke began to curl. He waited patiently. Passersby soon explained
to Datta, a graduate student in engineering, that sparks were bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought sparks were part of the normal heating
process,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen years later, he has deepened his understanding of
American microwave ovens. Now a biological engineering researcher
at Cornell University, Professor Datta has moved on from nearly
setting microwave ovens on fire to attempting to answer some of the
most nagging questions confronting the microwave-food industry: Why
is the food so bad? How come, in a typical microwave dinner, the
peas are dry, the ham lukewarm and the mashed potatoes still
frozen?
</P>
<P>
   Pushing the frontiers of food science, Datta has for the first
time developed a comprehensive computer model of what happens to
food in a microwave oven _ the good, the bad and the
stomach-turning.
</P>
<P>
   Datta, an expert in heat and moisture transfer, says that while
microwave energy is being applied in one way to, say, a four-course
TV dinner, the dinner itself is warming in four or more different
ways.
</P>
<P>
   About 95 percent of American homes have a microwave oven, Datta
said, and the ovens' most popular use is for reheating or thawing
already cooked food. Yet 90 percent of new microwave food products
fail every year, he said, mainly because foods heat unevenly and
unappetizingly.
</P>
<P>
   In a conventionally heated oven, hot air cooks food from the
outside in, leading to crisp surfaces, like the skin on a
Thanksgiving turkey. Moreover, the hot air inside the oven is
uniformly hot, more or less, so the food cooks or thaws uniformly.
</P>
<P>
   But in a microwave oven, energy is used to heat the food itself
rather than the air. Moreover, there are pockets of lots of
microwave energy, some energy and none in the oven. By rotating the
food on a carousel, the energy is made a little more uniform, but
not much.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the uneven heating is the fact that the air in a
microwave oven is cool. When heated water migrates to the surface
of food, it stays there, instead of evaporating. French fries
become soggy, not crisp; mashed potatoes become a half-frozen,
half-lukewarm glop.
</P>
<P>
   Also, when water finally boils, its volume expands more than
1,500 times, cracking hard, non-porous surfaces. This is terrific
for popcorn, unattractive for potatoes and truly ugly for
hard-boiled eggs, whose hardened whites make for spectacular
splatters.
</P>
<P>
   Such heat-transfer effects can be described in standard
mathematical equations and then displayed in color on a computer
screen. Working with a graduate student, Hua Zhang, Datta
represented these heat effects in shades of blue for cold, red for
hot and yellow and green for in-between.
</P>
<P>
   In the model, the ham-and-gravy concoction of a TV dinner is red
at the edges, light blue in parts of the interior but dark blue, or
completely frozen, in the rest. The smaller mashed potato, pudding
and vegetable courses are just turning a splotchy yellow and green.
Nothing is just right.
</P>
<P>
   Datta hopes that food manufacturers, using his computer model,
can develop optimal sizes, shapes and materials for containers so
food will heat evenly. Curved egg shapes, for example, clearly
accelerate heating. As for aluminum foil, Datta has learned his
lesson.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Lost in (air) space
 &HT;    (For immediate release)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   McGwire, Sosa, Clinton, Lewinsky, Yeltsin, Diana _ who cares?
</P>
<P>
   My current news interest is absorbed by a weather balloon. It
has defied the air forces and commercial airlines of at least four
nations, including at least one military assault.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, it had been afloat for one week, launched Aug. 24
near Saskatoon in western Canada to measure ozone levels. It wasn't
supposed to drift away but it did, on a northeast course.
</P>
<P>
   What makes it all so remarkable is that it is floating around up
there somewhere near 35,000 feet with 1,000 rounds of cannon fire
pumped into it near Newfoundland on Thursday by two Canadian CF-18
fighter planes, and still it continues to drift _ over Canada, over
the Atlantic, over Iceland, over Norway and, now, over Russian air
space.
</P>
<P>
   There was a report that British fighters downed it, but that was
denied by London, as well as proven wrong by radar, which tracked
it as far as Bear Island in the Barents Sea north of Norway. When
asked why the CF-18s had not fired missiles at it, a Canadian Air
Force spokesperson said he did not think Canadians would have
``appreciated having a missile blowing over their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   And so The Balloon That Wouldn't Die floats on.
</P>
<P>
   One tries to draw a comparison between adventurer Steve
Fossett's doomed-by-lightning balloon flight and this one, and you
really can't, because it's all unfathomable to the lay person.
</P>
<P>
   Question: How long will it take for enough helium to leak out
through 1,000 shell holes in a 25-story-high weather balloon before
it falls to earth? Or will it require a missile or two to put down
this monster of a windbag, said to be the length of five football
fields?
</P>
<P>
   To date, the Canadian, U.S., British and Norwegian air forces
have been following the balloon, and trans-Atlantic commercial
flights have either been diverted or delayed because the balloon
began to intrude on the normal flight lanes between Europe and
North America.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I've grown weary of all those other stories about
presidents and princesses and home run hitters. The runaway balloon
is different, and I think the entire world should be looking up as
this story unfolds, instead of looking down at those others.
</P>
<P>
   It would appear to be another in a string of bad-luck launches
by both U.S. and Canadian space agencies. Two launches from
Florida's Cape Canaveral last month exploded shortly after leaving
the launch pad, and the runaway balloon was a joint project of the
Canadian Space Agency and several environmental and space research
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the economic loss of the balloon and any embarrassment
that results from it, something good can come of this. Whatever it
is that makes the balloon so resistant to weather, weapons _ and
leaks _ I want to have put into my auto tires, have my trousers
made of, my roof covered with and my atomic waste wrapped in.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, any similarities in this week's meeting in Russia
between Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, and an out-of-control bag
of wind floating above them, are purely coincidental.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Mourning the passing of a conservative
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell, who died last week,
was one of the notable conservatives on the bench in the 1970s and
'80s. He helped to sustain affirmative action, ruled anti-abortion
laws an unconstitutional invasion of privacy and carefully policed
the line of church-state separation.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, conservative.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of just how far to the right the political
boundaries have been dragged since Powell left the court in 1987 _
a pull that had begun in deadly earnest with Ronald Reagan's
election as president _ that few of the conservatives on today's
court would be caught dead within shouting distance of any of those
rulings.
</P>
<P>
   Yet President Richard Nixon correctly understood Powell as a
conservative when he persuaded the Virginia attorney to take a
Supreme Court position Powell had earlier twice ducked.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to imagine Chief Justice William Rehnquist or
Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia forswearing the
ideological absolutes that Powell shunned. Powell's conservatism,
in its prudence and respect for judicial stability, was far more
profound than the judicial bomb-throwing the current court's
reactionary activists try to pass off as legal conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, recognizing the Constitution as dynamic rather than
hidebound, searched for the fine legal lines that would equally
accommodate pressing social needs and prevent excesses in their
name. Thus his crucial ruling in the Bakke case that barred rigid
racial quotas but allowed race to be taken into account for
university admissions.
</P>
<P>
   A corporate lawyer for most of his career, Powell usually took
business's side in civil cases, and he was only infrequently among
the court's liberals on law-and-order issues. He found some
church-state separations extruded beyond constitutional support,
but he took the distinction seriously, again unlike most titular
conservatives these days.
</P>
<P>
   Powell was what has become a rarity in today's noisy crowd of
rightward dogmatists _ an open-minded conservative. The
intellectual habit continued into his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   A steady supporter of capital punishment on the bench, Powell
turned later against execution on the practical grounds that the
uncertainties in the process would in time bring the judicial
system into discredit. And he concluded that his make-or-break vote
had been wrongly cast in sustaining state laws against sodomy.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for liberals, we'd still be singing ``God Save the
Queen,'' but a long campaign of denigration has so defamed and
distorted the term that candidates now delegitimize opponents with
the dismissive ``Too liberal for...(fill in your state or town).''
And liberals demean themselves by ducking the label in favor of the
weaselly ``progressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans will no longer speak, as is proper, of the
Democratic Party but use instead the truncated, sneering ``Democrat
Party,'' and ideological pressure groups have made ``conservatism''
narrow and doctrinaire.
</P>
<P>
   When we let our political language be stunted, we let our
political options be stunted. That is exactly of the aim of the
forces that are doing the stunting.

 THE UNINSURED FIND FEWER DOCTORS IN THE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, August (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite a decade of steadily rising prosperity, a
million more Americans a year are losing the protective umbrella of
health insurance. As a result, more than 41 million people, or 15
percent of the population, don't have coverage.
</P>
<P>
   They lack insured care because they can't get it at work or
can't afford it. Most are adults under 65, the age when they become
eligible for Medicare. Most are men. Most have no children at home,
so they are ineligible for Medicaid, the insurance program for the
poor. Most have jobs, or live with someone who works, but their
incomes, typically below $25,000 a year, make them ineligible for
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as their numbers grow, the uninsured are finding that
their last resort _ charity care _ is being threatened by the rapid
expansion of managed care, which is putting tremendous financial
pressure on doctors and hospitals to focus their resources on
insured patients.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that in crises the uninsured can take their diabetes,
their rotted teeth, their tuberculosis, their hypertension, their
addictions, their obesity, their asthma attacks _ all scourges of
the poor _ to emergency rooms, where by law they must be seen and
treated free.
</P>
<P>
   For less urgent care, they can go to doctors' offices, public
hospitals and clinics subsidized by the government and
philanthropic groups. Often, that care is free as well, or the
patient agrees to pay a few dollars a month for it, albeit for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, anything beyond emergency treatment has
become harder to get in much of the country. As managed care has
expanded to cover 85 percent of the working population, it has
succeeded in stabilizing costs for employers and their managed care
subscribers. And the government is reaping similar rewards for
taxpayers by steering Medicaid recipients and the elderly into
managed care plans, and by cutting Medicare reimbursements to
doctors, hospitals and health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But as part of the process of containing costs, the government
and the managed care industry have also pressured doctors to take
cuts in their incomes or to take on more paying or insured patients
to maintain their current incomes, which has left them with less
time for charity.
</P>
<P>
   One fraying thread of the safety net is the Most Holy Trinity
Catholic Church's medical clinic in the Corktown neighborhood of
Detroit. Sister Mary Ellen Howard, the registered nurse who manages
the clinic, uses volunteer physicians and nurses to treat 3,000
patients a year, all uninsured, on an annual budget of $50,000
collected from small foundations.
</P>
<P>
   The care is free, but there's less of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had somebody come in here who had blood in his urine,''
Sister Mary Ellen said. ``He needed further diagnostic study, and
we couldn't do it. He couldn't go to an emergency room because
that's not an emergency. There was a urologist I could call and
say, `Joe, will you take this one client?' He would take him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now when I call, he says, `Sorry,''' she added, noting that he
has cut back on charity care because he has to see more and more
patients to maintain his income. ``My clients are able to get
primary care here,'' Sister Mary Ellen said. ``But I cannot get any
kind of a specialist to see a poor person in the city of Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Corlin, a senior officer of the American Medical
Association and a gastroenterologist in Santa Monica, Calif., says
he won't turn away poor patients sent by a similar clinic in nearby
Venice who need gall bladder removals and colonoscopies. But he
says the government, like managed care, is draining his reserves
for charity.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Corlin said, he could ``balance bill'' by charging wealthy
Medicare patients the difference between Medicare's reimbursement
for a procedure, which might be $180, and his usual fee of $300,
and then use the difference for charity. Balance billing is now
prohibited by the government, and because of falling reimbursements
from both Medicare and HMOs, Corlin says he now collects 50 percent
of his standard fees, compared with 75 or 80 percent 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Such complaints by health care providers help explain the
findings of a survey in June sponsored by the Henry J. Kaiser
Family Foundation, which specializes in health-care philanthropy.
``Contrary to a common belief that the uninsured are able to get
the medical care they need from doctors and hospitals, in 1997
uninsured adults were four times more likely than those with
private health insurance to say they did not receive the medical
care they believed to be necessary,'' the survey found. ``Over half
said they had postponed getting care, and a quarter had not filled
a medical prescription _ both because they could not afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kaiser foundation and many providers of charity care say
shortchanging the uninsured by treating them only in emergencies is
often more costly than preventive care _ for the patient, for the
health care provider and for the overall economy.
</P>
<P>
   An uninsured diabetic is cheap to treat when he is delivered
comatose to an emergency room and dies. But a more typical
emergency-room visit brings charges of $200 to $500, which the
hospital often swallows as charity care.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joy Everson, director of patient financial services at Good
Samaritan Hospital in Phoenix, says an ``emergency treat and
release'' costs $50. An EKG costs $125, and the doctor who reads it
charges $50 to $100. Holding a patient for observation costs $26 an
hour. Admitting him to the hospital costs $725 a day.
</P>
<P>
   In the argot of emergency rooms, many uninsured patients are
``train wrecks.'' They show up every month or so, with asthma
attacks or chest pains, and incur similar charges each time. But a
patient in a managed care plan, receiving the regular preventive
care that prolongs lives and spares the emergency room, is cheaper
to care for.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason people dismiss the problem of the uninsured is that
they don't believe people are turned away,'' said Drew Altman,
president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. ``They're right. What
happens is people delay getting care. And when they get it, they
are more expensive to treat.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jonathan Weisbruch, director of the Maricopa County Health
Department in Phoenix and a former medical director for the county
of Los Angeles, estimates that universal care and prevention could
curb the nation's $1 trillion spending on health care by one-third.
``If we intervene with people when they're 45 years old, get them
to do things like stop smoking and reducing their weight,'' he
said, ``imagine what that would do to the cost of Medicare after
they're 65.''

29.) 
 IT'S A BAD TIME FOR WEAK LEADERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, August (The Week in Review)  
(duplication warning: also sent with `i' code) 
 (bl)  
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ It is sometimes said that extraordinary times produce
extraordinary leaders. But if so, where are they?
</P>
<P>
   Many experts in foreign affairs worry about what they see as a
perilous combination of Brobdingnagian challenges to international
stability and Lilliputian authority among the political leaders
tackling them.
</P>
<P>
   With the Asian meltdown spreading to Russia and undermining
Europe, China and Latin America, some experts fret about the risk
of a severe global downturn, perhaps another depression, with
incalculable political and military risks. But just as the threats
to world order seem unusually grave and complex, leaders in major
capitals appear unusually enfeebled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we are on the verge of massive international
dislocations, which may have started in one country, Thailand, but
have created the real prospect of global financial instability,''
said Jeffrey Garten, the dean of the Yale School of Management.
``The reason this is potentially calamitous is that no one is in
charge.''
</P>
<P>
   That is something that President Clinton might discuss with
President Boris Yeltsin at their summit meeting in Moscow this
week. But the metaphor of a summit seems inappropriately robust;
these days the most fitting location for any meeting of the Group
of Eight industrialized nations might be a hospital ward, where
presidents could compare scars and take bets on who will survive
longest.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is so hobbled by scandal that he cannot even launch
missiles against alleged Afghan-based Arab terrorists _ against
whom it would normally take about two seconds to build a domestic
consensus to bomb _ without widespread doubts that the missiles
weren't at least in part an attempt to change the subject.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, the uncertainty is not whether Yeltsin will run again
in 2000 (he said last week he wouldn't), but whether he can even
finish his present term. In Germany, which has much at risk in
Russia's moribund economy, Helmut Kohl may be unseated in elections
next month after 16 years as Chancellor of Europe's powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi is limping along in his
first weeks in office, looking a bit dazed and struggling to show
some national leadership for the first time in his 35 years in
Parliament. Even in China, President Jiang Zemin has been humbled
by severe floods and by an economy that has been slowing
ineluctably.
</P>
<P>
   The only major figure who has sustained his authority is British
Prime Minister Tony Blair, and he has been distracted by the
turmoil in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Domestic, social and economic forces are overwhelming
political leaders everywhere,'' warned Professor Michel Oksenberg,
an international relations expert at Stanford University. Oksenberg
argues that the challenges to international order can be addressed
only at the political level, and that there is no correcting
mechanism _ say, global market forces _ that will insure that
everything works out well in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the world is on auto-pilot,'' he said. ``If so,
I'd hate to say where the plane is headed.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is difficult to argue that the threats to the
global economic order today are more serious than the risk of
nuclear annihilation during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Yet except for periods like the Cuban missile crisis, back then
there at least seemed to be a predictability to international
events, some notion of what might happen if the world did not
explode into a fireball. These days, it seems more likely that
there will be a tomorrow, but less clear what it will look like.
</P>
<P>
   Political scientist Francis Fukuyama published a famous essay in
1989 arguing that the collapse of communism marked ``the end of
history.'' The great debates that had animated history, he
suggested in that essay and in a subsequent book, had been
resolved. But now he has fresh doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past few months have been really the first time since the
beginning of the decade that I felt that I could really be proven
wrong in the argument that I laid out in `The End of History,'''
Fukuyama mused in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two things on the horizon that I think are really
quite scary: that the Asian crisis could broaden into a global
depression, in which case all bets are off about everything; and
essentially that Russia could fail in its attempt to Westernize and
go backward seriously,'' he added. ``Both of those may really
develop.''
</P>
<P>
   A third and related challenge, one that many experts cite as
requiring concentrated efforts by the world's leaders, is the
threat of proliferation of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass
destruction. Recent events are not encouraging. The longest-serving
American arms inspector in Iraq quit in protest last week, saying
the Clinton administration was unwilling to force Baghdad to reveal
its hidden weapons programs and was instead engaging in a charade.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts suggest that India may have been successful in
surprising the world with its nuclear tests this spring in part
because officials were not paying enough attention. And experts
also worry about Pakistan as its joins Russia on the list of
nuclear powers with disintegrating economies.
</P>
<P>
   What should the world's leaders be doing about these challenges?
The answers vary, although everyone agrees that the first priority
for people like Yeltsin and Obuchi is to stop the self-inflicted
injuries that are threatening international stability. Yeltsin's
withdrawal from day-to-day decision-making and his firing of his
prime minister and economic team a few days ago have worsened the
collapse of the ruble, and Obuchi is so weak that six bills vital
to Japan's economic restructuring program are stuck in Parliament,
aggravating the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As for the United States, its economy is the envy of the world,
but Clinton has been unable to wrest money from Congress to
replenish the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   There remains a vigorous debate within America about whether the
IMF has done more harm than good, but many foreign officials say
that Clinton's failure to deliver the money has limited the fund's
ability to combat the crisis in Russia and has, more broadly, added
to the unease in global markets. Already, some analysts are blaming
Kohl and Clinton for not having done more to bail out Russia when
its reformist economic team was still in power.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many government officials worry that if the United
States economy falters, Clinton will be too weakened to resist
protectionist pressures from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The wavering and weakness among major leaders now contrasts with
other moments of international crisis, like World War II and its
aftermath. Figures like Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt
commanded enormous authority once the allies faced up to the
threats posed by expansionist Germany and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   And even a seemingly weak president like Harry Truman, dealing
with a Republican Congress, managed an extraordinary agenda,
including the formation of the United Nations, the Marshall Plan,
the Berlin airlift and the Bretton Woods economic system.
</P>
<P>
   Garten of Yale argues that crucial differences from that era are
a narrower perspective today and an inattention to political risks
that arise from economic instability. The linkage was more obvious
to people like Truman, who had just fought a world war intimately
connected to the Great Depression: Hitler emerged from the economic
collapse of Weimar Germany and Japanese militarists seized power in
the chaos and misery of the Showa Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``After World War II, leaders recognized that ultimately
economic problems were political and security problems,'' Garten
said. ``They saw that right away.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``people today are far too technical in their
approach'' to global economic instability. ``They don't see the
connection.''
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, there are apparently several reasons why strong
political leaders are scarce today. Some of those reasons may be
more profound than quirks like the strong libido of one president
in Washington and the weak heart of another in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can deride the personalities involved, but I think
something much more fundamental is going on,'' said Oksenberg.
</P>
<P>
   International public opinion surveys, for example, have shown
declining confidence in government in recent years not just in the
United States but also in Canada and most of Europe. Bipartisanship
on foreign affairs has faded. Journalism has become more aggressive
and cynical as commentary has expanded with the technological
capacity to deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   Improvements in technology and communications have also cost
political leaders their monopolies on information and weaponry,
arguably empowering citizens and terrorists at the expense of
presidents. The private sector has gained prestige and
self-confidence, emerging as a rival force to guide policy _ which
may be a good thing at a time when ``political leadership'' seems
an oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a saving grace, a force that could compensate for
weak political leadership, it's business,'' said M.Y. Yoshino, a
professor at Harvard Business School. ``Still, that can't
compensate enough. What can you do when the ruble devalues 10
percent overnight?''
</P>
<P>
   In some sense, globalization and the huge pools of capital that
now slosh violently around the world, searching for the highest
return, have taken over a measure of the leadership that once was
demonstrated by national leaders. These oceans of capital now set
the international agenda and overwhelm the modest sums in the
accounts of central banks. The capital is beyond the reach of any
state.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the forces of globalization, however fickle, at times
function as a useful force to guide economic policy. Above all,
there is the discipline of capital markets, which are a powerful
force for prudence.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Obuchi equivocates about tackling Japan's bad loan
problem, Tokyo stocks tumble and force him to be more direct.
Likewise, the fear of being blamed for a market crash is a major
incentive for both Clinton and Congress to avoid protectionist
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But the bond market is no substitute for a leader. Japan, more
than any country, demonstrates that economies still require dynamic
politicians to forge a national consensus and set a country's
course. For Japan, in microcosm, has been something like the world
today: a place of powerful markets and puny leadership. If it is a
sign of what is to come, it is not auspicious, for it is a country
of enormous strengths that for eight years has stagnated and
drifted without anyone at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a set of challenges today that are out of the
ordinary,'' said Charles Morrison, president of the East-West
Center in Hawaii. ``It's not a happy picture, because you need
someone to push the agenda along, and it's not going to come from
weak political leadership.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Body language is easily read by ex-inlaw
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio. Sharon and I are not related; we just have
matching last names because we used to be married to brothers - but
now we're not. We haven't been married to anybody in a long time
which could explain the conversation we had the other night in
front of a particularly revolting television movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're hating this show, right?'' Sharon asks as she fumbles
around on her end of the sofa for the remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not loving it,'' I mumble trying to be polite just in case
she's not yet totally grossed out watching an unshaven bully knock
his witless wife into the wall. ``How could you tell?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Body language,'' she says as she flips to the weather channel
and asks if that's okay. I tell her it's fine and we watch the
pregnant weather lady point beyond her belly to a storm in Alabama.
``Omigosh,'' I hear Sharon mutter, ``it's raining again in Texas.''
I grunt.
</P>
<P>
   We watch in silence for a few minutes as someone explains what
next Tuesday's jet stream is going to do to the weather in North
Carolina. We don't really care but there's nothing else on. It's
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``What body language?'' I ask. ``What'd I do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You folded your arms across your chest which means you're
blocking everything out. You're easy to read.'' I tell her I'm not
so sure I like folks to know what I'm thinking by the way I tilt my
head or bend my elbow, and the reason my arms were flopped over my
chest was because my hands were going to sleep hanging off the side
of the couch. She's not buying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time you did this was when I asked you if you thought
you'd ever get married again. You wiggled your eyes, bit your lip,
and folded your arms. And then you lied and said, 'Maybe.' ``
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would I lie about a thing like that?'' I ask and she says
it's because I don't want to have to explain why I've been single
for 20 years. I remind her she's been single longer than I have.
She doesn't respond and for the next few minutes we share a
comfortable silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to rain next Wednesday,'' she announces
matter-of-factly. Then she gets to what's really on her mind.
``Aren't you tired of living alone?'' I roll my head to one side to
get a better look at her. Is she serious or are we acting out a
psychological experiment?
</P>
<P>
   She looks sincere. ``Sometimes,'' I confess honestly, ``when the
plumbing breaks or the power goes off in a storm, I think maybe
it'd be nice not to be alone. But then I remind myself how tough it
would be for anyone to put up with my odd habits. Three o'clock
yesterday morning I was down in the basement ironing. A couple of
days ago I sat with my feet in the desk drawer for six hours -
thinking. Husbands aren't geared to this kind of behavior. Besides,
they're always hungry.'' She nods tacit agreement.
</P>
<P>
   We study the ceiling for a couple of minutes before I ask: ``How
about you? Do you think you'd ever get married again?''
</P>
<P>
   She changes the subject at warp speed to a new diet she's trying
and begins babbling about carbohydrates and grapefruit juice. I ask
her if that's a thinly disguised yes. No answer so we turn back to
the television. Sharon picks up the remote and begins flipping
channels. The weather hasn't changed and the bum is still beating
his wife. She hits the power button and the screen goes dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at it this way,'' she chuckles, ``no more arguments over
who controls the remote.'' I remind her we never had to deal with
that issue because remotes hadn't even been invented while we were
still married. ``Ummm,'' is all she has to say about that.
</P>
<P>
   Body language forgotten, we confess. Yeah. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only this time,'' she says, ``it's going to be somebody who
wants me big time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what you mean,'' I assure her. ``Anything good on at
ten?''

 &HT;    Throw back home-run ball? Not me, pal
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   To heck with Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire and what's-his-name
from the Mariners. McGruff, I think his name is. No, that's the big
brown crime dog.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey. Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm not going to get sidetracked with discussions about our
old friend Moises Alou, although, geez, wouldn't it be nice to see
him in a Marlins uniform right about now?
</P>
<P>
   And while I'm sitting here denouncing all that was once near and
dear to my heart, to heck with this job. They can take it and,
well, you've heard that song, even if it is really bad country
music.
</P>
<P>
   To heck with those little coupons I've been sending in to
Florida's Pre-Paid College Program. Going, going, gone.
</P>
<P>
   This is my week, folks.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going to catch myself a home-run ball, and I'm going to keep
it.
</P>
<P>
   For me. Until someone offers me a billion dollars for it.
</P>
<P>
   And then I'll sell it.
</P>
<P>
   And the best part is, because I am a liberal newspaper person
and an outspoken Clinton supporter, I won't even have an ounce of
guilt about keeping the ball, then selling it to the highest
bidder.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I don't know if you've been paying attention to all this,
so allow me to brief you. Just a tiny little lesson, I promise.
</P>
<P>
   There is this incredible home run race going on in professional
baseball right now. Two guys _ Sammy and Mark _ are primed to break
an old baseball record, the one established in 1961 when Roger
Maris hit 61 home runs in just one season, post-season play
excluded.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this race has done a couple of things, not the least of
which is fill up ballparks around the country and make owners a lot
of money.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me to my point.
</P>
<P>
   I've invested a lot of emotion and time and sweat equity in this
game. Just thinking about last October exhausts me.
</P>
<P>
   I deserve a little payback, don't ya think?
</P>
<P>
   Now, as luck would have it, I am scheduled to watch McGwire play
on Wednesday and Sosa on Friday, an enviable baseball-viewing week
made possible because I have no other real life.
</P>
<P>
   But, first, please understand something. As fans go, I really am
a nobody. I mean, I could sit through an entire no-hitter and never
know the difference. But all this home run hullaballoo does beg the
question.
</P>
<P>
   Just how greedy are we fans?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Pretty darn greedy.
</P>
<P>
   Why, just the other day I ran into a fellow baseball fan in the
hall at work. And we were standing there, procrastinating, when he
asked me that very question. ``I'd throw it back,'' I said, aghast.
</P>
<P>
   But then, I got to thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Those guys make a lot of money. Those guys get winters off.
Those guys have special people to massage their sore muscles. Those
guys probably don't even do their own laundry.
</P>
<P>
   So. Cooperstown, Schmooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   I'm keeping the Spalding.
</P>
<P>
   I don't care if Sammy Sosa is sweet.
</P>
<P>
   I don't care if Mark McGwire is the only human being on Earth
with biceps bigger than my thighs.
</P>
<P>
   Mine, mine, mine.
</P>
<P>
   And I don't care if I have to knock over some little kid to get
it.

 &HT;    Memories all point to this: I love you, Dad
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service-Palm Beach Post
<TEXT>
<P>
   Happy 79th, Dad!
</P>
<P>
   My visits with you and mom have been precious to me these past
few years. I've especially enjoyed our talks about your childhood
recollections, even as your short-term memory fades.
</P>
<P>
   When I confessed recently that I wished we always could have
talked so easily, you told me how, as a child, kids teased you
about your curly red hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since then,'' you said softly, ``I've been shy.''
</P>
<P>
   That explains a lot. While I was shy of you, you were shy of me.
How nice to be beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   My birthday gift to you? I want to give you back some of your
memories, Dad. Here, my recollections of you and me through the
years:
</P>
<P>
   1944. I am 2. There is a war going on and you are wearing a
white sailor suit, bouncing me on your foot while holding my hands
and singing about a merry-go-round (boop-boop) that broke down.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, perhaps a year later, you lift me, and I touch
your face, so unlike Mom's. ``Stickers,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   You are stationed in Brooklyn in 1945, and on a walk across a
street, you and mom hold my hands and swing me upsa-daisy onto the
sidewalk, a thrilling, weightless sensation at the moment of
alighting.
</P>
<P>
   A cloud goes by. We are in your friend's small yellow airplane,
flying over Vero Beach. When we land, Mom is on the ground right
where we left her, waving. Or is she shaking her fist?
</P>
<P>
   You keep finding pennies in my ear. This is hard to understand.
Your friends from the naval base also find pennies in my ear. Your
friends drink a beverage called Jax Beer. Much later, as a teen in
Gainesville, I learn that this is the worst beer ever brewed.
</P>
<P>
   Age 5. The string of the kite is paid out and you hand me the
stick and I stagger forward with the pull of the wind. You give a
dime to a kid who races to the store on his bicycle to buy more
twine. This is living.
</P>
<P>
   I have a little brother now and as we walk through the
impossibly technicolor carnival midway, the barkers call you by
name. ``Hey Red! Over here, Red! Whadda ya say Red, three throws
for a dime, Red.''
</P>
<P>
   To me, this is as amazing as an ear full of pennies. ``Daddy,
how do all those men know you?''
</P>
<P>
   These were the days of nicknames: Red, Whitey, Blackie, Shorty,
Fatso, Curly, Baldie and Slim.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1947, and we live on a sandy road in Jacksonville. I can
see you stopping at the driveway to let me ride the running board
the last 20 feet. What were you, crazy? (I got that expression, by
the way, from you. You never said mean things to anybody, Dad. At
moments of exasperation, you might explode with ``What are you,
crazy?'')
</P>
<P>
   I can see you walking on your hands across the floor, change and
keys raining from your pockets. I spend hours learning to walk on
my hands, wanting to be like you.
</P>
<P>
   During your engineering studies at the University of Florida, I
can recall watching you use a French curve to draw a big swoopy
design that looked something like crescent moon with a medallion at
the point. This was to be on the cover of the premier issue of The
Florida Engineer, a magazine that you founded and edited.
</P>
<P>
   I remember driving with you. You always drove into the deepest
puddles, Dad, so we could see the splash. And when we drove by
ponds or lakes, we would ask you how deep the water was and you
would say, ``How the heck do I know?''
</P>
<P>
   But Dad, you knew everything.
</P>
<P>
   You are Mr. Science. You informed me that ice skates don't skate
on ice but on a thin film of water melted by the friction of the
blade. When I studied Morse code for my Scouting badge, you helped
me practice.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, Scouting. Dad, you had never been in the woods in your life,
and yet you signed on as Scoutmaster and won the Scoutmaster's fire
building contest right off the bat.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when you freed up that vine at Itchetucknee Springs so
the Scouts could take turns playing Tarzan over the ravine, our
bottoms grazing the tree tops below? Do you remember how when it
was your turn, you sailed higher than anybody else and just kept
going when the vine parted?
</P>
<P>
   Do you remember plunging 30 feet and breaking your pelvis, and
how a bunch of terrified 12-year-olds carried you to the truck?
Watching you disappear into those trees was the worst moment of my
life, Dad.
</P>
<P>
   What were you, crazy?
</P>
<P>
   But, oh, were you fun, Dad! I guess it was about 1954 when we
saw the teeter-totter acrobats on Ed Sullivan, and you built us a
teeter-totter and taught us to do forward flips and back flips
until Bernie Bostick missed the mattress and sprained his ankle.
Mom had some choice words.
</P>
<P>
   On a Sunday when I was about 16, you came home from a neighbor's
house with beer on your breath and I ratted you out to Mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronnie,'' Mom says, ``your father will drink beer, he just
won't buy it.'' You never smoked and you never swore, Dad. Even
when the television antenna smashed your thumb, you said only,
``Ow.''
</P>
<P>
   I liked that.
</P>
<P>
   I'll be honest, Dad, you didn't talk to be talking. You were
blunt. But all I had to do was mention a problem with algebra or my
motorcycle, and you were there, sleeves rolled up, brain engaged,
teaching, fixing, advising.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the driving lesson in the white 1951 Hudson, when I
drove 3 miles until we smelled something burning. Turns out, if you
leave the parking brake engaged, the brake lining will burn. What
was I, crazy? you asked.
</P>
<P>
   Do you remember why, in my senior year, I couldn't bring myself
to look at you for three days? You said I could use the car and,
after I made plans, you said you needed the car. On the fourth day
of my sulk, the new Elvis album mysteriously appeared on my bed. I
burst into tears.
</P>
<P>
   I remember the first time I felt grown up around you. I was 20
and in the Navy. It was the day after Marilyn Monroe's death, so
that would make it Aug. 6, 1962 and you flew to California on
business near my base. We had dinner, and talked like real people.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when we said our good-byes we shook hands, this being
before the manly hug was invented.
</P>
<P>
   But I've saved my fondest memory for last, Dad.
</P>
<P>
   I am about 9, sick with a high fever, and you come into my room
and feel my head, asking if there is anything you can do. I mention
comic books _ Donald Duck and Superman _ and you head for the
drugstore.
</P>
<P>
   That was just what dads do, and I gave it no thought. But here
is the part I will never forget: Mom is holding my hand, and she
cautions me, ``Be careful of what you ask for, Ronnie.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you asked your father for the moon, he would go out and get
the tallest ladder he could find.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny how something like that stays with you, huh, Dad?
</P>
<P>
   Your loving son,
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie

 &HT;    Let 'St. Diana' image rest in peace
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monday, August 31, is the first anniversary of Princess Diana's
birthday in eternity.
</P>
<P>
   That is a pious phrase long used by Christian faithful to
describe the day a saint died. For millions of her fans, Diana, the
Princess of Wales, remains a kind of secular saint. She
personifies, for them, all that is good and gracious in a world of
struggle and pain.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Diana struggled much, knew great pain and was, in
many ways, a good and gracious person. But she is not likely to be
a saint. The remarkable relationship between the troubled princess
and her adoring public is more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   She was 36 when she died in a car crash in a Parisian tunnel.
But not even her death could end more than 15 tumultuous years as
an object of international curiosity, adoration and mockery. Her
short, troubled life came to be seen as a kind of vicarious
atonement for all who suffer _ and survive _ ridicule, self-doubt
and defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Her followers believe Diana overcame nearly insurmountable
challenges to finally blossom as an independent, mature woman. And
they hope, through Diana's experience, that they may do the same.
</P>
<P>
   That makes Diana more a saviour than a saint. Saints live out
the will of God. Diana lived out both the nightmares and dreams of
her followers.
</P>
<P>
   Saints reflect God. Diana reflected the Angst of a generation.
She is a kind of icon for a self-absorbed, confused age that
identifies with her private struggle and envies her public
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Those who still, in their own way, worship Diana believe they
know the rejection and insecurity she suffered because they suffer
the same. And they believe she won the struggle they daily engage.
So, they may have hope.
</P>
<P>
   They also claim Diana accomplished this generation's fundamental
spiritual goal: to find herself, discover meaning in life and peace
in her heart. And she did so in a fairy-tale setting of royalty,
expensive clothes, elaborate trips and international notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   For that she became ``the people's princess.'' In death,
however, her life became more fantasy than fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her death brought her into mythic proportions, not because of
who she was in their life but of what people wanted her to be,''
says the Rev. J. Brabban, associate professor of religion and
philosophy at Palm Beach Atlantic College in West Palm Beach. ``We
make her who we want her to be, living the life we want to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana was beautiful, wealthy and caught up in a glamorous fairy
tale gone terribly wrong. More than 1 billion people watched her
televised marriage to Charles, the future king of England, in 1981.
That many or more wept at her funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Millions followed her journey, step by torturous step. They
alternately rejoiced and wept as the naive schoolteacher became a
glamorous princess and devoted mother, a divorced member of the jet
set working to ban land mines and, finally, the victim of a tragic,
brutal crash.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Diana lived the highly visible, privileged life of a
princess. Privately, she knew the hell of loneliness, self-loathing
and depression. The royal family disapproved of her. Her husband
cheated on her.
</P>
<P>
   She tried to kill herself, developed severe eating disorders and
took up lovers. Nothing worked. The marriage failed, but Diana is
remembered as one who not only survived but prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Her life ended just as many believe she was beginning a new and
grace-filled chapter. Her presumed sainthood is rooted in that
experience _ and in her death. Sudden death _ especially the tragic
death of a young person _ often blurs the moral ambiguity in which
most of us live and confers instant beatification upon the
deceased.
</P>
<P>
   Something like that happened to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr., John and Bobby Kennedy. All were able men. None was a saint or
American icon until the abrupt and unexpected murder of each man.
``We highlight all the good qualities and make them larger than
life, the Rev. Brabban says, ``and we dismiss any negative
features. That creates not a saint but a fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first anniversary of Diana's death, it is time to put the
fantasy of Diana to rest. Forget the nonsense about sainthood and
simply honor the genuine person she was, warts and all, a woman of
grace, laughter and tears.
</P>
<P>
   Even Diana deserves as much.

 &HT;    Oof! Wham! Slam! Wrestling wannabes pin their hopes on learning
the ropes
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service-Palm Beach Post
<TEXT>
<P>
   After he finishes his 4 a.m. to 1 p.m. shift, Publix stock clerk
Jay Cintron goes to his home in Lantana, changes out of his
uniform, gets dressed in his workout clothes and continues pursuing
his dream. He wants more than anything to be a professional
wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   He's dead serious about this goal, to the point that he's chosen
his signature wrestling move (``I think I'll use the sleeper hold.
I like to put guys to sleep.'') and his future stage name: Puerto
Rican Prince Papa Jay. Seems that back in the rough neighborhood in
the Bronx where he grew up, he always greeted friends and teachers
with, ``Hey, what's up, Pops?,'' so everyone called him Papa Jay.
</P>
<P>
   He added the rest for flair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be Puerto Rican Kid Papa Jay, but I got a little
bit older, so I changed it to Prince,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   To further his wrestling dreams, the 21-year-old has spent $100
a month since December to attend sessions once a week at a local
school run by a former professional wrestler. At his home every day
after work, he carefully follows a training regimen that starts
with 50 pushups and finishes with dumbbell curls.
</P>
<P>
   Then, to psyche himself up and toughen his resolve, he tops it
off by whacking himself in the head with a piece of sheet metal.
</P>
<P>
   The number of whacks depends on how he feels that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do it until it hurts,'' he says matter-of-factly. ``Usually
about three or four times.''
</P>
<P>
   The move is pure testosterone. In the movies, Rocky Balboa
pounded sides of beef with his fists. On the football field,
linebackers get ready with thunderous head butts. Cintron simply
has his own method, involving a solid sheet of aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense. After all, he's only about 5-foot-8 and 207
pounds; a lot of the guys he grapples with at wrestling school run
about 250 to 300 pounds. The sheet metal regimen, he reasons, is
good practice for learning how to take a blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds crazy, I know,'' he admits. ``But I'd rather hit
myself first and know what the pain is like before I hit someone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Cintron is part of a growing throng hoping for a future in the
pro wrestling arena.
</P>
<P>
   Every Sunday morning, he and about a dozen other guys in their
late teens and 20s make their way to World Gym in Delray Beach to
attend Flex Armstrong's Pro Wrestling World Do-Jo, a school for
wannabe wrestlers. Some are former college or high school athletes.
Most are blue-collar guys working regular jobs but angling for more
money and excitement.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, wrestling schools' popularity has soared
nationwide, mainly because the sport has come such a long way since
the days when guys like Gorgeous George would pull their oversized
briefs over their guts and 'rassle around.
</P>
<P>
   The two main wrestling groups _ World Championship Wrestling and
the World Wrestling Federation _ grapple for a pool of money
estimated at more than $1 billion a year from pay-per-view and
merchandising alone. More than 30 million tune in weekly to watch
WCW and WWF matches, shows that regularly draw the top cable and
pay-per-view ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Monday's show at the Miami Arena has been sold out for
weeks. So has the Nov. 2 show at the new arena in Fort Lauderdale,
says WCW marketing director Michael Weber.
</P>
<P>
   In every town _ whether it's a basketball town like Chicago or a
hockey haunt like Hartford _ there are screaming legions waiting to
see their favorites. Doesn't matter whether it's 7-footer Kevin
Nash or Bill Goldberg, who is wrestling's biggest sensation since
Terry ``Hollywood'' Hogan (formerly ``Hulk'' Hogan) or ``Macho
Man'' Randy Savage.
</P>
<P>
   With every month, the sport wades deeper into the mainstream. In
July, NBA stars Karl Malone and Dennis Rodman mixed it up with WCW
superstars. Two weeks ago it was, of all people, Jay Leno who
``defeated'' Hogan in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I predict that in the next five years, the money will be
equivalent to what's being earned in the NFL,'' says Weber. Former
NFL players already dominate the sport: Goldberg, Kim Bokamper and
``Chief Wahoo'' McDaniels all played before jumping in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Or there may come a time when NFL players will be clamoring to
make wrestling money.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong understands his students' thirst for the limelight and
the big paydays. He was one of them once. After wrestling in the
Army at Fort Benning in Georgia, Armstrong _ whose real name is
Flex Armstrong (he won't reveal his birth name ``for professional
reasons'') _ played a little semi-pro football and did some
powerlifting.
</P>
<P>
   A friend invited him to try out at a wrestling camp, and he did
well. After about six months of training, he wandered over to a
World Wrestling Federation show and was invited to star in one of
the undercard bouts after a wrestler didn't show. He did well
enough to later join the WWF circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the guys are big fans and come from all walks of
life,'' says Armstrong, 29. ``The guy who eventually became the
Ultimate Warrior in the WWF was a chiropractor in Scottsdale, Ariz.
Now he's a multimillionaire. It's all about money and the love of
the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   So, tucked in a corner of the cavernous 60,000-square-foot gym,
away from the yuppies running on treadmills and the body builders
pumping free weights, Armstrong's students spend the better part of
four hours bouncing against the homemade ring's ropes, slamming to
the barely cushioned plywood mat and wrapping each other in holds
that look downright painful.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong runs his class with the authority of a high school
football coach: He instructs them on fundamentals _ an assortment
of head slaps, pile drivers, head locks and the ``tombstone'' move,
which basically involves dropping someone on his head.
</P>
<P>
   They practice how to tumble without getting hurt. They take
turns throwing each other into the corner turnbuckles. They learn
how to bounce off the ropes and send the other guy slamming into
the mat after delivering a stiff-arm ``clothes line'' to the throat
of an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Before they can do the tricky maneuvers, though, they must first
absorb the basics, such as running the ropes (bouncing from one
side of the ring to another). Then there's the ``head scissors''
move, in which one wrestler wraps his thighs around his opponent's
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them we don't play games here,'' Armstrong says,
``because if they go try out somewhere and have a poor performance,
it's my name and reputation that suffers, because I'm the one who
trained them.''
</P>
<P>
   Spend a couple of hours watching a class in all its
body-slamming, neck-choking, arm-twisting glory, and it's hard to
remember this is all supposed to be a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestlers don't really wrestle, right? Everyone knows they don't
play hard, they play act. Aren't they just a bunch of thyroid
giants and fat, hairy dudes bouncing around the ring during a
``match,'' executing pre-arranged moves, winning when someone
decides they're supposed to win and falling when they're told? It's
a parade of contorted faces and pulled punches and fake blood.
</P>
<P>
   Right?
</P>
<P>
   Yes and no. Pro wrestlers have to be athletes as well as actors,
says WCW's Weber.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling is real in the sense that wrestlers do feel pain after
getting picked up and slammed down. They have to be able to carry
out the moves, choreographed or not, and do them safely.
</P>
<P>
   During a match nine months ago, Armstrong broke his neck when he
did a flip over the top rope of the ring and landed square on his
head. Paralyzed for three minutes with what doctors later called a
``spinal stinger,'' he regained movement and nursed his neck back
to mobility between a few more matches. Five months later he
resumed his career and he now competes in Japan and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But wrestling is artificial in the sense that promoters who set
up shows can decide who wins, says Weber. Wrestlers don't plan out
every move before a match, but there are certain things that have
to happen in order to tell a story. Mess with the story line and
all hell could break loose.
</P>
<P>
   Need proof? Look at a lawsuit filed earlier this year in Atlanta
by the WCW.
</P>
<P>
   The organization accused legendary wrestler ``Nature Boy'' Ric
Flair of reneging on a three-year, $1.95million deal, forcing
last-minute rewrites of ``story lines'' that propel the game. The
WCW, which refers to wrestlers as ``characters,'' says Flair
started missing work leading up to a nationally televised program
in Tallahassee and put plans with other wrestlers at risk. WCW
wants at least $2 million in damages, plus legal costs. The suit is
still pending.
</P>
<P>
   One Sunday morning, eight students _ all men _ turn out for
class at Armstrong's ring. The crowd is a collage of body types and
personal styles. Among them, there are three with shaved heads, two
goatees, two visible tattoos and one ponytail.
</P>
<P>
   There are guys like Wayne Ingstrup, 27, of Palm Springs, who
wants to go by the stage name ``Insane Wayne Suicide.'' He's
athletic, but with his long hair, goatee and untanned skin, he
looks more like he just stepped out of a computer lab. His goal is
to be the guy the audience hates. Lacking girth and Adonis-like
muscle tone, he's already devised his bad-boy equalizer: a baseball
bat wrapped in barbed wire. Who needs a power move with a tool like
that?
</P>
<P>
   There's Joe Cabibbo, a stocky 24-year-old construction worker
from Lake Worth with a peach-fuzz haircut who enjoys wrestling as
an outlet for releasing his frustrations. ``I just love playing the
bad guy,'' he says. ``Being a wrestler is my first love.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants to learn the sport, but he's equally fascinated with
the behind-the-scenes dealings and business aspects. And his
girlfriend, a mental health worker, loves the fact that he's
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all on the bottom rung, but we're hungry,'' Cabibbo
says. ``I have no mind-set for if I fail.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's Maurice Hennebicq,who already has the uniform, if
not the skills. A burly man with curly black hair, a bird's nest of
a beard and a hairy chest, he showed up for his first class in
style. He wears a black stretch tank top, a leather forearm cuff,
black elbow pads, black leather boots and black leggings with the
words ``BIG MAURICE'' stitched in red letters across his keister.
To say he stands out among the rest of the group's wardrobe of
faded T-shirts and beat-up sneakers would be an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   During class, the men break into groups. Some practice holds and
power moves, while Armstrong works with two at a time in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   One man drapes his armpits over the top of the ring as his
opponent pulls the upper rope into his throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure you sell it!'' Armstrong yells. He wants more
screaming and groaning from the student absorbing the punishment.
He wants more arm flailing. He wants him to act like his head is
about to pop up like a Pez dispenser. (The word ``act'' isn't said,
but everyone knows what ``selling'' means.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Get your chin down into your chest!'' Armstrong yells.
``That's it. That's it!''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he takes over and shows them how it's done.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, he demonstrates on 25-year-old Shawn Ambrosino.
Ambrosino, a 6-foot-1, 310-pound former college defensive tackle,
climbs the shaky corner ropes until he can stand steady and tall on
a turnbuckle. In his baggy jeans with frayed hems, faded yellow
T-shirt, clunky boots and scraggly face, he looks like he just
emerged from a concert mosh pit _ and won.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrosino stands perched upright on the ropes, until Armstrong
grabs the student's ample waistline and barrel chest and flops him
in a somersault on his back. Ambrosino lands like an asteroid. The
ropes waggle violently. The yuppie gym rats in the next room crane
their necks around the corner to see just what the hell made that
sickening thud.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrosino grimaces, groans, arches his back. He is a master at
``selling it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the granddaddy of them all,'' Armstrong says of the
throw. He high-fives Ambrosino. ``Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   As if nothing happened, Ambrosino rolls to his feet and collects
the accolades of the others in the group.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, as the students take turns using the moves
they just learned, Armstrong takes stock of his ambitious herd.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have so much potential, it makes me sick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hulk'' Hogan turned Ambrosino on to becoming a wrestler. He
used to watch the Hulkster on TV and copy the tanned, muscular
wrestler's moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked larger than life to me,'' he says. ``He wasn't a
role model. It just seemed that for him to be doing that every
night would be tough. That was something I could look up to.''
</P>
<P>
   After playing football for the University of Central Florida,
Ambrosino returned to Royal Palm Beach and got a job working as a
customer service representative at a bank.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months ago, a friend at the gym told him about wrestling
school. He gave the school a try and quickly developed a love for
throwing another guy around a ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from football, I loved the contact,'' he says. He
thinks about it for a second, searching for the right term. ``Not
the contact ... the collision.'' He says ``collision' the way a
pyromaniac might say ``fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambrosino is one of Armstrong's pet pupils. His jumps are
sharper, his throws are a little more physical. And with a body
like a steamer trunk filled with wet cement, he knows how to sell a
move.
</P>
<P>
   A guy his size has a better chance of making it to the
professional ranks, says the WCW's Michael Weber. At the
organization's monthly auditions in Atlanta, only about two or
three out of a group of 15 candidates has what it takes to be
accepted in its Power Plant wrestling school. And an even smaller
percentage graduate from the wrestling school to the professional
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is the look,'' Weber says. ``We won't even look at
you if you're under 200 pounds. And just because you were an
All-American football player doesn't mean you can do this type of
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambrosino already has a stage name picked out: Gemini. That way
his character can be both a good guy and a bad guy, he reasons. All
he needs to do is paint his face two different colors. The way he
figures it, no one will know which side of Gemini will show up in
the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to think up a hook, a concept you can work with,'' he
says. ``You have to bring something new to the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, it's sports entertainment.''

 &HT;    Useless facts plentiful on Web
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Bill Husted
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever seen the results for one of those surveys about
what kind of television people watch, you know most of us favor
educational programs and care nothing at all for the shows that
flaunt sex, violence and lowbrow humor.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same with the Internet's World Wide Web. If you ask
your co-workers and friends how they use the Web, you'll find that
almost all of them are engaged in serious research.
</P>
<P>
   But, let's suppose you don't fit into any of these
super-studious categories. And that _ unlike most of your friends _
you actually waste time browsing Web sites that contribute nothing
at all to the world's storehouse of knowledge. This column is for
you. It's a look at some of the best ways to waste time on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Given the seriousness of today's quest, let's meet at a site
called The Three Stooges _ a starting point at
http://www.byrum.org/3stooges/. Here you'll find trivia about the
Stooges as well as a chance to get involved in serious political
movements. For instance, you'll learn how to organize to protest
the removal of ``The Three Stooges'' from the Family Channel's
programming lineup. For those of you who want still more, check out
The Official Three Stooges site at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .threestooges.com/.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of you should follow me. We have only a limited
amount of time to waste, so we'll need to keep moving. What you
need now are some facts. That way, when your more studious friends
begin to brag about all that they've learned from their day
browsing the Web, you'll be prepared to answer in kind.
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop will provide all sorts of important information
such as the fact termites can live to be 50 years old and there are
just 14 blimps left flying in the world. The page is called _ maybe
you would have guessed _ The Bin of Useless Facts, and it's located
at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .campbell.k12.ky.us/programs
</P>
<P>
   /oasis/BRAIN/RAK002.HTM. It is unlikely that anything you learn
here will get you ahead at work, but where else would you learn
that ``months that begin with a Sunday will always have a Friday
the 13th''?
</P>
<P>
   If by now you are worried you are wasting too much time browsing
the Web, perhaps you need a good time-wasting hobby. While many
come to mind, it would be difficult to go wrong with something such
as matchbook cover collecting.
</P>
<P>
   You can learn more about this hobby at a Web site called Online
Matchcover Auction at http://
</P>
<P>
   www.matchcovers.com/. Besides being able to trade matchbook
covers there, you'll learn stuff you won't find anywhere else,
including at any of the useless facts sites. For instance, you'll
find out the first matchbook cover advertisement appeared in 1895
and was for an entertainment troupe that promised ``A cyclone of
fun _ powerful caste _ pretty girls _ handsome ward-robe _ get
seats early.''
</P>
<P>
   If this seems like a stupid way to spend your time, you may want
to check your intelligence over at a site called IQ Test at http://
</P>
<P>
   www.iqtest.com/welcometest
</P>
<P>
   .html. It's really an amazingly accurate gauge of IQ. The real
question is whether IQ is an accurate gauge of intelligence,
however. And it's sort of fun.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if the IQ tests come back with some bad news for you,
you may as well try a page called Stupid News, Andy Savage Online,
at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .andysavage.com/news/news.html.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The dead candidates society
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Voters often elect the wrong people.
</P>
<P>
   Usually this is only a matter of opinion. Occasionally it's
irrefutable. Democracy is not perfect.
</P>
<P>
   The election last week of a dead Oklahoma woman to a spot in the
Democratic runoff for U.S. Senate seems a pretty clear case of the
democratic system gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, dead people cast ballots to elect the living. In
Oklahoma, it must work the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe that won't even be a problem. In a Senate filled with
the likes of Strom Thurmond and Slade Gorton, a dead person might
look right at home.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the primary puts Oklahoma Democrats in an awkward
position. The timing was a big problem. The candidate, Jacquelyn
Morrow Luis Ledgerwood, died of a heart attack only a month before
the election. This left no time to take her off the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   She went on to garner 21 percent of the vote, finishing second
in a field of four. She now has a shot at winning the primary in
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   If she wins, she would be the Democratic nominee against
incumbent Sen. Don Nickles in November, a man who is to the right
of anyone alive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even a dead candidate offers voters more choice than they
get in most states. In almost half the congressional races in the
country, the incumbent was re-elected without an opponent from the
other major party. At least Oklahoma Democrats have a chance to
vote for somebody, dead or alive.
</P>
<P>
   And for somebody who would be guaranteed not to surprise or
disappoint anyone after the election. In an age of low expectations
in public life, who could ask for more?
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's doubtful the majority of Oklahoma Democrats intended
to nominate a person who is no longer a member of the caucus of the
living.
</P>
<P>
   People may argue about this candidate or that. People may vote
liberal or conservative. But there are five categories of
candidates everyone wants to avoid:
</P>
<P>
   -- Nonexistent and nonhuman candidates. Cartoon characters for
example. You'd be surprised at how often they turn up as write-ins.
And inanimate objects, too. Two years ago, a write-in line on the
Volusia County general election ballot read: ``Volusia County Soil
and Water Conservation District (Vote for one).'' Water got the
most write-ins, edging out soil. Sadly, only votes for humans were
tallied.
</P>
<P>
   -- Dead candidates. See above. It happens.
</P>
<P>
   -- Insane candidates. There are forms of mental illness that
drive people to plop down filing fees, talk to reporters and
prepare amazingly detailed platforms. (``We can tap the icecaps for
water, energy and economic development! Details in the 145-page
position paper that I will post on the Web! I will not allow the
government or the lackeys of the so-called New World Order to
suppress this!!!'') The unseen running mate in such races all too
often is the voice the candidate hears in his head. As a candidate
for the House of Representatives told me many years ago, ``After
that head injury, a lot of things just started making sense to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Jailed candidates. Ever since the legendary James Curley of
Boston was elected mayor from behind bars, this has not been seen
as an insurmountable obstacle. But this is America. We expect our
leaders to go to jail after we elect them and not a moment before.
Anything else is jumping the gun.
</P>
<P>
   -- Candidates who have lost more than three consecutive
elections. The people can be very wrong on occasion, but after
three or four times, the collective wisdom must be on to something.
Three-strikes-and-you're-out laws should be expanded from criminal
sentencing to politics.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, politics would lose a lot of color and a certain amount of
choice if these five kinds of candidates were kept off ballot. But
brighten up, we would still enjoy the services of angry
single-issue candidates, disgruntled former public employees,
grudge candidates, people who have discovered the One Big Truth
that explains everything, the delusionally ambitious and people who
like to be videotaped.
</P>
<P>
   They would be happy to take up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   They always are.
</P>

 &HT;    Mariner Write has simple, stable word processing
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The developers of Mariner Write are nothing if not courageous.
They are releasing their simple but powerful word processor just at
the time when more and more people are playing it safe by choosing
Microsoft software.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Write's developers hope there's still a niche market for
those looking for an inexpensive alternative to Word 98,
Microsoft's latest version of its word processor.
</P>
<P>
   As such, Mariner Write is a good deal. It's fast, lean and
stable. The program includes most of Word's features but costs
$69.95. Word retails for $365.
</P>
<P>
   What's missing from Write are features that let you draw tables,
write outlines, auto-correct typos and automatically create indexes
and tables of contents. Word does all of these.
</P>
<P>
   Of these, the only two glaring weaknesses are the lack of
auto-correct and outlining. Both have become standard now in word
processing.
</P>
<P>
   But Writer does some things Word doesn't. For one, it lets you
highlight and edit noncontiguous text, a feature long part of Nisus
Writer.
</P>
<P>
   Writer even bests Nisus in one area. It handles styles far more
elegantly than this popular word processor. In Nisus, you set
rulers and fonts in two different places. Write combines both
rulers and fonts in a menu in the title bar of the document. It's
easy to switch among styles as you write.
</P>
<P>
   Word also lets you do this, but it's not as elegantly
implemented as in Write.
</P>
<P>
   Write also has Word beat in terms of stability and efficiency.
Even the latest version of Word, crammed as always with new
features, is unstable on anything but the fastest Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Worst yet, it's a hog. Word requires 13.3 megabytes of RAM and
occupies 5.2 megabytes on your hard drive. In contrast, Write takes
only 875 K of disk space and needs only 2 megabytes of RAM.
</P>
<P>
   It has a simple, uncluttered interface. There's just one
toolbar, which provides access to most of the things you'll need.
Move your cursor over a button to reveal its function.

   Write lets you drag and drop copy, insert automatically updating
page numbers and look at your words as they'd appear in print. It
also undoes up to 10 of your last actions and saves documents in
most word-processing formats. Write supports headers, footers but
not endnotes.
</P>
<P>
   Write includes some nice extras in the form of macros such as
one that capitalizes every sentence on command. It does so quicker
and more accurately than either Nisus or Word, which have a similar
feature.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Write is not a bad little package if all you want to
do is write or design newsletters and the like.

 &HT;    Just a few dollars to spare? You can still acquire stocks
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even when the stock market goes kablooey, as it did last week,
there are people who still want to get into it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not talking about committed stock investors, already in and
eager to ``buy on the dips.'' I'm hearing from newcomers, people
with only a few dollars to spare and a yearning to get started.
</P>
<P>
   ``How,'' a tenderfoot bargain hunter asked the other day, ``does
a person buy stock if he doesn't have thousands to put into a
brokerage account?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good question. There are two good answers _ mutual funds
that will open very small accounts and direct purchase or no-load
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these alternatives is an automatic winner, or even an
easy choice. Mutual fund managers have all sorts of stock-picking
strategies, for example. The performance of individual stocks is
infamously hard to assess.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, alternatives exist for people with high hopes and
low bank balances. The accompanying chart gives some examples, and
there are many more to be found. Here's a more detailed look at the
choices:
</P>
<P>
   Mutual funds
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar Inc., a widely respected mutual fund research firm,
came up with 48 funds that will open an account for $500 or less.
(A few other funds say they will accept a minimum investment of
zero dollars, but that's too metaphysical for me to figure out.)
</P>
<P>
   The 48 include a variety of investment styles. MSB, for example,
invests in a blend of value and growth stocks. That means,
respectively, stocks that people think have attractively low prices
and stocks that have attractive growth records or prospects or
both. MSB likes to buy stock in very large companies.
</P>
<P>
   Muhlenkemp buys the shares of midsized, value companies. Pax
World is a ``domestic hybrid,'' meaning that it buys U.S.
securities, including stocks, bonds and convertibles. It describes
itself as a socially responsible fund, avoiding defense, tobacco,
liquor and gambling-related companies.
</P>
<P>
   Investment styles are not the only thing to consider. You must
think over how much risk you're willing to tolerate. You should
also check out the fees and operating expenses of any fund you
consider. Morningstar's list included the well-known Fidelity
Destiny I and Destiny II funds, for example. But the front-end
sales charge of each of those is 8.67 percent, which was enough to
put them off my list.
</P>
<P>
   As you begin an investment program, you're also beginning your
investment education. When you call up a fund company, you should
ask for the fund's prospectus and most recent quarterly or annual
report. It will tell you about sales charges and operating
expenses. You should also think over the things the company has to
say about how it picks stocks, and about why its recent performance
has been good, bad or just so-so.
</P>
<P>
   Those documents also will give you comparisons of how the fund
did in comparison with similar funds and with stock market
averages. Check out both long-term and recent performance. You
might also want to check how long the manager has been on board. Is
he a newcomer, or someone who has been around long enough to shape
the fund's performance?
</P>
<P>
   You can continue your education at the nearest public library.
Look for general-purpose books on financial planning. Kathy Kristof
has a good one, as do Marshall Loeb, Jane Bryant Quinn and Grace
Weinstein. Public libraries often carry the Morningstar ratings
books, which are packed with both statistics and plain-language
assessments of a fund's practices and philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, some good places to start are www
</P>
<P>
   .morningstar.net, http://www
</P>
<P>
   .accessatlanta.com/business
</P>
<P>
   /finance/dividendreinvestment
</P>
<P>
   .html or http://www
</P>
<P>
   .investorama.com/director.html.
</P>
<P>
   `No-load' stocks
</P>
<P>
   About 200 companies will sell stock directly to the public, so
you don't have to go through a broker. A major advantage of these
direct investment programs is that your first step into the market
can be a baby step _ committing as little as $50. Another advantage
is that you won't have to pay a big percentage of your money as a
stock broker's fee.
</P>
<P>
   Low costs are also important if you want to put your second
investment into an entirely different company, thus moving toward a
basic investing goal _ spreading or diversifying your investments
among different kinds of companies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another advantage is that direct-investment companies tend
to be larger, older and steadier companies. They may well go down
with the overall market, but they aren't likely to go under.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``no-load'' is a casual one and not always true. Some
companies charge a fee for selling you some of their shares. It
will likely be less than a broker would charge, but it's something
to check.
</P>
<P>
   These programs are not for short-term or nervous investors.
That's because each company sells or buys back shares on its own
schedule, perhaps once a week or even once a month. This is an
investment strategy for the long haul. It is not for people who
hope to snatch today's profit before the sun goes down.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential drawback: tax paperwork, particularly if you
choose to reinvest dividends. The company will send along a form
called a 1099 that contains the information you need to report to
the Internal Revenue Service. But you'll have to keep up with and
manage that paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   To find companies beyond those listed in the table, try the
library. Look for books by Charles B. Carlson, an author and
specialist on direct investments. Ask also if your library has
newsletters on the subject, including Carlson's DRIP Investor and
The Moneypaper.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, check out www.netstockdirect.com,www
</P>
<P>
   .noloadstocks.com or www
</P>
<P>
   .dripinvestor.com. The latter has information on a larger group
of stocks that will sell directly to individuals but only after
they have acquired at least one share of the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Why now?
</P>
<P>
   Why should you pump money into a sinking stock market?
</P>
<P>
   The readers I hear from clearly are bargain hunters. If savvy
investors want to buy when prices are down, newcomers want to do
the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   A more basic reason is that successful investing is a long-term
process. You put a little money in this month, and you learn a
little. You do the same thing next month and the month after that.
You have to start sometime, and today is better than tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, some people just like to swim against the tide. On Main
Street, such people are called ornery or even wrongheaded. But on
Wall Street, there is an honorable term for them: contrarians.

 &HT;    Pax TV becomes nation's seventh network
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   And then there were seven.
</P>
<P>
   Today (Monday, August 31), Pax TV becomes the nation's seventh
network with a slate of family-themed shows.
</P>
<P>
   The West Palm Beach-based network kicks off at noon with Great
Day America (WPXP-Channel 67), a one-hour entertainment/talk show
broadcast live from Universal Studios in Los Angeles. Yes, the show
is new, but don't expect to see too much original fare on Pax TV.
Only 20 percent of the network's shows are first-run.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Pax TV will primarily boast infomercials, a meditative
show called Worship (it features scenes of nature, Burt Bacharach
music and words of wisdom) and repeats of old network fare.
</P>
<P>
   But it's those repeats Pax TV is counting on. Over time, the
network hopes to build an audience on such popular shows as Touched
By An Angel, Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman and Diagnosis Murder. For
old-time TV buffs, there's always Medical Center, Bonanza and The
Big Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our idea is that you can still actually (air) television shows
that really rely on just telling stories about relationships
between people, and that don't rely on sexual titillation and
people perpetrating violence on one another,'' says Jeff Sagansky,
Pax TV president and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Steve Sohmer, Pax TV's head of marketing and promotion:
``This is no schizophrenic mosaic trying to be all things to all
people. Pax TV is a brand that's absolutely, positively,
unblinkingly crystal clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but the producers behind Pax TV's original shows
candidly admit the network is in for a Godzilla-sized battle. While
Pax TV bills itself as a network for all ages, such shows as
Diagnosis Murder and Dr. Quinn mostly attract viewers over 50.
</P>
<P>
   For example, according to TN Media, a New York-based media
buying firm, last fall Diagnosis Murder was TV's
second-oldest-skewing show, with a median age of 57. Touched By An
Angel's median viewer age was 52, while Dr. Quinn's was 51.
</P>
<P>
   Great Day America co-host and executive producer Michael Young
worked at CNBC during its 1989 launch and remembers how difficult
it was to get viewers and guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first year, we were trying to get all the newsmakers in
the financial community to come on and be guests,'' recalls the
former Flamingo Fortune host. ``But we didn't just have to call
them and find out if they were available, we had to call them and
explain the damn network. It was hard to get guests and get people
excited.''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Young acknowledges the same thing is happening with
Pax TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we go out there to get guests, the first thing you have
to do is say, `This is our show and this is what it's about,' and
they go, `Oh, where is it on?' We tell them Pax TV and they say,
`What's Pax TV?''' says Young. ``Now, not only do we have to
explain the show, we have to explain the network. And that'll get
easier, but right now it's a difficult thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Booking guests has gone a bit smoother at Woman's Day TV, a
half-hour lifestyle/talk show based on the popular magazine and
hosted by Phyllis George and Sloan Lindemann. Some of the
celebrities scheduled to appear include Kris Kristofferson, Donny
and Marie Osmond and The View's Star Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woman's Day is a cache, it's like an institution,'' says
executive producer Brad Nathanson. ``That brand is helping us a
lot. But we're not thinking about ratings at the production office.
We're just thinking about making a great show.''
</P>
<P>
   So are the producers of It's A Miracle, a reality-based show
about people who claim to have witnessed miracles. Like so many
other reality-based shows, It's A Miracle will recreate the actual
events _ but with a twist. Instead of using actors, producers will
use the real people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unsolved Mysteries do real drama re-creations,'' explains Jean
Wiegman, the show's executive producer. ``Ours are more reality
based. Theirs have more of a dramatic structure.''
</P>
<P>
   But isn't it tough getting non-actors to ... act?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not really,'' says Wiegman, who produced such Fox specials
as Why Planes Go Down and Inside a Crash. ``We get them, like,
mourning towards the lake. We don't get them to do a lot of
dialogue. We've chosen stories that are multi-dimensional and
compelling. Hopefully people who like this kind of alternative
programming will find us and stay with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Producers note there are some advantages to working for an
upstart network. The biggest perk: Network suits don't meddle as
much, and Pax TV programmers are actually open to casting
suggestions and storylines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other networks have their rules and regulations and they
don't like to change them,'' grumbles John Ryan, producer of Little
Men, a drama about an woman running a boys boarding school alone in
1871. ``Pax TV is more willing to take a chance. For instance, they
left it up to the executive producers and myself to find the
(Toronto) location. They just went along with us. We showed them
some pictures and they bought into it. With the networks, they
would've flown up here, they would've hemmed and hawed and said,
`No, we want something a little different.'''
</P>
<P>
   Before getting involved with Pax TV, many producers admit they
knew little about the network's founder, Lowell ``Bud'' Paxson. All
they knew was the cash-rich entrepreneur started the Home Shopping
Network and is a staunch conservative with deeply held religious
views.
</P>
<P>
   Little Men's Ryan says he searched the Web to get more
information on Paxson. Ryan adds he was asked to produce Little Men
because of his extensive background of producing such period TV
movies as Lonesome Dove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm familiar with this time period and horses and buggies,''
says Ryan, who has produced about 15 TV movies for the major
networks. ``You do one period thing and then all of a sudden, I'm
called when they need a producer who knows his way around animals
during that period.''
</P>
<P>
   Great Day America's Young remembers being called by someone at
Paxson Communications who asked if he would be a roving reporter at
the company's West Palm Beach unveiling party last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked me what kind of compensation I wanted,'' he
recalls, ``and I said, `I never met Bud Paxson, so after it's over,
I'd like to go to lunch with him and find out about his network.'''
</P>
<P>
   Young did meet with Paxson and pitched what eventually became
Great Day America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept waiting for Bud to ask me what my religious preference
was,'' says Young. ``He never did, and he still hasn't done it. He
couldn't have made a bolder statement in hiring Jeff Sagansky. Jeff
is a very committed Jew, and if Bud was one of those right-wing,
born-again Christians who don't think Jews are saved, he wouldn't
have hired someone like Jeff.''
</P>
<P>
   Pax TV hopes to attract families
</P>
<P>
   If you get tired of watching countless Touched By An Angel
repeats or sleep-inducing infomercials, the Pax TV folks hope
you'll check out their new programs. Here's the lowdown on all of
their original shows.
</P>
<P>
   GREAT DAY AMERICA
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: Have you seen the last hour of the Today show?
Now you know what Great Day America will look like. This one-hour
show will broadcast live from Universal Studios in Los Angeles and
offer mostly lifestyle information, current events and celebrity
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Says co-host Michael Young: ``Today has beaten the hell out of
Good Morning America in the ratings, and we'd rather emulate the
leader. But I'm nowhere near as handsome as Matt Lauer.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect big name guests, though. The first week you'll see
Rod Steiger and Harrison Young. Harrison who? He played the older
Matt Damon character in Saving Private Ryan. Susan Crenshaw
co-hosts. Interestingly, Crenshaw replaced Maria Calleia, who was
introduced to TV writers as the show's co-host. Now Calleia's just
a regular contributor. Explains a show insider: ``Contract
negotiations never worked out. But there are no hard feelings.''
Sounds so Hollywood, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   When it debuts: noon, Monday
</P>
<P>
   When it airs: 5 p.m., weekdays
</P>
<P>
   IT'S A MIRACLE
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: Think Unsolved Mysteries meets Oprah. Producers
re-create miracles, then interview the people involved. You'll hear
about dogs who saved little boys from drowning and lovers who fell
in love at an organ donors convention. Wait ... the producers swear
It's A Miracle won't turn into a sleazy, reality-based show. ``This
isn't When Animals Attack,'' says Jean Wiegman, the show's
executive producer. ``We're not going the sensational route; we're
going the inspirational route.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hosted by the odd-couple pair of Nia Peebles (Dance Party)
and country singer Billy Dean. If the stories are boring, at least
we know the hosts can sing and dance.
</P>
<P>
   When it debuts: Sept. 6
</P>
<P>
   When it airs: 9 p.m., Sundays
</P>
<P>
   LITTLE MEN
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: It's the story of Jo Baher, one of the Little
Women characters who must run a boarding school for boys alone
after her schoolteacher husband dies. Of course, Jo struggles to
keep the school running but manages to offer a lot of life lessons
along the way. ``There's going to be plenty of opportunity for
adventures and Tom Sawyer-ish action,'' says executive producer
Carl Binder.
</P>
<P>
   And there'll be some romance. Jo might find love with bad boy
Nick, who's released in Jo's care after doing time in the joint.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, producers are scrambling to meet tight production
schedules on the Toronto set. ``It's been nip and tuck around
here,'' notes producer John Ryan (Lonesome Dove). ``We go to camera
in two weeks, and we just hired our leads last night!''
</P>
<P>
   When it debuts: Nov. 7
</P>
<P>
   When it airs: 8 p.m., Sundays
</P>
<P>
   WOMAN'S DAY TV
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: Woman's Day the magazine comes to life. Hosted
by Phyllis George (yes, that Phyllis George) and Sloan Lindemann (a
former New York City assistant D.A.), the show is designed to
entertain and inspire women of all ages. ``The demographics are
pretty wide,'' says Brad Nathanson, executive producer and
director. ``It's 26 to 54. We're not going after the MTV
generation.'' Expect segments on cooking, fitness, beauty, time
management and gossip. ``We're not trying to emulate a talk show,''
sniffs Nathanson. ``None of us like that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   When it debuts: Monday
</P>
<P>
   When it airs: 2 p.m., weekdays
</P>
<P>
   FLIPPER: THE NEW ADVENTURES
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: Just like the old Flipper, except he'll have
some new adventures. Whip Hubley (Top Gun) stars as Dr. Keith
Ricks, the Florida Keys marine biologist (the show is filmed in
Australia, though) whose best buddy is a dolphin. Let's hope it's
better than the awful Flipper movie starring Elijah Wood and Paul
Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   When it debuts: Saturday
</P>
<P>
   When it airs: 8 p.m., Saturdays
</P>
<P>
   REEL TO REEL
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: A movie trivia game show hosted by former
Hollywood Squares host Peter Marshall. What??? Peter Marshall's
still alive? You think that's funny, check out the Who's Who of
C-list stars scheduled to appear on the show: Abe Vigoda, Police
Academy's Michael Winslow, Stella Stevens, Robert Hays, Linda
Blair, Jeff Conaway, Stephanie Powers and Shelley Duvall. First
question: What was the last movie each of these stars made?
</P>
<P>
   When it debuts: Monday
</P>
<P>
   When it airs: 2:30 p.m., weekdays
</P>
<P>
   CLOUD NINE
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: A trio of do-good teen angels take over a TV
station and broadcast uplifting kid shows. Sounds like the story of
Pax TV. Actually Pax TV is trying to copy ABC's successful 1
Saturday Morning cartoon block. Forget that Power Rangers stuff,
these angels program shows about a shipwrecked family (Adventures
of Swiss Family Robinson); a merry group of animal friends (Get
Along Gang); a mismatched soccer team (Hurricanes); a show that
answers silly questions kids have (Inquiring Minds); a team of
peacekeeping heroes (Starcom); a magical forest where you shrink
and wishes come true (The Sylvanian Families); adventures of two
toothbrushes (The Toothbrush Family); and a cool mayor who helps
children solve problems (Zaktales).
</P>
<P>
   Says Andy Heyward, Cloud 9's executive producer: ``The stories
will center on personal and work problems and at the same time be
warmhearted and (deal with) kid-relatable issues.''
</P>
<P>
   When it debuts: Saturday
</P>
<P>
   When it airs: 7-9 a.m., Saturdays; 6-9 a.m., Sundays
</P>
<P>
   Shows that lost viewers
</P>
<P>
   will be finding new life
</P>
<P>
   on network's lineup
</P>
<P>
   Pax TV will air several shows you've either heard of or seen
before. Here are five you may have never watched or even knew
existed.
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTY
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: Based on Catherine Marshall's novel about a
spunky young woman (Kellie Martin) who leaves a cushy life in
Tennessee to teach at a missionary school in a remote Appalachian
community.
</P>
<P>
   When it airs: 6 p.m., Sundays
</P>
<P>
   When it aired before: CBS, 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
   LIFE GOES ON
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: A gentle drama about a working-class family
dealing with all sorts of problems including handicapped children
and AIDS. Gee, wonder if the ultra-conservative Pax TV will lose
those AIDS episodes? Stars Kellie Martin and Patti LuPone.
</P>
<P>
   When it airs: 7 p.m., weekdays
</P>
<P>
   When it aired before: ABC, 1989-93
</P>
<P>
   I'LL FLY AWAY
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: A thoughtful drama about race relations in the
South in the 1950s. Sam Waterston stars as the gentlemanly
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   When it airs: 10 p.m., Sundays
</P>
<P>
   When it aired before: NBC, 1991-93
</P>
<P>
   THE HOGAN FAMILY
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: A typical sitcom about a harried mom (Valerie
Harper) juggling family and career. Mostly remembered for when
Harper left the show after one year in a well-publicized spat with
NBC. The network replaced her with Sandy Duncan, who played her
husband's divorced sister.
</P>
<P>
   When it airs: 4 p.m., weekdays
</P>
<P>
   When it aired before: NBC/CBS, 1986-91
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL CENTER
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: Before ER and Chicago Hope, there was Medical
Center, starring the hunky Chad Everett as a dedicated doctor
dealing with personal medical dramas.
</P>
<P>
   When it airs: midnight Sundays
</P>
<P>
   When it aired before: CBS, 1969-76

 &HT;    Computers head list of back-to-school supplies for today's
college students.
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Next to deciding whether to go to class on a regular basis,
picking a computer to use at college is one of the biggest
decisions a student makes.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of college students, responding to a poll
commissioned by Sprint, named the computer the most important
back-to-school item. It ranked ahead of calculators, stereos and
televisions.
</P>
<P>
   Those seeking help buying a computer often encounter a barrage
of confusing and conflicting advice. But most experts agree that
you should buy as much computer as you can afford. But, with prices
falling by the day, that may be more computer than you'd imagine.
</P>
<P>
   As a starting point, most students can spend $1,400 and get a PC
that should be more than adequate. A 15-inch color monitor will run
about $300 more.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want an IBM-compatible PC, Brian Carr, assistant
director of the Georgia Tech bookstore, recommends buying at least
a 266 megahertz Pentium processor, 32 megabytes of RAM and a 2
gigabyte hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   For Macintosh users, Carr recommends the iMac, with a 233
megahertz processor, 32 megabytes of RAM and a 4 gigabyte hard
drive. In both cases, he recommends a 56k bps modem.
</P>
<P>
   Carr says to buy the most machine you can, but hold off on
software purchases until you see what discount packages your school
offers.
</P>
<P>
   Tech junior Divya Gupta followed that advice and bought a
top-of-the-line IBM-clone when she started school two years ago. If
she had to do it over again, she would spend a little less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look for the best deal and don't get suckered into what's
the best thing out there,'' said Gupta, a third-year mechanical
engineering student from Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's best isn't what's necessary for school. You don't need
anything too extravagant and you don't need a top-of-the-line
model,'' she said. ``You just need something that processes fast
enough and that has a decent modem, basically.''
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Dell Computers recommend checking with your
university or college before buying a computer. Most schools post
minimum technology recommendations on their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   They also advise reading computer reviews in newspapers and
industry magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the company backs up the machine with a warranty and
enhances your tech knowledge with toll-free, 24-hour-a-day support.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech is one of the few local colleges with minimum
technology requirements. Emory University, like most schools,
limits itself to making recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Cabot is in charge of computer support for Georgia Tech.
She said the school lets students know the minimum computer
requirements by mail and with postings on Tech's Web site by May.
</P>
<P>
   Tech also requires a standard suite of software programs. This
year's list includes Microsoft Office 98, Adobe Pagemill and
Symantec Cafe and costs about $325.
</P>
<P>
   Each year the selection changes slightly. A committee reviews
and posts any changes by March 1, Cabot said.
</P>
<P>
   Gupta, 20, said she uses her computer to read course syllabuses
online, to get homework assignments and then check her answers. Her
PC also serves as a telephone answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big help,'' she said. ``I was like, `Wow. This is
really going to be handy.'''
</P>
<P>
   A self-described pre-college tech-novice, Gupta became
well-versed enough to install a second hard drive when the software
she downloaded from the Web clogged up the first. It took her about
a half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get a computer and you have to use it, you tend to
play around with it, talk to people and you learn to make things
work. You get less intimidated by technology by having the
computer,'' she said. ``But still, I would never have dreamed I
could have done it myself.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S NEW AND HOT
</P>
<P>
   What's new _ and expensive _ this year in the computer world.
</P>
<P>
   400 megahertz Pentium processors The extra speed lets you handle
3-D graphics, digital photographs and video editing more quickly
and, thus, more practically. And Intel recently introduced a 450
megahertz chip.
</P>
<P>
   Pentium II technology for notebook computers Some of the hottest
notebooks are now just as powerful as desktop machines.
</P>
<P>
   56k modems You can download bit-laden text, graphics and image
files via the Internet much faster.
</P>
<P>
   Digital versatile discs or DVD This technology makes it possible
to run full-motion movies and high-end games on the computer.

 &HT;    Cheap PCs intriguing, but you probably won't purchase one
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've been expecting grocery stores to start selling computers in
the checkout line any day now. They'd be stacked up somewhere
between copies of the National Enquirer and boxes of Good 'N Plenty
and would cost about the same.
</P>
<P>
   After all, everyone says computers are dirt cheap these days.
And you don't have to go any further than this newspaper for proof.
Just look at the ads. You'll find computers _ brand new ones _ for
as little as $400 or so. I can remember when a person paid that
much for a modem.
</P>
<P>
   The low prices are real. But they can be misleading, too. I'm
not saying the stores are trying to deceive you. What I am saying
is that _ once you get in the store _ you may find that the bargain
basement PCs aren't for you.
</P>
<P>
   Let me explain. Last weekend I went shopping for a new computer.
I finally got tired of using a PC that sounded like a washing
machine filled with rocks and soft drink bottles. It was scaring my
cat. Besides, the old machine was way too slow.
</P>
<P>
   While it is powerful enough for word processing, browsing the
Web and checking e-mail, it is showing its age. The once-gigantic
1-gigabyte hard disk now seems tiny. The 256-color video card is
something of an antique. The 125-megahertz processor speed (that's
not a typo, the 125 megahertz is the result of an Overdrive chip)
seems way too slow now.
</P>
<P>
   It was on a shopping trip to replace that PC that I discovered a
truth that can only be learned at the cash register: For someone
who needs a relatively powerful PC, prices haven't really changed
much.
</P>
<P>
   Those of you who know me _ either through this column or
face-to-face _ understand I'm not exactly a free spender. With cars
and computers, I tend to wait as long as I can before replacing
what I own. I think there are still some good miles left in my Nash
Rambler, but my computer is on its last legs.
</P>
<P>
   I went shopping with the notion of picking up a new PC for $500
or so. After all, I've been earnestly assuring you that most of us
don't need a state-of-the-art machine.
</P>
<P>
   But being a TechnoBuddy doesn't make a person immune to the sort
of raw hunger for power that hits folks in a computer store. Before
long, I was rationalizing with the best of them. I told myself
those inexpensive computers weren't much more powerful than the PC
I wanted to replace.
</P>
<P>
   I told myself I was looking for a machine that would have some
chance of being useful for three or four years. And yet I didn't
want to pay top dollar for the fastest chip around. The machine
needed more RAM memory and a much bigger hard drive, and it needed
one of the new 100-megahertz motherboards.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah. There was one other thing. The new machine needed to
be powerful enough to play computer games. The old machine just
wasn't powerful enough for modern games. Lately I've been getting
this powerful hankering to kill space aliens. It's a plain and
simple fact that the most demanding computer programs these days
are games.
</P>
<P>
   I ended up buying a 350-megahertz Pentium II machine with an
8-gigabyte hard disk and 64 megabytes of RAM. That's not the
fastest machine on the market, but it should be powerful enough to
play most of the games that have been collecting dust on my
bookshelf. And since it uses the new 100-megahertz bus _ the bus is
the circuitry that moves data on the motherboard _ I should be able
to upgrade the machine as new chips come along.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of machines like that to choose from. And the
price spread for PCs with these specifications was real familiar:
It ranged from about $2,000 for brand-name machines down to $1,300
for no-name PCs. That's identical to the prices I saw the last time
I bought a PC. What I'm trying to say is that while there may have
been some really big changes in computer prices lately, human
nature is still pretty much the same.
</P>
<P>
   I'm betting that the $500 machines will get you into the store
but that you won't go home with one.

 &HT;    PC voice recognition: Last word still elusive
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps it is something left over from the film ``2001,'' but I
have always felt rather self-conscious talking to a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, since publishers are claiming great strides
recently in the advancement of voice recognition systems, I am
talking to mine on a regular basis these days. The results are
mixed, at best.
</P>
<P>
   I have several new systems to test; the one we'll examine today
is L&AMP;H Voice Xpress Plus, a program confined to dictating text and
formatting commands to Microsoft Word 97 or 98, or the considerably
less elaborate word processor contained within the program.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, if Voice Xpress is representative of the breed,
computer dictation programs have indeed made great strides over the
past few years. It will not only record your words, but you can
dictate formatting changes, manipulate menus and almost entirely
eliminate the use of the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   The program comes with a head-mounted microphone, with one
earpiece, in case for some odd reason you want to hear your voice
played back to you. It's comfortable enough, although it interferes
annoyingly with the ingestion of food and drink.
</P>
<P>
   First come the mechanical issues of setting up the software,
which attaches itself like a leech to Microsoft Word, and getting
the microphone adjusted and calibrated. Then the user must
``enroll'' in the program. This is simply a curious way of saying
you have to teach the program to understand your voice.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a simple matter. It consists of uttering 416
statements, mostly witty aphorisms, until the program understands
all or at least most of it. It can take awhile.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with my review of any voice recognition program is
my voice. It has been likened to that of Burl Ives with a toad in
his throat. I tend to mumble, and whistle at ``ess'' sounds. Even
my wife often can't understand me.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, once I opened Word the old-fashioned way, I used
the voice recognition program to open the File menu. From there, I
used voice commands to open a story. Amazingly, it all worked.
</P>
<P>
   Voice Xpress runs significantly behind your dictation; it takes
awhile to figure things out. If, for instance, you dictate ``Mary
had a little lamb'' and the program decides you said, ``Mary had a
little ham,'' you simply tell it to ``delete last word'' and then
try again. If you can't get it to understand, then you can go into
spelling mode.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often it fails to recognize I am giving editing
commands and not dictation, but that may be my fault. Anyone who
enunciates so poorly that a program came up with ``Thelma'' when
the phrase was ``the movie'' shouldn't be too critical.
</P>
<P>
   Working carefully, I can generally create a sentence every five
minutes or so. At that rate, I fear I won't live long enough to
create the Great American Novel, or even an average American novel.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't believe programs like this are really intended for
people with two good hands for typing. Regardless of how much you
dislike typing, you'll find getting comfortable with Voice Xpress
more trouble than it's worth unless you're in Rex Harrison's vocal
league.
</P>
<P>
   But for those with physical problems that make it difficult or
impossible to type, a voice recognition program, and especially one
that allows the manipulation of a standard word processor in a
virtually no-hands mode, could be a godsend.
</P>
<P>
   Before drawing any final conclusions, we'll look at a couple of
more commonly available programs of this sort.

 &HT;    Can Bud Paxson make money on the first-ever, feel good TV
network for families?
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At noon Monday, engineer Bill Meyer will click a computer mouse
at PAX TV's satellite uplink center and _ poof! _ the nation's
seventh commercial broadcast network will start running with the
big dogs _ ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox.
</P>
<P>
   At PAX TV's West Palm Beach headquarters, there won't be a
champagne-popping party for the 160 employees _ not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have a party when we start making money,'' says Lowell
``Bud'' Paxson, who built the network that could put him and West
Palm Beach on the broadcasting map.
</P>
<P>
   If PAX TV works, Paxson, 63, becomes a billionaire, a media
power broker running with the Michael Eisners and Rupert Murdochs
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   And he will have done what no one else has ever done: Create a
network dedicated to G-rated shows and built primarily with
stations he owns _ not affiliate stations, which is how other
networks work.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson owns or operates 71 TV stations _ more stations than
anyone in the United States. With those stations, plus 24
affiliates and some cable access, PAX TV will reach 76 million of
America's 99.4 million TV households.
</P>
<P>
   What they will see is a new kind of commercial network TV:
Wholesome shows. Spiritual shows. Uplifting shows. Shows such as a
new Flipper series and reruns of the CBS hit Touched by an Angel.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a Christian network, Paxson says. No preachers, no
pitches, no pontificating.
</P>
<P>
   But the network is the result of a powerful partnership: God and
Bud Paxson.
</P>
<P>
   To understand PAX TV, you must know the imposing, 6-foot-7-inch
man who pushed all of his chips to the middle of the table to
create it.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson, who grew up in Rochester, N.Y., as the son of a Kodak
machinist, likes to do business at what he calls ``stupid speed.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't climb through windows of opportunity, he dives.
</P>
<P>
   Even as a kid he was smart about business. He raised hamsters
that he sold for $1 each and became a disc jockey _ Buddy Bud _
when he was a teenager.
</P>
<P>
   After earning a degree at Syracuse University, Paxson bought
radio stations in Newark, then Jamestown, N.Y., and Waterbury,
Conn. He moved to Florida in 1968 when he bought an AM in Sarasota.
</P>
<P>
   It was a small station with a small budget, where the title of
owner meant he also had to collect past-due ad bills. One unpaid
account meant he couldn't make the station's payroll. He went to
collect the $1,000. But instead of cash, the appliance store paid
him with 112 can openers. He sold them on the air.
</P>
<P>
   He hit his first home run when he and a partner created the
Clearwater-based Home Shopping Network in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   But as he built himself into a millionaire, Paxson's home life
was crumbling. On Christmas Day 1986, right after the family had
unwrapped the gifts in their Sarasota home, Paxson's second wife,
Barbara, dropped the bomb: She was leaving him for another man.
</P>
<P>
   Despondent, drained and dumped, Paxson spent New Year's Eve
alone in a suite at the Las Vegas Caesar's Palace.
</P>
<P>
   The miserable millionaire tore through the suite looking for a
Bible. He found it, opened it. He read how God saved Job. He read
on and on. And then, he says, God filled him with a pure and
perfect peace.
</P>
<P>
   He dedicated his life to God, and Paxson doesn't care who tries
to use this partnership to make him look foolish.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not speak to me,'' explains Paxson. ``You do not hear
an audible voice. The old cartoon is pretty accurate. You've got
the devil on one shoulder and the little angel on the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people can only hear the devil, Paxson says. He listens for
the angel.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you develop your faith, you become sensitized to an
internal knowing, and it's a knowing that grows.''
</P>
<P>
   That knowing led Paxson to take the biggest gamble in broadcast
history.
</P>
<P>
   He cashed out of the Home Shopping Network (and Silver King
Broadcasting) with $133 million in 1991. Next, he built a
47-station radio network that he sold for $633 million in spring
1997. Along with the radio stations, he had been buying TV
stations.
</P>
<P>
   He had an idea. In 1992, Congress had ruled that cable systems
had to provide a channel for all local stations. Paxson knew he
could build a network out of low-power stations that cable systems
had to carry.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``must-carry'' rule, universally hated by cable
operators and cable networks, was challenged and slowly worked its
way to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Paxson bought his third TV station, this one in
Atlanta, and suddenly had buyer's remorse. What if the Supreme
Court killed must-carry?
</P>
<P>
   He was worried. He couldn't sleep. He needed help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to the Lord, `Gee whiz, we're going to have a
must-carry decision. What have I done?' '' he recalls. ``The Lord
said, `Don't worry about must-carry.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Paxson worried no more. ``We went out and bought 50 more TV
stations.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 31, 1997, the Supreme Court upheld the must-carry rule.
When Paxson got the news, he broke down and cried.
</P>
<P>
   With the Lord on his side, Paxson says, ``it was not a gamble at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   PAX TV was announced in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Television on his own terms
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we believe in,'' Paxson says, ``simply good
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney's Michael Eisner may know what middle-class families want
in their theme parks, but Paxson thinks he knows what they want on
their TV sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the family is at the heart of
society,'' he contends. ``That is the common denominator, and if
ABC, CBS and NBC knew it, television wouldn't be at the sorry state
that it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry or not, monolithic ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox must lure huge
audiences to their shows. They can't make money on shows watched in
``only'' 10 million TV households.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson's lean network doesn't need those numbers to make money.
Because Paxson owns the stations and because his original
programming will be cheap by network standards, PAX TV just needs
to average 994,000 TV households to make money.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson's betting that at 9 p.m. Mondays, 994,000 TV households
would watch reruns of Touched by an Angel instead of Melrose Place,
NFL football or any other show.
</P>
<P>
   Or, at 8 p.m. Saturday, he's hoping 994,000 TV households would
rather watch Flipper than Cops or America's Funniest Home Videos.
</P>
<P>
   When reruns of Touched by an Angel were headed to CBS-owned The
Nashville Network's schedule, Paxson rushed up with an eye-popping
bid and bought the right to run the 88 episodes 10 times each for
$950,000 per episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a preemptive buy,'' he says. ``I needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxson reportedly paid $300,000 per episode for reruns of Dr.
Quinn, Medicine Woman.
</P>
<P>
   The last two commercial networks _ WB (Warner Bros.) and UPN
(Paramount) _ launched in January 1995, both with the huge cash
reserves of a movie/TV studio behind them. Each has reportedly lost
more than $150 million annually, and neither is producing the 20
hours of original programs that PAX TV offers on Day One.
</P>
<P>
   The six networks sell national ads. An owner of a group of
affiliated stations sells target markets and local ads. PAX TV can
sell all three.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why it can't miss,'' says Paxson.
</P>
<P>
   With a smile, Paxson recalls surfing channels recently and
seeing a stand-up comic on Comedy Central. ``He mentioned PAX TV
and said, `No sex, no violence, no ratings.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street and media analysts aren't laughing at the PAX TV
idea. None is predicting doom or success _ but there's agreement it
could fly.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran TV ad buyer Paul Schulman, with heavyweight clients such
as Energizer batteries, The Gap and Ralston Purina, says, ``When
you have a goal of a 1 rating (994,000 TV households), that's not a
ridiculously high measuring board. And it is possible that they
will not achieve it in year one.''
</P>
<P>
   That only means that Paxson has to stay in the game, says
Schulman, ``and certainly Bud Paxson has the dough to stay in this
for the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulman, with offices in Boca Raton and New York City,
concludes, ``The way I look at their schedule, it's pretty much a
poor man's CBS because most of the programs that they have acquired
are programs that will have an older audience skew. Most
advertisers are interested in the 18-49 audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxson describes his target viewers as women 25-50 who will use
the remote to take their families to a peaceful place, the home of
shows that affirm life.
</P>
<P>
   Original Paxson shows will aspire to inspire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus told about his father in story and parables,'' says
Paxson. ``And that's what we want to be known as, the story and
parable teller. I think (show creator) Martha Williamson got it
right with Touched by an Angel. God exists, and He loves you,
period.''
</P>
<P>
   But Paxson prefers God's subtle message.
</P>
<P>
   He's received ``at least 200 requests'' from TV preachers who
want to buy time on PAX TV. He has said ``no.'' When Fox recently
bought The Family Channel, part of the deal was that the Fox Family
Channel had to continue airing Pat Robertson's 700 Club. Fox,
desperate to dump the Christian talk show, offered Paxson ``a ton
of money'' to take the 700 Club. Paxson said ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   On a mission from God, there's no room for hitchhikers.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sagansky: Obscurity with an ocean view?
</P>
<P>
   Now that Paxson's built the foundation, the game of PAX TV is in
the hands of Jeff Sagansky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sagansky is Paxson's biggest asset, no question,'' says ad
buyer Schulman.
</P>
<P>
   As the president and CEO of PAX TV, Sagansky is a 47-year-old
former CBS programming boss who took the network from No. 3 to No.
1. His job now is to find the writers and producers who will create
family-friendly PAX shows that viewers fall in love with.
</P>
<P>
   And do it at Paxson's ``stupid speed'' _ which means building
from the current 20 original hours to more than 100 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Sagansky is moving quickly. Projects are blessed _ by Sagansky,
Paxson and William Scott (programming president) _ without
expensive pilots. A single script can earn an order for 13 episodes
of a show _ rare at other networks.
</P>
<P>
   And what is PAX TV paying people to create new shows? One
veteran TV producer says, ``They're in the ballpark, but barely.''
</P>
<P>
   At CBS, Sagansky green-lighted shows such as Dr. Quinn and
Touched by an Angel. But at PAX TV, the Ivy League-educated exec
doesn't have a CBS-sized budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not paying network money,'' he says. ``I've worked at a
studio, I've worked at a network, and these networks and studios
spend way more than they have to, way more.''
</P>
<P>
   Sagansky wants network-quality shows for far less than network
money. A typical network one-hour drama costs $1 million per
episode to make. If it becomes a hit, the price goes up
dramatically. Della Reese recently had a salary snit at CBS and
will earn $100,000 per episode for Touched by an Angel. Her
co-star, Roma Downey, gets more per show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who are into the studio system, they only know how
to do things within that system,'' says Sagansky. ``They aren't
calling because our whole economics are different.''
</P>
<P>
   So, where does he find talent willing to work cheap for a
brand-new network? Other than waiting in the Betty Ford Clinic
parking lot for people who used to have careers, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Sagansky laughs.
</P>
<P>
   PAX TV's potential writers, producers and actors are ``people
who have a real passion for the show and really know producing and
know this material can be done for a little less money, and just as
well. Those are the calls I'm getting, those are the calls I want.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're out there. You have to look hard. Already I think I
have three or four people who want to work in the genres we're
talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those could be Bruce Nash. The TV producer, a former Palm
Beach Gardens resident, is talking to Sagansky about doing a
series.
</P>
<P>
   And Nash isn't near the downside of a career. This fall he'll
produce a special, This Is Your Life for CBS, Magic's Biggest
Secrets for Fox, two reality shows for ABC and Secrets of Pro
Wrestling Exposed for NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do a lot of shows that are darker, edgy, controversial,
eerie, whatever they are,'' Nash says. ``Where do I sell great
stories where we can see people in a positive light? I need that
for myself creatively.''
</P>
<P>
   Sagansky is committed to PAX TV with a four-year contract. He's
living at a Palm Beach hotel. His wife, Christy Welker, who has
family in Fort Lauderdale, is on the way from Los Angeles with
their daughters, Summer, 4, and Gillian, 9.
</P>
<P>
   Sagansky shares Paxson's passion. ``The timing for this is
perfect,'' he begins. ``Just look across the board at 8, 9 o'clock,
there are so few family offerings. I'll tell you, frankly, I am
shocked at what goes on at 8 o'clock. It's all sexual titillation
and a huge amount of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever watch Cops on Fox or The World's Scariest Police
Chases?''
</P>
<P>
   Ready, set, go!
</P>
<P>
   If, starting at noon Monday, PAX TV stalls and eventually goes
bust, Bud Paxson will be down to his last few million, his faith
and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Daughter Nicole, 15, goes to the Alexander W. Dreyfoos Jr.
School of the Arts. Another daughter, Julie, lives in Cleveland.
(Her dad guards her age. ``She'd kill me if I told.'') His son,
Devin, 33, owns seven TV stations and lives on Palm Beach. Devin's
sons, Austin, 3, and Dakota, 9 months, are Paxson's only
grandchildren. Paxson's son Todd, 36, raises dogs and horses in
Loxahatchee.
</P>
<P>
   If PAX TV sinks, Paxson's third wife, Marla, may not get to host
her show, Celebrities &AMP; Charities, scheduled for spring.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he has any aspirations to do his own show, Paxson
scoffs. ``No, never. You do what you do best. I do one thing best,
build companies. Do the impossible. I'm Don Quixote. Let's go.
Dream the impossible dream.''
</P>
<P>
   PAX TV go bust? Paxson delights in skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   ``To all the naysayers _ I've been in the kitchen preparing
crow. Get ready for a feast.''

 &HT;    Foundation seeks to aid Latinas in public service
 &HT;    By Suzanne Gamboa
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Whether their public office experiences ended amid
embarrassment, scandal or defeat, Lena Guerrero, Nora Linares and
Christine Hernandez gained one important thing from their
government careers: experience.
</P>
<P>
   And it's that experience that the three former Texas public
officials said they can pass on to other Latinas looking to enter
the world of public leadership in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Along with other Texas Latinas, the three are forming the Latina
Foundation, an organization they hope will help teach young,
ambitious Hispanic women interested in public service what they
need to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience that Nora and I had, as difficult as it seemed
to be, we hope to teach others what we've learned,'' said Guerrero,
whose campaign for Railroad Commission and political career ended
amid revelations that she had lied about her educational
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero, who also was an Austin representative in the Texas
House, was a panelist at the Region 5 conference of the National
Association of Hispanic Journalists. The conference drew
journalists from across Texas under the theme of ``Countdown to the
Millennium: The Latino Legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the audience for the panel that included Guerrero was
Linares, former director of the Texas Lottery Commission, and state
Rep. Hernandez, a San Antonio Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Linares was fired in 1997 after confirming that her close friend
had worked as a consultant for lottery operator Gtech. She has
since reached a legal settlement with Gtech over her dismissal.
Hernandez lost an expensive campaign to replace U.S. Rep. Henry B.
Gonzalez in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we go out and speak to people, they say, `How did you get
involved? How did you get into politics?' '' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost a campaign for which she raised $300,000, Hernandez
said she can teach other Latinas not only how to wage a campaign,
but also how to raise money for a campaign. Lack of money, she
said, intimidates many Latina women and keeps them from running for
elective office.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Latina Foundation was informally organized in 1997,
Guerrero said the group of Latinas _ ``a handful of us'' _ is
trying to obtain nonprofit status. The lessons members can pass on
range from the practical _ ``don't wear orange; you don't look good
in it'' _ to the professional _ ``when you want public apologies,
call me, because I can write them,'' Guerrero said in a blend of
English and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said many Latinas will begin their careers as a school
board member, a county commissioner or a local court judge. But as
a neophyte politician, a Latina may not have handled something like
a bond issue. Hernandez said the Latina Foundation hopes to provide
practical advice for such day-to-day issues.
</P>
<P>
   And being the center of controversy also has its lessons,
Linares said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned something, and we want to teach others what we
learned,'' she said of herself and Guerrero. ``There are issues
that happen around you that we don't have any control over.''

 &HT;    UT stadium gets all decked out
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When the Texas Longhorns meet the New Mexico
State Aggies on the field, the average Texas fan will encounter a
bigger, prettier stadium that athletics officials swear on their
playbooks will be ready.
</P>
<P>
   Three shifts of construction crews have been working around the
clock for the past three months to finish a massive renovation of
Royal-Memorial Stadium's east side, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It is down to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Friday, power saws, scaffolding, lumber, paint, drop
cloths, insulation, forklifts and all manner of construction tools
were strewn from the ground level to all five upper levels, with
crews creating a cacophonous roar. It will all be gone by kickoff,
said George Abikhaled, senior project manager of the University of
Texas System Office of Facilities Planning and Construction.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, athletics officials are so sure the public areas of the
stadium will be ready, they are planning to show off the east side
at an open house from 5 to 7 p.m. Thursday. Those who want a peek
at the public areas _ no club areas or skyboxes _ should come to
the east-side entrances off East Campus Drive, which recently
reopened to traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having this open house because it's so different-looking
we're afraid people will be confused when they come here on game
day,'' said Chris Plonsky, associate athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   The formerly grungy east side will become the ``sexiest side of
the stadium,'' Plonsky predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The east side was decrepit. It was horrible,'' she said. ``I
wouldn't go to the women's restroom over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the dark, dank interior concourse has been transformed into
a bright, airy space that's been expanded outward toward the field.
It boasts three times as many women's restrooms; new concession
stands; 50 skyboxes, or luxury suites; two new clubs for the
well-heeled; and a new 5,535-seat upper deck, expanding the
stadium's capacity to 79,438 seats.
</P>
<P>
   A similarly overhauled west side, with 14 luxury suites, a
festival-style mezzanine and novelty stands, made its debut last
season.
</P>
<P>
   What the average fan won't notice next Saturday are two stadium
projects that won't quite be ready: a club open to 1,262 donors who
will sit in new chair-back seats on the east side and certain
improvements to the Moncrief-Neuhaus Athletic Complex, which abuts
the stadium on the south side. Both are scheduled to be completed
by the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the club, which has been named the University of Texas
Club, will be open for the first game to the 700 donors who have
purchased seats so far. Because the kitchen isn't done, food will
be brought in by the operator, Club Corporation of America. CCA is
also catering the luxury suites.
</P>
<P>
   A contract is being finalized for the club, which will remain
open year-round for faculty, staff and alumni to dine in and
entertain guests. The club, along with the massive spending on
renovations and other athletics projects in the past two years, now
totaling $94.9 million, has fueled faculty concerns that the
university overemphasizes sports.
</P>
<P>
   Plonsky stressed Friday on a tour of the stadium that no tax
dollars are being used for the projects.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the east-side upper deck, she pointed to the roof of
the Moncrief-Neuhaus Athletic Complex, in the south end zone, where
the End Zone Club is returning this year. Another party spot for
donors, the club will be visible to fans in the stadium. It will be
open next Saturday, but the second floor of the athletic complex
won't. That floor houses coaches' offices and the Champions' Room,
a sort of Longhorn hall of fame featuring trophies, memorabilia and
a replica of former Coach Darrell Royal's office. Officials expect
it to be open to the public by the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   The athletic complex project got behind when Diamond
Construction went bankrupt and another contractor, Silverton
Construction Co. Inc., had to take over, Abikhaled said.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the east side, fans will see a new banner scoreboard on
the upper deck, Big 12 Conference school flags across the top and
towers at either end.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the west side, where the outer facade is concrete gray,
the east side is pale orange and cream brick, similar to campus
academic buildings.
</P>
<P>
   All 14 skyboxes on the west side have been leased, but 20 of 50
remain on the east side, ranging in cost from $50,000 to $60,000 a
year. Athletics officials had predicted that all would be gone by
the season's start. Since they won't be, some suites will be leased
on a game-by-game basis at a cost of $8,000 for a regular game to
$12,000 for the Texas A&AMP;M game Nov. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Two suites have been converted to the Touchdown Club, which has
36 seats being sold to season ticket holders by the pair at $7,000
for both. The buyers get free food and beverage service. So far, 12
seats have been sold, Plonsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still going to close on four or five more suites next
week, I think,'' Plonsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Some students, meanwhile, are unhappy to be losing 1,800 seats
near the field. They'll be moved to the upper deck.
</P>
<P>
   There will be 2,800 seats for students in the new upper deck, a
net gain of 1,000 seats, said Mark Harrison, athletics ticket
manager.
</P>
<P>
   But Luke Mislinski, 21, a senior chemical engineering major,
said he hated to see the students moved. He liked being close to
the band and the players. The students make a lot of noise, which
is ``demoralizing to the visiting team,'' he said. ``I hate for us
to lose that.''
</P>

stadium, and while you're there, tell us what you think about the
renovations.

 &HT;    What Diana did for charity
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Diana's enormous impact on charity during her 16 years as
princess of Wales is undisputed. But, even a year after her death,
she continues to influence charitable giving.
</P>
<P>
   Her legacy reverberates in the $114 million raised by her
memorial fund. In her example of hands-on volunteerism still
broadcast around the world. And in the increased focus her efforts
continue to bring to such causes as land-mine victims, cancer and
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to say that someone's death was timely,'' says David
Walker, executive director of Hope House, Palm Beach County's
largest residential provider for AIDS patients. ``But it occurred
just as we were establishing a program for children who have AIDS
and those who'll be orphaned because of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the heightened attention brought to Diana after her
death, there was also heightened attention brought to the things
she cared most about,'' he says. ``While we haven't experienced any
increase in funding, there has most certainly been an increase in
awareness.''
</P>
<P>
   Local agencies _ such as the American Cancer Society, American
Heart Association and American Red Cross chapters based in West
Palm Beach _ report no surge in donations directly linked to Diana,
but on the national level, charitable giving has risen
substantially, according to the American Association of
Fund-Raising Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Americans contributed $143 billion to charity last year _ up 7.5
percent from the $ 133 billion given in 1996. Even adjusted for
inflation, donations rose 5.1 percent in 1997, making it the
greatest increase since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Research director Ann Kaplan attributes that boost not only to
Diana's death _ which thrust her charitable works into the
spotlight _ but also to the death of Mother Teresa Sept. 5 and
attention given to huge individual donations, such as media mogul
Ted Turner's $1 billion pledge to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Langan, spokesman for the National Charities Information
Bureau, says generosity extended beyond Great Britain after the
Aug. 31 car crash that killed the princess.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to the incredible amounts of money being sent to
her foundation, there were an awful lot of people giving to
American charities,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But regardless of where the money went, it's safe to say she
had a remarkable impact, and it's still very much going on.''
</P>
<P>
   From the moment the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund was
established just days after her death, donations poured in and
continue to do so at a rate of $113,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   But there also has been controversy.
</P>
<P>
   First, the fund's legal team was found to have charged $800,000
for a few weeks' work. (The bill was later cut by 20 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Then, the fund allowed a food company that was sponsoring the
London Marathon to emblazon Diana's signature _ in the royal color
purple _ on tubs of Flora margarine. British commentators and the
princess' brother, Earl Spencer, were horrified.
</P>
<P>
   Companies must make a hefty donation to the fund to be
sanctioned, and more than 200 a week apply, but fund trustees have
been conservative since the margarine fiasco. They've licensed only
seven items: a Beanie Baby bear, a crystal candle holder, scented
candles, a tribute CD, a set of postage stamps, a set of enamel
boxes and a photograph of flowers piled outside Kensington Palace
by mourners.
</P>
<P>
   The tribute CD has raised nearly $23 million, and the postage
stamps $14.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest money-raiser so far, however, has been Elton John's
recording of ``Candle in the Wind 1997,'' which has raked in more
than $30 million. John's CD isn't licensed, but all proceeds are
directed to the memorial fund.
</P>
<P>
   (The 500 British charities that raise the most in private
donations, meanwhile, earned $7.2 billion last year _ an 11 percent
increase over 1996, according to ``The Chronicle of Philanthropy.''
Many attribute that gain, at least in part, to the emphasis given
charities after Diana's death.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite its role in memorializing Diana, the fund isn't linked
to any events marking the one-year anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first place, this is out of respect for the family,''
spokeswoman Jo Greenstead told Reuters news service. ``And, as it
says in the mission statement, the fund doesn't want to stimulate
the emotions that surround the memory of the princess.''
</P>
<P>
   The memory of the princess is best sustained, perhaps, by things
like the international treaty banning land mines, recently ratified
by the British parliament. And by the $3.25 million _ raised by the
sale of her dresses two months before the crash _ now being used by
AIDS and cancer charities worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, Princess Diana is the gift that keeps on
giving,'' says Stephen Lee, director of Britain's Institute of
Charity Fund-Raising Managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her overall effect on charity is probably more significant
than any other person's in the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Staff researchers Lynne Palombo and Barbara Gellis Shapiro
contributed to this report.

 &HT;    A whole new world for first time cruisers
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby

<TEXT>
<P>
   NASSAU, Bahamas _ The white-jacketed Austrian waiter brought out
china trays, and with a grand flourish set them down on the table
amid stemmed crystal and English china.
</P>
<P>
   On each tray was a gourmet feast of five appetizers including
smoked salmon rosettes with capers, duck and vegetable spring
rolls, and wild mushroom bisque.
</P>
<P>
   The two women from Illinois took one look at it and screeched in
unison: ``Oooooh, gross!''
</P>
<P>
   Other adults, and their numerous children, at surrounding tables
also were not interested in this weird food.
</P>
<P>
   This scenario _ sophisticated amenities and passengers mystified
by them _ was repeated throughout my recent three-day cruise on
Disney Cruise Line's gorgeous new Disney Magic mega-cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   My traveling companion also was grossed out by the menu. She
skipped the escargot and went straight for the pizza. She was my
8-year-old niece, Ruby Hernandez, who I borrowed from my sister in
order to get a kid's viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian waiter, who had come to the ship from the Queen
Elizabeth 2, complimented one guest on her dress and bent down and
kissed her hand. The woman jerked her hand back and she and her
husband, who was wearing a tank top and shorts, exchanged looks
that said, ``Gross!''
</P>
<P>
   A guest on the QE2 probably would have been pleased by the
waiter's attentiveness _ indeed, would have expected it.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of the Magic's passengers were first-time
cruisers who were taking the ship as part of a seven-day package.
They spend three or four days at Disney World and three or four
days on the Magic, which cruises out of Port Canaveral and goes to
Nassau and Disney's island, Castaway Cay, in the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Most passengers had children in tow, except for 350 honeymoon
couples (a natural extension of Disney World's wedding pavilion).
And the crew was extremely kid-friendly. Waiters, room stewards and
even maintenance workers made a point of greeting children along
with adults and would bend down to their level to talk to them.
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian waiter automatically wiped pizza sauce off Ruby's
face as he chatted with her, and he asked each child at our table
what they did that day.
</P>
<P>
   But this ship does not have the ambience of a theme park and
Minnie and Mickey are not omnipresent. In fact, you have to check
the schedule for the times of their appearances around the ship.
</P>
<P>
   The $350 million Magic, which debuted July 30, is as elegant as
any ship afloat and has service equal to those that cost twice as
much.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the high-rise Marriott-sized atriums and flashy neon
lights of many new mega-ships, the Magic has a majestic three-story
atrium-lobby with two graceful curved staircases, and subdued
lighting that would befit an elegant inn. Artwork, particularly
drawings from Disney cartoons in the 1930s and '40s, lines
wood-paneled walls.
</P>
<P>
   Our room had beveled glass over a desk, sleek wood furniture,
and art including a sketch from Pirates of the Caribbean in 1965
and a black and white portrait of Mr. and Mrs. Walt Disney taken on
the deck of a ship in 1934. Our balcony had a cushioned bench, a
great nook for reading a book, a chair and weather instruments
including a compass and barometer.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the passengers on my cruise didn't appreciate the
magic of The Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers complained about the size of the cabins, calling them
closets. They didn't realize that the Magic's cabins, most with
sofas, queen-sized beds, desks _ and almost half with balconies _
are 25 percent larger than the industry average.
</P>
<P>
   And unprecedented on ships _ many rooms have two bathrooms, one
with a toilet and vanity, the other with a bathtub and vanity.
</P>
<P>
   They complained about the rubbery theme park hamburgers and
dried pizza offered at bars on the swimming pool deck. They might
not have been informed judges of the herb-crusted baked salmon with
Zinfandel glaze, but they knew a mediocre hamburger when they saw
it.
</P>
<P>
   But if the marble floors, chandeliers, sleek black terrazzo
floors and Art Deco columns in the French restaurant were lost on
them, they appreciated other things:
</P>
<P>
   The Disney camp, called the Oceaneer Club, covers almost an
entire deck and includes a computer and science room for older
children, and costume room and theater for small children. The camp
keeps children entertained from 8 a.m. to 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby loved the camp, and I had a hard time tearing her away from
it. On the second night, I picked her up at midnight and she
implored me to stay until it closed at 1 a.m. I relented _ how
could I resist with ``Never had a friend like me'' from Aladdin
playing in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most camps on other ships, the Disney club also takes
children to dinner. Parents could take their children on this
cruise and never see them except at bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   When parents or guardians register their kids, they are given
beepers to keep for the entire cruise so the club is in constant
contact with the parent. If the child is ready to leave, they
message the parent.
</P>
<P>
   Teens have a coffee house just for them, and children have a
pool with a slide and a lifeguard.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney Theater, which presented three original plays. There
were stellar performances by actors from Broadway and the English
theater. And even small children were enthralled by the sound
effects and Disney songs and characters.
</P>
<P>
   Castaway Cay, Disney's 1,000-acre island in the Bahamas that has
a dock for the ship, white sand beaches including a mile-long beach
just for adults with massage cabanas, and trails for hiking and
biking.
</P>
<P>
   A day and most of a night in Nassau for gamblers who missed
having a casino on board.
</P>
<P>
   This ship differs from other ships in many ways. There is no
captain's party, no officers mingling with passengers, no tours of
the bridge. The only captain sighting was when he gave a toast at
the huge French restaurant, and left soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   One experienced cruiser and travel agent from Oregon observed
that the ship was run like a hotel, not a ship. She called the
Magic a ``trainer ship'' for those who have never taken a cruise.
</P>
<P>
   There is no casino, no Las Vegas-type shows with dancers in
thongs and elaborate headdresses, and no R-rated comic acts, even
at Disney's comedy theater and three bars just for passengers 18
and over. There were no four-letter words at the comedy
improvisation act I saw. The most risque joke: ``Marv Albert asked
me if I wanted to go out for a bite.''
</P>
<P>
   The Magic also didn't have a cruise director, the comedian/host
who serves as the laugh track for a ship, cracking jokes at
lectures and bingo and serving as master of ceremonies at shows.
</P>
<P>
   At the port lecture and at bingo, pleasant, and bland, young
women served as hosts.
</P>
<P>
   The general atmosphere of the ship was sedate, a far cry from
the rowdiness of Carnival ships.
</P>
<P>
   Another invention: Passengers play musical chairs at dinner,
changing restaurants each night, and taking their waiters with
them. On arrival, passengers receive tickets telling them the time
and which restaurant and which table they have each night.
</P>
<P>
   It's a strange mix on the Disney Magic _ a ship so
sophisticated, it recalls the ocean liners from another era. But
experienced passengers would be appalled by the tank tops at
dinner, and all the children.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there is a restaurant, pool and three bars for
adults only, there is no getting away from Disney and kids. On what
other ship would announcements begin, ``Ladies and gentlemen, boys
and girls. ''
</P>
<P>
   If passengers weren't passionate about Disney, they would
quickly tire of listening to Disney tunes. They would soon be
humming ``It's a whole new world ... '' whether they liked it or
not.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if passengers are bringing children and/or
they are extremely pure of heart and love Disney, the Magic is the
ship for them.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic is, indeed, a whole new world.
</P>
<P>
   Island is all Disney, all fun _ all business
</P>
<P>
   CASTAWAY CAY, Bahamas _ Disney Cruise Line's Disney Magic docked
at this tiny Disney-owned island just after the sun came up.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning at 8:30 a.m., about 2,000 adults and children started
walking off the gangways loaded down with masks, fins and suntan
lotion, and boarded a Disney-style tram bound for the beach.
</P>
<P>
   A band played Jimmy Buffett songs and pretty soon the long white
stretch of sand was as busy as Disney World's Blizzard Beach on a
summer afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of kids went to the Oceaneer Club's camp for arts, crafts,
storytelling and games.
</P>
<P>
   Their parents, and the adults without kids, boarded the tram
again and went to the quiet mile-long adults-only beach. They
pulled lounge chairs into the shallow water, and drank beer, eyes
closed against the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby were open-air cabanas, where they could get massages, and
a beach-side cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Other Magic passengers rented bikes and rode the miles of paths
shaded by towering pines.
</P>
<P>
   And back at the main beach, there were kayaks, sailboats, paddle
boats and rafts.
</P>
<P>
   Barbecue was available at a covered pavilion with picnic tables
that offered views of coconut palms and the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,000-acre island, formerly Gorda Cay, is in the Abacos. No
one lives on the island anymore except for 70 Disney employees, who
live here in six-month shifts.
</P>
<P>
   But when the ship is in, the island comes to life.

 &HT;    Canine cloning more byte than bark
 &HT;    Has sidebar: DOG-WEBSITE
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eleven years ago, Missy was a cast-off, a mixed-breed stray
taken home from the pound only after a long night of second
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   She turned out to be one charming dog.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of life without her, even through it's probably a
few years down the road, prompted her owners to donate $2.3 million
to Texas A&AMP;M researchers to try cloning their precious pet.
</P>
<P>
   The owners are a mystery, described only as rich dog lovers. But
Missy's life is an open Web page (http://www.missyplicity.com), her
allure explained in part by pictures and anecdotes with titles
like, ``How Missy Found A Home.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Missy-laneous revelations:
</P>
<P>
   _ She wasn't her owners' first love. She was taken in as a
companion for Liebe, a shepherd-coyote mix who was 15 and ailing.
Missy, about 4 months old and frisky, recognized Liebe's frailty
and became her faithful protector.
</P>
<P>
   _ Missy earned her owners' ``permanent love'' on a stormy night
when she led a search to rescue Liebe, who was tangled in thick
brush and branches.
</P>
<P>
   _ Missy's beauty draws constant compliments from people who want
a dog like her, but her background is a mystery. The owners
describe her as ``the dog equivalent of a Rorschach test: People
see the breed or blend they want to see.'' The best guess is part
collie, part husky.
</P>
<P>
   _ Missy loves to howl with the coyotes and chase cats. But if a
cat stops and hisses, Missy stops and lies down.
</P>
<P>
   Although the first news reports of the cloning appeared this
week, Missy's Web site has been drawing attention for months.
Messages posted from around the world show strong feelings for and
against the attempt, which is considered far more complicated than
the Scottish sheep experiment that created Dolly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why clone a dog when you can just as well go out and buy
one?'' asked one message. The reply from the project's coordinator:
``True, our client could go buy another dog. But he's never met a
dog like Missy.''
</P>
<P>
   Conventional breeding is ruled out because Missy's been fixed.
Even if she hadn't been, cloning is the only way to duplicate her
mixed-breed genetic traits.
</P>
<P>
   That means any clone will look like Missy, but personality is
less certain: There's no guarantee any animal clone would be as
lovable as the original.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't discouraged inquiries from numerous pet owners,
including one who wrote: ``About a year ago, even before Dolly was
heard from, I dreamed the idea of cloning our cat, Walter.''
</P>
<P>
   While cat cloning is not in the research group's plans, success
with Missy could lead to commercially available dog cloning costing
thousands rather than millions, the researchers suggest. But the
first Missy pups, if there are any, are probably two years away.
</P>
<P>
   It's already too late for one Italian dog lover, who asked the
Missy team to advise colleagues in her country on how to begin
duplicating her pet. The initial reply was cautious but encouraged
further correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   Her second message included one detail that dashed all hope: The
dog was buried three months ago. Until tissue-preservation
techniques are perfected, only owners of live pets need apply.

 &HT;    Sidebar to DOG-CLONE
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Missy may make history as the first dog cloned, but she's too
late to be first with a page on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever impels people to think everyone will be fascinated by
their musical taste or reading habits also leads to sites like
``TRAMP Our Barking Cocker!'' (http://4peaks.com/ftramp.htm).
</P>
<P>
   Many pets get prominent positions on owners' Web pages, which
have grown increasingly common as they've become easier to make and
dirt cheap or even free to post.
</P>
<P>
   There are also plenty of sites dedicated to specific breeds,
such as Scottish terriers (http://w3.ag.uiuc.edu/VJR/Scottie.html)
and a profusion of commercial and advice sites like, ``The Dog
Owner's Guide'' (http://www.canismajor.com/dog/guide.html) and Dog
World Magazine (http://www.dogworld mag.com).
</P>
<P>
   Of all the dog-related sites on the Web, the most unusual may be
the Virtual Pet Cemetery (http://www.lavamind.com/pet.html). It's
an ``online burial ground'' where loving tributes allow Misty the
brown mutt and many others to byte long after their last bark.

 &HT;    Storms in 'the box' can delay home sales, insurance
 &HT;    By Paul Owers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The coast is clear now, but would-be home buyers and sellers
should watch the Atlantic for storms that could abruptly stop
residential real estate deals.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Bonnie postponed some closings in Palm Beach County
and the Treasure Coast earlier this week when it entered ``the
box.'' When a tropical storm or hurricane blows into the box _
stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Dominican Republic and
from North Carolina to Honduras _ the two state-created insurers of
last resort won't issue policies.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Residential Property &AMP; Casualty Joint Underwriting
Association, which provides basic homeowner insurance, and the
Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association, which insures against
wind damage only, stopped writing policies Monday, after Bonnie
crossed into the box over the weekend. The insurers resumed issuing
policies Thursday, after the storm moved out.
</P>
<P>
   But Hurricane Danielle or subsequent storms could enter the box
before hurricane season ends Nov. 30 _ meaning the insurance window
would slam shut again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's foolish to wait to get coverage,'' Jay Newman, executive
director of the JUA, said Friday. ``We estimate that if Danielle
follows the same track as Bonnie, it'll be in the box Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   As the six-month hurricane season enters its busiest period,
real estate agents have been scrambling to help their clients get
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Some home buyers planned ahead, buying coverage before their
closings, but others waited until Bonnie was breathing down on the
Southeast, said Mickey Bradley, president of the St. Lucie
Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had problems with some closings,'' he said. ``It can be a
huge inconvenience for a seller who has a moving truck in his
driveway.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the windstorm pool is not writing policies, home
buyers still should have their agents fax insurance information to
the agency's headquarters in Jacksonville and send checks and
photos of houses, spokesman Alan Cook said. The pool will make the
coverage effective as soon as it resumes writing policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be careful and get your ducks in a row,'' said
John Pinson, managing broker at Prudential Florida Realty in Palm
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Most private insurers, such as State Farm, don't use the box,
instead choosing to stop writing policies only when a particular
county is under a watch or warning for a tropical storm or
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the box is too restrictive,'' said Tom Hagerty,
spokesman for State Farm. ``Under that box, a Realtor in
Tallahassee wouldn't be able to issue a policy even though there's
no imminent threat of a hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   The windstorm pool and the JUA insure homeowners who are unable
to buy coverage on the private market.
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach County, the windstorm pool, created in 1970,
covers ho
</P>
<P>
   Private insurers not affected by 'box'
</P>
<P>
   mes east of Interstate 95 from PGA Boulevard south to the
Broward County line and east of Alternate A1A from PGA north to the
Martin County line. In St. Lucie County, it covers homes within
1,000 feet of the coast. The windstorm pool does not insure homes
in Martin County.
</P>
<P>
   The JUA, established after Hurricane Andrew in August 1992, grew
to 937,000 polices in the fall of 1996. Officials have since
transferred 700,000 policies to private insurers. It now has more
than 42,000 policies in Palm Beach, Martin and St. Lucie counties.
</P>
<P>
   State law bars the JUA from offering wind coverage in windstorm
pool areas.
</P>
<P>
   If a home in the windstorm pool area can't get coverage anywhere
else, it must buy wind coverage from the pool and basic homeowner
coverage from the JUA.

 &HT;    `Our room was a kid's heaven'
 &HT;    By Ruby Hernandez
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Disney Magic was docked at Cape Canaveral. I was the first
one to see it! We were driving on a bridge over the Banana River in
Cape Canaveral.
</P>
<P>
   I screamed, ``Tia, Tia (that's my aunt)! I think I see the
ship!''
</P>
<P>
   It was so big! It had a black hull and two red smokestacks with
Mickey Mouse ears.
</P>
<P>
   In the terminal, I saw Mickey, Minnie and Goofy. Minnie had on
white high heels with little anchors on the toes. She was so cool.
</P>
<P>
   Our room was a kid's heaven. It had a big bed. On the wall, it
said, ``A dream is a wish your heart makes,'' a song from
Cinderella, which goes dah dah dah-dah-dah ...
</P>
<P>
   I ran into the room and jumped from the sofa to the coffee table
to the bed.
</P>
<P>
   Tia (that's Spanish for aunt) said, ``Ruby, you can't break your
leg on the first day! Maybe on the third day but not the first!''
</P>
<P>
   Our room had a balcony, where the wind blows in your hair when
the boat is moving.
</P>
<P>
   I could watch Disney cartoons on two channels on the TV. I
watched Hercules cartoons at 6:30 the first morning, and Tia woke
up and said, ``Turn off the TVVVVVVVV!'' (But I didn't, I just
turned it down.)
</P>
<P>
   The toilets on ships are really loud. When you flush it, it
sounds like an airplane taking off. I flushed the toilet and ran
out of the bathroom holding my ears.
</P>
<P>
   When we left our room, Rebecca, our room hostess, fixed up our
room so well we couldn't find things! She put my sandals way under
the table and my lotion in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   She had short black hair and was from India and wore a striped
uniform. We told her our room was so clean we couldn't find
anything, and she got upset and asked what we couldn't find and
wanted to come in our room to find it. We said, ``Rebecca, we're
joking!''
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca turned down the covers for us every night and put my
Beanie Babies on the pillow, and she left cards on my pillow. One
said, ``There's a voice that's true right inside of you, follow
your heart ... '' She did that so we would have good dreams, I
guess.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of kids on the ship and great kids' counselors.
The waiters are fun and they bring you crayons and games at dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The ship has a camp called the Oceaneer Club. A camp is very
important to a kid. The 9- to 10-year-olds and 11- to 12-year-olds
get to go to the lab, which has music, computers, Legos and a place
to make jewelry. The 3- to 5-year-olds and 6- to 8-year-olds stay
at the main club room, which has a playroom with slide and dress-up
costumes.
</P>
<P>
   One night the Oceaneer Club had a sleuth game and we split into
teams and tried to solve a mysterious password. We ran all over the
fourth deck collecting clues. Our team won and the password turned
out to be Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
</P>
<P>
   I've been to camp on Carnival Cruise Lines, and the Disney Magic
is much better. The area for kids is a lot bigger, and Carnival's
camp was boring for kids older than 6. It's for little kids.
</P>
<P>
   On the Disney Magic, we ate at 8:30 at night. That's usually my
bedtime but I got to stay up.
</P>
<P>
   There are plays every single night. I saw three. I loved the
costumes, dancing and the actors were awesome.
</P>
<P>
   The ship has three restaurants and they have a kids' menu with
pizza, chicken nuggets (better than McDonald's) and peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   There are three pools on the ship. The kids pool had a long,
curving, really fast slide. Another pool was about 4 feet deep. It
was my favorite because Pinocchio's Pizzeria was close by.
</P>
<P>
   You can also swim in the ocean on Castaway Cay, Disney's own
island. There were kayaks and fun games. There is also a skeleton
of a whale at MonstroPoint!
</P>
<P>
   Nassau is the capital city of the Bahamas. We docked there for a
whole day. Tia and I went to the straw market to shop for a
birthday present for my friend Lindsay and a present for my little
brother Eli.
</P>
<P>
   The straw market has jewelry, straw hats and bags, T-shirts,
caps and lots of people.
</P>
<P>
   I got my hair braided in Nassau, and it was two hours of pure
agony! But I love my braids and beads!
</P>
<P>
   We went to the Ardastra Gardens and Zoo, which is one of my
favorite places to go in Nassau. There are monkeys, two jaguars
from Mexico, owls and parrots. Some of them are recovering from
injuries in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   The best part is the flamingos, the Bahamas' national bird. They
actually put on a show and march like soldiers. I got to walk with
them. They're almost as tall as I am! It takes two years to train
them. And the older ones help train the young ones.
</P>
<P>
   Next, we went to Fort Charlotte. At the fort are old rusted
cannons used to keep pirates away. There are also dungeons, where
they could stretch people who were captured.
</P>
<P>
   Our guide at the fort has a daughter named Lashon Brown, who
sounds just like me. Her dad says she loves to read and write and
she has a 4-year-old sister. I'm going to be her pen pal. Maybe my
4-year-old brother can be her sister's pen pal when they learn to
write!
</P>
<P>
   Then we went back to the ship in time for the show at the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   There is just one problem with the Disney Magic _ you are just
getting settled in by the third day. That's why I suggest a
four-day or seven-day cruise!

 &HT;    Rexall to close vitamin production plant in Idaho
 &HT;    By Phil Galewitz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Rexall Sundown Inc. plans to close an Idaho
vitamin manufacturing plant and will shift production to its Boca
Raton and Deerfield Beach facilities.
</P>
<P>
   About 12 to 18 of the Idaho plant's 110 employees are interested
in transferring to South Florida and have been offered jobs, Rexall
President Damon DeSantis said recently. The rest decided not to
apply and will be laid off, DeSantis said.
</P>
<P>
   The 62,000-square-foot plant in Meridian, Idaho, was owned by
Richardson Labs, a vitamin and diet products maker that Rexall
bought in January for $98 million in stock. Richardson's main
product is the diet supplement Ultra Chroma Slim.
</P>
<P>
   Rexall said it expects to hire about six more employees, in
addition to those who transfer from Idaho, to handle the increased
local production. Boca Raton-based Rexall employs about 1,300
people at its Boca Raton and Deerfield facilities.
</P>
<P>
   DeSantis said it makes sense to consolidate operations to save
money. But when the deal was made, Rexall (Nasdaq: RXSD, $21) and
Richardson officials said the Idaho plant would remain open.

 &HT;    Growers see science as ally in sour reply to `Sugar Busters!'
 &HT;    By Michael Utley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sugar is under attack.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not the environmentalists this time. It's not the
free-trade crowd. And it's not the South Florida Water Management
District or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   The new foe is a best-selling diet book called Sugar Busters!
It's raising anew all those nagging questions about the health
effects of sugar _ one of Florida's most lucrative agricultural
products.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar Busters! (Ballantine Books, $22) is a wildly popular tome
that says a low-sugar diet will result in weight loss, reduced
cholesterol, increased energy and ``optimal wellness.'' The
270-page book follows in a long line of previous anti-sugar
literature, and, like its predecessors, it thrives on many of the
old beliefs about the evils of sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows sugar makes you fat, right? Everyone knows it
contributes to diabetes, heart disease, premature aging and a host
of other nasty medical conditions _ not to mention that it makes
your kids bounce off the walls. Right? Page 3 of Sugar Busters!
boldly states, ``Sugar is toxic!''
</P>
<P>
   Some of these claims have become so ingrained in the American
psyche that you can barely hear the faint pleas of the sugar
industry: ``It's not true! It's not true!''
</P>
<P>
   Unfairly indicted repeatedly
</P>
<P>
   While you'd expect the industry to protest, there is a growing
consensus in the scientific community that sugar has been convicted
unfairly again and again over the years _ with Sugar Busters! being
the most recent indictment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sugar is always going to have a bad rap, because it's a sexy
topic and people like to talk about how harmful it is,'' said Roger
B. McDonald, a nutritionist at the University of California, Davis,
who has studied the health effects of sugar. ``But the fact is,
sugar is no better or no worse than any other food. Everything is
toxic if you eat too much of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sugar does not cause diabetes _ ``that claim has been dead for
over 40 years,'' McDonald said. And most scientists believe sugar
does not cause obesity _ except for the fact that people who eat
too much of it tend to eat too much of everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there are no direct links between sugar and heart disease,
premature aging, hyperactivity and many of the other ills that have
been attributed to the second-most-maligned commodity in history _
after tobacco, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The sugar industry in Palm Beach County and South Florida _
where a fourth of the nation's sugar supply is produced _ has been
slow to react to the negative publicity. For years, sugar farmers
took a defensive posture, commenting only when criticized, if they
commented at all. But that is changing.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, The Sugar Association trade group started
financing scientific research in recent years, and it has begun to
get the word out that sugar is not as bad as many people think.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like sound science to drive opinions,'' said Barbara
Miedema, a spokeswoman for the Belle Glade-based Sugar Cane Growers
Cooperative, a member of The Sugar Association. ``Facts need to
rule the day.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent association-sponsored study, released last year
by Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina, found that
``average, healthy people trying to lose weight do not necessarily
have to restrict their sugar intake, as long as they lower the
amount of fat and total number of calories they ingest daily.''
</P>
<P>
   By itself, one teaspoon of sugar contains just 16 calories.
</P>
<P>
   The Duke study backed up a mantra that members of the nation's
$21 billion sugar industry often repeat: ``Sugar doesn't make you
fat. Fat makes you fat.''
</P>
<P>
   The most well-known sugar study in recent years focused on
hyperactivity in children. In 1995, the Journal of the American
Medical Association published a comprehensive review of sugar
research and concluded that ``no effect of sugar on behavior or
cognitive performance in children has been proven.''
</P>
<P>
   Many parents immediately scoffed at the report, concluding that
its authors obviously had no children of their own. But many
researchers suggested that childhood hyperactivity is linked with
sugar mistakenly because children generally consume large amounts
of candy and sugar at parties or other festive occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The parties _ not the sugar _ make the kids excited, researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Government agencies concur
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, numerous government agencies have conducted their own
research and determined that sugar causes no adverse health
effects. Of course, those who consume sugar and don't take care of
their teeth will get cavities.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Health and Human Services Department, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration have
issued reports in recent years stating that sugar consumption does
not cause heart disease, diabetes, allergies, cancer, obesity or
other health problems.
</P>
<P>
   The government reports often rebutted anti-sugar studies of
other organizations, many of them outside the traditional
scientific research community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the attacks on sugar are basically coming from
wackos,'' said Judy Sanchez, a spokeswoman for Clewiston-based
United States Sugar Corp., the largest raw sugar producer in the
nation. ``The medical community is not attacking us.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, two recent reports out of the Netherlands and
Italy have linked sugar with certain types of cancer. Those studies
have never been replicated in the United States because, researches
here say, the results are not credible.
</P>
<P>
   But science hasn't stopped critics from targeting sugar, and the
attacks have taken their toll.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, U.S. sugar consumption fell dramatically as a health
craze gripped the nation and food manufacturers turned to other
sweeteners, such as corn syrup.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Americans consumed more than 11 million tons of sugar.
Just 12 months later, that figure dropped to 9.5 million tons, a 14
percent decline.
</P>
<P>
   Consumption continued to be weak throughout the 1980s, hitting a
low of 8.5 million tons in 1985. In the 1990s, small annual
increases in sugar consumption largely have been attributed to the
growth of the U.S. population. And consumption has not returned to
the pre-1982 levels.
</P>
<P>
   No research for book
</P>
<P>
   That's good news, according to the principal author of Sugar
Busters! _ 63-year-old H. Leighton Steward of New Orleans. He
readily admits that he, a businessman, and his three co-authors,
all medical doctors, but not nutritionists, did no independent
research to back up their conclusions. But he insists there is a
mountain of anecdotal evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are getting fatter and fatter and more diabetic
every year,'' Steward said in a recent interview from his vacation
home in Wyoming. ``And that's because our bodies were never
designed to handle all this sugar we've been consuming.''
</P>
<P>
   Steward readily dismisses the arguments of the sugar industry
and the scientific community. In his view, they are simply
``defensive'' reactions inspired by a ``threatened'' sector of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When their backs are up against the wall, just like President
Clinton, they can come up with some pretty shaky answers,'' he
said.

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Summer vacation is all gone
and as usual, the list of ``things to do this summer'' that I made
in a fit of spring optimism, has not been addressed. I'm thinking
it can't hurt to look it over now since it too late to do anything
about it. (Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED.

   LANE-COLUMN _ Voters often elect the wrong people. Usually this
is only a matter of opinion. Occasionally it's irrefutable.
Democracy is not perfect. The election last week of a dead Oklahoma

pretty clear case of the democratic system gone awry. (Lane,

   GUSHEE-COLUMN _ Monday, August 31, is the first anniversary of
Princess Diana's birthday in eternity. That is a pious phrase long
used by Christian faithful to describe the day a saint died. To be
sure, Diana struggled much, knew great pain and was, in many ways,
a good and gracious person. But she is not likely to be a saint.
The remarkable relationship between the troubled princess and her
adoring public is more complicated. (Gushee, Palm Beach Post)

 &HT;    Titanic, the video, hopes to make another big splash
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will our level of curiosity over the RMS Titanic ever sink?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Monday August 31, at midnight, videocassettes of Titanic _ the
most financially successful movie in history, which re-creates the
maiden voyage of the least successful ocean liner of all time _ go
on sale.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount Home Video has shipped between 20-26 million
videocassettes to stores, a record high for pre-sale copies,
according to industry estimates. It foresees Titanic becoming the
all-time video champ, topping Disney's 25-30 million sales of The
Lion King.
</P>
<P>
   The 6,000-store Blockbuster Video chain agrees, stocking its
outlets with so many copies of the two-cassette video that it
guarantees the movie will be available to rent. Video Avenue is
issuing a similar promise, noting that it expects to stock each
store with 200 rental copies.
</P>
<P>
   But can there be anyone left on the planet who hasn't already
viewed the $200 million epic?
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that everyone and his brother has already seen
Titanic, but our research suggests that's actually not the case,''
says Blockbuster Video corporate relations director Liz Greene.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe they just want to see it again. Blockbuster research
indicates that 43 percent of ``active video renters'' _ those
renting at least once in the past three months _ are likely to buy
a copy of the movie, even though 61 percent of those polled has
already seen it.
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster, Video Avenue and Best Buy stores will be among
those feeding the Titanic frenzy by staying open after midnight to
sell and rent the 11-time Oscar winner.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the movie has already brought in more than $600 million in
theaters in the United States, and an estimated $1.8 billion
worldwide. Yes, it has played in Palm Beach County and the Treasure
Coast for 35 consecutive weeks since its release in December, and
is still on the big screen at the Value Cinemas in Lantana.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean there's an iceberg in sight for video
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Dorrit Ragosine, Paramount Home Video's executive director for
public relations, says a reasonable video sales estimate would be
around $400 million. The number comes from multiplying the copies
shipped by the minimum retail price of $19.95.
</P>
<P>
   Many outlets, like Blockbuster, are selling the coveted tapes at
$24.99, with various pre-order rebates and future rental bonuses.
Going up against Paramount's pricing guidelines are such Internet
firms as Reel.com (www.reel
</P>
<P>
   .com), selling the Titanic tape for $9.99, plus $3.85 for
shipping.
</P>
<P>
   King of the world film director James Cameron personally
supervised the pan-and-scan reframing of the movie to make it fit
the squarer format of television screens. The video is also
available in a wide-screen, letterbox version, though fewer than 4
million copies of that format have been shipped.
</P>
<P>
   And no, the video version does not contain extra ``director's
cut'' footage not previously seen in theaters. ``James was asked
that at a press conference,'' notes Ragosine. ``While he was
flattered that anyone would want to see more after a three-hour
(and 14 minute) movie, there are no such plans at this time.''

 &HT;    Lawyers get out ``big guns''
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service Palm Beach Post Capital Bureau
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ The cardboard flier features an automatic
pistol, opens ominously to a warning that state Rep. Bill Andrews
refused to disarm wife beaters.
</P>
<P>
   A missive from an abused women's shelter? A gun-control group?
</P>
<P>
   For Andrews and four other suddenly-vulnerable lawmakers, its
something far more threatening: the unleashed vengeance of
Florida's trial lawyers, who through a front group have dumped
$371,000 worth of mailers, broadcast and ``push polls'' against the
legislators, all five of whom supported a measure limiting
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motivation is clear: I voted straight party line on `tort
reform,' '' said Andrews, R-Delray Beach, who until the past two
weeks had been expecting a relatively easy primary campaign against
an unknown opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he and four other lawmakers have seen the past
legislative session's most divisive bill now become possibly the
most lethal issue of this election season. Andrews will attacked
with $21,373 worth of mailings and phone ``polls'' by Tuesday's
primary, according to records filed with the state Division of
Elections. Rep. Rick Minton, D-Fort Pierce, is being hit with
$18,713 in mailings and phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles William, D-Live Oak, is the biggest target, with
$200,969 in ads _ including radio and television spots _ urging his
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Carruthers, executive director of the Academy of Florida
Trial Lawyers, said his group promised during this spring's debate
they would involve themselves in the races of legislators who sided
with large corporations at the expense of injured consumers. ``We
intend to let voters know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The meddling has infuriated Republican leaders, some of whom
have said their push for the law was repayment for all the help
they received from business interests in taking control of the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker-designate Rep. John Thrasher, that chamber's chief
architect of the bill, has hinted he might try to hold a special
session this fall to override Gov. Lawton Chiles' veto that kept
the law from taking effect _ unless trial lawyers stop their ads
and work toward a compromise. ``Maybe there won't be a need,''
Thrasher said.
</P>
<P>
   And state GOP chairman Tom Slade complained that the group
actually sponsoring the ads _ the Coalition for Family Safety,
which lists numerous environmental and consumer groups among its
members but draws much of its money from the trial bar _ is
violating tax laws by running political ads despite its tax-exempt
status.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition president Charlie Roberts, though, called that a
``bogus argument'' intended to deflect attention from the five
legislators' voting records. He said IRS regulations prohibit his
group from donating to particular campaigns, not from exercising
their first-amendment rights. ``The IRS code is not intended to
muzzle citizens and it doesn't muzzle us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One beneficiary of the ads, meanwhile, said she was grateful for
the help although she doesn't know anything about her benefactors.
``It's nice of them of them to do it,'' said Michelle Nemo, a Lake
Worth resident and Minton's opponent Tuesday in the Democratic
primary for the District 78 House seat.
</P>
<P>
   Both Minton and Andrews were attacked for voting: against a bill
to prevent those with court injunctions against them in domestic
violence cases from owning a gun; for a bill giving billionaire
Wayne Huizenga a $60 million tax break; and for the tort reform
bill.
</P>
<P>
   In Andrews' race particularly, the last-minute wave of
advertising could prove pivotal. Because supporters assumed he
would coast to re-election, he was only able to raise $28,756 by
Aug. 7, all but $3,000 of which was already spent. The $21,400
spent by the Coalition quadruples the $5,445 that Andrews'
opponent, Rob Ross, had raised by Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Delray Beach resident and Andrews supporter JoAnne Peart, 48,
said she has received two fliers and two phone ``polls'' attacking
him in the past few days. ``I'm afraid it might affect people who
don't really know what's going on,'' she said. ``They'll keep
hammering away, negative, negative, negative, and it just might
work.''

 &HT;    Technology transfers have bipartisan history
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When a rocket carrying an American-made commercial
satellite burst into flames over a small village in southern China
one winter day in 1996, mangled metal and debris cascaded down from
the sky, leaving more than 200 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, debris is still crashing down from that fiery
crash, creating havoc in the form of congressional probes that are
examining technology transfers to China and why the licensing
control of commercial satellites was shifted from the State
Department to the more business-friendly Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have seized upon the issue, saying President
Clinton's decision to move jurisdiction to the Commerce Department
in March 1996 placed the nation's security at risk. Rep. Dana
Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) went so far as to warn that ``every man,
woman and child in the United States now is in jeopardy of nuclear
incineration.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) unleashed criticism on the White
House's export policy, saying it had ``elevated our risk to
national security.'' And Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said the
fallout from the satellite crash had resulted in ``the most serious
allegations that I've heard on any administration in the last
eight, 10, 12 years, maybe longer.''
</P>
<P>
   But documents obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and
interviews with officials in the Reagan, Bush and Clinton
administrations show that Republicans were just as aggressive as
Democrats in removing commercial satellites and other high-tech
equipment from a list of exports controlled by the State Department
known as the Munitions List.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus to transfer the jurisdiction from the State
Department to the Commerce Department actually began under
President Reagan, took root under President Bush and became reality
with Clinton's 1996 executive order.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the decision to transfer the approval process to the
Commerce Department had the backing of key Republicans such as
House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and former Rep. Toby Roth
(R-Wis.), who headed the House International Relations subcommittee
responsible for monitoring export controls.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would have approved
</P>
<P>
   Even top Bush administration officials concede that had Bush
been re-elected president in 1992, he likely would have approved
moving the jurisdiction of commercial satellites and other
technology to the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense in the Bush administration that something
was broke in the satellite licensing process,'' said Arnold Kanter,
who worked then at both the National Security Council and State
Department and now is an international business consultant. ``If
Bush had been re-elected, I can easily envision the satellite
transfers going to the Commerce Department.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Transferring that authority from State to Commerce was
legal,'' said Gingrich in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not have been wise, but it was legal. There was a
bipartisan effort to do it,'' added Gingrich, who has kept his
distance from the fray, commenting little on the matter before this
interview.
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich also noted that there is a big difference in
transferring the jurisdiction for approving the licensing of
commercial satellites to the Commerce Department and transferring
highly sensitive technology to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   And that is exactly what a special select committee appointed by
Gingrich looked at in a series of closed-door sessions last week.
The committee, headed by Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Calif.), is
looking at whether Loral Space and Communications, the maker of the
satellite that exploded, and Hughes Electronics, the company hired
to help figure out what went wrong, put the national security at
risk by helping the Chinese figure out the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   As Democrats see it, few issues in Congress are as ludicrous as
the Republican allegation that the president put the nation's
security at risk by putting the control of commercial satellites in
the hands of the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt Gingrich signed several letters with me to make that
happen,'' said Rep. Sam Gejdenson (D-Conn.), who worked with Roth
both as chairman and then as ranking member of the export policy
panel. ``This is ridiculous. They are attacking the president
because they don't have an election-year agenda.``
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Roth said the decision to transfer jurisdiction to
Commerce Department was a ``good thing,'' and the congressional
push to return control to the State Department constitutes a
knee-jerk reaction that is not as deliberative as his
subcommittee's hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term ramifications of the debate over jurisdiction is
that the country will lose its stronghold as the top commercial
satellite maker in the world, Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. satellite manufacturers make more than 70 percent of the
world's commercial satellites, but the industry is facing
increasing competition from German and French companies that do not
have to wade through the layers of government that American
companies face, said Clayton Mowry, director of the Satellite
Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   How the decision was made
</P>
<P>
   The satellite industry began lobbying for the transfer to the
Commerce Department in the late 1980s as a result of frustration
over delays in the State Department's approval process.
</P>
<P>
   For years, makers of commercial satellites as well as other
products lobbied to be removed from the State Department's
Munitions List, which is a list of technologies intended for
everyday use but can be used for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The reason?
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of distinctions made that were fairly
arbitrary,'' said William Loughrey, director of governmental
affairs for Scientific-Atlanta, a Georgia-based company that
specializes in cable television, telecommunications and satellite
transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Bush and Clinton administrations,
Scientific-Atlanta sought to remove its ``ground station
equipment,'' which transmits and receives satellite signals, from
the State Department list.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make the change from State to Commerce because it
was a faster and more transparent process,'' Loughrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said, companies that make equipment on the State
Department list are precluded from selling equipment to certain
countries. Facing competition from abroad, that put
Scientific-Atlanta in a bind. Not only did the State Department
take longer to approve its licenses, it limited the countries where
its products could be sold.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial satellite makers like Hughes faced even more of an
uphill battle. ``Commercial satellites are not weapons,'' said
Steven Dorfman, vice chairman of Hughes Electronics Corp. ``They
are no different than telephone cables and headsets, which might be
used for military communications.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether ``we want to shut down on the spread of
inexpensive global communications and all that means for the free
flow of information and the hope of democracy in China because the
military might also be making phone calls,'' Dorfman said.
</P>
<P>
   Hope for those `on the list'
</P>
<P>
   It was not until the spring of 1995, more than five years after
the first legislative attempt to wrest away jurisdiction from the
State Department, that the satellite makers saw hope in their quest
to transfer jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the Clinton administration appeared to be in
concert with Republican leaders on the Hill, to transfer oversight
authority.
</P>
<P>
   In a March 10, 1995, memo outlining the Republican effort to
make that happen, William Clements, the National Security Council's
director of non-proliferation and export controls, wrote to his
boss Sandy Berger, then the NSC's deputy director and now Clinton's
national security adviser, to say that the chances for legislation
looked promising. Roth, Clements wrote, is ready to do business.
</P>
<P>
   Roth, according to the memo, had told Clements that a number of
key Republicans, including Gingrich, would support an ``export
administration act'' that stripped control of commercial satellites
from the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roth is committed to passing an EAA in this session,'' the
memo states. ``He (Roth) has already talked to the Speaker,
Congressmen Spence and Hunter (of the National Security Committee)
and Senator Bond (chairman of the Senate subcommittee). They were
all supportive. Scientific-Atlanta and IBM are the two largest
employers in the Speaker's district. Both companies have been very
involved in the export control wars. Consequently we believe the
Speaker can be engaged if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo is important because it shows that the controversial
decision to transfer the jurisdiction from State to Commerce was a
bipartisan affair. Indeed, in a 1997 letter to Attorney General
Janet Reno outlining why the export policy was changed under the
Clinton administration, Roth sounds slightly like a Clinton
apologist:
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, the administration's export control policy changes
were in response to strong bi-partisan urging by those of us in
Congress who actually had the legislative and oversight
jurisdiction. To us, the administration's efforts were then, and
are today, entirely appropriate to adjust out-of-date Cold War
policies to the new realities of the post-Cold War era and to take
account of the rapid changes in the global availability of high
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The need for reforms began in the 101st Congress when Bush was
in the Oval Office. Roth and Gejdenson, then-chairman of the export
monitoring panel, heard extensive testimony about the issue for six
years, prior to Clinton's 1996 executive order.
</P>
<P>
   From 1990 to 1996, testimony was taken from the top industry
executives about the need for completely overhauling the policy on
export controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes made by the Clinton administration have been
consistent with the recommendations received during those hearings,
which began well before President Clinton was elected,'' Roth wrote
in his letter to Reno.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1995, Roth introduced a bill calling for revising the
export policies to allow commercial satellites, supercomputers, jet
engine technology and telecommunications equipment to be
transferred to the Commerce Department's control.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Clinton signed an executive order doing that, and
more.

 YOU FILL UP MY CENSUS, EVEN IF I CAN'T FIND YOU

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Obscured by the debate over whether the Census
Bureau should use statistical sampling to supplement the next
national head count is a little secret: the ``actual enumeration''
mandated by the Constitution never really takes place.
</P>
<P>
   In the 2000 census, the bureau wants to count everyone who lives
in 90 per cent of the households in each of the country's census
tracts _ neighborhoods containing about 1,700 dwellings each _ and
use the data gathered from them to estimate the remaining 10 per
cent who haven't been located. It would then conduct a nationwide
survey of 750,000 households and use the results to adjust the
official figure up or down.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of sampling say it offends the Constitution, which
mandates an ``actual enumeration'' of the population every 10
years. Their criticism grew even louder last week after a federal
court in Washington said the Census Bureau's plans for using
sampling violated statutes governing how the count is to be
conducted.
</P>
<P>
   When the opponents of sampling say actual enumeration, they mean
just that. ``You have to go nose-by-nose, head-by-head,
neighborhood-by-neighborhood to count people,'' said Pete Jeffries,
spokesman for Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Such comments evoke a dreamy past in which clipboard-toting
census-takers troop through communities counting people one at a
time. But since the first census in 1790, the traditional head
count has been conducted in ways that belie that notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been a kind of line-up-everybody operation
where the U.S. Marshals or the census enumerators had to actually
see the people,'' said Margo J. Anderson, author of The American
Census: A Social History'' (Yale University Press, 1988).
</P>
<P>
   Conducted in a country that has always loathed heavy-handed
intrusion by its federal government, the census has instead relied
on the word of whoever in the household chooses to provide the
information. If that person gives erroneous information, for
whatever reasons _ personal, political, economic _ no one tries to
verify it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, the Census Bureau moved even further away from the
original idea when it began to mail out census questionnaires, and
generally relied on the information that was sent back. With
mail-back forms, there are no government representatives noting
evidence _ bicycles stacked on the porch, raincoats hanging in the
hall _ that would look the information-giver in the eye and say,
``Are you sure you're the only one living here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, it was a bigger change in census-taking to go from
enumerators going to every house to mailed questionnaires than
anything we're talking about now,'' said Barbara Everitt Bryant,
Director of the Census Bureau during the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   The fall off in the number of households that mail the
questionnaires back _ it dropped to 65 per cent in 1990 from 78 per
cent in 1970 _ is a prime reason the Census Bureau wants to change
its methods. In the 1990 census, counters went back again and again
to households that did not send back the form and to households
where no one was home when a census taker came calling. In some
cases, households were finally contacted as late as August, a major
reason why the 1990 Census had an estimated 26 million errors,
including people missed, people counted twice and people counted in
the wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   Since census tallies are used for allocating seats in the House
of Representative and drawing boundaries for legislative districts,
the Census Bureau has to find out not just how many people live in
a given neighborhood but how many people live there on the same
date, April 1 of the census year. Thus, information gathered in
August is barely relevant.
</P>
<P>
   And if a census-taker never is able to catch up to the occupants
of a household at all, he would ask landlords, neighbors,
shop-keepers, even people on the street _ measures that are closer
to guesses than actual enumeration.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau has even used a form of sampling to help fill
in data. In 1970 Census Bureau statisticians sent counters to a
sample of houses that were considered vacant and found that a
percentage of them were in fact occupied. This data were then used
to extrapolate how many people actually lived in the rest of the
nation's presumably vacant dwellings. As a result, a million people
were added.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of sampling say, though, that in the past, those were
measures of last resort. This is the first time the census
deliberately intends not to at least try to count everyone. What's
needed, they say, is for the Census Bureau to merely try harder.

 ONE FOR THE RECORDS: HOW THE PRESS HOUNDED ROGER MARIS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ With Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals and
Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs closing in on Roger Maris' record of
61 home runs in a major league baseball season, people are
recalling the press' shabby treatment of Maris during the summer of
1961.
</P>
<P>
   Many think, especially in light of the furor last week over
McGwire's use of testosterone-boosting pills, that anyone making a
run at the record today is in for a far worse experience than Maris
endured.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps not. In New York's newspapers, Maris faced
unrelenting criticism, not only of his performance but of his
souring mood. Still, while his treatment during his record chase
was brutal enough, only the following spring did he face the
vilification for which he now is remembered. Here are excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   _ By ALAN SCHWARZ
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Maris ran neck-and-neck with Mickey Mantle
until Mantle was injured in September. A bigger source of pressure
was commissioner Ford Frick's ruling on July 17 that Babe Ruth's
record would be considered broken only if it were surpassed in the
season's first 154 games, rather than the 162 to which the season
had just been expanded. Maris' standard reply: ``A season's a
season.'' But most fans supported the edict, as did columnist Dick
Young of the New York Daily News on Aug. 22: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   (Frick's) seems to be the realistic approach. Just as there is a
difference between the 100-yard dash record and 100-meters, so is
there a difference between a home run race over the 154 and
162-game distances. . . . What Maris seems to overlook is that the
Commissioner's deadline has been set for the benefit of Maris and
Mantle, just as much as it has built a protective wall around
Ruth's record. It will spare the M &AMP; M boys from charges of being
``cheese champs.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Young helped mold public opinion, and as
Maris entered September with 51 homers _ and with game 154
approaching at mid-month _ the pressure mounted. The New York Post,
Sept. 11:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday was (Maris') 27th birthday, and each day he has come
closer to destiny has heightened the tension within him as it has
increased the sense of history about him. He hit no homers in
yesterday's doubleheader against the Indians. He has tried to
protect himself with bravado _ ``I do or I don't; that's all there
is to it'' _ but there is also bewilderment that what he is doing
has produced a near air of hysteria among those who are witnessing
his pass at the record that has withstood 34 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Labor Day we had talked just this same way and Maris had
said: ``I wish the damned season were over right now.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``You still wish the same thing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)On Sept. 12, Maris temporarily stopped
speaking to the press. This opened him up to ridicule and prompted
negative comparisons to the far more gregarious Mantle. Louis
Effrat of The New York Times reported on Sept. 16:(END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   How does the man who has poled 56 homers and is still four short
of Babe Ruth's record of 60 feel now that he is even with the 1927
Ruthian pace?
</P>
<P>
   Maris didn't say. In fact, Maris wouldn't say anything.
Immediately after the Yankees had split the two games with the
Tigers, an interrogation squad swarmed into the visiting club's
dressing room. . . .
</P>
<P>
   While Mickey Mantle answered all questions and volunteered
information, Maris, the other half of the celebrated M-Squad,
remained in the trainer's room and sulked.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)On Sept. 20, game 154, Maris needed two home
runs at Baltimore to tie Ruth. He hit one. The next day, Harold
Rosenthal of The New York Herald Tribune didn't sound
disappointed:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris, the crew-cut modern Yankee, couldn't catch the
laughing ghost of Babe Ruth last night. He crashed his 59th home
run of the season in the third inning, but failed in three more
attempts to sock one out of Memorial Stadium in Ruth's ometown. So
the Ruthian record of 60 over a schedule of 154 games is safe for
this year at least. It remains to be seen what the reaction will be
if Roger belts a few more in the eight games still on this year's
Yankee schedule.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The Daily News, Sept. 27:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris hit the Golden Gopher last night, crashing his 60th
homer to tie Babe Ruth's great and heretofore untouched high of
1927. The blond Bomber drove into the third deck in right field in
the third inning to become the only man ever to equal the immortal
Sultan of Swat. It took him 159 games.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Despite being a home run away from a new
record, Maris didn't play the next game against the Orioles. Weary
and bitter, he didn't even stay for the game, and instead went
shopping in New York with his wife. The Daily News, Sept. 28:(END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris really doesn't take ``surly pills.'' Baseball's new
home run king only looks that way. More exactly, he acts that way.
The other players call him ``Redneck Roger,'' or a less presentable
variation of same in dugout language. . . .
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his personality is exactly the opposite of the man
whose homer production he matched, Babe Ruth. The Babe roared
through life. He loved people, excitement, fame. He was just a big
kid. Roger is a serious, reticent man. He shuns publicity and many
times in the past month said with complete candor: ``I'm sick of
all this. I wish I were home with my wife and kids. I can't wait
for this season to end.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)The New York Post, Oct. 1: (END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Success makes people change, and money. Slowly, inevitably,
Roger Maris has become less the charming grouch he used to be and
more the busy, harried, far less personable grouch.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) On the last day of the regular season,
Maris connected with No. 61 off Tracy Stallard of the Boston Red
Sox for a 1-0 Yankee win. Within minutes, scores of reporters
mobbed Maris at his locker. United Press International, Oct. 2:
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Maris, thoroughly spent from his recent efforts to match Babe
Ruth's record of 60 homers, said he was ``glad the ordeal was
over.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about it,'' he said in almost a whisper.
``When you have to put up with something like this for two months''
_ gesturing toward a mob of newsmen, photographers, and newsreel
men crowded around his locker _ ``it's bound to affect your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)In the offseason, Maris grew increasingly
resentful over his ordeal. The writers pounced at spring training.
The Post, March 15:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   It's strange. During last season's pressure cooker he behaved
remarkably well, acting cooperative, available, frank and patient.
Only since then has he acquired real bitterness about life in a
goldfish bowl, the inescapable price of his fame and sudden wealth.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   So you hear: ``I'm through being a nice guy. It doesn't pay.
This world isn't made for niceness.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Oscar Fraley of UPI, March 15: (END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   For a man who belabored the ball at a rather anemic .269 clip, I
would have to think that Maris has a rather swollen idea of his
importance. Sports are grand fun when kept in their proper
perspective, but if either of my two sons was a hero, I hope it's a
modest fellow named John Glenn who went for the circuit when it
really counted. Because guys like Maris bat a round zero with me.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Maris' biggest mistake was skipping a
scheduled interview with Jimmy Cannon of The New York
Journal-American, who expected great deference from athletes. The
result was a two-part series in which the columnist excoriated
Maris for his ``defects of personality.'' Cannon's column of March
21:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that dissension caused by Roger the Whiner's
soliloquies may disturb the traditional harmony of the Yankees. The
hostile attitude of Maris . . . has even discouraged those paid to
praise him. They have already become deliberately negligent in
their spent crusade to have him canonized as Ruth's heir. Seldom
has a man in sports so quickly alienated those who originally
offered their respect with gladness provoked by admiration. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I was also guilty of slovenly reporting by not turning it on him
(last year) for his treacherous smallness. The absence of stress
does not diminish his capacity for self-worship. I'll pick up on
him tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)The next day:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The animosity the others on the squad have for The Whiner has
ruffled the usual serenity of the Yankees. . . . Even Mickey
Mantle, who is now their greatest player and symbol of their casual
efficiency, pretends he is merely one ballplayer on a squad of 25.
</P>
<P>
   The community of baseball feels Mantle is a great player. They
consider Maris a thrilling freak who batted .269.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)On Dec. 8, 1966, Maris was traded to the St.
Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 14, 1985, he died of lymphatic cancer in Gainesville,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 4, 1991, commissioner Fay Vincent removed the separate
listing of Ruth's 154-game record, leaving Maris' standing
alone.(END ITALICS HERE)

 RUSSIA IS NOT POLAND, AND THAT'S TOO BAD

(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, August (The Week in Review)  
(duplication warning: also sent with `i' code) 
 (bl)  
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Put aside for a moment the frightening crash of the ruble and
the collapse of Russia's stock and bond markets last week. They are
symptoms of something larger _ a deformed economy in which the
government sets business taxes that few firms ever pay, enterprises
promise wages that employees never see, loans go unpaid, people
barter with pots, pans and socks and shady dealing runs rampant.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't have to be this way. The Russians need only look to
Poland to behold the better road untraveled. Poland too began the
decade saddled with paltry living standards bequeathed by a
sclerotic, centrally controlled economy run by discredited
Communists. It reached out to the West for help creating monetary,
budget, trade and legal regimes, and unlike Russia it followed
through with sustained political will. It now ranks among Europe's
fastest-growing economies.
</P>
<P>
   Key to Poland's steady success have been two policy decisions,
and discussing them helps to illuminate by contrast what is going
wrong in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   First, Poland adopted what might be called the Balcerowicz rule,
named after Leszek Balcerowicz, the finance minister who
masterminded Poland's market reforms. Balcerowicz invited thousands
of would-be entrepreneurs to sell, within loose limits, anything
they wanted anywhere they wanted at whatever price they wanted.
Economists called this liberalization. The Poles called it
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Balcerowicz rule helped break the chokehold of
Communist-dominated, state-owned enterprises and government
bureaucracies over economic activity. Also, encouraging small
start-ups denies organized crime opportunities for large prey.
</P>
<P>
   When Poland broke away from communism, Western economists had
wrung their hands trying to figure out what to do with its
sprawling state-owned factories, which operated more like social
welfare agencies than production units. The solution, it turned
out, was benign neglect. Rather than convert factories, the Poles
allowed them to shrivel. Workers peeled away to set up retail shops
and other small enterprises largely free of government
interference.
</P>
<P>
   The second major decision was scarier. Poland forced insolvent
firms into bankruptcy, preventing them from draining resources from
productive parts of the economy. That also ended a drain on the
federal budget by firms that had to be propped up by one disguised
subsidy or another.
</P>
<P>
   There were moments when the post-Communist government in Russia
appeared headed in the same direction. In early 1992, the Yeltsin
government embraced the Balcerowicz rule. Russians were invited to
take to the streets and set up kiosks and curb-side tables, selling
whatever they wanted at whatever price consumers would pay.
</P>
<P>
   But then Communist antibodies, in the form of the oligarchs who
controlled the state-owned factories and natural resources, were
activated. They detected foreign tissue and attacked. Local
governments buried the Balcerowicz rule, imposing licensing and
other requirements and eventually strangling start-ups. Professor
Marshall Goldman of Harvard points to revealing comments by Viktor
Chernomyrdin, the off-again, on-again prime minister whom President
Boris Yeltsin restored to his post last week. Chernomyrdin observed
that street vendors were an unattractive, chaotic blight on a proud
country. The Russian authorities cracked down.
</P>
<P>
   The impact was severe. Anders Aslund, a former adviser to the
Russian government now at the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace, estimates that since the middle of 1994, the number of
enterprises in Russia has stagnated. In a typical Western economy,
he estimates, there is 1 business for every 10 residents. In
Russia, the ratio is 1 for every 55.
</P>
<P>
   By snuffing out start-ups, Russia lost the remarkable device by
which Poland drained workers out of worthless factories into units
that could produce the goods that people wanted to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia not only stifles start-ups; it also props up
incompetents. It tolerates businesses that cannot pay taxes or
wages. They survive because of systems of barter and mutual
forbearance of loans and taxes. Suppliers engage in round-robin
lending by which everyone owes money to someone and no one ever
pays up. That too throws a lifeline to insolvent firms.
</P>
<P>
   Russian factories continue to churn out steel and other products
that no one needs. One measure of the deformity is that Russia is
littered with factories employing 10,000 or more workers. In the
United States, such factories are a rarity. The effect is to keep
alive concerns that chew up $1.50 worth of resources in order to
turn out a product that is worth only $1 to consumers. Economists
call this ``negative value added.'' Ordinary folk call it economic
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, of course, was not like Poland before or after
communism. History matters. Poland could let its relatively small
number of mega-factories wither, confident that workers could be
absorbed in fast-growing small enterprises. Russia's officials had
no such confidence about absorbing the workers from its numerous,
gigantic state-owned factories.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike communism in Poland, Soviet communism went back 70 years,
obliterating private property and extinguishing memory of a time
when ordinary people ran independent shops. There was also, Goldman
points out, a vibrant civic culture in Poland in the early 1990s
that equated the freedom of markets with freedom from the Soviets.
There was no such unambiguous response in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clifford Gaddy of the Brookings Institution makes the point
that where start-ups were encouraged, namely Moscow, they thrived.
Still, when Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko in recent months
threatened to close down insolvent firms, the oligarchs rose up and
forced Yeltsin to drive his prime minister out of office. The
problem was not that Russia had no choices. It made the wrong ones.
</P>
<P>
   The West played a decisive role in Poland, but, it now appears,
not in Russia. Poland invited Western economists and investment
bankers to help design and execute its reform package. The West
also provided timely aid to smooth over the painful adjustment of
economic reconstruction. The Poles used the aid as promised, to pay
for bold reform.
</P>
<P>
   Russia too received Western aid. But, it now appears, the money
did more to postpone reforms than to provoke them. Over the years,
the West extracted grudging promises from the Russian government to
undertake this or that pro-market reform. The promises were never
fulfilled. Western money permitted the Russians to preserve
subsidies that keep the economy, such as it is, on life support.
</P>
<P>
   This too might have been otherwise. Early in Yeltsin's reign,
Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard, a major architect of the Polish
reforms and a former Yeltsin adviser, organized a lobbying campaign
for a grand bargain, by which the West would provide substantial
aid early if Yeltsin would implement tough market reforms. The West
dithered and the moment was lost.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the bargain would have convinced the Russians to follow
the Poles' course rather than their own is unclear. But by the time
the West did crank up aid, the economy had foundered, people had
soured on reform and opponents of an economic overhaul had erected
high hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Today Russia is paying the price. A government that clamped down
on reform in part because it produced chaotic, messy streets now
oversees an economy that is a chaotic mess.

 THROUGHOUT THE AMERICAS, NATIVES INVOKE THE LAW OF THE LAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, August (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In August, after initialing the first treaty that his people had
ever concluded with Canada's government, Chief Joseph Gosnell Sr.
held the document over the seal whiskers of his regal headdress and
shouted, ``The Nisga'a canoe has returned.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a reference to a trip to the white man's capital taken by
his native American ancestors a century ago, and it was a way of
saying that the Nisga'a's long journey for recognition within
Canada was over.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nisga'a in fact have a long way to go, and in that they
are little different from other native Americans in Canada, Mexico
and the United States. For the treaty, which gives the Nisga'a
title to ancestral lands and the right to govern what goes on
there, still must be approved by Nisga'a members, the legislature
of British Columbia and the federal Parliament. It has already
raised objections from other Canadians about the special rights it
would give the Nisga'a.
</P>
<P>
   In fact the Nisga'a experience illustrates how much, across all
of North America, the original problem that European settlers faced
on their arrival in the new world remains largely unresolved. More
than 500 years later, Indians continue to demand recognition that
they have special rights to live a special way of life by virtue of
their having been in North America first.
</P>
<P>
   And this is more than a simple question of granting justice, as
the native Americans see it. Even where the political will exists
to grant such rights, governments and courts struggle to reconcile
the needs of Indian cultures with the concept of equality in the
constitutions of all three countries.
</P>
<P>
   It is a little like the basic political problem with affirmative
action programs: While the central goal of righting past wrongs
enjoys considerable support, the formulas being put forward are
under attack because they seem to grant special privileges to some,
but not all, citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, for example, Indians in the state of Chiapas have
taken up arms to force the government to recognize Indian autonomy,
but officials worry that doing so too broadly could give Indians
rights not available to other Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   And in the United States, tribes are testing the boundaries of
their sovereignty by exploiting their land in ways that might not
be tolerated off the reservations.
</P>
<P>
   In the Canadian case, opponents object to the treaty because it
would allow elections limited by race. So they are preparing to
challenge the constitutionality of the Nisga'a treaty before the
precedent is followed by dozens of other Indian groups that are
also clamoring for self-government.
</P>
<P>
   Despite different histories and vastly unequal populations,
these issues all boil down to a demand to control Indian destiny by
controlling Indian land.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes Indians Indians is the dream of living on
communally held lands,'' said Jose Barreiro, associate director of
the American Indian Program at Cornell University, who has worked
and studied Indian groups across the American continent. ``The
issue of land is very, very strong in all indigenous communities.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the land itself has been addressed, fairly or not,
in treaties or contracts signed over many years. Now the crux of
controversy in all three countries is the way Indians live on the
land. Although they travel in pick up trucks, wear jeans and use
the Internet, many Indians lead lives on their reserves and
reservations that are different from the societies around them.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,500 Nisga'a who live on their traditional lands are
divided into four bands, which correspond to four villages.
Patterns of leadership, land tenancy and even marriage are
determined to a large extent by participation in the bands.
</P>
<P>
   Some tribes have their own courts, their own methods of
punishment and their own preferred style of elections, which is not
always democratic. These patterns have persisted despite ferocious
attempts at assimilation through residential schools and laws that
banned traditional ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 30 years, the recognition of basic human rights
around the world has exposed injustices in the way Indians are
treated. In the United States, the civil rights movement focused
attention on Indians, and affirmative action gave a whole
generation of Indian students access to universities and law
schools. That generation of lawyers is now testing the limits of
Indian sovereignty, and the fight for greater independence is
sometimes financed by tax-free revenues from gambling operations.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, the government is still smarting from a violent
confrontation between soldiers and Mohawk Indians in 1990. A report
by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples last year left no
doubt about how badly directed Canada's paternalistic handling of
Indians had been. Recent court decisions have upheld Indian claims
and even the legal validity of Indian oral histories.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Indians in Utah, claiming sovereign
powers, caused a panic with their plan to accept nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, where there are no reservations, the number of
full-blooded Indians is estimated to be around 10 million. Their
poverty is as extreme as their marginalization from the rest of
society. Much of the current tension can be traced to a
constitutional amendment in 1992 that essentially privatized Indian
land, which until then had been held by the community. The
government believed it was boosting Indian chances of entering the
modern economy but Indians have opposed the change. The Zapatista
uprising in Chiapas was based on issues of the land and Indian
rights.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiations with the Zapatistas, accords acknowledging
Indian autonomy were reached in January, 1996. But the government
recoiled at what the negotiators had given away. It was
particularly concerned that acknowledging the rights of ``the
Indian people'' as opposed to the more limited concept of ``Indian
communities,'' infringed on the sovereignty of Mexico and created
two classes of Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas prefer to see themselves as part of a global
tribe of Indians. ``We have helped create, at the side of men and
women in the five continents, a great network,'' the Zapatista
leader, Marcos, wrote in the Indians' latest declaration from
Chiapas, ``a network that is fighting to build a new world.''

   Reno Orders Inquiry Into Gore Fund Raising
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno ordered a 90-day investigation to
determine whether to seek an independent prosecutor to examine Vice
President Al Gore's fund-raising telephone calls from the White
House during the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Reno first examined Gore's solicitations last year, but absolved
him of wrongdoing, saying she could find no evidence that he knew
the money he raised was ``hard money'' to be spent on behalf of
specific candidates _ a use that Reno said could be illegal.
Federal officials are generally prohibited from raising such money
on government property.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the White House belatedly turned over a November 1995
memorandum with handwritten notations by a senior Gore aide that
suggested Gore could have known some of the contributions were for
the use of candidates.

   Limited Review Set For King Assassination
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years after Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated
on the balcony of a motel in Memphis, Attorney General Janet Reno
ordered a review of new evidence that raises questions about the
conviction of James Earl Ray as the sniper who alone killed the
civil rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   The review, which will be narrower than the full-scale reopening
of the case sought by King's family, will focus on claims like one
by Donald Wilson, a retired FBI agent, who said that after the
killing he found paper in Ray's car that bore the name Raoul. That
was the name of the shadowy figure who Ray, after recanting his
confession, claimed had manipulated him into the plot.
</P>
<P>
   But FBI officials said agents recently investigated Wilson's
claims and found them to be, as one agent put it, ``a total
fabrication.''

   Chinese Leaders Vow To Mend Ecological Ways
</P>
<P>
   In his heyday in the late 1950s, Mao Tse-tung called a mass
campaign to kill sparrows, accused of eating too much grain. The
result was disastrous as insect populations soared.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, awareness of ecology in China has changed, to say
the least. But it took this summer's disastrous floods and an
unusual public outcry to jolt the government into admitting past
mistakes and vowing sweeping changes in policy.
</P>
<P>
   As less-than-record rains caused record damage, China said it
would halt logging in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River system
and restore lakes and wetlands downstream that used to soak up
excess water, but were drained to make farms.
</P>
<P>
   Execution will not be easy, since the new policy threatens the
livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of loggers and farmers.

   The government's antitrust investigation of Microsoft has

   At issue is whether Microsoft bullied Intel into backing away

   Federal and state investigators, Microsoft replies, are

   Carcinogen Found in Fetuses of Pregnant Smokers

   Researchers reported the first direct evidence that a
cancer-causing substance from tobacco is transmitted to fetuses by
pregnant smokers. Dr. Stephen Hecht of the University of Minnesota
Cancer Center said his findings established that the

processed by the body.

   By Hemingway, One Last Time
</P>
<P>
   ``In your novels, are you writing about yourself?'' a student
once asked Ernest Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does a writer know anyone better?'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   But now in a final, posthumous novel to be published next year
for the centennial of his birth, the adventurer and prankster who
was Hemingway can keep readers guessing. The book, ``True at First
Light,'' an unfinished fictional memoir based on a 1953 safari to
Kenya with his fourth wife, Mary, weaves in the story of Debba, an
18-year-old girl of the Wakamba tribe whom the narrator woos, weds
and beds _ cheered on by his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Is it true? Patrick Hemingway, the author's 70-year-old son, who
carved the 100,000-word book out of a 200,000-word manuscript for
Scribner, said he joined the safari from his farm in Tanganyika and
saw no Debba. Nor apparently did the photographer for Look
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Yet both Hemingway and Mary later tantalized biographers with
tales of a romance. A.E. Hotchner even quoted Hemingway's account
of three-way nuptials that included his bride's widowed 17-year-old
sister.
</P>
<P>
   But the book, portions of which were excerpted by Sports
Illustrated in the 1970s, ranges far beyond the love triangle.
There are autobiographical flashbacks, meditations on the soul and
suspenseful hunts. This much at least is true: Mary gets her lion.
Its skin adorns the floor of the Hemingway Room in the John F.
Kennedy Library in Boston.

CALIFORNIANS FIGHT TO SAVE THE RUSSIAN RIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE KAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDWOOD VALLEY, Calif. _ The Russian River begins here, just a
trickle from invisible cracks in mountains thick with fir trees.
</P>
<P>
   It ends 110 miles away on the Pacific Ocean, where waves crash
up to the river's mouth forming the estuary at Jenner, a haven for
harbor seals and cormorants.
</P>
<P>
   In the miles between, the river runs lazy and inviting in summer
months, swollen and menacing in wet winters _ a source of drinking
water for a half million people.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, it's San Francisco's hot weather playground, a
place for canoeing and swimming and weekend barbecues in the shade
of redwood trees. In the fall, the fields near its banks are ablaze
with the orange and red hues of grape vines that signal another
harvest in an increasingly important wine region. In winter, it's
one of the most flood-prone U.S. rivers, a nightmarish torrent 200
times its summertime size, ripping out banks and houses and
threatening lives.
</P>
<P>
   And all year round, it's an endangered waterway.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of trapping, logging, gravel mining, damming,
straightening, sewage dumping, water pumping and farming right up
to its banks have put the Russian River on an environmental group's
list of America's Most Threatened Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   And now _ inspired by a new spurt of local activism, buoyed by
tougher federal laws to save wild salmon and steelhead _ the
river's future has come to the top of the agenda for public action
by an amalgam of water agencies, government offices, growers,
utilities and environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the next month, 300 people who have been attending a
series of recent meetings will decide whether to launch a Russian
River Watershed Council, under which varied interests in Sonoma and
Mendocino counties would work together to restore the river. It
would be modeled after councils formed to protect such Pacific
Northwest rivers as the Umpqua and Coquille in Oregon and the
Skagit in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian River's story is in the next 25 years. It could be
the most dramatic restoration in the country,'' said Richard
Charter, 52, of Friends of the Russian River.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take the cooperation of agriculture,'' said
Charter, who played on the Russian River as a toddler and fought
every river battle for the last 30 years. ``Developers have to get
less greedy. Gravel miners have to realize they don't run the
county. Water agencies are going to have to make a commitment to
conservation and wise management.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the warning lights on the dashboard are red,'' said
Charter. ``Everything is wrong. Everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian River is born high on a summit, its tiny headwaters
hidden in craggy, forested mountains 15 miles north of Ukiah.
</P>
<P>
   The river, a third the length of the Sacramento River and half
as long as the Thames, drains an area of 1,485 square miles. Its
biggest tributaries are the East Fork of the Russian and Big
Sulphur, Mark West, Maacama and Dry creeks.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful East Fork is artificially supplemented by 159,000
acre-feet a year of Eel River water, enough to make up two-thirds
of the Russian as it flows through Guerneville in summertime.
</P>
<P>
   The Eel water bursts into the Russian through a two-mile tunnel
drilled into a mountainside in Potter Valley in 1908 when a company
later bought by PG&AMP;E built a hydropower plant.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as people of the Russian River watershed weigh decisions
about their economic and environmental future, they look north to
its beginning and down the separate reaches as it sweeps toward the
sea.
</P>
<P>
   On the upper reaches of the river as it flows from the Potter
and Redwood valleys, through Ukiah and Old Hopland to Cloverdale,
two important decisions loom.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E, following a state order to switch from power generation to
distribution, is deciding what to do with the Potter Valley
hydropower plant. Its proposal, which must be approved by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, could shrink the size of the
river downstream if less water were diverted from the Eel for the
Russian.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen miles downstream of the power plant, the Army Corps of
Engineers is trying to address problems created by the operation of
its 40-year-old Coyote Valley Dam. Critics say this dam, and the
corps' Warm Springs Dam on the Dry Creek tributary, speed up
erosion of riverfront property downstream. The dams can also harm
fish considered threatened species by the National Marine Fisheries
Service by releasing water warmer than is good for them.
</P>
<P>
   Long-time grape grower Malcolm King doesn't plant to the edge of
his riverfront property the way many growers tempted by valuable
acreage do. Nonetheless, in last winter's floods, he saw a half an
acre of his 40-acre vineyard liquefy and melt away after weeks of
dam releases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The banks and vegetation can handle the natural peaks and
drops of a few hours duration,'' said King. But the huge volume
over time ``supersaturates the banks and the water is dissolving
the very fine topsoils laid down forever.''
</P>
<P>
   On the sweeping Alexander Valley reach from Cloverdale to
Healdsburg, the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors is preparing an
ordinance to address environmental effects of transforming land to
vineyards _ including erosion and loss of stream-side habitat for
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   In Sonoma County, vineyards jumped in the last decade from
30,000 acres producing $67 million worth of wine grapes to 48,000
acres producing $289 million.
</P>
<P>
   The river's ability to withstand floods and provide for wildlife
suffers from the disappearance of natural willows, alders and
cottonwoods, now bulldozed down to a narrow band to make room for
the vines that produce wine grapes, say scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem the river faces it sewage.
</P>
<P>
   For years, treated sewage overflow from Santa Rosa has entered
the river via Mark West Creek near Mirabel Park. Locals joked that
Santa Rosa's favorite saying was, ``Flush twice for Guerneville.''
</P>
<P>
   After decades of dumping the treated discharges through the
little river towns, the county has a new plan. Santa Rosa promises
it won't release more than 1 percent of its highly treated sewage
overflow into the river. Most will get piped to geothermal beds and
to water crops.

</P>
<P>
   Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, Ingrid
Bergman had to walk into Humphrey Bogart's in Casablanca. And ever
since, Casablanca has been a romantic place somewhere out there in
the imagination of millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Casablanca, the biggest city and main port of
Morocco, is intensely romantic _ faded, languid and vaguely
decadent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if you ask residents, they will most often tell you that
their city is just another disagreeable metropole with too many
people and too many cars and that you'd be far better off setting
out for the more authentic Morocco _ Marrakesh and Fez, say.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Casa, as they call it, seem hardly to notice that
they are living in an Art Deco museum, with some austere French
Colonial buildings mixed in. To them, the muezzin's soulful call to
prayer is as ordinary as the sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   And the daily tide of veiled women and desert tribesmen, and
others in tatters, jeans and the latest designer stuff barely
merits a glance.
</P>
<P>
   Casablanca, which was a small town when the French made it the
commercial capital of their protectorate in 1912, is clearly not
ancient. And it is not entirely Moroccan in body and soul. But none
of that makes it mundane.
</P>
<P>
   It is a whitewashed city of sidewalk cafes and fine restaurants
with bazaars where you can bargain for carpets and hand-painted
plates or just lose yourself among sacks of spices, baked sheep's
heads and Hermes knockoffs. And if you like to rock, Casablanca has
a club for you.
</P>
<P>
   An enduring modern legend is that Bogie never set foot in
Casablanca (the movie was shot in Hollywood). But his latest
biographers, A. Sperber and Eric Lax, say it isn't so. According to
them, Bogie dropped by in 1943, shortly after the Allied landing in
Morocco and the release of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   But there has never been a Rick's. The Hyatt Regency Hotel has
tried, with its Casablanca Bar, a wicker and mahogany refuge with
ceiling fans. But the real Casablanca, just outside, is a lot more
exciting.
 &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Ben M'Sik Theater Festival takes place Sept. 3 to 15, with
companies from 28 countries, including France, Italy and England.
Tickets will range from about $2.35 to $4.70 (at the rate of 8.4
dirham to the dollar), and can be bought at the performance sites,
including the Moulay Rachid Theater, Avenue Akim Allam; phone
(212-2) 70-23-49.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the festival, Dar America, the American cultural
center, at 10 Place Bel-Air, will present two performances of
``Stuff as Dreams Are Made On,'' a one-man adaptation of
Shakespeare's ``Tempest,'' by Fred Curchack, a University of Texas
drama professor. Information: (212-2) 22-14-60.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 9 at 8 p.m., the jazz duo of Tom Wolfe on guitar and
Rick Condit on saxophone will play at La F.O.L. (Lay Charities
Foundation), 16 Avenue Moussa Ibn Noussair, (212-2) 26-67-51.
Condit, a former soloist with the Stan Kenton Orchestra, and Wolfe
are American college professors. Free; contact Dar America.
</P>
<P>
   The WAFA Bank has collected 500 modern Moroccan paintings and
rotates them through the gallery at its headquarters at 163 Avenue
Hassan II. The gallery, which also shows foreign art, is open daily
10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Free.
 &UR; SIGHTSEEING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Art Deco architecture of Casablanca is so plentiful that you
don't have to work at seeing it. A relaxed way to take in some and
enjoy the street life is to stroll east along Mohammed V Boulevard
from the Place des Nations Unies in the heart of the city, by the
Old Medina with its landmark clock tower, wandering off on side
streets when the fancy strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Turn down the Rue Mohammed Qori, for example, and you'll find
the Rialto Theater, whose interior has been renovated in modern
style. It presents first-run films and live performances in its
1,000-seat auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   At the Place Mohammed V, the post office, the police prefecture
and the Palace of Justice are examples of the neo-Mauresque style
of French architects in the 1920s and 1930s, rich with arches,
columns and tiles.
</P>
<P>
   At the north end of the quiet, thickly wooded League of Arab
Nations Park on Boulevard Hachidi is Paul Tornon's Sacred Heart
Cathedral, closed for years, but a towering 1930s Art Deco wonder
of soaring stone spires that El Greco might have dreamed up.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the city's great visual delights is the corniche, the
oceanfront boulevard that looks out on the freighters and derricks
in the port, the remains of an old fortress, the towering Hassan II
Mosque, nightclubs, hotels and miles of beaches and rolling surf.
</P>
<P>
   At the vast, somewhat scruffy public beaches, packed with
humanity, young men gallop along the water's edge chasing soccer
balls. The few women sit together chatting, fully clothed. But at
private beach clubs like the Miami, which charge a few dollars to
enter, the standard is more Monaco than Mecca, and foreigners and
less traditional Arab women take the sun in bikinis by half a dozen
sparkling swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of Casablanca's two main bazaars comes close to the
teeming maze of passageways of the one in Marrakesh, with its snake
charmers and medicine men. But the one in the walled Old Medina,
which dates from the 18th century and is across from the Hyatt
Regency, is a working market with lots of practical goods, like
bargain shirts and shoes, and gives a peek at the daily life of
ordinary Moroccans.
</P>
<P>
   The bazaar in the New Medina, which is merely about 65 years old
and is in the Habous neighborhood, 10 minutes or so by taxi south
of Place des Nations Unies, is a real tourist center, unnaturally
spic and span and orderly, with stacks of brass trays, ceramics and
rugs. It is mostly souvenirs, but some shops offer antique jewelry,
old knives and occasionally, a memorable rug.
</P>
<P>
   One of the complaints about Casablanca is that it has no
museums. But the Hassan II Mosque, opened only five years ago,
comes pretty close to filling that gap. Its angular minaret,
visible throughout the city, soars 60 stories and its interior is a
tour de force of craftsmanship: walls and ceiling covered with
mosaic tiles, intricately carved wood and stucco.
</P>
<P>
   Three-story-high Venetian crystal chandeliers _ among the few
imports in the mosque _ are virtually swallowed up beneath the
180-foot-high vaulted ceiling, one of the high-tech features. It
slides open and, when the wind picks up, the two halves are quietly
closed by computers.
</P>
<P>
   The mosque also shoots a laser beam of light nearly 20 miles
toward Mecca, and has electrically warmed marble floors. There are
several tours daily for visitors.
 &UR; WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Room rates often turn out to be negotiable, and some of the
least expensive hotels are charming.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Idou Anfa, with 220 rooms in plain, European modern,
at 85 Boulevard d'Anfa, (212-2) 20-01-36, fax (212-2) 20-00-09,
makes up in efficiency what it lacks in ambiance. Though the
switchboard is not geared for computers, there is cable television
in every room. Views from the high floors sweep across the city to
the sea. Doubles are $86.
</P>
<P>
   Out at the beach, 15 minutes from downtown, double rooms at the
51-room Hotel de La Corniche, with its angular Art Deco concrete
and marble and gold trim, cost $58; (212-2) 36-10-11, fax (212-2)
39-11-10.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: The Hotel Bellerive, on the ocean drive, a few doors
from Hotel de la Corniche, is an Art Deco gem with 35 commodious
rooms with high ceilings, 14 of them with small sitting areas
looking out to sea over a terrace cafe, a park and a good-sized
pool. Doubles are about $45; (212-2) 39-14-09, fax (212-2)
39-34-93.
</P>
<P>
   Across Place des Nations Unies from the Old Medina is the
80-year-old Hotel Excelsior, at 2 Rue el Amraoui Brahim, (212-2)
20-02-63. It has 60 rooms and a lovely curving stairway leading up
from the dark-wood lobby. The rooms are large and clean, but expect
no frills except breakfast in doubles for $30.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: The Royal Mansour at 27 Avenue de l'Armee Royale,
(212-2) 31-30-12, fax (212-2) 31-48-18, offers spacious doubles
from $225 and a five-room suite from $3,570. Managed by the French
Meridien chain, this 182-room hotel boasts a spectacular arched
entrance, a soaring pillared lounge and mosaic-tiled corridors.
</P>
<P>
   And at the 251-room Hyatt Regency, on the Place des Nations
Unies, (212- 2) 26-12-34, fax (212-2) 22-01-80, doubles start at
about $230. The rooms are big, with contemporary furnishings, and
amenities include a pool and a fitness center.
 &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The best Moroccan food is served in Arabian Nights-style
restaurants, with colorful inlaid tiles, filigreed stucco and,
sometimes, fountains.
</P>
<P>
   Menus feature tagines, stews of lamb or chicken with olives,
prunes, lemons and onions; incredible pastries called pastillas,
stuffed with cinnamon, pigeon and almonds and topped with powdered
sugar; and the national dish, couscous _ steamed cracked-wheat
semolina, usually with raisins and chickpeas, and piled high with
lamb, chicken or vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best of these restaurants is Al-Mounia, at 95 Rue du
Prince Moulay-Abdallah, (212-2) 22-26-69. There, dinner for two
with a bottle of Moroccan wine is about $65.
</P>
<P>
   In the same price range is the excellent Ryad Zitoun, at 31
Boulevard Rachidi, (212-2) 22-39-27. The restaurant features the
simple rose-colored walls typical of Marrakesh rather than the
ornate local style.
</P>
<P>
   For about $45, two can dine on grilled shrimp and fillets of
local fish under the ceiling fans of the Taverne du Dauphin, at 115
Boulevard Houphouet-Boigny, within sight of the main entrance to
the port; (212-2) 27-79-79.
</P>
<P>
   The proprietors of Restaurante Au Petit Poucet, with its white
tablecloths, crystal sconces and gauzy curtains in the shade of one
of the arcaded sidewalks downtown at 86 Boulevard Mohammed V, boast
that Antoine de St.-Exupery was a regular when he flew airmail
around North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   There is a fixed lunch and dinner menu, with soup, a choice of
steak, chicken or fish, dessert and a cocktail for an astounding $9
each; (212-2) 27-54-20.
 &UR; NIGHT LIFE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Things get pretty quiet in downtown Casablanca by 10 p.m. or so.
But the hot spots on the Corniche _ the playground of well-to-do
Moroccans, other Arabs and Europeans _ don't even open until near
midnight. Most nights at most places, the pricey drinks _ $7.50 for
a beer, $11 for the best scotch _ are the only admission charge.
</P>
<P>
   One of the clubs, L'Armstrong, is a paneled and raw-brick,
slightly hard-to-find subterranean room at 41 Boulevard de la
Corniche, (212-2) 39-76-56. The music is rock-n-roll, country,
blues or jazz, whatever the singing manager, Albert Cohen, can
arrange.
</P>
<P>
   The Fandango, at the Rue de la Mer Egee-sur La Corniche, (212-2)
39-85-08, and Le Cafconce, at 10 Rue de la Mer Adriatique, (212-2)
94-42-33, are pleasantly decorated villas with soft lighting and
the easy feel of a friend's home. If Bogie were operating in
Casablanca today, the Fandango might be his place.

   The mosque also shoots a laser beam of light nearly 20 miles
toward Mecca, and has electrically warmed marble floors. There are
several tours daily for visitors.
 &UR; WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Room rates often turn out to be negotiable, and some of the
least expensive hotels are charming.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Idou Anfa, with 220 rooms in plain, European modern,
at 85 Boulevard d'Anfa, (212-2) 20-01-36, fax (212-2) 20-00-09,
makes up in efficiency what it lacks in ambiance. Though the
switchboard is not geared for computers, there is cable television
in every room. Views from the high floors sweep across the city to
the sea. Doubles are $86.
</P>
<P>
   Out at the beach, 15 minutes from downtown, double rooms at the
51-room Hotel de La Corniche, with its angular Art Deco concrete
and marble and gold trim, cost $58; (212-2) 36-10-11, fax (212-2)
39-11-10.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: The Hotel Bellerive, on the ocean drive, a few doors
from Hotel de la Corniche, is an Art Deco gem with 35 commodious
rooms with high ceilings, 14 of them with small sitting areas
looking out to sea over a terrace cafe, a park and a good-sized
pool. Doubles are about $45; (212-2) 39-14-09, fax (212-2)
39-34-93.
</P>
<P>
   Across Place des Nations Unies from the Old Medina is the
80-year-old Hotel Excelsior, at 2 Rue el Amraoui Brahim, (212-2)
20-02-63. It has 60 rooms and a lovely curving stairway leading up
from the dark-wood lobby. The rooms are large and clean, but expect
no frills except breakfast in doubles for $30.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: The Royal Mansour at 27 Avenue de l'Armee Royale,
(212-2) 31-30-12, fax (212-2) 31-48-18, offers spacious doubles
from $225 and a five-room suite from $3,570. Managed by the French
Meridien chain, this 182-room hotel boasts a spectacular arched
entrance, a soaring pillared lounge and mosaic-tiled corridors.
</P>
<P>
   And at the 251-room Hyatt Regency, on the Place des Nations
Unies, (212- 2) 26-12-34, fax (212-2) 22-01-80, doubles start at
about $230. The rooms are big, with contemporary furnishings, and
amenities include a pool and a fitness center.
 &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The best Moroccan food is served in Arabian Nights-style
restaurants, with colorful inlaid tiles, filigreed stucco and,
sometimes, fountains.
</P>
<P>
   Menus feature tagines, stews of lamb or chicken with olives,
prunes, lemons and onions; incredible pastries called pastillas,
stuffed with cinnamon, pigeon and almonds and topped with powdered
sugar; and the national dish, couscous _ steamed cracked-wheat
semolina, usually with raisins and chickpeas, and piled high with
lamb, chicken or vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best of these restaurants is Al-Mounia, at 95 Rue du
Prince Moulay-Abdallah, (212-2) 22-26-69. There, dinner for two
with a bottle of Moroccan wine is about $65.
</P>
<P>
   In the same price range is the excellent Ryad Zitoun, at 31
Boulevard Rachidi, (212-2) 22-39-27. The restaurant features the
simple rose-colored walls typical of Marrakesh rather than the
ornate local style.
</P>
<P>
   For about $45, two can dine on grilled shrimp and fillets of
local fish under the ceiling fans of the Taverne du Dauphin, at 115
Boulevard Houphouet-Boigny, within sight of the main entrance to
the port; (212-2) 27-79-79.
</P>
<P>
   The proprietors of Restaurante Au Petit Poucet, with its white
tablecloths, crystal sconces and gauzy curtains in the shade of one
of the arcaded sidewalks downtown at 86 Boulevard Mohammed V, boast
that Antoine de St.-Exupery was a regular when he flew airmail
around North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   There is a fixed lunch and dinner menu, with soup, a choice of
steak, chicken or fish, dessert and a cocktail for an astounding $9
each; (212-2) 27-54-20.
 &UR; NIGHT LIFE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Things get pretty quiet in downtown Casablanca by 10 p.m. or so.
But the hot spots on the Corniche _ the playground of well-to-do
Moroccans, other Arabs and Europeans _ don't even open until near
midnight. Most nights at most places, the pricey drinks _ $7.50 for
a beer, $11 for the best scotch _ are the only admission charge.
</P>
<P>
   One of the clubs, L'Armstrong, is a paneled and raw-brick,
slightly hard-to-find subterranean room at 41 Boulevard de la
Corniche, (212-2) 39-76-56. The music is rock-n-roll, country,
blues or jazz, whatever the singing manager, Albert Cohen, can
arrange.
</P>
<P>
   The Fandango, at the Rue de la Mer Egee-sur La Corniche, (212-2)
39-85-08, and Le Cafconce, at 10 Rue de la Mer Adriatique, (212-2)
94-42-33, are pleasantly decorated villas with soft lighting and
the easy feel of a friend's home. If Bogie were operating in
Casablanca today, the Fandango might be his place.

 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Over the years, we have spent the year-end holidays sightseeing
London, cruising on board the Mississippi Queen, seeing the
Rockettes perform in New York City and cheering on the Northwestern
Wildcats in Pasadena, Calif., during one of their two Rose Bowl
appearances in half a century. Wherever we go during the holidays,
we find other mature travelers who also choose to celebrate the
season on the road.
 &HT;    The lure of a holiday trip is not the same for everyone. For
some mature travelers, it's a way to let succeeding generations
develop their own Christmas customs. For other travelers, family
members may be few or far-flung.
 &HT;    For especially large families, central destinations such as
Nashville's Opryland can offer a place to gather without hassle or
stress. And, of course, for the inveterate traveler, it's a way to
see favorite places in a new way _ all dressed up for the season.
 &HT;    Now is the time to book holiday tours or cruises. Because of
their growing popularity, people who wait too long to make
reservations are likely to be disappointed.
 &HT;    Travel company catalogs feature holiday tours to places such as
Branson, Mo., San Antonio, Texas, Williamsburg, Va., the Christmas
markets in Germany, San Miguel de Allende, Mexico and Vienna,
Austria. Other possibilities include Kenya wildlife safaris and
Caribbean, Mediterranean or Pacific cruises.
 &HT;    Here is a sampling of great places and tours for your holiday
trip:
 &HT;     _ Saga Holidays,  which packages tours just for those 49-plus,
has a special Christmas in London tour for singles and a Danube
River Christmas cruise. Also on its menu of holiday destinations
are old favorites such as Palm Springs, Calif., and San Antonio,
Texas. Many of its trips do not require a single supplement.
 &HT;    The London tour features a walking tour of Dickensian London,
Christmas Eve with caroling and an evening at the theater. The
price, which includes round-trip airfare, is $2,149 from New York
or $2,349 from San Francisco. For more information, call (800)
343-0273.
 &HT;     _ Holland-America  offers 11 different itineraries for holiday
cruises ranging from seven to 16 days, with new ports of call at
Puerto Quetzal, Guatemala; Hualtulco, Mexico; and Virgin Gorda and
Tortola, British Virgin Islands.

and a visit from Santa. Seven-day Christmas cruises, double
occupancy, start at $1,381. Call your travel agent or

 &HT;     _ Gerhard's Odysseys' annual Christkindles (Christmas) Markets

1998 departure dates _ Nov. 27 and Dec. 4. The price is $1,440 per
person, double occupancy. Call (503) 223-2402 for details.
 &HT;     _ Maupintour's Top 40 Holiday Treats  start in November with
Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade in New York City and conclude with

Newark on Dec. 18 and includes tours of the Jewish Quarter,

 &HT;     _ Sanborn's Viva Motorcoach Tours of Mexico  offer great
variety, from San Miguel de Allende to Oaxaca and Veracruz. Many of
the itineraries are repeated year after year because of their
popularity.
 &HT;    A five-night tour of San Miguel, for example, is offered for the
eighth time this year, departing from Texas' Rio Grande Valley on
Dec. 22. Stops will include San Luis Potosi, Guanajuato and
Matehula as well as San Miguel, where tour-goers will greet

 &HT;    Midway between Richmond and Norfolk, Williamsburg is served by

News. Call (800) 501-0057 for details.

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Walt Disney World in Orlando is the grand prize of American
tourism. But a vacation there does not come cheaply.
 &HT;    Adding up the cost of admission tickets, parking, eating and a
couple of T-shirts, the average family of four can spend $360 per
day in the land of Mickey and Minnie. And that's before factoring
in the cost of hotel accommodation, car rental and air fares.
 &HT;    ``It can be a very expensive vacation,'' says Bob Sehlinger, the
author of ``The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World 1998,''
(Macmillan, 1998; $15.95), a jampacked 742-page bible for
Disney-goers.
 &HT;    ``We're geared for travelers who really want to get their
money's worth,'' he says. ``My average readers are very organized
and button-down. But they're intimidated by the destination. It's
twice as big as Manhattan, with four major theme parks and three
minor ones. They want to be in control before they set foot in the
place.''
 &HT;    Sehlinger, who's been authoring this guide since 1985, has
become an expert on planning a vacation in Walt Disney World. He
extols the merits of traveling during low season, which runs from
September to mid-December, except Thanksgiving.
 &HT;    He ranks all the hotels _ both inside and outside ``the World,''
as it's known. Accommodations outside the park may lack Disney's
magic, he contends, but they almost always give better value.
 &HT;    Sehlinger rates Disney's full-service restaurants. He gives
strategies for those with small children, honeymooners, couples and
single travelers. And he gives specific itineraries for touring
each park within Walt Disney World.
 &HT;    ``Our research methodology is very unique,'' Sehlinger says of
himself and his staff. ``Most of us come from business backgrounds
and about half are MBAs. We use a scientific approach and do
sophisticated survey work. And we've worked on queuing theory.
That's another way of saying that there's got to be a better way to
go through this place than standing in the sun all day.''
 &HT;    Sehlinger's guide is a statistical marvel. He's figured out down
to the minute how to beat the crowds with early admission, how to
cope if a line proves to be too long and when and where to eat.
 &HT;    He's also figured out, based on the number of people standing in
line at a given attraction, how long a wait will be. At ```Honey, I
Shrunk the Kids' Movie Set Adventure Playground,'' a line of 100
people means a 20-minute wait.
 &HT;    At ``New York Street Backlot,'' 100 people in line signifies
almost no wait, because this attraction can process people faster.
 &HT;    ``We had a platoon of researchers with stopwatches who hung out
inconspicuously and monitored line lengths,'' Sehlinger explains.
``We produced flow charts of how the traffic was moving, how it
dispersed and what it did during the course of the day.''
 &HT;    ``We had a test group and a control group who started at the
same time,'' he adds. ``The control group had never been to the
park before and toured according to their own plan. Their only
instruction was to see as much as was humanly possible in a single
day.''
 &HT;    When Sehlinger compared groups, he discovered that on a day when
the park has an average to high attendance of, say, 40,000 people,
the group using his plan at the Magic Kingdom spent three hours and
10 minutes less time standing in line than the other group.
 &HT;    ``People feel a lot of pressure to maximize their time,''
Sehlinger says. ``In some cases, they're almost obsessive about
squeezing value out of their vacation.''
 &HT;    While conceding that having and using such a rigorous plan is
not as necessary in low season, Sehlinger says, ``The bottom line
is that the place is large and overwhelming and Disney is
hyperorganized. If you go, you have to have a plan. If you don't,
whatever spontaneity you have is going to be lost standing in a
line.''
 &HT;    A visit to Disney World with the family is often not a relaxing
vacation. Sehlinger notes that many people tell him they need a
vacation after their vacation to recover.
 &HT;    ``It's important to get your butt out of there during the hot,
crowded part of the day,'' he advises. ``Take a nap, swim, eat.
People think that they have to see a theme park from opening to
closing, and they hit the wall after two or three days. They're
just flat wiped out and not having much fun.''
 &HT;    But for all of Sehlinger's organizing, there are the naysayers _
those who contend that such planning and strategizing are the very
antithesis of a vacation.
 &HT;    Sehlinger admits there are the ``type Bs.''
 &HT;    ``They stop and enjoy the architecture and people-watch,'' he
says. ``They draw the line, no pun intended, at standing in a queue
for hours and hours. That's how my sister goes. She never uses a
plan and she loves the atmosphere. Being there is good enough for
her.''
 &HT;    But for the readers who write to him ``with a certain amount of
rebellion and glee when they circumvent regimentation,''
Sehlinger's book is probably the Disney-goer's best friend.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Walt Disney World in Orlando is the grand prize of American
tourism. But a vacation there does not come cheaply.
 &HT;    Adding up the cost of admission tickets, parking, eating and a
couple of T-shirts, the average family of four can spend $360 per
day in the land of Mickey and Minnie. And that's before factoring
in the cost of hotel accommodation, car rental and air fares.
 &HT;    ``It can be a very expensive vacation,'' says Bob Sehlinger, the
author of ``The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World 1998,''
(Macmillan, 1998; $15.95), a jampacked 742-page bible for
Disney-goers.
 &HT;    ``We're geared for travelers who really want to get their
money's worth,'' he says. ``My average readers are very organized
and button-down. But they're intimidated by the destination. It's
twice as big as Manhattan, with four major theme parks and three
minor ones. They want to be in control before they set foot in the
place.''
 &HT;    Sehlinger, who's been authoring this guide since 1985, has
become an expert on planning a vacation in Walt Disney World. He
extols the merits of traveling during low season, which runs from
September to mid-December, except Thanksgiving.
 &HT;    He ranks all the hotels _ both inside and outside ``the World,''
as it's known. Accommodations outside the park may lack Disney's
magic, he contends, but they almost always give better value.
 &HT;    Sehlinger rates Disney's full-service restaurants. He gives
strategies for those with small children, honeymooners, couples and
single travelers. And he gives specific itineraries for touring
each park within Walt Disney World.
 &HT;    ``Our research methodology is very unique,'' Sehlinger says of
himself and his staff. ``Most of us come from business backgrounds
and about half are MBAs. We use a scientific approach and do
sophisticated survey work. And we've worked on queuing theory.
That's another way of saying that there's got to be a better way to
go through this place than standing in the sun all day.''
 &HT;    Sehlinger's guide is a statistical marvel. He's figured out down
to the minute how to beat the crowds with early admission, how to
cope if a line proves to be too long and when and where to eat.

Sehlinger's book is probably the Disney-goer's best friend.

SILENCE ON CLINTON PUTS WOMEN SENATORS AT RISK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The fallout from President Clinton's extramarital
affair with Monica S. Lewinsky could be radioactive this fall for
Democratic women candidates who, their opponents say, have a double
standard on sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Most vulnerable are Senators Barbara Boxer of California,
Patty Murray of Washington, and Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois,
all first-term members who rode a feminist wave in 1992 after the
Senate's clumsy handling of lawyer Anita Hill's allegations that
Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The three Democrats also vigorously pressed for an
investigation of their Senate colleague, Republican Robert Packwood
of Oregon, who was accused of sexual misconduct by more than a
dozen women. Packwood resigned under fire in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But when President Clinton was sued by Paula Jones for sexual
harassment, the same senators had little or nothing to say. And
when Clinton confessed Aug. 17 that he had a relationship with
Lewinsky, a former White House intern, that was ``not
appropriate,'' Boxer, Murray, and Moseley-Braun expressed sadness
and disappointment but not indignation or outrage.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Now their opponents are starting to exploit what they call the
women's partisan hypocrisy and test it as a campaign weapon.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Barbara, your silence on this issue is deafening,'' Matt
Fong, Boxer's challenger and California's Republican state
treasurer, said Wednesday in the campaign's first face-to-face
debate in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; US Representative Linda Smith, the leading Republican
candidate to oppose Murray on Nov. 3, has called on the president
to resign and has questioned Murray's muted response to the
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Isn't it amazing how Patty Murray has been silent about the
problems of the president?'' Smith asked at a recent GOP picnic in
Washington state. ``She seems to have traded in her tennis shoes
for a pair of Hush Puppies,'' referring to Murray's slogan of being
a ``mom in tennis shoes'' during the 1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The senators have responded, but mostly by trying to change
the subject. Moseley-Braun said she was hurt by the president's
actions but proud of his agenda. Murray said that she was
disappointed Clinton misled the country but that ``there's no one
better when there's a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said that what the president did was wrong, but whether he
sexually harassed the intern was ``a matter for Monica Lewinsky to
state.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Political analysts call the Clinton-Lewinsky affair the ``X''
factor, the big unknown, in the midterm congressional elections.
Even if the impact is small, as Democrats hope, it still could be
the margin of defeat for Boxer, Murray, Moseley-Braun, and other
women who faced tough reelection races even before anybody had
heard of Lewinsky or Linda Tripp, a former friend of the intern who
secretly taped their telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Moseley-Braun, whose term has been dogged by financial and
political controversies, is trailing her opponent, GOP state
Senator Peter Fitzgerald, 46 percent to 39 percent, according to a
recent Chicago Tribune poll. A telling feature of the survey: a
1992 gender gap that helped Moseley-Braun make history by becoming
the first African-American woman in the Senate has disappeared; the
conservative Fitzgerald is more popular than Moseley-Braun with
women.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, whose daughter is married to Hillary Rodham Clinton's
brother, is even with Fong in a recent California Field Poll, with
each receiving 45 percent of the likely vote. Boxer's gender gap is
closing, too; her support from women is half what it was in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being close to Clinton could hurt Barbara Boxer, and having
her opponent hammer on it could have a bit of the effect of tarring
her in a race that is so close,'' said Elizabeth Sherman, director
of the Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy at the
University of Massachusetts in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In Washington state polls, Murray is well ahead of the field,
but party officials there believe the expected Murray-Smith race
will be lively and close.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Democrats' concerns about their women candidates this year go
well beyond the fate of the three senators. First, polls show the
president's popularity is beginning to erode among married,
suburban women, the so-called soccer moms, who view the scandal
more harshly than men. These women contributed heavily to Clinton's
win over Republican Bob Dole in 1996, and they disproportionately
support Democratic women candidates.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Second, the scandal may so disillusion and disgust some
Democrats that they sit out the November elections. A weak
Democratic turnout not only would boost Republican prospects, but
also narrow the gender gap that has helped women in the past three
elections.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Third, women candidates who normally benefit from the
publicity and fund-raising of a presidential visit are seriously
weighing the risks of bringing Clinton into their districts this
fall. Women running on a clean-government, family-friendly agenda
may not be eager to share a podium with a president being pummeled
by press questions about his sex life or details in independent
counsel Kenneth W. Starr's expected report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``I'm anticipating an inside-outside campaign this fall,''
said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst at the Claremont
Graduate University in Claremont, Calif. ``Inside, the president
will go below the radar, raising money for Democrats. Outside,
you'll see Mrs. Clinton, who's now viewed so much more favorably
than her husband.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Gail Riecken, a Democratic US House candidate from Evansville,
Ind., told reporters this week that having the president come to
her district ``is just something I would not even entertain at this
point.'' Riecken, a city councilwoman running against GOP
Representative John Hostettler, already has had the first lady
campaign with her.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Democratic Party line is that the Lewinsky affair won't
resonate beyond the Washington Beltway, and instead, local issues
will dominate campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Devlin, campaign manager for Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat
seeking the nomination for an open House seat in Madison, Wis.,
said questions about Clinton have not come up in candidate forums
or on the stump because voters there aren't obsessed with the
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Alan Secrest, a Democratic consultant, said, ``We're telling
our candidates, `Don't race to the ramparts, do run your own
campaigns, and make it clear that the president did something
wrong, self-indulgent, and selfish.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Democrat Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky said women candidates
must not defend Clinton's behavior, but they also should not
forget, in the hail of Republican attacks, that this administration
has put women first.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the whole picture _ how this president has
empowered women and pushed their issues, like family leave and
child care _ it is very hard for us to turn on him,'' said
Margolies-Mezvinsky, a former congresswoman who is running for
lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania. ``Yes, he's flawed. Yes, he
did something very wrong. But think what the alternative to him
might have meant for women.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Strategically, Republicans can't allow women candidates who
were highly critical of alleged misbehavior by Packwood and Thomas
to ``straddle the fence'' and try to excuse sexual misconduct that
the president has admitted, said Mary Mead Crawford, a spokeswoman
for the National Republican Congressional Committee.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Are these women fair game? You bet,'' Crawford said. ``If
they treat similar situations differently, then they are
hypocrites. At the least, it tells us whether they are speaking
from feminist conviction or a partisan perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Pat Deal, a vice president of the National Women's Political
Caucus, a group that backs liberal women candidates, said the
Republican attacks on women are a ``contorted'' and unfortunate way
to make Clinton an issue in upcoming races.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``To the extent that many women candidates represent family
values and high levels of integrity, this should really be a good
time to elect them,'' said Deal. ``I hate to see this scandal used
as an issue to defeat them.''

WHAT MAKES SKUNKS SMELL SO BAD? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What's in a skunk's juice that makes it smell so bad?
</P>
<P>
   M.L., Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. William Wood, a chemical ecologist at Humboldt State
University in California, risked his nose and the possibility he'd
never be invited to another party to come up with the chemical
formula of skunk spray.
</P>
<P>
   In a word, he says, the answer is thiols.
</P>
<P>
   Wood says the major components of the two or three grams of
spray in a skunk's sac are 2-butene-1-thiol and
3-methyl-1-butanethiol, which consist of sulfur, hydrogen, and
carbon atoms. The sulfur and hydrogen atoms are bonded together.
That explains why eau de skunk is so repugnant.
</P>
<P>
   In our noses, they attach to the same smell receptors we use to
detect a similar chemical, hydrogen sulfide gas _ which we know as
that ``swamp gas'' smell. Hydrogen sulfide is more toxic to mammals
than cyanide, Wood says, so we evolved particularly sensitive
receptors to let us know when it's around.
</P>
<P>
   Skunks learned through evolution that the best defense is a very
offensive offense. ``The `go away' message is very profound,'' Wood
says. We can smell it at concentrations as low as 10 parts per
billion.
</P>
<P>
   In high concentrations it can bring on vomiting or even cause
the victim to lose consciousness; sprayed in the eye, it's like
tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Skunk spray has never been known to be fatal, though it can
certainly kill your friends' desire to be anywhere near you.
</P>
<P>
   Thiols are not volatile, which means they don't evaporate
quickly. That's why the smell lasts so long. Secondary chemicals in
the spray break down into thiols in the presence of water, so
washing actually makes things worse.
</P>
<P>
   If you're sprayed, the best way to get rid of the smell, Wood
suggests, is to change the chemical composition of those stinky
thiols with the following solutions:
</P>
<P>
   For pets, mix a quart of 3-percent hydrogen peroxide (from the
pharmacy), a quarter-cup cup of baking soda, and a teaspoon of
liquid detergent. Your brown-haired beagle may turn into a bleached
blond from the peroxide, but at least he won't smell.
</P>
<P>
   For you: same formula. Same warning about bleaching your hair.
</P>
<P>
   For clothes: one cup of bleach per gallon of wash water.
</P>
<P>
   The folk remedy of tomato juice doesn't really remove the smell.
It overpowers it after your smell receptors become overloaded with
thiols, so you end up smelling the tomato juice. Eau de skunk is
still there.
</P>
<P>
   Your best bet is to avoid being sprayed in the first place. Stay
at least 15 feet from any skunk you happen upon. That's safely out
of their range.
</P>
<P>

KILLER II, OR MERELY A COPYCAT?
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Should the cat be cloned? I'm weighing the pros and cons. Now
that Killer is well into his golden years, I'm forced to imagine
life without him, a prospect I prefer not to dwell upon, but one
that's inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes news that a wealthy California couple plans to give
$2.3 million to livestock cloning experts at Texas A&AMP;M University
to clone their 11-year-old mixed-breed dog, Missy. According to a
story in Friday's Globe, the Missyplicity project, if successful,
would ``tap into the yearnings of less well-heeled pet owners,''
some of whom have written to an Internet site saying they plan to
freeze their aged or dying animals in hopes that cloning will
eventually be available ``at Wal-Mart prices.''
</P>
<P>
   I understand how they feel. In this uncertain world, the one
thing you can be sure of is the constant devotion of a pet.
Actually, in my case, it's more a case of the pet being sure of the
constant devotion of a human, but it really amounts to much the
same thing. It means the world to me, this bond that Killer and I
have forged during the 16 years in which I have been his devoted
servant.
</P>
<P>
   I think of all the little things Killer and I share. Reading him
his horoscope every day (he's an Aries). Cooking his favorite
shrimp and asparagus. Cleaning up after him. Killer has taught me
the rewards of service. He keeps me humble, not that I could be
otherwise with the legacy of ancestral guilt I've been handed. But
if ever there was a chance that something would go to my head,
Killer is always there to remind me not to get above myself.
</P>
<P>
   Every human-animal relationship is different. There were other
cats in my life, and there will be more. In fact, there already are
other cats. But my relationship with Killer is special. It's
tempting to think of having a replica of him after he's gone.
Certainly not before he's gone. He wouldn't stand for it.
</P>
<P>
   Cloning is still in the experimental stages. According to a
recent Chicago Tribune story, even if scientists eventually iron
out all the kinks, cloning won't produce exact copies of the
original. Each clone will have its own personality, shaped by its
own experience. I could get a Killer clone who wouldn't claw the
furniture to shreds, which would be no Killer at all.
</P>
<P>
   Cloning him would amount to an act of hubris. I'd be tempting
fate, asking for trouble. I'm reminded of the sort of expectant
parents who anticipate a child that will combine all their own best
features and instead produce a little stranger as imperfect as they
are, but in different and sometimes maddening ways. I'm not trying
to draw a parallel between creating a baby and cloning a cat, so
don't take offense. I'm just pointing out that reproduction is
always unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   A Killer clone would be a conversation piece. And he'd provide
column fodder. Cloning would eliminate the heart-rending process of
deciding which cat to adopt. There are so many pets waiting for
homes. What's the point of cloning more? The California couple
could better spend their millions on curbing animal overpopulation
and taking care of homeless animals. But I understand what drives
them to spend millions trying to clone Missy. Love sometimes leads
us to do strange things.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I have to ask myself if Killer would want to be
cloned. I don't think he would. He takes a dim view of other cats.
He'd be offended by the notion that a clone of himself would
replace the original in my affections. I'm sure he'd prefer that I
acquire another cat after he's gone, a very different cat who will
remind me, every day, of how lucky I was to live for so many years
with the best cat ever.

BROTHER OF SHOOTING VICTIM BLAMES JOHNNY RODRIGUEZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 BY KATE HUNDER and WILEY ALEXANDER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The brother of the man shot to death in the house
country singer Johnny Rodriguez was living in said he doesn't
believe a defense attorney's account that his brother was mistaken
for an intruder.
</P>
<P>
   Israel Borrego, 26, died early Saturday after being shot once in
the abdomen in Rodriguez's mother's house in Sabinal, a small South
Texas farming community about 60 miles west of San Antonio, where
the singer grew up and still has family.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was charged with murder after reporting a shooting
shortly after 4 a.m. at the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to get out of it,'' Israel's brother, Meliton
Borrego, said of Rodriguez in a telephone interview Sunday
afternoon. ``I know he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez remained in Uvalde County Jail on Sunday in lieu of
posting a $250,000 bond. His attorney, Alan Brown of San Antonio,
said he would seek a bond hearing today for the singer.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has said Israel Borrego, an acquaintance of the singer's,
was in the house uninvited. He said Rodriguez fired a shot when he
entered the house and saw an intruder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was startled,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   But Meliton Borrego said he isn't satisfied with the
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and his brother have known Rodriguez, 46, all their
lives and had begun spending time together in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was upset by the way Brown described events leading
up the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who's known Rodriguez for 20 years and has represented
him in the past, said his client's actions were justifiable under
the Texas Penal Code.
</P>
<P>
   He said Rodriguez walked across the street from his brother's
house early Saturday morning to check on his mother's house, where
he had been staying.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said although Borrego and Rodriguez knew each other,
Borrego had been told for at least a month before the shooting he
wasn't welcome at the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not supposed to be in the house,'' Brown said. ``He was
not an invited guest.''
</P>
<P>
   But Meliton Borrego said he wasn't aware of any disagreement
between the two men or of any request that his brother stay away
from the Rodriguez home.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he's visited Rodriguez in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is terrible, but he was doing as good as you could expect
under the circumstances,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny really should have gotten a personal recognizance
bond,'' Brown said, adding, ``I don't think there's any question
Johnny Rodriguez is going to show up in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Uvalde County District Attorney Tony Hackebeil said a grand jury
already scheduled to convene in Uvalde on Thursday could take
Rodriguez's case if the investigation is far enough along.
</P>
<P>
   Hackebeil said he isn't motivated by Rodriguez's celebrity to
speed the case along and will treat it like any other case.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's known Rodriguez for years and may have played in a
band that opened for Rodriguez's act years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will probably be some information coming out that will
put this in a different light than Mr. Brown has,'' Hackebeil said.
</P>
<P>
   Sabinal police wouldn't discuss the case Sunday, citing an
ongoing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Bexar County Medical Examiner performed an autopsy on
Borrego but results were unavailable Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Meliton Borrego said his family and Sabinal residents are
pitching in to help his brother's widow pay for funeral expenses.
He said his brother has a 7-year-old son and a young daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like a father to my brother,'' Meliton Borrego said,
adding he stepped in to fill his father's shoes after his death
several years ago. Meliton is the oldest of five brothers and
sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother was always helping me out,'' Meliton Borrego said.
``He liked to drink, though. He liked to party.''
</P>
<P>
   Meliton Borrego said funeral plans tentatively are set for
Wednesday at the Sabinal Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   The two brothers had been planning to play in a softball
tournament Sunday, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several local radio disc jockeys said they will
continue playing Rodriguez's music, which include the 1972 hit
``Pass Me By'' and ``I Didn't (Every Chance I Had),'' recorded in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to continue playing Johnny's records,'' said
Jerry King, program director of San Antonio's KKYX-AM Radio. ``I
believe and feel our listeners believe that a man is innocent until
proven guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Laughlin, owner of Floore's Country Store in Helotes, has
Rodriguez booked for Nov. 14 and isn't canceling the date.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's waiting to see what happens,'' said C.B. Laughlin, the
owner's father, ``''but, as of now, the show is still on.''

<P>
   And Merante notes that there are some benefits to being an
openly gay candidate. ``It can be easier to raise money and recruit
volunteers, and a more moderate candidate can gain support among
some liberal non-gay voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Money, obviously, plays an important role in campaigns. And in
California, San Diego City Councilor Christine Kehoe, a
congressional candidate and lesbian, had raised $705,624 through
the end of June, as compared with GOP incumbent Brian Bilbray's
$650,123, according to Federal Election Commission figures.
</P>
<P>
   That cash is expected to give Kehoe _ the Democratic nominee _ a
strong chance to become the first openly gay woman elected to
national office. It is a title that Tracy would like, as would
Tammy Baldwin, in Wisconsin, or retired Army Colonel Margarethe
Cammermeyer in Washington, who was discharged from the military in
1992 after saying she was a lesbian. Both are running for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other congressional candidates, they are offering
themselves as candidates who happen to be gay, not gay candidates.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1974 _ the year after the American Psychiatric Association
erased homosexuality from its compendium of mental illnesses _
Elaine Noble, openly gay, was elected to the Massachusetts
Legislature. She is believed to have been the first openly gay
person ever elected to a state office anywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there has been a trickle of openly gay candidates,
and more like Frank, who ``came out'' after serving in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any minority that feels oppressed is going to be more
politicized than the mainstream,'' says Merante. ``Issues such as
family life, taxes, and inheritance are problems if you are gay and
tend to make people think and act politically.''
</P>
<P>
   But one reason for the gay community's relatively quick fluency
in politics is AIDS, say gay activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIDS brought gay people to the fore like no other thing had,''
says Mary Bonauto, civil rights director for Gay and Lesbian
Advocates and Defenders. ``The community was ravaged and had to
come out to their families, interact with the medical system in a
way they had not before. Doctors and nurses saw committed, caring
relationships between men, people caring for their partners to
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank says he doubts he would have won his tough first election
if he had announced in 1980 that he was gay. But, he says, the more
that people come out, the more it diminishes prejudices. ``It is a
very powerful force, a very successful reality check, and the
average American is a lot less homophobic that he or she thinks
they are supposed to be,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the double-digit number of gay candidates in
Massachusetts is that it is, well, Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   According to Victory Fund, there are 12 openly gay elected
officeholders in the state, from municipal officials in Cambridge
and Northampton to state Representative Liz Malia and Frank. It is
the highest number of gay officeholders, per capita, in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gay and lesbian candidates feel they no longer have to hide in
the closet, especially within the Commonwealth,'' says Dana
Hilliard, a candidate from Newburyport running for a state
legislative seat. ``It is a sign of how accepting this state is.''
Hilliard has served three terms as a state representative in New
Hampshire _ but when he campaigned in the Granite State, he was not
open about his sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   And Miller says that ``Massachusetts is a special case; the
political atmosphere here is more open. Michael Duffy is running on
the Republican ticket'' for state auditor. In fact, the only other
Republican candidate in either the Massachusetts or congressional
races who is openly gay, is US Representative Jim Kolbe, of
Arizona. Like Frank, Kolbe announced his sexual orientation after
several terms in office.
</P>
<P>
   Miller also credits former Governor William Weld, a Republican
who supported the gay movement, with helping make Massachusetts a
more tolerant state.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was working on `In Search of Gay America,' I went to
Mississippi to interview a gay Republican, and when word got out
that he might be gay, he withdrew from the race,'' recalls Miller.
``Almost all of these people are Democrats, and that is really
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Goshko, the local president of the Log Cabin, an
organization of gay Republicans, notes that recruiting candidates _
gay or straight _ to run for office has been harder for Republicans
than Democrats. ``In Massachusetts, the Democratic Party has much
higher registration, and recruiting GOP candidates has been a
general problem,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, Goshko says, ``This is the year that the
floodgates have opened for gay candidates. Until this year really,
fairly few people would run.''
</P>
<P>
   What does Noble, the pioneer in 1974, think about the number of
candidates?
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand,'' she says, ``it surprises me there are so
many, and on the other, it saddens me there are so few. And it is
sad that folks say `You are gay' before they say `What are your
stands on the issues?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I feel like a grandmother sitting off in the
corner, clucking. Win, lose, or show, they do advance issues
tremendously, and they are all smart and bright. Even if they come
in last, they have won by being there.''

THE BLACKLISTING OF STEVEN EMERSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To journalists of integrity, blacklist is the vilest word in the
dictionary. Nothing corrupts a free press like conspiring to
silence a man. And when the conspiracy results from arm-twisting by
extremists, it is not only corrupting, but cowardly.
</P>
<P>
   This is a story of blacklisting at National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 20, NPR's popular ``Talk of the Nation'' dealt with
breaking news: the US raids on Osama bin Laden's terror facilities
in Sudan and Afghanistan. One of several guests interviewed by
telephone was Steven Emerson, an investigative journalist and a
leading expert on Islamic fundamentalist terrorism. Emerson has
reported in detail on Islamic extremism, and has focused public
attention on the network of terror cells and front groups operating
in the United States. His 1994 television documentary ``Jihad in
America'' won some of journalism's most coveted awards, and he has
repeatedly been invited to testify before Congress on Islamic
violence and US counterterrorist policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be,'' the FBI's former assistant director of
counterterrorism has written, ``that Mr. Emerson is actually better
informed in some areas than the responsible agencies of
government.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, Emerson was an ideal guest for NPR's show, and his
brief on-air conversation with host Melinda Penkava was
unobjectionable.
</P>
<P>
   Unobjectionable, that is, to anyone except the Islamic
terrorists and their supporters whom Emerson has done so much to
expose. In recent years, he has been the target of a brutal
campaign of vilification and defamation. The Council on American
Islamic Relations _ a radical group that warmly defends Hamas and
other terror outfits _ has led the way in demonizing Emerson as an
anti-Arab racist.
</P>
<P>
   CAIR's world view is simple: Criticism of anything linked to
even the most fanatic wings of Islam is bigotry. (For example, it
labeled a ``hate crime'' the arrest of Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman,
ringleader of the World Trade Center bombing.) Its approach to
press relations is also simple: Deluge media outlets with protests,
invective, and cries of ``racism!'' when they publish or broadcast
stories unflattering to Islamic extremists.
</P>
<P>
   Because Emerson has shed so much light on the operations of
these zealots, his appearance drives them into a particular froth.
Right after his NPR interview, CAIR urged its adherents to go on
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   One of the many attackers was Ali Abunimah, a leader of the
Chicago-based Arab American Action Network. Judging by its web
site, the AAAN's chief project is condemning ``the genocidal
policies of the US government toward the people of Iraq.'' But
Abunimah has a pet project of his own: Lobbying NPR to blacklist
Steven Emerson.
</P>
<P>
   In June, he e-mailed NPR's news division to say he was
``horrified'' that Emerson had been used in a story on Mohammad
Salah, a reputed Hamas fund-raiser. Emerson is an anti-Arab bigot,
he said _ witness his comment in April 1995 that the Oklahoma City
bombing bore ``a Middle Eastern trait.'' It was intolerable to
``have to listen to such a blatant, sickening racist.'' Abunimah
demanded that NPR ``not allow this to happen to Arabs ... again.''
</P>
<P>
   He pressed his vendetta up and down the NPR food chain: To the
network's national news editor, Michael Fields; to the general
manager of the affiliate that had produced the story; to Jackie
Northam, who had reported it; to Loren Jenkins, NPR's foreign
editor. The network caved. Fields assured him that quoting Emerson
had been a ``mistake'' and that ``it won't happen again'' _ i.e.,
that Emerson would be blacklisted.
</P>
<P>
   But on Aug. 20, Emerson appeared on ``Talk of the Nation.''
Livid, Abunimah fired an e-mail to Ellen Silva, TOTN's producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am shocked and disappointed,'' he wrote, ``that TOTN had
Steven Emerson on its call-in show today as a guest. Mr. Emerson is
a well-documented anti-Arab, anti-Muslim racist. When he was last
on NPR on June 24, in a report by Jackie Northam, there was a
public outcry.... This should not have happened again .... Last
time, I accepted the explanation that it had been an innocent
error. But how many errors can be innocent? This is a very serious
matter and will require an appropriate response.''
</P>
<P>
   Abjectly, NPR caved again. The following exchange ensued.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin itals) &QL; 
 &QL; 
From: Ellen Silva &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thank you for your letter.
</P>
<P>
   Our executive producer was in charge of that decision _ not me.
I take your point and extend an apology to you from the staff of
TOTN.
</P>
<P>
   Please take care,
</P>
<P>
   Ellen
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
From: Ali Abunimah &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thank you for your response. Who is the executive producer of
TOTN? Have you forwarded my concerns to him or her? Other than an
apology, which we received previously, what assurance can I have
that this won't happen again?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufdots &LR;
</P>
<P>
   From: Ellen Silva
</P>
<P>
   I have forwarded your concerns to him. You have my promise he
won't be used again.
</P>
<P>
   It is NPR policy.
</P>
<P>
   E
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NPR's obsequious surrender speaks for itself. That an expert who
testifies before Congress would be barred from the airwaves of the
radio network Congress subsidizes is too scandalous to need
elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to add only that, late last week, I learned of the
Abunimah-Silva correspondence and asked NPR to explain its
blacklist policy. Silva retracted everything. ``I was wrong to use
the word `policy,''' she said. ``I misspoke. We don't have a policy
on Steven Emerson.'' I asked several times why NPR was repudiating
its words. Silva declined to answer.

ACADEMICS WORLDWIDE ANALYZE PRINCESS DIANA'S LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Her fairy-tale-turned-sour spawned made-for-TV movies, tabloid
obsession and tears around the world. And in death, Diana, the
princess of Wales, has spawned something else: an academic frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   At the one-year anniversary of her death at age 36, Diana is
being awarded status the academy more commonly accords to figures
like Ernest Hemingway and Abraham Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   She has been the subject of at least 15 conferences worldwide,
including one at the London School of Economics, arrayed with
figures as giant as Henry James and Thomas Jefferson, and the topic
of monographs with such titles as ``Diana and the Fantasy of
Ordinary Suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   So fast have scholars around the world developed the field, in
fact, that they are already postulating the revisionist perspective
on Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say this is the ivory tower stooping to remain relevant,
in an age when American colleges offer courses on the Geography in
Jimmy Buffett Music and The Psychology of Weight Lifting. But
scholars say it is hardly surprising that someone hounded by the
paparazzi would now be deconstructed by academicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a history of studying the communicators who became
well-known since the classical period in Greece,'' insists Dr.
James Golden, a former professor at Ohio State University and a
member of the President's Commission on Thomas Jefferson. ``If you
can analyze the message, analyze the audience, then you've got
something worth an academic assignment, no question. I have no
problem looking upon it as an academic exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither, apparently, do many scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Using television ratings to estimate that one-third the world's
population ``connected'' with Diana's death, Boston's Emerson
College has sponsored a trilogy of conferences under the title,
``The Global Rhetorical Phenomenon of Diana, Princess of Wales.''
At the second, conducted in French in Paris at the six-month mark
in late January, scholars debated such propositions as ``Diana is
not dead because she never `existed.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the third conference, held at the ivy-covered University of
London last week, academics from Britain, Australia, and the United
States discussed her effect on the monarchy, Diana as a feminist
icon, and the ethics of using her as poster princess for seat-belt
safety campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   They dissected the significance of ``Dianaiana'' _ a term coined
to describe everything from the tea towels that commemorated her
wedding to her biographies, which one scholar numbered at 175.
</P>
<P>
   While they insisted that tabloids were not invited, the
organizers apparently could not resist a few tabloid aspects. There
were special presentations by the doctor who treated Diana, her
lover's former butler, and the first British reporter to confirm
her death, as well as a special ``artistic salute'' by singer Jose
Feliciano.
</P>
<P>
   But why all this scholarly attention to Diana, a woman, as one
scholar sniffed, ``whose highest aspiration was to dance with John
Travolta''?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a characteristic of our time, when everything is so
concentrated in time because of the media, that things are
immediately processed,'' said Rabbi Howard A. Berman, who traveled
from Worcester to attend the conference. ``The modern intellectual
approach is far more immediate than the past, where someone had to
be dead for 50 years before you took them seriously. I don't think
that's true anymore, and I think we're the better for it.''
</P>
<P>
   As has been said so many times in this anniversary week,
scholars say Diana inspires inquiry because she related to so many
people on so many different issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you have popular figures who provide a meaning or a
case study of a theory you might be advocating, so that figure
becomes useful to discussions of those issues,'' said Gregory
Payne, a professor of communication at Emerson. ``So if you have,
say, a feminist perspective, you can take her strong stand against
Charles, her strong stand against the monarchy and make her a
feminist icon. She becomes relevant to discussions of feminist
theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Women to whom Diana is frequently compared _ Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis or Mother Teresa _ did not draw the same inquiry, Golden
says, because they did not champion as many issues _ or,
practically speaking, appear in so many photographs.
</P>
<P>
   They also did not draw so much controversy. And as the life of
Diana had its controversies _ from her days as nursery school
teacher to her frolics with Dodi Fayed in the Mediterranean _ so
does the scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially there was the rush to sainthood,'' Payne said. ``Now
we have voices of revision, questioning whether the outpouring of
grief was appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   But the revisionists are in for a fight with the hard-core
Dianaianaists.
</P>
<P>
   Their latter-day skepticism ``smacks of elitist snobbery and
ivory tower arrogance,'' Berman said. ``She was a major cultural,
social phenomenon in late 20th century life, and it's very
appropriate that she is the subject of serious inquiry.''

   WASHINGTON Trent Lott started it back in March. He got no
bandwagon rolling _ the Senate majority leader rarely does _ but
the idea of Congress officially condemning President Clinton's
behavior, assuming it doesn't include an actual and proved abuse of
his office such as obstruction of justice, has hung around.
</P>
<P>
   Even now it is not gaining ground, but it has gained some
attention. It deserves to gain more as long as various carts are
not placed before various horses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the somewhat increased level of attention for
what shorthand is calling a ``censure'' of Clinton, what I find
most interesting is that the topic is being discussed way up the
president's chain of command. That's far from official, or even an
indication of his own views, but it is plenty interesting, and
trial balloons have flown with a lot less helium than that.
</P>
<P>
   From this perspective, censure stinks if by that is meant a
distinct measure drafted and approved by both houses of Congress.
But there are other ways of skinning the same cat.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the only use of censure on a president in
American history left an aroma that is still around. In 1834, a
Whig-controlled Senate formally censured President Andrew Jackson
for a controversial use of power regarding a giant bone of
contention in those days, the national bank. Jackson rightly
accused his Whig opponents of lacking the guts to impeach him, and
when they lost the Senate two years later, the censure was promptly
withdrawn. No one has seriously attempted such a stunt since.
</P>
<P>
   For another, a motion of censure would set weird, if not bad,
precedents. Since the grounds would presumably be an appalling
sexual liaison with a young woman and an effort to keep it secret
that included lying to the public, the question would arise whether
that is the standard that Congress means to set for such an action.
What about other presidential lies, for example, and what about
other examples of lies with huge public consequences (like the
Vietnam War) that get de facto grandfather status?
</P>
<P>
   There's still a way, however. The independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, is finally on the verge of presenting evidence to the House
of Representatives. Assuming for discussion that there is no
direct, dramatic, and unquestionable proof of obstruction or
subornation of perjury that could overcome the public's
overwhelming antipathy to further proceedings, Congress, even
though it doesn't have to, could vote to ``accept'' Starr's report.
And in the measure accepting Starr's report, it could include
language condemning the president's behavior. That limits it to
this case.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage is that it would give official voice to genuine
feelings of horror and worse that people have about Clinton's
admitted conduct.
</P>
<P>
   It is still early for this, though not too early to have a few
decent ideas on the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the president remains in seclusion with his
family, a delicate and properly private process that must still be
resolved before anything else matters. Clinton may need a similar
process to see if he can repair relations with his official and
political families.
</P>
<P>
   He will also need to say more to the public than he did last
week to truly deliver the three Cs his chief of staff, Erskine
Bowles, falsely advertised that the president's brief speech was
about to deliver _ confession, contrition, and closure.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest short-term cost of those remarks was the anger of
the very Republicans poised to try to find a way past this mess _
Orrin Hatch in the Senate and Henry Hyde, the Judiciary Committee
chairman, in the House _ who have said Congress should not even
proceed toward an inquiry into possible impeachment on the sole
basis of a sex and sex-lies case.
</P>
<P>
   That stance, if maintained, would probably split Republicans,
many of whom insist that the president go or be tossed out of
office. Even those leaders who have no stomach for a sex-based case
_ like Newt Gingrich himself and chairman Gerald Solomon of the
Rules Committee _ talk of expanding a Starr report on the Monica
Lewinsky affair into a reinvestigation of everything the prosecutor
has already investigated in his four-plus year, even if he has
found no evidence of impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Out of respect for the public's views and to avoid that kind of
madness, this may be a matter that cries out for responsible
settlement, unless the pure facts in Starr's report clearly
indicate otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   But first we all need a signal from the first family. In one of
the least-noticed, most direct sections of his speech, the
president said, ``I must put it right, and I am prepared to do
whatever it takes to do so.''

A CASE FOR ASSASSINATION? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ Here's an unusual way to make America a kinder
and gentler superpower: legalize assassination.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Make it OK to knock off outlaws beyond our
borders.
</P>
<P>
   Before dismissing the controversial idea, consider the cruel
irony of the rules that exist today. The Pentagon can rain cruise
missiles on known terrorist camps and factories _ as it did 10 days
ago _ killing and injuring any innocent people who happen to be in
the wrong place. And yet, because of an executive order signed by
President Reagan, the US government cannot hunt down and kill a
terrorist, mass murderer, or war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   That means Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of bombings that have
killed hundreds of people, is off-limits unless he has the bad luck
to be at a site that is bombed. And it means that Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein cannot be targeted, even though he tried to
assassinate former president George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is it possible to say that we can justify actions (in
which) innocent people inevitably get killed, instead of going
after someone who has openly declared war on us and is personally
responsible for killing Americans?'' asks L. Paul Bremer III, who
was Reagan's chief of counter-terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Bremer first proposed ending the assassination ban a decade ago,
while testifying before Congress. Since the twin bombings of US
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, he has stepped up his rhetoric. We
live in a turbulent world where the old rules of conventional
warfare no longer hold, he reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In its pursuit of bad guys around the world, Washington relies
on the courts of other countries, or on extraditions, or, as a last
resort, on attacks of safe houses and terrorist camps. But all
those measures have flaws.
</P>
<P>
   American drug enforcement agents amassed overwhelming evidence
that Pablo Escobar and other drug barons had killed US citizens in
the 1980s and early '90s. Jail? Escobar and his associates made a
mockery of Colombia's justice system by murdering, threatening, and
paying off prosecutors and judges. Extradition? The drug lords
didn't like the prospect of trials in the United States, so they
bullied and bought off a constitutional convention to do away with
extradition. Attacks? Even though American officials often knew
Escobar's whereabouts, they could not bomb Colombia, a friendly
country. So they sat and stewed for years, until Escobar died in a
shootout with police.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the US response to the car bomb that blew up at a
Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983, killing 241 Americans. US forces
fired into the mountains of Lebanon, even though that was not a
hiding place of the Shiite Muslims of the Islamic Jihad, who had
claimed responsibility for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In such attacks, innocent civilians become ``collateral
damage.'' And that raises the question of whether a selective
assassination policy might be more effective, and even more humane,
in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   But even backers of allowing assassinations don't propose giving
US agents free rein. Bremmer, for one, wants checks and balances.
Just as the Pentagon has to have a sound reason to launch a strike,
a president should have a finding, or some other legal document,
before deciding on an assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just have the president blithely signing orders to
kill people,'' Bremer says.
</P>
<P>
   But backers of assassination haven't gotten a ringing
endorsement from the Congress, the Clinton administration, or
scholars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interesting,'' a White House official said when told of the
suggestion. As he thought aloud, though, his interest quickly
cooled. This country is the leading target for terrorists, he said,
so America's enemies would say, ``If they can assassinate our
leaders, we can assassinate theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Harvard Law School, professor Ann-Marie Slaughter, an
expert on international law, sees a deeper moral reason for banning
assassinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, you'd be saying it's all right to kill an
individual without judicial process,'' Slaughter says. ``But that's
a violation of a core tenet of the world's great legal systems and
religions, which all have a prohibition of extradicial killings.''
</P>
<P>
   A bedrock belief of the American system is that a suspect of a
crime is entitled to a trial to confront his accusers and see the
evidence. Intelligence data, which is used to track terrorists
across borders, is not subject to scrutiny or cross-examination,
Slaughter says.
</P>
<P>
   Jeswald Salacuse, a professor of international law at the
Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, cautions against any move to
get rid of the executive order. ``There's a hysteria building in
this country that says we are threatened from all over and anything
goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, both Slaughter and Salacuse concede that it's easy to sit
on a campus and denounce assassinations as immoral. Real life
offers examples that beg for an exception. What if Hitler was alive
and committing genocide today? Under the assassination ban,
President Clinton would not be allowed to order US troops or
intelligence officers _ or even foreign mercenaries _ to poison or
shoot Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Larry Johnson, the State Department's former
counterterrorism director, says the assassination ban at least
ought to be modified. The US government should be allowed to kill a
malevolent foreign leader if war has been declared, Johnson says.
He calls that the ``Hitler option.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the ``janitors' option'': If someone has murdered
or consipired to murder US citizens and is beyond the reach of law
enforcement, he's fair game. ``Otherwise we end up launching a
nighttime strike on a weapons plant that guarantees we are going to
kill janitors and cleaning ladies, not the people who planned the
operation,'' Johnson says.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, US presidents will continue to deal with the
executive order as they have in the past: by obeying it and yet
ignoring it. An aide to a Republican senator who is an expert in
military affairs explained that the Pentagon has not technically
tried to assassinate anyone, but it has targeted missiles at the
hiding places of bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, and other pariahs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they happen to be in the way,'' the aide said, ``then no
executive order is going to protect them.''

WHEN THE HYPE REIGNS, THE ISSUES GET LOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagese of hysterical parents, baby-faced suspects and
schoolhouse carnage have dominated the news for much of this year.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed one horrifying incident followed another. The shooting
of students by a classmate at a high school in West Paducah, Ky.,
was followed by similar shootings at schools in Mississippi,
Arkansas, and Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they triggered a bout of national soul-searching: ``As
the U.S. witnesses the latest school shooting, can anything be
learned _ or done?,'' asked Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Congress called for tougher juvenile crime laws. President
Clinton went to Worcester Thursday to tout new ways to help
educators identify potentially violent pupils. He'll convene a
conference on the topic this fall.
</P>
<P>
   It would probably surprise most people to learn that the number
of children killed in schools actually declined during the last
three years, compared with the period three years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case, the hype has overshadowed the facts, or at
least the context, in this high-profile story. The problem is not
new _ it happened in the spring and summer of 1996 when black
churches were burning in the south _ and it's not confined to
institutions. For example, a recent flurry of concern about
increasing ``road rage'' has little basis in statistical fact.
</P>
<P>
   Although the school violence story is not the only one in which
a series of events were joined together to represent what was
represented to be a meaningful trend, it is an unusually good
illustration of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Many people have come to think of schools as unsafe. But the 40
children killed by guns in schools during the 1997-1998 school year
are a small fraction of the 3,024 children who die from gunfire
each year.
</P>
<P>
   Further, children are 23 times more likely to be killed in a gun
accident than in a school shooting and 90 percent of all juvenile
murders occur at home, according to the Justice Policy Institute, a
Washington D.C., think tank that studies juvenile crime.
</P>
<P>
   For added perspective, the institute reports the number of
children killed by gun violence in schools is about half the number
of Americans killed by lightning every year.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the school shootings, a series of anecdotes
conspired to become the ``truth'' _ a truth that helped drive the
debate about how to respond to these violent attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Media coverage of these dramatic killings has created a
misperception that schools are dangerous,'' said Vincent Schiraldi,
the director of the Justice Policy Institute. ``In fact, schools
are still the safest place in America for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's the harm with a little media hype? Plenty, says Jason
Ziedenberg, one of the authors of the school report.
</P>
<P>
   Ziedebnberg doesn't criticize the media for covering the
shootings, only for covering the events without context.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put it in perspective because the consequences and policies
being thrown about were disconcerting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The saturation coverage and linking of the school shootings
created an overblown response that threatens to divert resources
and attention from issues that pose a greater threat to children,
warns Ziedenberg.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, the governor proposed reducing the number of
after-school athletic events after a nonfatal shooting in Richmond.
FBI data, however, show that one in five violent crimes committed
by children occur in the hours immediately after the end of the
school day. In many urban areas, schools remain a safer alternative
to the street in the hours following the end of classroom
instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating after-school programs, argues Ziedenberg, would
actually increase the threat of violence against children.
</P>
<P>
   The well-publicized school shootings also prompted a national
crackdown on misbehaving students _ with sanctions that may have
once been perceived as unduly harsh.
</P>
<P>
   In Tyrone, Ga., two elementary school students were suspended
for composing a list of people they wanted to harm. Among the
targeted victims were the Spice Girls and Barney the dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of increasing the number of police in schools and
instituting harsher sanctions against children, the institute urges
the expansion of after-school programs and restricting the mass
sale of guns.
</P>
<P>
   Ziedenberg said both sides of the political spectrum attempted
to use the school shootings to push their own agenda _ from
conservative US Senator Orin Hatch, a Utah Republican, to the gun
control lobby. The saturation media coverage urged them on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that more media leads to these kinds of
pile-ons,'' he said. ``Crime is cheap to cover. There is a drama
unfolding with a cast of characters. There are plenty of people to
book and everyone is suddenly an expert on why this kid went crazy.
It goes on and on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, this year's new interest in ``road rage.'' Many of the
stories reported an upsurge, or even epidemic, in the numbers and
intensity of aggressive drivers.
</P>
<P>
   In this month's Atlantic Monthly, writer Michael Fumento
deconstructs the road rage phenomenon and finds the use of the
phrase by the media has skyrocketed while federal transportation
records reveal a different story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Headlines notwithstanding, there was not _ there is not _ the
least statistical or other scientific evidence of more-aggressive
driving on our nation's roads,'' he writes. ``Indeed, accident,
fatality and injury rates have been edging down. There is no
evidence that `road rage' or an aggressive-driving `epidemic' is
anything but a media invention.''
</P>
<P>
   The road-rage hype is seen as dangerous because it distracts
from more serious problems such as drunk drivers and the
less-than-rigorous process used to license young drivers, who are
among the most accident-prone on the roads.
</P>
<P>
   The hype around school violence and road rage harken back to
another epidemic of questionable origin: the burning of mostly
black churches two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The church burnings became a political issue in a presidential
election year, with Clinton personally touring arson sites.
</P>
<P>
   But a later review found much of the political rhetoric and
reporting on the issue to be flawed. Insurance records indicated
the number of fires at churches in 1996 was within the normal range
for what was reported in the six years prior. In addition, fewer
than 20 of the 73 fires that summer could be clearly linked to
racism.
</P>
<P>
   However, most of the reporting on the church fires referred to
an ``epidemic'' or ``wave'' or ``string'' of fires.
</P>
<P>
   If there are lessons in all of these cases, they may come from
the front line of reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Post reporter John Schwartz, who covered the
Jonesboro school shootings, offered some advice to his colleagues
in a first-person account of covering the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying we should ignore stories like the one that
happened in Jonesboro,'' he wrote. ``I'm simply saying that as
journalists, we should cover these stories more thoughtfully, and
with decency and compassion instead of cookie-cutter bathos. We
should, in other words, do what we're paid to do: Get the story
right.''

DUCT TAPE HAS THIS ONE LITTLE FLAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's duct tape good for? Just about everything, it seems,
from &UR;  &LR; making stopgap repairs on briefcases and upholstery or
household tools and appliances to patching holes in the screen
porch. Whatever it is, if it's broken, duct tape can probably fix
it.
</P>
<P>
   Okay, what's duct tape no good for? Taping ducts.
</P>
<P>
   And that's straight from a team of scientists working at a major
government research lab.
</P>
<P>
   After three months of rigorous comparison testing at the
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a US Department of Energy
facility that spends most of its time trying to develop things like
futuristic fusion-powered generating systems, the team concluded
that the ubiquitous, gray, ultra-sticky stuff we call duct tape
fared worse than everything else they tried when it came to sealing
the ductwork in home heating and air conditioning systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried as many different kinds of duct sealants as we could
get our hands on,'' said Max Sherman, head of the Energy
Performance of Buildings group at the prestigious California lab.
``Of all the things we tested, only duct tape failed. It failed
reliably, and often quite catastrophically.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be great for keeping the cuffs of your pants out of the
spokes of your bicycle wheels. It may even, as some people swear,
be good for getting rid of warts (try this at your own risk; the
folks at Lawrence Berkeley haven't tested this claim yet).
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But as strong and sticky as duct tape is when you apply it,
apparently it's going to need a new name. Put it on a duct, and
it's going to crack, split, and fall off before you can say
``jumping heating bills!''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the issue, say the earnest government scientists.
Duct tape may sound like a frivolous subject for research (Let's be
honest; that's why this study is getting a lot of press), but the
fact is that an enormous amount of energy is wasted if hot air
spews out of joints in the ductwork and ends up heating the
basement, crawlspace or the insides of walls, instead of your home.
In the Berkeley tests (which tortured the tape with rapid heating
and cooling cycles to produce accelerated aging) most of the duct
tape failed within days. Most of the joints ended up spewing out at
least half as much air as they did before the tape was applied.
</P>
<P>
   Everything else the researchers tried worked better: Clear tape,
foil-backed tape, mastic, and a newly-developed aerosol sealant all
held up under the tough testing. Only the duct tape failed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;   &UR;  &LR; The aerosol sealant, developed at the Berkeley lab, worked
best of all _ and it may be the easiest to use. Instead of
laboriously taping or painting the material over every joint, you
simply squirt the spray through the duct system; it settles into
the leaky places and seals them shut. After two years of testing,
those seals were still holding like new.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the energy lab's findings were published this summer
in Home Energy magazine. But the work leaves one lingering
question. Among the various kinds of duct tape the team tested,
there was one _ which worked no better than the others _ that was
described as ``nuclear grade.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what, exactly, is that being used for?
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, maybe we don't want to know.

REVISITING THE SUMMER OF '68 _ WHEN SO MANY DREAMS DIED

<P>
   Chicago police beat demonstrators outside the convention hall,
and Humbert Humphrey barely defeated Senator Eugene McCarthy for
the Democratic presidential nomination, as the sizzling summer of
1968 drew to a close 30 years ago this week. America was on fire
that year _ politically, emotionally, and literally.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy had been
assassinated; armies of demonstrators seized the streets in protest
of the Vietnam War, which shattered Lyndon Johnson's presidency and
cracked the core of the nation's self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, some prominent figures reflect on their thoughts
at the time _ on how the world might have been different had that
long, hot summer never taken place _ and on its lasting social and
political impact for the United States.

Moscow, we should spend that money to improve conditions everywhere

time is that it didn't tear our country apart. Yes, it was a
troubling time and, yes, there was a lot unrest, but we did
respond. We did get out of Vietnam, we have seen changes around the
civil rights movement _ not enough, but real changes, and the same
is true for women's rights. ... In any case, I think the country
has responded ... including with a change in the leadership of the
country. That didn't happen in '68, but a lot of what happened
since that time has happened as a result.

   ``I think the message I'd deliver, if I could, from that time is
one that was given to me by a political science professor and that

don't drop out and say, `I'm not going to participate.' You get
involved. For me, that was the strongest message of that period.

RUSSIAN TROUBLES COULD LEAD TO ILLEGAL SALE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The crash and burn of Russia's economy could
inspire the deadliest sort of ``fire sale'' _ the illegal sale of
its nuclear weapons technology to terrorists and renegade nations.
</P>
<P>
   Unpaid, impoverished Russian military employees or weapons
scientists might be tempted to sell their nuclear weapons,
materials or know-how to foreign powers or terrorists, Western
experts and arms-control advocates warn.
</P>
<P>
   They urge the Clinton administration to immediately launch a
mini-``Marshall Plan'' to keep Russian nuclear bombs or bomb-making
materials _ ``loose nukes,'' in popular jargon _ from falling into
irresponsible hands.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, future historians might recall Bill Clinton as the
president who ``lost the chance to save us from Russian nuclear
chaos,'' warns Joseph Cirincione, director of the Non-Proliferation
Project at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
</P>
<P>
   Russia ``has 22,000 nuclear weapons. And 10,000 to 15,000 of
them are in storage and, so, are guarded not by elite forces but
(rather) by regular troops'' whose trustworthiness is less certain,
Cirincione says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be a little concerned ... about how vulnerable
those weapons might be to sale or theft. And those concerns are
certainly increased by the economic situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a nightmare scenario to me,'' says Bruce Hall, a field
organizer at the Washington office of Peace Action, a 60,000-member
grass-roots peace organization in Washington, D.C. ``The (Russian)
economy is in free fall, and it's not clear how stable the Yeltsin
government is. It should really be a wake-up call that we need to
get moving on nuclear arms control.''
</P>
<P>
   To help stabilize the situation, arms-control activists urge
Clinton to make a dramatic gesture during his visit to Russia next
week _ for example, by offering to begin negotiations on the next
major round of arms-control talks, known as Start III. Ideally,
that treaty would lower both sides' nuclear arsenals to 1,000
strategic nuclear weapons, a tiny fraction of their Cold War might.
</P>
<P>
   But progress is stalled, critics charge, by factors ranging from
Clinton's preoccupation with the Monica Lewinsky scandal to the
U.S. bureaucracy's preoccupation with other foreign issues, says
John Pike of the Federation of American Scientists. He calls this
``the most crisis-ridden year in international relations in my
memory,'' with U.S. diplomats facing headaches from Kosovo to Iraq
to Pakistan. ``It's been one thing after another.''
</P>
<P>
   In this atmosphere, some experts contend, the administration
hasn't been able to give full attention to an issue that most
Americans, in the aftermath of the Cold War, have forgotten:
whether the Russians have locked the front door to a plutonium
facility in a remote forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 1,200 tons of fissile material _ plutonium and
highly enriched uranium _ in Russia and the former states of the
Soviet Union. Some of this is in poorly guarded facilities with _ I
mean this _ no guards,'' Cirincione says. Some of the bomb
materials are ``in research facilities that are padlocked ... (but)
where people could easily walk in and out with enough plutonium in
their pockets to build a bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States must launch the ``equivalent of a Marshall
Plan'' now ``because it's in our national security interest,''
Cirincione says. ``This is not a humanitarian mission. We should
lock up, destroy and remove as much (Russian) fissionable material
and weapons as we can, and put as many (Russian) scientists as we
can on non-weapons work.''
</P>
<P>
   A window of opportunity to protect the weapons is fast closing,
Cirincione says: ``We have no idea if it will snap shut in the next
week, or whether we'll be able to buy some time and keep it open
for a while longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Accusing the administration and Congress of dragging their feet
on the Russian nuclear security issue, Cirincione urges them to
``double or triple'' the annual U.S. expenditure on the program,
called Nunn-Lugar after two U.S. senators. The program _ funded for
$400 million a year _ tries to ensure that Russian scientists and
military personnel don't sell their bombs, fissionable materials or
bomb-making knowledge to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government should consider funding a Russian program to
seal fissionable materials inside solid glass or ceramic
containers, from which they would be difficult to extract, says
Steven Dolley, research director at the Nuclear Control Institute
in Washington. The program, he says, would create jobs in Russia,
inject valuable hard currency into its economy, and lessen the
risks of ``loose nukes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was less worried about (loose nukes) until the (Russian)
situation became decidedly worse over the last few weeks, with
concern about national collapse,'' Dolley notes.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cirincione, U.S. money also could help the Russians
to: Improve security barriers, such as fences, at nuclear
installations, some of which are poorly guarded.
</P>
<P>
   Pay Russian weapons scientists to work on nonmilitary projects
such as developing new industrial tools or consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   Time is running out, Cirincione says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian military is not immune to the economic
dislocations engulfing Russia,'' Cirincione says. ``They have
experienced problems with paying the troops. There are severe
housing shortages for both active-duty troops and officers ... and
a particularly severe housing shortage for the officers who are
being discharged now as part of the downsizing of the Russian
military.''

FROM THE CLOSET TO THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call 1998 the year that gay politicians came of age.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, at least 10 openly gay candidates are running
for state or congressional offices in next month's primary.
</P>
<P>
   That's a record number, and reflects an environment far
different from the early years of US Representative Barney Frank's
tenure; after being elected in 1980, it took him four terms in
Washington before he felt he could reveal his sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   But no longer does Frank stand out in the national political
landscape. Six other openly gay candidates are running for Congress
this fall _ the largest group to make a serious run for Capitol
Hill. Nationally, the number of gay officeholders has tripled since
1991 (from 49 to 156), and another 100 are candidates this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The advancement of any minority group that has candidates stand
for office _ rather than simply endorse others _ marks a crucial
development.
</P>
<P>
   But this year there is a further sign of the maturation and
political savvy of gay movement: Openly gay candidates are not
automatically winning endorsements from gay political caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reached this odd state, where we have gone from
endorsing candidates, to running gay candidates, to the point where
we don't even have to endorse gay candidates,'' says Neil Miller,
author of ``Out of the Past: Gay and Lesbian History from 1869 to
the Present.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, gay candidates are no longer defined solely by their
sexual orientation. Rather, they are supported or opposed based on
the qualities that define any candidate: their stands on issues,
their record, and their personalities. No more blanket
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is that more apparent than in the Massachusetts 8th
Congressional District, where some gay groups declined to endorse
Susan Tracy, the only openly gay candidate in the race. The Lesbian
and Gay Political Alliance of Massachusetts endorsed Marjorie
Clapprood instead.
</P>
<P>
   And two gay newspapers, Bay Windows and In Newsweekly _ which
called on Tracy to drop from the race _ endorsed Clapprood.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Tracy was frustrated with the papers not endorsing
her, because, she says, neither talked with her beforehand. But,
she says, ``I am proud of the breadth and depth of my endorsements,
and I don't think it is fair to say `Susan is gay, so every gay
person is going to be with her.' Is every person of Italian descent
going to vote for Mike Capuano? No.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not just in the 8th District that gay groups are
surprising some with their endorsements. In the 9th Suffolk
District, the Lesbian and Gay Political Alliance backed state
Representative Byron Rushing instead of either of two openly gay
challengers.
</P>
<P>
   That endorsements are no longer a reflexive matter of identity
politics ``is a sign of sophistication in the gay community,'' says
Sean Cahill, chairman of the Lesbian and Gay Political Alliance.
``We are thoughtful and don't automatically support someone because
of their sexual orientation. In a couple of races, Rushing's, and
the 8th Congressional race, we made the decision that the gay
candidate was not the best.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Washington-based Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund _ a group
dedicated to electing gays _ backs only about 18 percent of the
candidates that seek its support, says deputy director Kathleen
DeBold. The group endorsed Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure the candidate is viable, and we only pick
qualified individuals who happen to be gay or lesbian,'' says
DeBold. ``Susan Tracy is a qualified congressional candidate who is
a lesbian; she is not a lesbian running for office. Unless you are
looking for a date, there is no reason why you should care about a
candidate's sexual orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexual orientation, however, does still matter. And not just to
the Anita Bryants of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no constituency that I am aware of where it is a
non-issue,'' says Mark Merante, cochair of Bay State Gay and
Lesbian Democrats. ``It is an issue, even in the most liberal of
districts. A certain segment of the population, either consciously
or not consciously, will not support you.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett Barrios, who is running for a state legislative seat
from Cambridge _ arguably the most liberal city in the country's
most liberal state _ says he has felt the chill.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go door-to-door, and I have knocked on 4,000 doors,
generally people are interested in the issues. But I have
encountered homophobia before my sexual orientation comes up. Other
campaigns have contacted supporters to let them know `this man is a
homosexual.' That is gay-baiting, and it is disappointing, but we
have not made an issue of it. The issues are affordable housing,
schools, and child care.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Duffy, however, the Republican candidate for state
auditor, sees great differences between 1998 and 1990 when he ran
for a state legislative seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the convention this year, I was the Republican nominee for
state auditor _ a statewide position _ and I was unanimously
endorsed. There was no opposition, no dissent, and I think that is
an extraordinary thing.''

TO EVERY DOG HIS DAY...HIS DAY...HIS DAY...

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Given the red-hot state of cloning research and the boundless
affection of many pet owners for their animals, it was only a
matter of time before something like the ``Missyplicity'' project
came along.
</P>
<P>
   For the anonymous couple who plunked down $2.3 million in an
effort to clone their 11-year-old, mixed-breed dog Missy, success
could mean never having to say a final goodbye to their
black-and-white pooch.
</P>
<P>
   And judging by the reaction to announcement of the effort this
week via an Internet site, success would also tap into the
yearnings of less-well-heeled pet owners, some of whom wrote that
they plan to freeze their own aged or dying animals in anticipation
of eventual cloning at Wal-Mart prices.
</P>
<P>
   It's a departure for cloning science, which until now has been
driven mainly by visions of megabucks in the livestock industry,
where copies of prize animals could be made and sold at high
prices. By contrast, the Missyplicity project is fueled ``mainly by
emotional reasons,'' said Lou Hawthorne, an intermediary for the
unidentified couple, in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne insists that the plan is serious and could produce
methods for copying the best search-and-rescue or guide dogs, and
for rescuing endangered species. But, he insisted, it is in no way
a step toward cloning humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has agreed that cloning Man is bad, but what about
Man's Best Friend?'' says Hawthorne in an Internet message on the
Web site. ``Most people aren't bothered as much _ or at all _ by
cloning dogs,'' he adds, noting that while the uniqueness of humans
puts cloning out of bounds for many people, ``our concept of a good
canine companion does not depend on uniqueness _ at least not to
the same degree.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne, who heads a newly formed company called Bio Arts and
Research Corp. _ yes, BARC _ said in a telephone interview that he
assembled a scientific advisory board to help choose the scientists
who would attempt to carry out the donors' wishes. The first
$500,000 has been forwarded to a livestock cloning specialist at
Texas A&AMP;M University, Mark Westhusin, who will head the effort.
Westhusin and his colleagues took tissue samples from Missy earlier
this summer as a start in identifying cells that might be suitable
for cloning.
</P>
<P>
   It is barely a year since the birth of Dolly the lamb, the first
mammal cloned from a single cell of an adult individual. The months
since have seen the birth of cloned calves, mice, and cattle, along
with sheep that were not only cloned but had genes inserted from
other species to cause them to produce medical proteins in their
milk.
</P>
<P>
   Copying the familiar domestic dog, however, will force
scientists to start practically at square one, because far less is
known about normal canine reproduction than that of livestock, said
Westhusin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know much less about how to collect and transfer embryos,
how to manipulate hormonal cycles, how to do in vitro
fertilization, in the dog than we do in livestock animals, because
there hasn't been the economic incentive,'' said Westhusin in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   He said a colleague in the project, Dr. Duane Kraemer, succeeded
10 years ago in transferring fertilized embryos from a female dog
to a surrogate mother dog which bore the puppies. But few if any
attempts at dog cloning have been reported, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What interested me is the challenge, the opportunity to do
really good basic science involving reproduction in dogs,'' he
said. The Texas scientists plan to use some variation of nuclear
transfer, the technique that produced Dolly and similar clones. It
involves extracting the nucleus of a mature cell from the animal to
be cloned, and fusing it with a fresh egg from which the nucleus
has been removed.
</P>
<P>
   When the scientists ``activated'' the artifically made embryo
for Dolly, for instance, the nucleus from the original animal cell
reprogrammed its genes, turning them all on so that they could
direct the complex development of an entire new animal. The
resulting fetus was implanted into the womb of a surrogate mother
to develop and be born.
</P>
<P>
   A cloning expert at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst,
Dr. James Robl, said the Missyplicity project stands ``a reasonable
chance of success,'' although it might take several years. Robl,
who founded a company to commercialize aspects of livestock
cloning, said he has had requests for a decade to clone dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago someone wanted to clone racing greyhounds,'' he
recalled. ``But most people are interested because they have a dog
that's been around for 10 or 12 years and is getting old but is a
part of the family.''
</P>
<P>
   To Dr. Peter Theran, vice president for health and hospitals of
the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
interest in the project ``is a clear example of the strength of the
human-animal bond.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that ``whether cloning would really duplicate
what someone has and loves'' remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   And, like some others responding to the Internet announcement,
Theran had some reservations about taking this tack to replace an
aging animal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are thousands of dogs euthanized every year for lack of
a home,'' he said. ``It's a shame to take this direction _ it's
like trying to clone people when there are a whole bunch of
orphans'' without a home.

YELTSIN: THE HERO WHO TURNED INTO A BUMBLER 
</HEADLINE>
   News Analysis  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Boris Yeltsin's tragedy is that by the time he got to
the top, he was no longer the man he had been on his way there.
</P>
<P>
   Illness, hard drinking and a lack of application to the arduous
tasks involved in running such a vast country as Russia have turned
the onetime national hero into a sad bumbler whose grip on affairs
of state seems to have all but vanished.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of political and financial turbulence unmatched
since the collapse of the Soviet Union, a humiliated Yeltsin went
on television Friday to insist he will not resign as president but
also to promise that he won't run for re-election when his present
term ends in two years.
</P>
<P>
   He was addressing a disgruntled people who, as he himself is
well aware, have no sympathy for him.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts predict that, as a consequence of the
botched job he has done ruling Russia in recent months, he will not
be able to resist the pressure on him to quit and could step down
soon after his summit with President Clinton ends.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is the same man who, in the late 1980s, broke ranks
with the communist leadership in the Kremlin to proclaim his faith
in a democratic future. Unlike his erstwhile mentor, Mikhail
Gorbachev, he recognized that the communist system had
irretrievably lost its grip and would not endure much longer.
</P>
<P>
   His incessant demands for far-reaching change made him the
dominant dissident voice among senior party bosses, antagonizing
Gorbachev, then seemingly entrenched and applauded around the world
for his attempts to modernize the Soviet state. One day, according
to Yeltsin's autobiography, Gorbachev summoned him to his office
and told him gloatingly that he was ``finished.'' Events were, of
course, to show that it was Gorbachev who would be ousted.
</P>
<P>
   After Yeltsin was fired from the ruling Politburo and ostracized
by his former colleagues, he deftly planned for the day when
communism would be overthrown. He arranged to be elected to the
traditionally powerless job of president of the Russian Federation,
which despite its huge expanse was at the time little more than an
administrative division of the Soviet Union, ruled from the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   But from this seemingly innocuous post Yeltsin built the power
base that soon would make him leader of an independent Russia. He
also gained great credibility by being the first leading communist
to risk running in a free election _ something Gorbachev had
declined to do.
</P>
<P>
   Then a year later in 1991, Yeltsin's moment came. In
circumstances that remain mysterious to this day, members of
Gorbachev's own government placed the Soviet leader under house
arrest while he was on vacation in the Crimea and declared they
were restoring ``order'' to the Soviet system.
</P>
<P>
   Some historians suspect Gorbachev connived in the plot as part
of a complicated strategy to drop his badly sagging liberal reforms
and return to authoritarian rule. Whatever the truth, the inept
plotters, by an incredible oversight, failed to arrest Yeltsin, who
instantly became chief of the popular resistance to the coup.
</P>
<P>
   Vigorous and determined, he was everywhere: addressing crowds
from the top of a tank, urging wavering troops not to back the
coup, calling on western governments to stand fast in support of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Within 72 hours, the coup collapsed. No one doubted that most of
the credit belonged to Yeltsin. A shaken Gorbachev returned to
Moscow, but his authority had been fatally weakened. Under constant
attack by Yeltsin, he found himself divested of office in December
1991 as the Soviet Union dissolved. Already the real power in the
land, Yeltsin immediately became president of an independent
Russia. But the best was already behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Pledged to establish a free market economy, Yeltsin never quite
came to grips with the challenge. His own grasp of the economic
problems involved was patchy, and internal feuding among his
advisers didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   As one reform plan after another was discarded, Yeltsin appeared
to detach himself increasingly from the day-to-day business of
governing. Occasionally he would act decisively, only to lapse back
into apparent apathy. When anti-Yeltsin members of parliament rose
up against the regime in 1993, he crushed them violently, sending
tanks and artillery to assault the parliament building.
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter, he appeared to dither as economic difficulties
mounted and popular discontent grew. Reports that he was drinking
heavily persisted, and his deteriorating health led to major
operations in 1995 and 1996. He was re-elected in 1996 _ mainly,
according to many experts, because his chief opponent was a
communist.
</P>
<P>
   Now the onetime national hero has become a despised figure to
millions of Russians who believe he has made their lives worse than
they were in Soviet times. They cannot wait to be rid of him.

IS THIS COUPLE ON THE RIGHT TRACK TO RETIREMENT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are 34 and 31 years old, respectively, and have
about $50,000 invested in mutual funds through our retirement
accounts at work and Roth IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   The investments are almost entirely in stock mutual funds. We
add approximately $1,200 a month to these savings. We are
comfortable with a life style that costs us $40,000 a year. If we
continue at this rate of savings, at what age can we reasonably
stop working?
</P>
<P>
   B.H., Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The bugbear in making calculations of the sort that you seek
is inflation. After running a few rough projections, I determined
that it will take roughly 25 years to attain your target.
</P>
<P>
   So the threshold question becomes, how many dollars will you
need 25 years from now to buy the same things that $40,000 buys
now. The answer is $83,751 if we presume future inflation at 3
percent; at 4 percent the number rises to $106,633.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if you continue your current investment program for 25
years, a pace of 10 percent average annual growth would take you to
$2,022,766. Let's assume that you then divide that sum into two
segments. One, representing two thirds of the whole, would be
invested to bring you an income stream. The balance would remain in
stocks, designed to build a pool to protect you from the effects of
inflation later in your retirement. Following this reasoning, you
would have $1,348,509 to invest for income, and if you achieved a
6.5 average yield on the income portfolio, this would generate
$87,653 in annual income. And that's in the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't make much sense to try to get much closer than a
ballpark figure; too many uncertainties loom. What will be the
state of Social Security in the year 2023? Was that projection of
10 percent average annual growth for stocks too high...or too low?
Will a 6.5 percent yield from fixed-income investments be realistic
in the future?
</P>
<P>
   Will you receive raises which will allow you to accelerate your
savings program? When you project such uncertainties over a couple
of decades, the future looks pretty murky.
</P>
<P>
   The best practice at this stage to reanalyze your situation
about every five years, making sure you're on track, and assessing
how things may have changed. You should be able to make some pretty
solid judgments once you are in your last decade before retirement,
but everything before then is largely a matter of rough conjecture.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My tax accountant and I are concerned about the capital gains
tax that was due on my 1997 income tax. I had capital gains of more
than $7,000, most of which came from holdings in Vanguard Wellesley
and Vanguard Windsor II funds. My wife and I are both 79 years old
and the portfolio allocation is 3.3 percent money market, 37
percent bonds, 25.1 percent balanced, and 34.6 percent equities.
For our age, I think the amount in equities is too high, but if I
sell some of it, the capital gains will increase even more. I now
have all dividends and capital gains reinvested. I was thinking of
having the capital gains transferred to my money market account; I
would still pay the tax, but it would stop the growth.
</P>
<P>
   W.F., Hellertown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Certainly ending the reinvestment of capital gains would be a
good idea if you think you're overcommitted to equities -- but why
stop there? Why not have both the dividend and capital gains
distributions transferred to either your money market account or
one of your other fixed-income holdings? This would not only tend
to reduce future capital gains distributions, but also might move
the portfolio (albeit at a snail's pace) away from the heavy equity
concentration.
</P>
<P>
   But the basic fact of the business is that those unpleasant
taxable distributions simply come with the mutual fund territory --
and indeed the distributions of which you complain were far from
huge. Windsor II's 1997 capital gains represented 7.66 percent of
its yearend share value, and the Wellesley capital distributions
represented 6.63 percent of yearend net asset value. Generally in
years such as 1997 there's only limited howling about these taxable
distributions, since they represented only a fraction of the fund's
gains; Windsor II had a 32.38 percent capital gain for 1997, and
Wellesley showed a 20.19 percent total return. It isn't always so
-- from time to time, especially when changing markets cause
managers to make large portfolio alterations, a fund might produce
substantial capital gains distributions in a year when the fund
shows a negative total return -- and the unhappy owner has no
choice but to face the tax liability.
</P>
<P>
   There are several things investors can do to minimize potential
liabilities of this sort.
</P>
<P>
   One is to consider the so-called tax-managed funds, where
portfolio managers are charged with doing everything possible to
keep distributions to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Another is to consider the typical level of portfolio turnover
before buying a fund. If the typical portfolio turnover is in
excess of 100 percent, you can expect a bumpy ride with the taxman.
On the other hand, as with the two funds you complain about, if the
turnover is lower than 50 percent, you can expect more moderate and
consistent levels of distributions.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, before buying a fund, you can look through the
financials (or in the Morningstar Mutual Funds reports) to discover
the potential capital gains exposure, which is the percentage that
would be distributed if the entire portfolio were liquidated. For
Windsor II, that figure is 33 percent; for Vanguard Wellesley, the
number is 18 percent. Such figures are fairly typical for long-
established low-turnover funds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have been reading your column for several years, and
noticed you recommend Fidelity GNMA fund as a conservative
investment for people who want a steady income. I called Fidelity
and asked them what the management costs are. Fidelity charges .74
percent (annually), Dreyfus charges .65 percent, and Vanguard said
there was not any charge, which is very hard to believe. Why do you
recommend Fidelity which seems to have higher costs than the
others? I am 60 and retired and looking for a reasonably priced
fund with decent returns and moderate swings in price.
</P>
<P>
   F.D., Fairview, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. First of all, my general tendency is to recommend funds in
families that investors are already working with, provided that the
fund family in question has a decent offering in the category.
Second, while steady readers of this column probably have long ago
realized I have a strong preference for Vanguard funds -- based on
their low fees and straightforward approach to investing -- I
frequently mention similar funds in other families simply to
forestall objections such as one I once received from a gentleman
who was convinced I was a Vanguard hireling. (For the record, I
have no relationship with Vanguard save as an investor.) Anyway,
you're right that the Vanguard GNMA offering is generally superior
to either of the others, although this may not be entirely tied to
expense levels.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I can't make sense of your numbers -- any of them. To
begin with, in the case of Vanguard I think your question was
interpreted as a request for the sales charge, or load.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sales charge for any of the funds you mentioned,
although Dreyfus GNMA does have a .20 percent annual 12b(1) or
distribution charge. As for the expense ratios, according to
Morningstar Mutual Funds, the total expense ratio for Dreyfus GNMA
is .96 percent, for Fidelity Spartan GNMA it is .51 percent, and
for Vanguard GNMA it is .31 percent. Since Fidelity Spartan GNMA is
closed to new investors I called for information on Fidelity GNMA,
which is not currently tracked by Morningstar, and was told the
ratio is .74 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More important that these expense ratios, though, are the bottom
lines -- the average annual returns over a long period of time.
Here's the lineup over a five-year period: For Dreyfus the figure
is 6.02 percent, for Fidelity Spartan GNMA it is 6.56 percent, for
Fidelity GNMA it is 6.34 percent, and Vanguard GNMA comes out on
top, at 6.98 percent. Over 10 years, the figures are 7.94 percent
for Dreyfus GNMA, 9.08 percent for Fidelity GNMA, and 8.27 percent
for Vanguard GNMA. The Fidelity Spartan GNMA fund, founded in 1990,
doesn't have a 10-year record. There are rumors that Fidelity
Spartan GNMA is soon to be merged into Fidelity GNMA, which is a
shame from my point of view. This fund, which shares a portfolio
manager with Fidelity GNMA, offered a lower expense level in
exchange for a higher initial investment ($10,000) and reductions
in privileges such as check-writing. If you look closely at the
five-year numbers, the difference in average returns between the
Spartan fund and the other come within 1 basis point of perfectly
reflecting the differences in the expense ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that, at bottom you're right -- Vanguard GNMA is the
top of the heap here, although all are solid funds, all rated
above-average by Morningstar Mutual funds except Vanguard GNMA,
which gets top five-star grades.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, I hold share of Vanguard GNMA and a family
member is an investor in Fidelity Spartan GNMA.

INVESTORS FACED WITH A WORLD OF UNCERTAINTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If the dizzying 482-point drop last week in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average can be explained with a single sentence,
it is this: Markets hate uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen months after Asia slipped into financial chaos, the
uncertainties are multiplying in the world economy. There are no
clear signs that the Asian crisis will end. Despite US pleas, Japan
has not roused itself out of recession. And last week, Russia
collapsed into political and economic meltdown, leading markets to
worry not only about Russia's ruble but about the security of its
nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did investors sell last week? I think it was that the
world looks crazy, and people said they don't understand it,'' said
Roger Brinner, chief economist at Parthenon Group, a Boston
consulting and investment firm. ``And when people don't understand
the world, they get out of stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was a turbulent ride on markets worldwide, as
investors fled stocks and rushed into investments they believe are
safer, such as US Treasury bonds. The Dow industrial stocks fell
5.6 percent, their worst decline in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Will the world economy get worse? Should Americans be alarmed?
Several economists considered these and other questions as the Dow
fell, and rose, and fell again last week. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Asian financial crisis began more than a year ago. Why are
markets so turbulent now? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There are few signs that Southeast Asia is improving, and recent
figures indicate that some economies are shrinking even more than
expected. That has left investors wary of emerging markets
elsewhere in the world, from Latin America to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent turmoil began earlier this month in Russia,
where political developments prompted already-wary investors to
abandon the country.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had been selling off Russian stocks and rubles, but
the government scared them even more by freezing all payments by
companies on their foreign debt. The government also cut the value
of the ruble, leading investors to sell more stocks on fears that a
weaker currency would leave consumers and companies even more
impoverished and shrink the economy.
</P>
<P>
   By midweek, the clamor to sell rubles was so loud that the
government suspended trading, and investors responded by sending
Russian stocks into a freefall. The fact that President Boris
Yeltsin had fired his entire Cabinet raised fears that Russia would
revert to Soviet-style leadership, prompting investors around the
world to sell stocks. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why should the US markets care about Russia? &LR;   &UR; Total US trade
with Russia is only $8 billion, a tiny portion of the US economy. A
single Massachusetts company, Raytheon Co., reports 2.5 times that
amount in annual sales. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For American investors, the fear is not so much that a
weakened ruble makes it harder for Russians to afford Gillette
razors or Compaq computers. The bigger concern is the fate of
Russia's 22,000 nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question is who has control of those nuclear weapons,
given the leadership vacuum,'' said Robert Litan, director of
economic studies at the Brookings Institution. ``Markets hate
uncertainty, and there's a lot of uncertainty about who is going to
get those weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a some chance that the weakened ruble could hurt
the US economy indirectly. German banks are heavily invested in
Russia, and big losses could force them to curtail lending. In
turn, that could limit growth throughout Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a weaker ruble cuts the price of Russian oil and
other natural resources on the world market. Countries from Brazil
and Venezuela to Canada sell the same products and could be forced
to cut their prices as well, hurting their economies.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; If investors are pulling money from Russia and Asia, won't they
also abandon Latin America? Would that hurt the US economy? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Latin America's emerging markets are very important to the US
economy. Mexico is our third-largest trading partner, and Brazil
and Venezuela rank in the top 20.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are eyeing these markets warily. If they continue to
pull money from Latin American stocks and currencies, the region's
economies will almost certainly contract, making it far harder for
US companies to sell goods south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   But there are important differences between Latin America and
Southeast Asia, economists say.
</P>
<P>
   In the industrialized West, investors buy stocks or loan money
to businesses based on the return they will receive. In South
Korea, Indonesia, and even Japan, it was the government that
largely determined which businesses received capital.
</P>
<P>
   This ``crony capitalism'' prompted Asia to invest too much money
in factories and real estate developments that now sit empty. The
owners could not repay their loans, and banks hid the losses. When
these problems were revealed, investors fled.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists say Latin America is now closer to the
``efficient'' Western economic model. That suggests its banks are
less likely to carry hidden bad loans, and that investors have
funded businesses based on realistic profit expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chile is a real market economy,'' Litan said. ``Argentina's
banking system is controlled mostly by foreign banks, so you don't
have banks going nuts lending for all kinds of crazy purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, investors may be more likely to retain confidence in
Latin America, leaving the region less vulnerable to the capital
withdrawals that have crippled Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never be too sure, and in two weeks I could turn out
to be wrong, but the overbuilding and crony capitalism seem less
deeply embedded in Latin America,'' Litan said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; There is so much turmoil in the world economy. How much should
events abroad worry Americans?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  On a scale of one to 10, Litan said, the United States'
anxiety level should not exceed a three or four.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Asian crisis is already hurting some US
exporters. The government reported last week that US corporate
profits fell 1.5 percent in the second quarter from the same period
last year. It was the first such decline in nearly 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all the hype in recent years over globalization,
trade is not as big a factor in the US economy as some people
believe. &UR;  &LR; Exports account for only 12 percent of gross domestic
product, a broad measure of economic activity. If world demand for
US products dropped 10 percent _ a huge number, considering that
many national economies are still growing _ the US gross domestic
product would fall 1 percent, Litan said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the 1.5 percent to 2 percent economic growth
that many economists forecast for next year would be shaved by a
percentage point. That could raise unemployment levels by a half a
percentage point or more, Litan said. But the economy would still
be expanding, not contracting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to think of the 85 percent of the economy that isn't
significantly tied to international trade,'' said Tim O'Neill,
chief economist at the Bank of Montreal. ``What you've got is a
domestic economy that is doing very well.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; If economists are holding their anxiety in check, at least for
now, what events would make them truly nervous? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The answer is one word: China. Almost alone among its neighbors,
China has held the value of its currency steady. Giving in to the
temptation to devalue the yuan would echo ominously around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   A devaluation by China would surely trigger similar moves by
other emerging nations as each attempted to make its products more
attractive on the world market. When Indonesia devalues, for
example, a US dollar can buy more Indonesian rupiah _ and therefore
more Indonesian toys or noodles.
</P>
<P>
   A new round of devaluations would mean US companies face more
competition at home from cheaper imported products. At the same
time, foreign consumers would have less-valuable currencies to buy
US goods, meaning they would buy less of them. This would squeeze
US corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Economists also say they cannot account for how Americans will
act in the face of global uncertainty. For now, consumer spending
is keeping US economy robust, as companies build new homes, make
products, and hire employees to feed consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   But consumers appear to be spending freely because they are
making money in the market and their jobs are secure. If the
world's economic prospects continue to darken, there could be a
steep downturn in the market, which could choke off the consumer
spending that is the main fuel of US economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, the only risk for the second half of this year is
that the American consumer loses his or her confidence by reading
about things going on in the rest of the world,'' said Brinner.
``That's the main thing that could knock us off balance.''

 &HT;    Tips on setting up a parent-approved, kid-friendly site for
school work
 &HT;    Eds: Fixes garble in last grafs.
 &HT;    By Christi Mays
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ A structured study area can turn homework woes
into successes, experts say. One of the key areas parents may
consider changing is the time, place and space their children do
their homework. Experts agree it's a good idea to set up consistent
study areas in a quiet and visible place in the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Establishing a place where they know there's no fooling
around, no games and that this is my work space _ that sets the
stage for getting to work than trying to work in the den with the
television or in their room where their toys are,'' said Carole
Perry with the Waco Independent School District. ``It's a good
idea. It sounds so simplistic but it's so important.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's at the kitchen table, on a card table in the dining
room or at a desk in the living room, children should get in the
habit of doing their homework in that one spot each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anything that can be consistent about homework helps
the children know that homework is important,'' said Dr. Della
Thomas, coordinator of psychological services with WISD. ``The
consistency of having things in the same place and not having to go
find things cuts down on time and helps them concentrate. It takes
some of the variables out of homework.''
</P>
<P>
   When a family has multiple children and only one desk, that may
mean sharing the kitchen table and keeping each child's supplies in
a separate cardboard box.
</P>
<P>
   If the child is just borrowing the desk for the school year,
they should still have something that makes that area their own
space while working there, Thomas suggested. This could be their
own jar of pencils, a school picture or little awards they've won;
that is, if those things aren't too distracting.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen table is still the old-fashioned way of doing
homework and works well, especially for younger students whose
attention spans may have them up and out of a desk chair in no time
flat.
</P>
<P>
   As students get older, parents might consider giving a
kitchen-table student a little more leeway and trust and perhaps
look at setting up a desk area.
</P>
<P>
   A little planning should take place before parents rush off to
the furniture or office supply store, said Henry Woodward, Office
Depot store manager. Here's some advice:
</P>
<P>
   _ Measure. Parents should decide where they want to place a desk
and then record measurements. Also, if a desk is to house a
computer, measure the pieces of hardware to make sure they'll fit
on the desk.
</P>
<P>
   _ Decide on cost. Student desks can cost anywhere from a few
dollars at a garage sale to a few hundred dollars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Look for quality and workmanship if you're planning on using
the desks for several years or for several children. Many of the
wooden desks are made of pressed particle board.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make a really good product for an economically minded
customer vs. real wood, which would be very expensive,'' Woodward
said.
</P>
<P>
   _ One of the most important factors in setting up a decent study
area for a child is to ensure there is sufficient lighting. An
extra lamp on the desk is always a best bet.
</P>
<P>
   _ What about a chair? Price is a substantial deciding factor
when it comes to desk chairs. Parents want to avoid going all-out
on a student's chair, but they do want to make sure it is
comfortable and accommodating.
</P>
<P>
   Look for heavy, lasting fabrics, adjustable seats and backs that
can be raised for little people and durable molded wheel casters.
</P>
<P>
   Chairs that roll and rock might not be the best choice for
children who have trouble concentrating, since they might end up
using the chair more as a jungle gym than a seat. A chair that
allows children to put their feet on the ground is ideal.
</P>
<P>
   _ When deciding on placement of a study desk, high visibility is
always good, but make sure it's out of the main traffic areas.
</P>
<P>
   Bedrooms are not as ideal as other rooms of the house, since
parents have a harder time keeping an eye on children and there are
too many distractions, such as stereos, toys and telephones.

 &HT;    Commentary: Off to college, not a moment too soon
 &HT;    By VICKI MARSH KABAT
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   How well I remember the emotions of May. As we watched our
eldest son cross the stage at his high school graduation, our
hearts swelled with pride and our eyes with tears at the thought of
our ``little boy'' heading off to college.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference three months can make.
</P>
<P>
   There is some odd chemical reaction that apparently occurs
between parents and child during the time between high school
graduation and collge welcome week. I personally believe it's a
gift from God that makes the separation easier. For lack of a more
scientific definition, let's just call it ``mutual
disenchantment.''
</P>
<P>
   Last May I was visiting across the backyard fence with my
neighbor, who also was experiencing emotional angst about her
daughter's graduation. We had watched these two kids grow up
together, had attended the same PTA meetings and open houses, the
same elementary, junior high and high school programs and award
ceremonies. Now, here were our two ``babies'' about to leave home.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, her daughter is going to college in a far northern
state while my son is only going up the road a short piece. She has
a bit more reason to agonize than I do.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, that same mother and I met by the backyard fence a
few days ago, looked each other solemnly in the eye and almost
simultaneously asked, ``Are you as ready as I am to send these kids
off?''
</P>
<P>
   It has been the summer of our discontent _ for the kids and for
us. For their part, they seem to think they are independent. That
would indicate they are ``not dependent'' on parents or others for
such things as college tuition, room and board, meal plans,
spending money, etc. Silly children.
</P>
<P>
   We, the parents, seem to think they are still contributing
members of our families and households, since we are still feeding,
clothing and housing them. As such, we expect they will help around
the house, mow the yard, ferry younger siblings, shovel out their
rooms occasionally, and the like. Silly us.
</P>
<P>
   How sadly we both are disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   I began working fulltime not long ago. As a result, I have
expected a great deal more of our three sons, including cooking an
occasional dinner. I'm not asking for vichyssoise or beef
stroganoff, but when I told our eldest to fix us BLT sandwiches
recently, you'd have thought I asked him to prepare a four-course
meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have lettuce and tomatoes,'' he told me.
</P>
<P>
   OK, son, let's use a few problem-solving skills here. We live
six blocks from a grocery store. There's a car in the driveway.
What should you do?
</P>
<P>
   ``Go to the store,'' I finally told him.
</P>
<P>
   Sigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you cook the bacon?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a skillet, on the stove.''
</P>
<P>
   No response.
</P>
<P>
   ``You turn the stove on medium heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Sigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have to cook both sides of the bacon?''
</P>
<P>
   I ask you, is this child ready to be on his own?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you turn the bacon or flip it?''
</P>
<P>
   You can tie it in little bows if you want, just cook the bacon!
</P>
<P>
   After we packed him off to his college dorm, I came home and
walked into his bedroom. Well, I had to kick several things on the
floor aside and then I walked into his bedroom. I picked up a shirt
he left behind and, overcome by tender reflection, I pressed it to
my face to inhale the scent of my little boy, now a man _ and
promptly gagged from the stench.
</P>
<P>
   You know, I think it's time.

DIETARY-SUPPLEMENT INDUSTRY FLEXES ITS MUSCLES

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals' Mark McGwire closes in on the home run
record. The Denver Broncos win the Super Bowl. And the dietary
supplements the athletes use disappear from store shelves around
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Driven in part by a national obsession with health and
longevity, the dietary supplement industry has grown to a $12
billion industry. But the booming business in so-called performance
enhancers such as androstenedione and creatine is occurring amid
conflicting claims about their effectiveness and safety, and in an
industry that is almost totally unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials are starting to search for a way to put on the
brakes _ especially because some manufacturers are aiming their
marketing strategies at high school athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do $100 million in annual sales,'' said Len Moskovits, the
president and chief economic officer of Met-Rx USA Inc., of Irvine,
Calif., an industry leader in the manufacturing of protein shakes
and bars, along with more controversial products containing the
amino acid creatine (CREE-uh-teen). ``We started out in 1991 and
we've doubled our sales almost every year we've been around, and I
believe it is not because we are such great marketers but because
the consumer interest just keeps on increasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, more than 10 retailers throughout the Boston area
said they found themselves running through their available stocks
of testosterone precursor androstenedione (an-dro-STEEN-die-own)
after a bottle of it was discovered in the locker of McGwire _ who
is in a historic, much-publicized pursuit of the game's
single-season home run record.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers, who last week were forced to begin shipping their
product by overnight delivery, admit it will be autumn before they
can keep pace with the demand generated by the McGwire story.
</P>
<P>
   A similar increase in consumer interest in creatine products,
among the most popular dietary supplements, accompanied the Super
Bowl victory of the Denver Broncos in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creatine products started flying off the shelves _ just like
andro this week _ because three-quarters of the Broncos used these
products,'' said Rick Antonelli, a salesman at Newbury Naturals in
Boston. ``People were saying, `Wow! Did the Denver Broncos beat the
mighty Green Bay Packers. And they use this stuff?'''
</P>
<P>
   Creatine is a shining star in the dietary supplement industry.
In 1995, about six years after creatine was developed, sales
totalled $30 million, according to the Nutrition Business Journal.
This year, sales are projected to exceed $180 million.
</P>
<P>
   Androstenedione, and similar ``andro products'' like Met-Rx's
Androdiol, were introduced within the past year. Sales were
expected to total perhaps $10 million annually, at first. In the
wake of the McGwire story, Moscovits and others say they expect
sales to total $70 million to $100 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it do for this business?'' Moskovits said. ``If Mark
McGwire had said he eats a bunch of radishes every morning,
everyone would go out and buy radishes. Anyone who was on the fence
about these products before, they got off the fence this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the escalating consumer demand and the manufacturers' drive
to meet it is enormous concern about the consequences for public
health, and outright attempts to halt the trend.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Association of Tennis Professionals Tour
reiterated its ban on androstenedione and the General Nutrition
Centers ordered its 3,700 stores not to sell it because of safety
concerns. Major League Baseball and the players' union called on
doctors to research muscle-enhancing supplements. In Rome,
meanwhile, a major Italian soccer commissioner suggested that
creatine be banned or greatly restricted.
</P>
<P>
   The decade-long trend of increasing interest in dietary
supplements is occurring amid relaxed government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Congress loosened restrictions on the sale of dietary
supplements. Driven in large part by consumers' voracious appetite,
a bi-partisan group of congressmen relaxed requirements for
pre-market approval by the Food and Drug Administration. They also
allowed the manufacturers greater flexibility to make claims about
the performance of their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``As dietary supplements become increasingly popular it is all
the more important that government have adequate tools to make sure
these products are safe and well regulated,'' said Bruce
Silverglade, legal director for the Center for Science in the
Public Interest. ``Unfortunately, Congress in 1994 rendered the
Food and Drug Administration toothless. Some people may have to get
hurt before Congress takes a look at it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, doctors and scientists are hoping that the
manufacturers police themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it really comes down to company by company,'' said
Richard Kreider, director of the Sports Nutrition Laboratory at the
University of Memphis. ``The major companies usually do a fairly
good job in honestly explaining what their products do and do not
do. Some of the newer smaller companies that are more aggressive in
the market, trying to find a niche, may be of more concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Kreider and other nutritionists said it is especially important
that companies support independent research. Moskovits says Met-Rx
is particularly proud of its spending on research, and officials at
EAS say they spend $1 million annually on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get creatine anywhere, but only a handful of companies
are standing behind it in that way,'' Kreider said.
</P>
<P>
   More than a few officials fear that young athletes are
particularly at risk in this unregulated market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want a kid influenced by a slick marketing technique
into taking something they ought not to be taking, especially if
the thought is that it is a shortcut to athletic success,'' said
Bill Gaine, of the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Gaine said that coaches and athletic administrators around
Massachusetts have discovered what doctors and nutritionists
already know: Definitive information on many dietary supplements is
extremely difficult to come by. The association hopes to adopt a
more general policy this month mandating that use of the products
occur only under the supervision of parents and coaches and after
consultation with doctors, Gaine said.
</P>
<P>
   Moscovits admits that part of Met-Rx's marketing strategy for
creatine products is an appeal to youths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We advertise in publications that they read, like American
Football Quarterly, which goes to high school and college
coaches,'' he said. ``We offer a program called Mentor, and they
can get the same stuff the pros use but at a lower cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscovits said some of the ads feature high school cheerleaders
to attract the attention of young male athletes. But he also said
that Met-Rx would never market its Androdiol products to youths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not pitch them to high school athletes because we think
it would be dangerous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Pastner, president of the Massachusetts High School
Football Coaches Association, says he sees more than a few
advertisements and solicitations for the supplements and enhancers.
``When I get them,'' Pastner said, ``I throw them right in the
trash.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastner and many nutritionists say the biggest danger of the
supplement fad is that younger athletes will simply forget that the
best way to train is to eat properly and work hard. Pastner says he
remains a devotee of ``three or four meals a day and lots of
frappes'' for players who need to bulk up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the high school audiences, advertising appeals to them
in a big way,'' said Nancy Clark, a sports nutritionist. ``They are
so malleable. What I get concerned about is that people forget that
food works. So many people reach for this magic bullet and they
forget about breakfast and lunch.''

&HT;     CANADIANS VEXED BY STRICTER US BORDER PLAN 
</HEADLINE>

 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Bad feelings are boiling along the world's
friendliest border.
</P>
<P>
   A move by Congress to tighten requirements for Canadians
entering the United States has Ottawa in a tizzy. Officials north
of the border say the scheme to force Canadians, like other
foreigners, to fill out immigration cards and undergo tighter
scrutiny upon entering the United States is a betrayal of the
``special relationship'' that has allowed citizens of both
countries extraordinary freedom in passing back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Canadians, American business and political leaders
from New England to the Pacific Northwest warn that Section 110 of
the immigration law _ which goes before the House of
Representatives next month _ will result in the loss of hundreds of
millions of dollars' worth of trade and tourism by discouraging
travel and creating hours-long traffic backups at busy border
crossings.
</P>
<P>
   But conservatives in Congress say Canadians should be treated no
differently than any other foreigners. They accuse Canada of
providing safe haven to terrorists under notably lax asylum laws,
and warn that maintaining soft entry rules along the northern
border exposes the United States to danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an open border that is an open invitation to people
who want to smuggle in drugs or people or terrorism,'' said
Representative Lamar Smith, the Texas Republican who is the main
author of the tough new immigration law. Although the law was
passed in 1996, enforcement of Section 110 _ the requirement that
Canadians fill out entry/exit forms _ has been delayed because of
bitter opposition from Ottawa and congressional leaders from
northern states.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Smith's office characterized Canada as a
``gateway for terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help Canada's case that the country's own spy agency,
the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, reported last April
that major international terrorist groups have ``established
themselves in Canada, seeking safe haven, setting up operational
bases and attempting to gain access to the USA.''
</P>
<P>
   One prominent case involved a Palestinian, Gazi Abu Mezer, who,
shortly after gaining refugee status in Canada, sneaked across the
border and was arrested in July 1997 for allegedly plotting to bomb
subways in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Canadian officials say the real border problem for
the United States is with Mexico, source of more illegal
immigrants, drugs, and other contraband in any given week than is
smuggled from Canada in a year. They say the law will cause
headaches and hassles for Canadians who pose no threat to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Section 110 is terrible for trade, terrible for tourism, and
just terrible overall for both sides,'' said Rodney Moore,
spokesman for the Canadian Embassy in Washington. ``Congress
essentially seems to be trying to address problems the US has on
its southern border without recognizing that the northern border is
not at all similar.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Canadians are in an uproar over a different part of
the immigration law that has already gone into effect that gives US
border inspectors sweeping and arbitrary powers to impose a
five-year entry ban on any non-citizen they suspect of
``misrepresenting'' his or her reason for coming to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The law was intended to provide officers with a way of turning
back would-be illegal immigrants, most notoriously from Mexico, who
try to enter the United States claiming to be short-term tourists
when their real aim is find permanent work.
</P>
<P>
   Critics in the north, however, assert that officers of the US
Immigration and Naturalization Service have used their new
authority to come down hard on Canadians for seemingly minor border
infractions.
</P>
<P>
   There is no judicial appeal process for the so-called expedited
removals _ the on-the-spot five-year bans that can now be imposed
by any border inspector.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a system wide open for abuse,'' said Anna Marie
Gallagher, a lawyer with the American Immigration Law Foundation,
which has filed a federal lawsuit in Washington, D.C., challenging
the law. ``It's giving low-level government officers power to act
as judge, jury, and executioner.''
</P>
<P>
   Last March 4, Donald Chatwin of Abbotsford, British Columbia,
was making the daily trip across the border to a job as a
consultant with a Bellingham, Wash., computer firm, of which he is
also a part-owner.
</P>
<P>
   But on that day, INS officers accused him of violating a
condition of his visa by performing sales duties for the company
when his application for the work permit claimed that the job only
entailed providing technical advice. He was grilled for several
hours, fingerprinted, photographed, and summarily banned from the
United States for five years under the controversial new procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Chatwin is reluctant to discuss the order, which he is trying to
have legally overturned, saying only, ``It's had a pretty drastic
impact on my life. It seems punishment out of all proportion to a
misunderstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Chatwin's lawyer in the United States, Greg Boos of Bellingham,
put it more bluntly. ``The new powers given immigration officers is
turning the border into a ruder, more surly, and even frightening
place for Canadians.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent headlines in Canada certainly seem to suggest so.
</P>
<P>
   ``US border crackdown keeping Canadians out,'' proclaimed a
recent front-page article in the Toronto-based Globe &AMP; Mail, while
the Montreal Gazette ran this banner headline: ``US inspectors turn
trips into nightmares.''
</P>
<P>
   Accurately or not, this perception has become common in Canada
since US immigration officers started wielding their new authority
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a bullying attitude at the border that wasn't there
before,'' said Ontario businessman Bud Williamson, who makes
frequent trips to the United States. ``And a lot of good will at
our borders is going down the drain. It's a huge issue for
Canadians, but Americans seem oblivious to the bad feelings your
new laws are causing among your best friends.''
</P>
<P>
   US border officials, however, say they are fed up with ``wild
rumors created by a Canadian media frenzy,'' in the words of
Russell A. Bergeron Jr., spokesman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue has been overblown, hyped by Canadian newspapers and
TV seizing on a few cases,'' he said. ``The actual numbers of
Canadians subjected to expedited removal is minute, a tiny fraction
of 1 percent of the millions of Canadians who enter without any
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he warned, ``misrepresentation is
misrepresentation, a lie is a lie. Anyone who tries to enter by
twisting the truth or telling a half-truth is violating the law.
That's true in the US, just as it is true in Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Since April 1997, when immigration inspectors started exercising
their new authority, a total of 62,706 foreigners seeking to enter
the United States from Canada or Mexico have been ejected and
slapped with five-year entry bans. But only 470 were Canadians; the
huge majority were Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   The most common misrepresentations are by Canadians entering the
United States to do business, legally or not, who claim to be
traveling on holiday, since they assume that will create less
hassle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a unique and special relationship on the northern
border,'' Bergeron said. ``But there is also supposed to be honor
between friends. A Canadian does not have an absolute right to
cross for any reason. A Canadian is not entitled to tell a white
lie just in hopes of avoiding legitimate questions from immigration
officers enforcing US law.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the cases of a few dozen Canadians hit with the
bans for seemingly petty infractions _ as opposed to Canadians
caught carrying drugs or blatantly trying to deceive _ have
generated extraordinary bad feeling in this nation. Special legal
seminars on ``how to enter the US'' attract thousands of
businesspeople fearful that the slightest slip of the tongue or
forgotten document will result in sanctions that might ruin their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a public relations disaster for the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   So much so that US Ambassador Gordon G. Giffin implored Canadian
Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy not to let a ``few
misunderstandings'' harm relations.
</P>
<P>
   Top Canadian officials, for their part, are far less worried
about the expedited removal issue than the possibility that Section
110, imposing the new travel requirements, might still go into
effect Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new law could put a real chill in relations as well as
causing incalculable harm to businesses on both sides of the
border,'' said a senior Foreign Ministry official.

AT ELVIS SHRINE, ARAB, JEW TUNE OUT DISCORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In this land of biblical patriarchs there is still
only one man referred to simply as ``The King.''
</P>
<P>
   Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   And here in the Jerusalem hills, the life and music of Elvis
Presley, the king of rock 'n' roll, are displayed in all their
glory at a gas station and restaurant known as The Elvis Inn.
</P>
<P>
   From the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway, a 22-foot-high statue of
Elvis looms like an ancient icon over a hilltop between the Israeli
community of Neve Illan and the Arab village of Abu Ghosh.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for a place devoted to Elvis in Israel began 25 years
ago when Uri Yoeli brought two pictures of The King to his small
restaurant, then known as ``The Mountain Inn.'' People commented
about the pictures, and soon the place was referred to by regulars
as the ``Elvis place.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Yoeli has named it ``The Elvis Inn,'' and the walls and even
the ceiling are covered with Elvis photographs, posters, framed
album covers, yellowed newspaper clippings, concert tour
promotions, and every imaginable form of Elvis souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   Every day from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., the place moves to the beat of
Elvis hits from early numbers like ``Jailhouse Rock'' to later hits
like ``Burning Love.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yoeli has framed a ticket stub from the 1971 Salt Lake City
concert. He traveled there to see The King decked out in his
trademark white fringed jumpsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Yoeli, 52, remembers the first time he heard Elvis sing. In
1956, when the nation of Israel was less than a decade old, a girl
in his Jerusalem neighborhood had a 45 of ``One Night.'' His family
owned the block's only record player. It was the beginning of his
love for The King.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every person of our generation has an image of him, a memory
of him. That is what this place is devoted to,'' Yoeli said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Elvis Inn is more than a pop shrine.
</P>
<P>
   It's a place where Jews, Muslims, Christians come together. It's
not unusual to see an ultra-rthodox Jew in black garb filling up at
the gas station while an Israeli Arab family stops for ice cream at
picnic tables and a busload of Christian tourists pause for a
snapshot in front of the statue.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the peace process is deadlocked and the long,
simmering tension of this place can be draining, the Elvis Inn
offers a way of getting away from it all.
</P>
<P>
   Rafi Mohammed, 30, from Abu Ghosh and a regular at the
restaurant, said, ``All politics ends when you hear Elvis. The
truth is, things aren't moving with the peace plan. We all feel
stuck, and you can get very down. This place lets you forget all
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yossi Cohen of Jerusalem loves to stop for coffee. ``This is
where you can relax, you get away from all the divisions,'' he
said. ``Elvis is singing about love and about rock 'n' roll. It
makes you feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce and Sherry Conrad, American tourists, were trying to
decide their favorite Elvis tune. For him, ``Love Me Tender.'' For
her, Elvis's version of ``Amazing Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lost trying to get to our hotel and an Arab guy told
us just to look for the statue of Elvis Presley,'' said Bruce, an
oil worker from Florida stationed in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in Israel a week and we've come here every day.
Hamburgers. Gas station. Cigarettes. Whiskey. Elvis on the jukebox.
Man, you can kid yourself for a minute that you're in America.
What's more American than Elvis?''
</P>

INVESTORS WILL WAIT, SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. JAFFE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One or two more bad days on Wall Street and some investors may
start to feel the walls closing in on them.
</P>
<P>
   Whether those nervous investors overcome their fears and stay
put or bust out and start selling in an attempt to lock in gains
will have a big role in determining what happens next on Wall
Street. And the next few days promise to be critical, both to the
future of individual investors and to the market itself.
</P>
<P>
   Investors may talk brave, but they don't always act that way,
and their resolve already has been tested by the stock market's
five-week, 13.8 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people are ready just yet to abandon ship, but
that could change if the market drops another 3 to 5 percentage
points,'' says Richard Geist, president of the Institute of
Psychology in Investing, a Boston research/consulting organization
that examines investor behavior. ``A bigger decline could change
the whole psychology of `buy on the dips.' If people sell on
strength instead of buying on weakness, everything changes.''
</P>
<P>
   While market watchers say investors have shown no signs of
panicking during the previous dips of the 1990s, investor
psychologists note that current market conditions are different.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the current downturn is slower and more torturous
than the 550-point freefall the market experienced last October.
</P>
<P>
   Boston University professor Jeffrey Heisler says that downturn
happened so quickly that investors were like deer in the
headlights, frozen by indecision and lucky that the downturn
quickly reversed direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``What no one knows is whether no one bailed because everyone
stuck to their discipline or because the worst was over by the time
people recovered from being blindsided by it,'' Heisler says.
</P>
<P>
   How investors will react in the current downturn depends on what
happens next, but observers note that there are any number of
psychological factors at play. Consider the following:
</P>
<P>
   _If the Dow Jones industrial average loses another 114 points,
it will be off 15 percent from its peak on July 17.
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly eight years since the Dow last gave back 15
percent of its value, the longest stretch in history without a
decline of that magnitude. The four next-longest periods without a
bear market ended in the crashes of 1929 and 1987, and with the
declines of about 25 percent over several years in the 1940s and
1960s. And none of those growth periods was even half as long as
the market's current spurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is simply a historical fact that the longer you go without
healthy corrections or bear markets, the more likely the next
downturn turns out to be something larger than anyone expects,''
says James Stack, publisher of the Investech newsletter in
Whitefish, Mont. ``People have learned to buy on the dips, but this
might not be just another dip. People should be worried about the
magnitude of what could happen next.''
</P>
<P>
   _If the Dow's loss grows from 114 points to 144, it breaks the
level it held at the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, psychologists warn, the nerves could really kick
in. One factor that has kept people in the market over the last
five weeks was that the market was still positive for the whole
year.
</P>
<P>
   Once you change that _ dropping below 8000 to boot _ there might
be more fear.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics note that other indices besides the Dow already have
lost more than 15 percent and that investors have held on, but
mounting declines across-the-board could eventually lead to
investors pulling the rip cord.
</P>
<P>
   ``There comes a point where people no longer see the market like
rust eating at the hull of the ship or moss eating the roof,'' says
Donald MacGregor, senior researcher at Decision Research in Eugene,
Ore. ``They decide `This is the bottom falling out quickly.'
Something is going to trigger that feeling, and that is when we see
investors cut and run.''
</P>
<P>
   _The vast majority of money in the stock market today _
including by most estimates almost 90 percent of everything in
stock mutual funds _ was not there for the last bear market.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of long, deep, slow losses is entirely new to
most investors. Moreover, psychologists note that people whose
expectations are met _ whether in investing or in general _ tend to
react very strongly when they suddenly are let down.
</P>
<P>
   It makes no difference whether they believe the talk shows,
magazines, newsletters, or in something silly like Super Bowl
theory _ by which January's win by the Denver Broncos of the
American Football Conference supposedly signaled a downturn for the
year. The one universal truth about investors is that none of them
wants to suffer losses for too long.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the success of the last few years may also cause
some people to pull back. The oversized gains of the mid-1990s have
helped some investors reach their goals, such as financing a
college education. They will not want to see that success snatched
away. That can prompt a switch into survival mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who say they will hold on through the bottom of a
bear market won't actually do it,'' says Mark Hulbert, a faculty
member for the Congress on the Psychology of Investing and
publisher of the Hulbert Financial Digest, which tracks newsletter
performance. ``They may believe in buy-and-hold now, but they will
get to a point _ if losses keep mounting _ when they say `I was
wrong.'''
</P>
<P>
   Any number of indicators show signs that investor resolve
already is weakening. Less money is flowing into stocks and more
into money-market funds, a sign that investors are getting more
conservative. Early reports indicate that this change includes
assets held in retirement plans, which presumably are long-term
holdings in which the investor can ride out the downturns.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the financial psychologists acknowledge having no
idea how investors will react, most believe that staying the course
will be the right action for those who can stomach whatever comes
next.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will take some of the giddiness out of the market, but I
don't think it will make people suddenly believe that only idiots
invest in stocks,'' says Meir Statman, a Santa Clara University
professor who studies behavioral finance. ``Everyone believes
things will go up again in the future _ maybe soon, maybe not _ so
pulling back is probably a mistake. But investors are like kids
sometimes: They just don't get it and won't believe you until they
make mistakes for themselves.''

CLANCY'S `RAINBOW' JUST TOO SILLY TO THRILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
RAINBOW SIX 
By Tom Clancy 
Putnam, 740 pp., $27.95 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What happens when a writer of military thrillers runs out of
plausible enemies? Here's a hint _ it's not pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Just take a peek at the latest from old reliable himself, Tom
Clancy. He's in a bad way for bad guys. Since the Cold War ended,
Clancy has ginned up a succession of ruthless new adversaries _
Colombian drug lords, Iranian fanatics, Japanese lunatics. Yet
miscreants and malefactors have gotten a bit thin on the ground _
at least the kind suitable for the attentions of Clancy's
cold-eyed, high-tech warriors.
</P>
<P>
   But the god of bestsellers is a demanding god. Clancy knows that
he must continue to heap menace upon menace and thrill upon thrill
to keep his readers satiated. And so the dust jacket of his latest
book, ``Rainbow Six,'' promises the ultimate villains, ``a band of
men and women so extreme that their success could literally mean
the end of life on this earth as we know it.''
</P>
<P>
   The dust jacket tells us no more about these hell-spawned
fiends, perhaps to preserve an aura of suspense, but more likely to
prevent bookstore browsers from bursting into hysterical laughter.
</P>
<P>
   For this time out, Clancy's hero John Clark must save the world
from environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   You heard right. It's a cabal of tree-huggers, led by a biotech
billionaire who is convinced that the only hope for the earth's
ecosystem is the near-total extermination of the human race. Armed
with his limitless wealth, this mastermind launches an
international plot to infect all but a chosen few with a deadly new
strain of the Ebola virus that'll leave the earth fresh and pure
again, except for a few billion fetid corpses.
</P>
<P>
   The faithful Clancy fan, once he's stopped giggling, will notice
that the old boy has taken to repeating himself. It seems odd for a
free-market type like Clancy to choose plutocratic loonies as his
villains, but this makes his second trip to that well. A couple
books ago, in ``Debt of Honor,'' it was a Japanese magnate pulling
the strings. And then there's this business of the Ebola virus.
Just one book earlier, in ``Executive Orders,'' the Iranians tried
that trick.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, apart from the freelance mayhem of nut cases like the
Unabomber, the environmental movement hasn't displayed a whole lot
in the way of blood lust. Certainly not enough to allow for 740
pages of military muscle-flexing. So Clancy serves up a bizarre
plot in which our eco-psycho spends millions to fund a variety of
terrorist groups. It's hard to see why, when he's just going to
exterminate everybody in the end. But at least it gives John Clark
and his band of hard men lots of opportunities to shout ``Execute!
Execute!'' into their walkie-talkies while redecorating Europe with
the brains of their adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy made his name by building a thoroughly credible thriller
around an outrageous premise. ``The Hunt for Red October'' is a
rollicking read; it leaves you utterly persuaded that the CIA could
steal a nuclear submarine from the Soviet Navy, and get away with
it. Then again, Clancy stretched his legs a bit with ``Clear and
Present Danger.'' Amid the usual flag-waving, this book offered a
sober meditation on the limits of military force, and the
consequences of pulling the trigger once too often.
</P>
<P>
   But his series of novels about Clark and CIA
analyst-turned-president Jack Ryan become more implausible with
each outing. With ``Rainbow Six,'' Clancy's hit the wall. Even his
considerable narrative talent can do nothing to rescue this
ridiculous tale. And I fear there's worse to come. On a recent talk
show, Clancy said he's got three more novels in the pipeline.
There's no telling what we're in for _ an all-female army of
genetically engineered Amazons, perhaps, led by a fanatical devotee
of Minister Louis Farrakhan.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh _ people will buy it. They're buying ``Rainbow
Six,'' aren't they?

PAX TV TUNES IN TO SPIRITUAL SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Why a seventh network?'' repeated Lowell ``Bud'' Paxson. ``Why
not?''
</P>
<P>
   Paxson's jaunty optimism notwithstanding, skepticism surrounds
the launch today of Pax TV, his ``family-friendly'' alternative to
the television networks he dismisses as ``lemmings'': NBC, ABC,
CBS, Fox, UPN, and the WB.
</P>
<P>
   From Wall Street, Madison Avenue, and Hollywood have come
rumblings of doubt that Paxson can corral enough viewers and
advertisers to &UR;  &LR; make Pax TV more than a blip on the television
screen.
</P>
<P>
   But the 63-year-old multimillionaire who cofounded the Home
Shopping Network _ and who says he believes divine intervention has
played a hand in the establishment of his new network _ is not
easily daunted. ``The naysayers said we wouldn't launch, and now
that we're going to launch, they say we're going to fail,'' said
Paxson. ``They're going to be wrong twice.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Paxson sees it, at a time when other networks are
``fighting for the young and edgy shows and who can do the most
violence and sex,'' the Pax TV lineup represents the ultimate in
counter-programming, with reruns of such G-rated fare as ``Touched
by an Angel,'' ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,'' ``Diagnosis Murder,''
``Highway to Heaven,'' and ``I'll Fly Away'' (shows drawn from the
very networks Paxson views as lemmings).
</P>
<P>
   ``Counter-programming is always a good idea,'' said Paxson, the
chairman of Paxson Communications Corp., a Florida-based company
that owns 75 TV stations. Paxson added that he views the ``Hallmark
Hall of Fame'' specials as a model for what his network will offer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to reruns, the network also will show original
programming such as two new talk shows, ``Great Day America'' and
``Woman's Day,'' along with several children's shows and ``Flipper:
The New Adventures.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he emphasizes ``this network is not here to
televangelize,'' Paxson says he wants Pax TV to ``tap into the
spiritual side'' of a nation where most citizens describe
themselves as religious. ``It's going to be family programming with
a little touch of the spiritual.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxson, a born-again Christian, says he discerns the hand of God
in the sequence of events that led to Pax TV. ``I don't say He
called; I never got a phone call, I never heard His voice,'' said
Paxson. ``But I kept seeing the doors opened. All the things that
happened to us couldn't have happened without a little divine
intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the launch of Pax TV, today marks the publication
date for ``Threading the Needle: The Pax Net Story,'' written by
Paxson with Gary Templeton. (The new network was originally called
Pax Net before being renamed Pax TV.)
</P>
<P>
   Pax TV will air on 88 stations, including stations in all top 20
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Though he hopes for more viewers, Paxson argues that Pax TV
needs only a .6 rating in prime time _ about 600,000 viewers _ to
break even, and predicts the network will turn a profit within its
first six months.
</P>
<P>
   TV industry consultant Paul R. Krumins, publisher of a newletter
called Syndication News, strongly disagrees with both assertions.
``No one in the television industry will agree with that,'' said
Krumins. ``The economics just don't work.''
</P>
<P>
   While Krumins said he thinks some viewers will be receptive to
family-oriented programming, he contended that neither national nor
local advertisers will be eager to sign up with a network that
can't deliver a sizable audience. Paxson needs strong ratings to
recoup the money he paid for programming, Krumins said.
</P>
<P>
   The debut of Pax TV has not been without controversy. Last
month, the network ran an ad in trade magazines that some critics
viewed as anti-gay. The ad accused ``some so-called creative
people'' of using TV to ``peddle every kind of alternative language
and lifestyle to our kids.'' Pax TV president Jeff Sagansky
apologized in July, saying the ad was meant ``to make the point
about the need for family programming and not to pass judgment on
any person or lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxson dismisses the flap as ``something the media people
dreamed up and tried to make a story of.'' He said the subject of
homosexuality will be ``treated with absolute respect'' on Pax TV.
``It's nothing we want to run from,'' he said. ``We want to treat
it with dignity.''

DIETARY-SUPPLEMENT INDUSTRY FLEXES ITS MUSCLES

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals' Mark McGwire closes in on the home run
record. The Denver Broncos win the Super Bowl. And the dietary
supplements the athletes use disappear from store shelves around
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Driven in part by a national obsession with health and
longevity, the dietary supplement industry has grown to a $12
billion industry. But the booming business in so-called performance
enhancers such as androstenedione and creatine is occurring amid
conflicting claims about their effectiveness and safety, and in an
industry that is almost totally unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials are starting to search for a way to put on the
brakes _ especially because some manufacturers are aiming their
marketing strategies at high school athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do $100 million in annual sales,'' said Len Moskovits, the
president and chief economic officer of Met-Rx USA Inc., of Irvine,
Calif., an industry leader in the manufacturing of protein shakes
and bars, along with more controversial products containing the
amino acid creatine (CREE-uh-teen). ``We started out in 1991 and
we've doubled our sales almost every year we've been around, and I
believe it is not because we are such great marketers but because
the consumer interest just keeps on increasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, more than 10 retailers throughout the Boston area
said they found themselves running through their available stocks
of testosterone precursor androstenedione (an-dro-STEEN-die-own)
after a bottle of it was discovered in the locker of McGwire _ who
is in a historic, much-publicized pursuit of the game's
single-season home run record.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers, who last week were forced to begin shipping their
product by overnight delivery, admit it will be autumn before they
can keep pace with the demand generated by the McGwire story.
</P>
<P>
   A similar increase in consumer interest in creatine products,
among the most popular dietary supplements, accompanied the Super
Bowl victory of the Denver Broncos in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creatine products started flying off the shelves _ just like
andro this week _ because three-quarters of the Broncos used these
products,'' said Rick Antonelli, a salesman at Newbury Naturals in
Boston. ``People were saying, `Wow! Did the Denver Broncos beat the
mighty Green Bay Packers. And they use this stuff?'''
</P>
<P>
   Creatine is a shining star in the dietary supplement industry.
In 1995, about six years after creatine was developed, sales
totalled $30 million, according to the Nutrition Business Journal.
This year, sales are projected to exceed $180 million.
</P>
<P>
   Androstenedione, and similar ``andro products'' like Met-Rx's
Androdiol, were introduced within the past year. Sales were
expected to total perhaps $10 million annually, at first. In the
wake of the McGwire story, Moscovits and others say they expect
sales to total $70 million to $100 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it do for this business?'' Moskovits said. ``If Mark
McGwire had said he eats a bunch of radishes every morning,
everyone would go out and buy radishes. Anyone who was on the fence
about these products before, they got off the fence this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the escalating consumer demand and the manufacturers' drive
to meet it is enormous concern about the consequences for public
health, and outright attempts to halt the trend.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Association of Tennis Professionals Tour
reiterated its ban on androstenedione and the General Nutrition
Centers ordered its 3,700 stores not to sell it because of safety
concerns. Major League Baseball and the players' union called on
doctors to research muscle-enhancing supplements. In Rome,
meanwhile, a major Italian soccer commissioner suggested that
creatine be banned or greatly restricted.
</P>
<P>
   The decade-long trend of increasing interest in dietary
supplements is occurring amid relaxed government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Congress loosened restrictions on the sale of dietary
supplements. Driven in large part by consumers' voracious appetite,
a bi-partisan group of congressmen relaxed requirements for
pre-market approval by the Food and Drug Administration. They also
allowed the manufacturers greater flexibility to make claims about
the performance of their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``As dietary supplements become increasingly popular it is all
the more important that government have adequate tools to make sure
these products are safe and well regulated,'' said Bruce
Silverglade, legal director for the Center for Science in the
Public Interest. ``Unfortunately, Congress in 1994 rendered the
Food and Drug Administration toothless. Some people may have to get
hurt before Congress takes a look at it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, doctors and scientists are hoping that the
manufacturers police themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it really comes down to company by company,'' said
Richard Kreider, director of the Sports Nutrition Laboratory at the
University of Memphis. ``The major companies usually do a fairly
good job in honestly explaining what their products do and do not
do. Some of the newer smaller companies that are more aggressive in
the market, trying to find a niche, may be of more concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Kreider and other nutritionists said it is especially important
that companies support independent research. Moskovits says Met-Rx
is particularly proud of its spending on research, and officials at
EAS say they spend $1 million annually on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get creatine anywhere, but only a handful of companies
are standing behind it in that way,'' Kreider said.
</P>
<P>
   More than a few officials fear that young athletes are
particularly at risk in this unregulated market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want a kid influenced by a slick marketing technique
into taking something they ought not to be taking, especially if
the thought is that it is a shortcut to athletic success,'' said
Bill Gaine, of the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Gaine said that coaches and athletic administrators around
Massachusetts have discovered what doctors and nutritionists
already know: Definitive information on many dietary supplements is
extremely difficult to come by. The association hopes to adopt a
more general policy this month mandating that use of the products
occur only under the supervision of parents and coaches and after
consultation with doctors, Gaine said.
</P>
<P>
   Moscovits admits that part of Met-Rx's marketing strategy for
creatine products is an appeal to youths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We advertise in publications that they read, like American
Football Quarterly, which goes to high school and college
coaches,'' he said. ``We offer a program called Mentor, and they
can get the same stuff the pros use but at a lower cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscovits said some of the ads feature high school cheerleaders
to attract the attention of young male athletes. But he also said
that Met-Rx would never market its Androdiol products to youths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not pitch them to high school athletes because we think
it would be dangerous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Pastner, president of the Massachusetts High School
Football Coaches Association, says he sees more than a few
advertisements and solicitations for the supplements and enhancers.
``When I get them,'' Pastner said, ``I throw them right in the
trash.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastner and many nutritionists say the biggest danger of the
supplement fad is that younger athletes will simply forget that the
best way to train is to eat properly and work hard. Pastner says he
remains a devotee of ``three or four meals a day and lots of
frappes'' for players who need to bulk up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the high school audiences, advertising appeals to them
in a big way,'' said Nancy Clark, a sports nutritionist. ``They are
so malleable. What I get concerned about is that people forget that
food works. So many people reach for this magic bullet and they
forget about breakfast and lunch.''

NEW YORK STATES STICK VOLUNTEER RESCUE WORKERS WITH $4,000 BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAY JOCHNOWITZ  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHOHARIE, N.Y. _ The volunteer rescue workers who saved Graig
Douglas didn't expect money for the dangerous job they did. On the
hand, they didn't expect a bill either. But that's what they got.
</P>
<P>
   When Douglas found himself wedged in a tunnel on July 18, the
state of New York's emergency system kicked into high gear, sending
a C-12 military transport plane to pick up 11 volunteers from three
states who were experienced _ and small enough _ to rescue the
24-year-old Medford, Mass., man from the narrow cave.
</P>
<P>
   But after getting Douglas out of his tight squeeze two days
later, the volunteers, who had come from Maryland, Virginia and
West Virginia and already had missed a day of work, found that New
York state was in no hurry to send them home.
</P>
<P>
   With the emergency over, the volunteers were told that flying
them home was out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no way we could justify flying them back on a
military aircraft,'' confirmed Don Mower, spokesman for the State
Emergency Management Office.
</P>
<P>
   So, they were told, they'd have to wait at least a day, and then
pile into a 15-person van that one caving expert said couldn't
possibly have fit an 11-person team and all their climbing gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a physical impossibility,'' said Emily Davis Mobley, a
nationally known caver and spokeswoman for the Albany-Schoharie
County Cave Rescue Team. She said the arrangement also required the
volunteers to stay overnight at the State University College at
Cobleskill. Most, she said, were already taking personal time off
from work.
</P>
<P>
   Partly as a result of the state's decision, the volunteers who
rescued Douglas were left with a bill estimated at $3,000 to
$4,000. Of that, Mobley said she personally paid $1,500 to charter
a larger bus to drive them back that Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the bus, Mobley said she expects her home phone bill
to hit $600 to $800 for calls around the country in search of
volunteers. Other people have cell phone bills, although at least
one company, Cellular One, has agreed to forgive one volunteer's
bill of about $150 for the weekend. At least one rescue worker lost
a 100-foot climbing rope worth about $50, and another dozen or so
more ropes are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley said that since word got around about the bills, cavers
have raised about $2,000 from various donations including $750 in
loose change and bills that came in at the National Speleological
Society convention in Albany two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, still using crutches but hoping to walk without them in
a month or so, said his medical insurance covered his bills and
about the only expense he faced personally was ``my gear got beat
up.'' He said he's trying to help raise money to cover the
remaining bills; plans are being made for a bike-athon along the
Maine coast later this year.
</P>
<P>
   There is, so far, no exact accounting of the bills, which Mobley
said may also include some equipment lost by local fire or rescue
squads. Anything left over will be donated either to the society or
to local rescue companies, she said.

`TITANIC' SETS SAIL; A SHALLOW `DREAM' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES:  &UR; ``Titanic'' &LR;  _ By now everyone has made up their
minds about this mega-movie. Director James Cameron made Leonardo
DiCaprio a star, no small task, and revived Gloria Stuart's career.
But I don't think it's as good as ``The Poseidon Adventure.'' A
little too treacly and overwrought for my tastes. Rent ``Lifeboat''
instead and see what Hitchcock did with a lot less space and money
but a lot more talent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Dream for an Insomniac'' &LR;  _ Ione Skye, who showed such
potential in the brilliant teen noir ``The River's Edge,'' flattens
out in this pretentious trifle that panders to a young, supposedly
hip audience. If they are hip, they'll just stay away from this
silly love story. Jennifer Aniston co-stars as an actress and many
of the lines are ``Friends'' derivatives.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Absolutely Fabulous Moments''  &LR; _ Highlights from the
hilarious British comedy that originally aired on Comedy Central.
Some of the skits are even funnier in this form than in their
original context.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Naked Lies'' &LR;  _ Shannon Tweed, one of the most underrated
actresses, stars in another direct-to-video erotic thriller. Aside
from being sexy, Tweed has a great sense of humor and has shown, on
many occasions, an ability to interpret a role with far more
sophistication than many of her more highly regarded colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Homegrown'' &LR;  _ The mainstream studios rarely know what to do
with dark comedies and this hilarious ode to paranoia is a perfect
example. When it failed to do good business opening weekend,
Columbia lost interest in it theatrically. This is a terrific
word-of-mouth picture that should find its audience among the more
sophisticated of the video crowd. Hank Azaria is particularly good
in an ensemble cast that includes Billy Bob Thornton, John Lithgow,
and Jon Bon Jovi.

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
 ! poor, !! fair, !!! good, !!!! excellent  
 
!!! 1/2 ``The Chambermaid''  By far the more interesting of the two
Titanic-themed movies of the '90s, this French film turns a chance
encounter on the eve of the sailing into a delicious meditation on
the progression from embellished storytelling to art (Unrated)
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! &UR; 1/2 ``Doing Time for Patsy Cline''  &LR; Structually rambling but
involvingly performed, this Aussie road romance throws an innocent
dreamer (Matt Day) into the even more desperate dreams of a shady
promoter (Richard Roxburgh) and a fragile singer (Miranda Otto) as
they try to break free of the outback to make it to Nashville.
(Unrated)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! &UR; ``54''  &LR; This film about the heady whirl of Manhattan's disco
mecca of the '70s is too superficial to satisfy despite a highly
watchable performance by Mike Myers as Studio 54 mastermind Steve
Rubell. He's made user-friendly by being presented as mostly
zonked-out. The real story of the rise of celebrity culture is
submerged in a conventional struggle between bad glitz and
working-class purity, as embodied by Ryan Phillippe and Neve
Campbell. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! &UR; 1/2 ``Nights of Cabiria''  &LR; A beautifully restored version of
Federico Fellini's 1957 Oscsar-winning classic starring his actress
wife, Giulietta Masina, in her richest performance. She combines
ladylike spunkiness and sad-eyed clowning as a resilient Roman
streetwalker whose brutal life never extinguishes the romantic
longing in her innocent heart. (Unrated)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FL)!!! &UR; ``Slums of Beverly Hills''  &LR; Warm, funny, endearingly
raunchy coming-of-age film based on growing up tacky in Beverly
Hills. Natasha Lyonne is adorable as the teen heroine of a
hard-pressed family and Alan Arkin is poignant and funny as her
divorced dad who can't seem to get the American dream right. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! &UR; 1/2 ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love''  &LR; More ambitious than the usual
Hollywood biopic, and filled with snazzy musical numbers, this
easy-to-take film nevertheless misses getting under the skin of
single-hit doo-wop sensation Frankie Lymon as it tells the story
from the vantage points of the three women claiming to be his
widow, all wanting the royalties piling up since his death. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! &UR; ``Your Friends &AMP; Neighbors''  &LR; Not as jolting or invigorating as
``In the Company of Men,'' Neil LaBute's second look at savage
sexual game-playing sends six contemporary urban types to bed, all
miserably, an inevitability considering how little they bring to
it. There's black humor therapeutic intent beneath it all, but the
superior ensemble performance makes you dig through a lot of sexual
tundra to find it beneath the anger posing as lust. (R)

A LOVE AFFAIR WITH LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURA YUEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of course he cries at the movies. British screenwriter William
Nicholson has written his share of poignant words for the cinema,
words that have engendered streams of tears in his audiences. So
it's only fitting that he, too, likes to be moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always cry in a good movie,'' Nicholson unabashedly admits.
``I will cry in a good commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   He creates his most lucid, genuine characters when he examines
life through the eyes of a woman. Nicholson helped Jodie Foster win
an Oscar nomination for his rendering of ``Nell,'' the heartfelt
tale of a ``woman-child'' raised in the backwoods speaking a
language all her own. He added dimension to Debra Winger's
character in ``Shadowlands,'' a biographical film about writer C.S.
Lewis that earned the screenwriter an Academy Award nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Nicholson has breathed life into another female
creation, Elisabeth Laurier, the strong-willed governess whose
story is central to ``Firelight,'' debuting in the States on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife says it's because I am a woman,'' explains Nicholson,
his eyes crinkling up little crescent moons. ``I'm interested in
all that feely stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   In a red sport coat, the 50-year-old writer muses over a bowl of
pasta in a restaurant at the Four Seasons, trying to analyze how he
began his love affair with the story of love itself. After a few
minutes of tossing around some theories, he settles for a Freudian
approach: Love stories are therapy to Nicholson, a product of an
all-male boarding school in England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I grew up very shy about girls,'' he reveals. ``I
certainly hadn't had a girlfriend until I left school at the age of
18. Well, I certainly was a virgin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had lots of fears and anxieties about, you know, would
anybody love me? Would I ever find a girlfriend? ... Love stories
reassure those anxieties, because in a love story, the person who
wants the lover usually gets the lover.''
</P>
<P>
   With that known, there's little wonder that a happy ending
awaits in the costume drama ``Firelight.'' In the Victorian-era
piece, Nicholson intertwined his two passions _ love for a woman
and love for a child. The poor and headstrong Swiss protagonist
pays off her father's debts by bearing a child of an English
aristocrat, whose comatose wife was paralyzed in an accident. Seven
years later, curiosity leads Elisabeth to become governess to her
own daughter, who has grown up spoiled and in need of a mother.
</P>
<P>
   With his new film, the first he has directed, Nicholson hopes
audience members will experience the same gripping emotion he feels
when watching a good romantic movie. ``I don't know why,'' he says,
``but the best experience I can have in the cinema is to fall in
love with the main characters and long for them to get together. I
like to feel that sensation of a very good love story, where you
just go `Ahhhhhh.'''
</P>
<P>
   The two biggest complaints Nicholson has heard are that the
drama is too long and too ``period.'' But essentially, he says,
that's what he intended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a pace that would serve the particular kind of
intensity I was seeking,'' says Nicholson, whose movie opened the
Seattle International Film Festival in May. ``If you're going to do
the kind of movie I was doing, you have to tell your audience right
away in the beginning: `Calm down. Pay attention. You're in good
hands _ I know what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nineteenth-century England seemed a likely setting for harsh
social mores oppressing two impassioned lovers _ in this case, a
poor governess and a married squire. Obstacles to such a match are
rarely seen in contemporary movies today, Nicholson says. As Jack
Nicholson's coarse and obsessive-compulsive character demonstrated
in ``As Good As It Gets,'' if many couples on-screen can't work out
a relationship, it's because of individual neuroses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it can be done brilliantly, what you don't get from
that is that tremendous surge of passion,'' says Bill Nicholson,
``that tremendous blood, relief, and excitement you get in an
old-style love story.''
</P>
<P>
   In his directorial debut, Nicholson reveled in his freedom to
compose images that would complement the words he had written. The
sudden ownership in crafting the visuals of a movie was ``like a
whole new toy box,'' he says. For instance, he constrasted the
cold, white winter light against the warm hues provided by the
firelight, a backdrop to many of the love scenes and meaningful
mother-daughter talks.
</P>
<P>
   He chose Firle Place, a mansion just 10 minutes from where he
lives, to shoot the movie. The middle-aged father of three _ ages
4, 7, and 9 _ says he can now provide a strong fatherly presence he
couldn't guarantee 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   An aspiring novelist, Nicholson landed what he considered a day
job making documentaries for the BBC after graduating from the
University of Cambridge in England. He would spend three hours
before work every morning penning his manuscripts _ all eight to be
turned down by publishers. Meanwhile, he made about 50 television
documentaries from the mid-1970s to mid-1980s. ``I didn't take it
at all seriously, and as a result, I did it rather well,'' he
recalls. ``I was relaxed about it because I always assumed I was
going to be a famous novelist.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 20s, when he began ``making a mess out of
relationships,'' he allowed his inquisitive nature to cross over
from work to dating. He recalls quizzing every girlfriend, asking
them, ```What does it feel to be like you?' and `What do you want
from men?' `Who did you fall in love with first?' and `Why did you
sleep with him?'''
</P>
<P>
   From his casual interrogations over the years, he says, he
acquired a knowledge of the emotional dynamics between men and
women.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote ``Shadowlands,'' his retelling of the romance between
Lewis and American poet Joy Gresham, as a TV drama in 1985, and he
soon adapted it to a play and then a movie starring Anthony Hopkins
and Winger. All incarnations of ``Shadowlands'' won numerous awards
and put Nicholson on the map in the movie business.
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Firelight,'' his pen has barely slowed. A movie based on
Nelson Mandela's autobiography, ``Long Walk to Freedom,'' will open
October next year. Also, ``American Caesar'' for Universal Studios
is still in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife is a terrific cook and loves good food,'' Nicholson
says of Virginia, whom he married just 10 years ago. ``She's taught
me to love good food.'' As he munches on his cavatappi _ a noodle
he has ``never heard of in his life; it sounds like some dance'' _
he explains that before they met, he never bothered grocery
shopping or cooking. He dined in restaurants or simply ate
``rubbish.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he is regarded as a hot screenwriter of this decade,
Nicholson still chooses not to read critics' reviews of his work.
If the comments are less than flattering, his wife informs the
family, ``Daddy got a poor review,'' to which the children reply,
``Oh, poor Daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably think I'm a terrific failure,'' he says. ``But I
want them to know that I go on working even when things go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Firelight,'' Elisabeth's bold quest to find her daughter
reveals a human instinct to nurture one's own. Nicholson concedes
that he couldn't have written this script if he had not fathered
children. Having a child ``is a million miles more powerful than
anything _ sex, fame, being a millionaire,'' he says. ``Anybody who
has a child knows it, but nobody ever writes about it because it's
so normal, so common. And yet it's the most explosively
extraordinary experience of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   In a time of parody and satire, or clever movies about
detectives, or movies in which ``people chase each other and shoot
each other,'' Nicholson remains a lover of the simple story. He
despises convoluted plots that ``intimidate'' the viewer into not
criticizing them.
</P>
<P>
   Too many books and movies, he says, refrain from telling simple
stories because they fear others will find them simple and naive.
Instead they orchestrate a game to prove they're clever, a game
Nicholson says he'd rather not play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to communicate a message. All these stories are
about human truth. I just want to get that response from the
audience: `Yes, I've felt that, too.'''

ROBERT REDFORD'S INDIE VISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can't go to Sundance? No problem. Sundance is coming to you.
Once reachable only by trekking to Utah, it's now as close as your
couch and your cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, MediaOne has been beaming the Sundance Channel for
the last month to some Boston-area cable markets. It's a quantum
leap for the Sundance Institute, the independent filmmakers' haven
founded in 1981 by Robert Redford and named for the outlaw he
played in ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.'' In the near
future, there'll be another leap, as Redford moves Sundance films
into newly built movie theaters in different cities, in league with
General Cinemas.
</P>
<P>
   But that's then, and this is now. Redford, who just turned 61
and doesn't look jet-lagged, although he says he is after promoting
``The Horse Whisperer'' in Europe, has sidled into town to spread
the word about Sundance on TV. ``It's not about commerciality,''
says the actor, director, producer, and environmental activist.
``It's about whether a film has a fresh vision or a fresh voice.
I've worked on both sides of the street. My heart has been in the
smaller film, inclined toward personal stories that have a deeper
root beyond what I call the popcorn experience.''
</P>
<P>
   So while other movie channels will celebrate the kinds of names
that get preserved in Hollywood cement, the Sundance Channel will
spotlight indie diva Parker Posey next month by screening ``Party
Girl,'' ``Drunks,'' ``Waiting for Guffman,'' ``Basquiat,'' ``The
Daytrippers,'' and ``subUrbia.'' Showcasing various facets of
Parker's smart, sentient, edgy persona in different roles, the
films will be supplemented by interview footage in which Parker
goes on record about them and herself.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, says Redford, relaxing for a moment in a Harvard
Square hotel, it was important to dispel any idea that the Sundance
Channel might have been conceived as a vanity outlet. The films
don't reflect his personal taste, Redford says. The vigor of a
given filmmaker's vision is the only criterion. ``You might like
something that I think is lousy,'' Redford says, the point being
that it's not Redford's likes and dislikes that govern the
programming, but the principles of diversity, choices, and
providing visibility for films otherwise shortchanged in the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Among other September films on the channel will be ``Choose
Me,'' ``Blue Velvet,'' ``Notes from Underground,'' ``Fargo,'' ``The
Eighth Day,'' ``Savage Nights,'' ``The Darien Gap,'' ``Arizona
Dream,'' ``Inside Monkey Zetterland,'' and ``Nobody Loves Me.'' Few
of these independent features enjoyed long theatrical runs. Other
films on the schedule _ especially shorts, documentaries, and films
by gay and ethnic minority filmmakers _ hardly got runs at all.
Later this year look for the French film ``Ridicule,'' ``The New
Age,'' ``Touch,'' ``In the Company of Men,'' ``The Long Way Home,''
``Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead,'' and ``Looking for
Richard.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Sundance Channel unique, Redford says, is its
policy of showing everything, even premieres, uncut and
commercial-free. Also, he says, he won't restrict programming to
films previously shown at the Sundance Festival _ although many
will be Sundance alumni, including premieres deemed worthy of
festival showings, but as yet without commercial distribution
deals. That many got made at all is due to Sundance backing. When
Redford established the festival back in 1980, there was almost no
place for independent films to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to put something back in the industry,'' Redford
says. ``I didn't know at the time that it was going to coincide
with a change taking place in the marketplace with videos and
cable. The changes came on so fast and so strong that very quickly
it became clear that the distribution sources were going to
outweigh the production sources. You can do the math on it pretty
easily. Say the industry's going this way and the distribution
channels are going that way, and suddenly there's this gap. So the
purpose of just creating an opportunity for new artists to have a
place to come and work and develop their skills suddenly became an
opportunity in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, while wary of the danger that Sundance's rapid growth may
blur its original purpose, Redford says that smaller, quirkier,
more personal films may get made but, in many cases, still have
nowhere to go. Hence the cable channel, which will include uncut
premieres of films that might subsequently proceed to theatrical
release _ possibly even in the Sundance theaters Redford envisions.
These, he says, will be anything but the multiplexes dotting
suburban malls. They'll be free-standing buildings, Redford says,
either newly built or converted from other uses, with
community-oriented adjuncts, like coffee shops, bookstores, and
lecture rooms for audiences to meet filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Down the line, Redford says, will be live coverage of each
January's Sundance Festivals, enabling home viewers to track
audience awards and each year's surprises and crop of new faces.
When the festival began in 1981, Redford says, he personally saw
all 32 films. Now he can't see the dozens of presentations, culled
from hundreds of entries. Ironically, environmental activist
Redford has had to reconfigure the festival, putting limits on
growth, designating certain theaters for certain kinds of films,
such as, say, documentaries, alleviating the traffic jams on the
snowy streets of Park City, filled to overflowing each year,
especially with industry types.
</P>
<P>
   Redford's communally oriented view of what might be called the
off-Broadway film world may seem paradoxical, in view of his
private nature. He doesn't like talking about himself, makes a face
when he speaks of what he calls the ``cosmetic'' aspects of
maintaining his standing as the kind of star presence that makes it
possible for him to bankroll films and projects close to his heart.
He plays the game, but remains uncomfortable about plugging his
films, even ones in which he's totally immersed, like his current
``The Horse Whisperer.''
</P>
<P>
   Redford's focus on ``The Horse Whisperer'' meant he had to limit
his role in another pet project, ``A Civil Action,'' to that of
producer. Based on Jonathan Harr's book about a lawsuit brought by
eight Woburn families against coroporations they charged with
polluting their drinking water, and starring John Travolta and
Robert Duvall, it's due out at Christmas. ``Fewer and fewer films
are about real-life situations and communities in our society, or
affect people on the human level. This one had such a strong
root,'' Redrord says, ``people vs. the corporation and the power of
money that conceals those abuses and the cost of it all. I just
thought that was very dramatic stuff. Still do.''

COMEDIANS GET SERIOUS ABOUT ALBUMS AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerry Seinfeld, in a press conference prior to his live comedy
special earlier this month, proclaimed that his first comedy album
would be available in late September.
</P>
<P>
   First comedy album? It seems odd that the star of one of the
most successful situation comedies in television history and a guy
who's been at the top of the stand-up game for more than 20 years
is just releasing his first comedy recording.
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld said that it was because comedy albums didn't sell in
the '80s and early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just started to sell again,'' he said, ``so we'll be
putting out a CD version of the special.''
</P>
<P>
   During the '60s and early '70s, many of today's comedians grew
up with comedy albums by Bill Cosby, Bob Newhart, Richard Pryor,
the Smothers Brothers, and other popular comic acts. Seinfeld
proudly points to the fact that he literally wore out Cosby's
records. In those days, comedy records such as Cosby's sold in the
millions. But sales dipped to practically nothing in the '80s. The
major cause for the decline was competition from cable television
and an oversaturation of the comedy market.
</P>
<P>
   But things are looking up. It's likely that Seinfeld's album,
``I'm Telling You For the Last Time,'' will sell a million copies
during its first week in release and, while there are no hard and
fast statistics on comedy album sales in general, their popularity
is steadily climbing.
</P>
<P>
   During the past week, I listened to a representative sampling of
some of the more interesting new albums and significant
re-releases. I give you both the witty and the witless.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``THE AMERICAN COMEDY BOX _ 1915-1994'' (Rhino)
</P>
<P>
   At $50, the five-volume boxed set is pricey, but it's a
marvelous sampler of American humor. Bob and Ray, Richard Pryor,
Abbott and Costello, W.C. Fields, Joan Rivers, Stan Freberg, Spike
Jones, Lenny Bruce, Mort Sahl, Dick Gregory, Henny Youngman,
Phyllis Diller, Bob Hope, and Steven Wright are just a few of the
nearly 60 comics represented. While meant to entertain, this set
also allows the more intellectually inclined to see how trends in
humor have evolved. From the sexual suggestiveness of Fields to the
explicitness of Bruce, the humor reflects America's growing
acceptance of, well, dirtier jokes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``BABES IN JOYLAND: KATE CLINTON'' (Whyscrack)
</P>
<P>
   Kate Clinton is one of the best comics around with her easy
conversational style and sharp observational humor. While her quips
are often sympathetically aimed directly at the gay community, her
artistry transcends gender and sexual identity. Describing herself
as a ``recovering Catholic,'' Clinton targets political and social
hypocrisy. ``To me, the avant garde just means not knowing when to
clap,'' is a typical dead-on line.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``BOBBY SLAYTON: RAGING BULLY'' (Parental Advisory) (Miramar).
</P>
<P>
   No one could be further from the political sensitivities of Kate
Clinton than Slayton. Yet, he is the funniest of the gargling
barbed-wire comics. He takes no prisoners in his assault on
virtually every ethnic group, political philosophy, and sexual
orientation. Make no mistake about it. He is raging and he is a
bully. His ranting and raving about minorities makes you wish that
HBO would put him and Chris Rock up against each other in a
no-holds-barred comedy laugh-off.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``CHRIS ROCK: ROLL WITH THE NEW'' (Parental Advisory)
(Dreamworks)
</P>
<P>
   Chris Rock is a Richard Pryor/Lenny Bruce descendent who uses
his humor to attack hypocrisy wherever he finds it. He even does a
long, hilarious oration on why black people are more racist than
white people. His riff on O.J. Simpson is remarkable for both its
humor and insight, as Rock makes the case for Simpson getting off,
not because he is black, but because he is famous. Rock takes on
all comers. ``Women are like the police,'' he says, ``they can have
all the evidence but they want the confession.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``RODNEY CARRINGTON: HANGIN' WITH RODNEY'' (Parental Advisory)
(Mercury)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you have to be from Texas _ and drunk _ to think this guy
is funny. While there are a few funny bits _ one involving shopping
for a casket and the other about sexual confusion _ Carrington
seems to think if he laughs loud enough at his own jokes, you will
too. The other irritating thing about this album is that it uses
repetitive material to fill out the CD. Listening to his silly
gender-confusing song, ``Dancing With a Man,'' once was bad enough.
But twice?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``PAUL RODRIGUEZ: CHEESE `N' MACARONI UNCOOKED'' (Payaso)
</P>
<P>
   It's great to see a Mexican comic who reverses the conventional
stereotype by poking fun at his Anglo sidekick, but Rodriguez has
to get beyond using old cultural stereotypes (such as Latinos don't
ski) if he's to move up. While some of his observations are funny,
particularly his commentary on the differences between Mexican and
American funerals and a commentary on white ebonics, much of the
material drags on.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``JACKIE MARTLING: THE JOKE MAN'' (Off Hour Rockers)
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For someone who can't remember a joke for more than five
minutes, I really admire the fact that Jackie Martling, whose
career took off through his exposure on ``The Howard Stern Show,''
recalls thousands of them. The problem is that most of them aren't
funny. Dirty? Yes. Disgusting? Yes. Revolting? Yes. Funny? Not
really. This Henny Youngman for the foul-mouthed generation,
rattles off bad jokes like the snake that he is. There's one good
one for 20 losers, and, even in baseball, that's a terrible
average. Comedy fans can excuse lapses in taste and judgment but
being unfunny is unforgivable. Sometimes not being able to remember
jokes, especially if they're Martling's, is an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``CLINTON: AN ORAL HISTORY _ DAVID FRYE'' (GAG MEdia)
</P>
<P>
   Every time there's a president in trouble, David Frye shows up.
The man, whose Nixon impressions drove the late President crazy, is
back with a timely indictment of Clinton's sexual escapades. Except
for George C. Scott as Generak Patton, Frye provides the major male
voices including Ted Kennedy, Henry Kissinger, John McLaughlin,
Peter Jennings, and Jack Nicholson while the equally talented Lynne
Marie Stewart performs as Monica Lewinsky, Linda Tripp, and Hillary
Clinton as Dr. Ruth. Timing is crucial in comedy and Frye's has
never been better. Surprisingly enough, the material is cleaner
than what we hear on the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``ALBERT BROOKS: COMEDY MINUS ONE'' (Rhino)
</P>
<P>
   Originally released 25 years ago, the reissue of this remarkable
album is cause for celebration. Personally, it's my favorite.
Whether Brooks is rewriting the National Anthem or asking what the
listener thinks of the record, this is not just a compilation of
funny bits but an artistic interweaving of material that is
brilliantly hilarious. Brooks, who was born Albert Einstein, is a
comic genius who's gone on to become a writer, actor, and director
but this early stand-up work is as fresh and amusing as when it
first came out.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``RICHARD BELZER: ANOTHER LONE NUT'' (Uproar Entertainment)
</P>
<P>
   Better known as a star of NBC's ``Homicide,'' Richard Belzer is
a remarkable commentator. Think of him as Mort Sahl's best material
as delivered by Norman Bates. And his best stuff is true. His
recollection of the time Hulk Hogan and Mr. T appeared on his
short-lived talk show is a dangerously funny bit where Belzer ended
up in the hospital, sued Hogan, and, despite a gag order, ended up
with a house in France for his trouble. Pathologically paranoid, he
adds new life to conspiracy theories. His description of the lone
bullet theory in the President Kennedy assassination case is worth
the price of the album.

DEATH IN SUMMER 
By William Trevor. Viking. 214 pp. $23.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his 1995 novel, ``Felicia's Journey,'' touted as his
breakaway literary thriller into the mainstream, the Irish virtuoso
William Trevor rendered a serial killer with as much care and
intimacy as one might arrange flowers from the garden. And yes, the
novel was terrifying, but hardly for the usual reasons. Devotees of
Trevor's fiction had long known that the man was capable of making
a silent nightmare out of a walk in the park _ and not only because
of what might lurk near the footpath there. The world he inhabits
throws shadows in all directions; if things generally work out for
his characters (which isn't often the case), that happy coincidence
rarely has anything to do with providence or a deserving life. You
might call this authorial viewpoint one of hopelessness, if not for
the shrewd beauty at its center. Beloved for years as a master
builder of the modern English story, Trevor has a way of forcing
collisions between character and circumstance. Rather than merely
fortunate endings, we are afforded truth.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with ``Death in Summer,'' a spare novel chillingly
reminiscent of ``Felicia's Journey'' but also of Henry James's
foray into Gothic. Like James, Trevor attends to but then
transcends the ordinary conventions of suspense; like James, he is
more concerned with the dark anticipation of moral consequence:
Just how far will bad people go? Such a query in the realm of
literary Gothicis complicated by achingly flawed protagonists: the
bruised but well-intentioned, whether James's hapless innocents or
Trevor's Felicia or, here the recently widowed Thaddeus Davenant _
a man who can make wisteria bloom under the direst of conditions
but whose own heart lacks the sine qua non of love.
</P>
<P>
   Or did, until his daughter, Georgina, was born four months ago.
``Death in Summer'' opens with the premature death of Thaddeus's
wife, a new mother and woman of ``almost wayward generosity'' who
was bicycling home in Essex one afternoon _ her basket full of
young pullets _ when she was struck by a car. Now Thaddeus must
provide for the infant girl he adores: must blow open the sealed
castle of the family estate where he has taken refuge all these
years, letting in the aid, and possibly danger, offered by the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
   The main threat posed to Thaddeus's quiet existence appears in
the guise of a potential nanny for Georgina, a troubled girl named
Pettie whose story unfolds in alternating sequences with the more
tranquil life on the Davenant estate. But the greater, or more
thematic, hint of peril belongs to chance itself: So long as
Thaddeus is left alone, trimming his yew and selling his
vegetables, his heart is impenetrable to loss. With that
well-tended invincibility shattered, he finds awaiting him all the
compromises and misunderstandings of a life lived in the company of
others. His mother-in-law, a woman initially hesitant to warm to
Thaddeus, moves in to care for Georgina after a number of
unsuitable young woman are passed over for the job. An odd,
pathos-ridden woman named Mrs. Ferry, who briefly belonged to the
recklessness of Thaddeus's youth, has reappeared to pester him _
probably for money, rather than the pricier commodity of love. Both
these abstruse dramas are dutifully attended by the exquisitely
portrayed servants of the household, Maidment and his wife,
Zenobia; with his silent scrutiny and her feather-duster wisdom,
they are quite capable of tending to a small army of domestic
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   But it is within the characters of the emotionally damaged
Pettie and her mentally halting friend, Albert, that Trevor's
magnanimity is most revealed. Late adolescents who together
survived, then escaped, an orphanage called the Morning Star,
Albert and Pettie are functional members of the dispossessed. He
has found an anchor with the aging Mrs. Biddle, whom he cares for
and who rents him a room, while Pettie drifts from one
fantasy-ridden misfortune to the next, replaying the ugly
choreographies of her childhood. Like the delusional Hilditch of
``Felicia's Journey,'' Pettie is depicted from the inside out: We
don't so much fear her as we do her impulsivity _ her doing the
wrong thing out of need, rather than cruelty. In Trevor's world,
desperation can easily do as much harm as outright malevolence.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that ``Death in Summer'' is the story of a few warm
weeks in England when the vines were flourishing and hearts were
full of longing _ the story of the badly crossed paths of a few
unfortunates, and what they might do to each other almost
inadvertently. Faced with the impact of his own agency in the
world, Thaddeus is forced to confront his past; if he refused his
wife the love she needed while alive, he can at least treat her
memory with honor. The changes and possibilities in the realm of
melancholia where Trevor reigns are both small and infinite: A
missed step, a fleeting act of mercy, might well transform an
entire life.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to say more about the novel without exposing its
subtle beauties, which unfold one moment at a time and with
delicate, sometimes ominous, character revelations. ``Death in
Summer'' feels scant but pleasurable: It is neither so taut nor so
heartbreaking as ``Felicia's Journey,'' but it has the hue of
vintage Trevor _ the perfectly crafted sentences, the insights into
the human condition that are rare and breathtakingly charitable.
For all his keen understanding of the world's meanness, he also
captures the torturous? terrain of those paths of darkness _ the
stones and rainstorms that make one follow certain turns in the
road. If death opens this rueful novel and death hovers over its
fecund summer with barely a hope in sight, there is nonetheless a
gentle light by story's close that outshines every sadness within.

   RUSSIA-CLINTON _ MOSCOW _ Viktor Chernomyrdin's chances of
becoming Russia's new prime minister appeared dim on Monday after
most parliamentary parties came out against him in a first
confirmation debate in the State Duma lower house. Sergei
Reshulsky, a senior Communist official, said before the start of
the debate that Chernomyrdin, prime minister between December 1992
and March 1998, was unlikely to garner more than 120 votes,
including those of his own party, a few dissident Agrarians,
Russian Regions deputies and independents. Will also analyze the

A HOME IN THE HEART OF A CITY 
By Kathleen Hirsch. North Point Press. 
244 pp. $24. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The heart of Jamaica Plain, a diverse bustle of a place in the
center of the city, can be found in the lank grass and bent willow
of Jamaica Pond, or the caramel-colored booths at Doyle's pub, or
the interplay of language and culture in Hyde Square. Annexed to
Boston in 1865, scarred by a ghost highway and sapped by
middle-class flight, it nevertheless held on stubbornly. Journalist
Kathleen Hirsch documents this holding fast and this history,
musing on the politics of place and doing up ``the grand old
buttons of a community's life.''
</P>
<P>
   In the course of her reporting, she finds something notable: a
small-town sensibility that flexes enough to contain the future.
The neighborhood's demographics _ 50 percent white, 33 percent
Latino, 17 percent black _ and its mix of niche businesses and
light industry _ already look like what much of urban America is
becoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``A city has two distinct kinds of history that set it apart
from other sorts of places,'' Hirsch writes. ``The first is the
random and the incidental. ... But there is the far more
significant history of the intentional, those principled moments
`of intensity when common action is exaggerated into visibility,'
as one historian put it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch moved to JP in 1990, a refugee from a younger, faster
track in Back Bay. In her mid-30s, she knew how belonging felt, she
writes, but not how it worked. She could envision the whole but had
yet to encounter the parts. A former writer at the Boston Phoenix
and author of ``Songs from the Alley,'' Hirsch blends the detail of
solid reporting with lyrical power. Her book belongs in the library
of anyone who yearns to understand what sustains a place and what
scorches it.
</P>
<P>
   She begins at Jamaica Pond, invoking Thoreau's walk through
equally wild frontiers, and finds natural beauty and repair. Cars
swerve down the Jamaicaway, but there is also this:
</P>
<P>
   ``On a morning in fall, the air is nippy when I arrive. But this
doesn't deter the regulars. A great shawl of green, willow and oak,
wraps the water in its calm just yards from a bustling parkway.
Thin layers of fog pull apart above the still water. The breath of
joggers clouds the air. Beneath the surface, salmon and bass drift
in granite caves. Wild swans cast their long-billed shadows. Loons
and cormorants and geese skim and bob in search of prey.''
</P>
<P>
   At the stolid, Tudor boathouse, she finds Christine Cooper,
neighborhood bulwark. Gripping a rake and a clutch of garbage bags,
laboring after work and on weekends, Cooper reclaimed the pond from
decay, briar, and bramble. By the summer of 1983, Cooper and
another activist, Gerry Wright, felt they had made enough progress
to hold a ceremony and plant a peace garden. By spring of 1984,
Cooper had a proposal for extensive park restoration and a petition
with 700 signatures in support. City Hall agreed, and the Jamaica
Pond Project began.
</P>
<P>
   After absorbing the lessons of the pond, and the community
taking shape by its shores, Hirsch begins to take regular, rambling
voyages out. She perfects the art of lingering. ``I found my way
onto detours and dead-end roads, following signs for lemonade and
yard sales. Whole chunks of reality fell down before me that I
hadn't noticed before.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood comes into a clearer focus as more characters
swim into view: Veronica Serrato, an assistant district attorney
who quit to work with Greater Boston Legal Services Center; pizza
purveyor Kathie Mainzer, who has an impulse to public service and a
knack for capitalism. (One activist interviewed in the book has
left the JP scene abruptly, and Hirsch may want to add a
postscript. Since the book was written, Boston Police investigators
reportedly have been probing the records of a summer cleanup
program at the Egleston Square YMCA to determine if city money was
diverted. Eddie Ortega, a former gang member who rose to become Y
director, resigned in March and his whereabouts are unknown.)
</P>
<P>
   Aptly enough, Doyle's pub on Washington Street receives its own
chapter, titled, ``Playing.'' But a sense of play and a splash or
two of Guinness are only part of the story. Jerry, Eddie, and Bill
Burke bought the pub in 1971, when JP's industrial base was
eroding, storefronts were vacant, and the Southwest Corridor
construction project was sowing disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle's provided continuity and something more: what sociologist
Ray Oldenburg calls the third place. A third place is convivial and
neutral, where visitors check status at the door and enjoy each
other's company. Successful cities, Oldenburg and others note,
thrive on such levelers. Play is also an important element, and
Hirsch makes a link between play and politics _ as in local. ``For
out of a community's play comes not just a certain tone but a
political confidence,'' she writes. ``Play fosters a politic that
is concrete and literal, and that doesn't exist in places where the
connections between people are more abstract and one-dimensional.''
The policy wonks, bus drivers, yuppies, local scribes, riot grrrls
and longhairs who commune at Doyle's share in the commonweal,
arguing, voting, running for neighborhood council, or pulling on
the mayor's coat.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hirsch's son is young, she knows the thorniest choices
of all await her _ public school or private? Moss Hill or Chestnut
Hill? Community cannot take root if young families flee. Hirsch
visits the Agassiz Elementary School and sees a screaming teacher,
a raging boy, and an assault with a rock. She wonders if she is
ready for the full-time job of sorting out the bureaucracy of the
Boston Public School system. The Agassiz seems the flip side of the
richly diverse community she and her son have found on the street:
Raw issues of race and class erupt, but an overburdened system
seems too deadened to respond. Hirsch is not ready to give up. She
advocates neighborhood-based schools until sixth grade, and hopes
to get children working on community projects, music, and crafts.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see if Hirsch decides to stay, and
which path she chooses for her son, assuming she has the means to
choose. Perhaps the schools will invite community and civility in,
as Hirsch hopes. Perhaps JP's ragtag band of activists will give
them a nudge. Because, as Hirsch has shown, one neighborhood has
much to teach in the age of microculture and individuality _
lessons about how to be public with one another, and how to find
joy in the particular.

THE LANDSCAPE AS SEEN FROM `OUTSIDE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
OUTSIDE LIES MAGIC 
Regaining History and Awareness in Everyday Places. 
By John R. Stilgoe  
Walker, 200 pp., $20  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think of this book as a sort of mirror-image Zen guide. Where
the guide would instruct you to live in the present, the book
trains you to see the present as layers of past. Where the guide
would call on you to turn inward, the book's advice (and opening
line) is ``Get out now. ... Go outside.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside Lies Magic'' is the operating manual for John R.
Stilgoe's life enterprise of accounting for the whole of the
human-contrived, American landscape and, in the process, revealing
our inescapable links to each other and the past.
</P>
<P>
   Stilgoe, a professor of landscape history at Harvard University,
has already wrestled with these subjects in a series of scholarly
masterpieces that include ``Common Landscape of America, 1540 to
1845,'' ``Metropolitan Corridor: Railroads and the American
Scene,'' and ``Borderland: Origins of the American Suburb.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, he takes a very different tack, offering a personal
meditation on what it is to be an ``explorer'' of everyday
landscapes in an era when most of the nation's terrain _ and many
of its citizens' lives _ seem parceled out and preprogrammed.
</P>
<P>
   The book has its flaws. Stilgoe's voice can be unnervingly
direct at times, like that of a drill sergeant in the face of a new
recruit. In addition, his concept of ``landscape'' can be confusing
to first-time readers. On the one hand, he doesn't mean nature as a
whole, but only those parts that humans have modified and molded.
On the other, he doesn't mean places like New York or Disney World
where the modification has gone beyond molding to complete
domination.
</P>
<P>
   Such problems aside, Stilgoe puts on a spectacular performance.
His ability to begin with his walking/bicycling explorer's
observation of something in the landscape, loop into an extended
disquisition on the thing, and finally circle back to the
explorer's journey, can be breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   Here, for example, is Stilgoe taking off from the observation
that kitchen cabinet interiors of a certain period are often apple
green: ``In the first two decades of the twentieth century, experts
advised men to have their kitchens painted apple-green. The experts
believed that apple-green quieted nervous people, and especially
wives beginning to think of suffrage, of careers beyond the home.
...''
</P>
<P>
   Or here he is wrapping up a discussion of the ``military'' in
``military and interstate highway system:'' ``Few motorists
nowadays realize the relationship between aircraft design and
highway design, but bicyclists exploring back roads know the rare
thrill of seeing Wyoming highway troopers temporarily stopping
highway traffic while an immense B-52 practices emergency landings
a half mile away on the interstate.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Stilgoe's audience has been largely confined to
designers and historians. But with passages like these, ``Outside
Lies Magic'' could extend the author's influence to a wider public
and in the process help cast him as a modern Thoreau, an
observer/moralist/celebrant of the American landscape.
</P>
<P>
   That said, let me offer a single lingering doubt _ one raised by
the book's discussion of the recent craze for gated, themed
communities like Disney's Celebration, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Stilgoe's greatest accomplishment has been to help make
landscape a legitimate focus of cultural study; to show that it is
an object whose examination can reveal important truths about
society. He has done that by portraying it as the product of
natural and human forces beyond any one generation's ability to
control and therefore as a layered synthesis of the nation's entire
history.
</P>
<P>
   But what if _ as at Celebration _ most of the forces have been
controlled all at once? What if all the houses have been built and
the trees planted and even all the public monuments erected to
mimic the small town of ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' or ``Mayberry
RFD''? Does that make landscape any less important _ less credible
_ a bearer of history? Stilgoe seems to answer no, largely because
he doesn't think there is as much control in controlled communities
as meets the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But the author's principal argument for getting up now
and going outside is that it is the antidote for ``the trap of the
programmed electronic age so gently closing around so many people
at the end of the century.'' Why believe that the trap can only
snap shut on computer screens and television tubes? What keeps it
from closing in just as thoroughly on the land?

ACADEMICS WORLDWIDE ANALYZE PRINCESS DIANA'S LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Her fairy-tale-turned-sour spawned made-for-TV movies, tabloid
obsession and tears around the world. And in death, Diana, the
princess of Wales, has spawned something else: an academic frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   At the one-year anniversary of her death at age 36, Diana is
being awarded status the academy more commonly accords to figures
like Ernest Hemingway and Abraham Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   She has been the subject of at least 15 conferences worldwide,
including one at the London School of Economics, arrayed with
figures as giant as Henry James and Thomas Jefferson, and the topic
of monographs with such titles as ``Diana and the Fantasy of
Ordinary Suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   So fast have scholars around the world developed the field, in
fact, that they are already postulating the revisionist perspective
on Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say this is the ivory tower stooping to remain relevant,
in an age when American colleges offer courses on the Geography in
Jimmy Buffett Music and The Psychology of Weight Lifting. But
scholars say it is hardly surprising that someone hounded by the
paparazzi would now be deconstructed by academicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a history of studying the communicators who became
well-known since the classical period in Greece,'' insists Dr.
James Golden, a former professor at Ohio State University and a
member of the President's Commission on Thomas Jefferson. ``If you
can analyze the message, analyze the audience, then you've got
something worth an academic assignment, no question. I have no
problem looking upon it as an academic exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither, apparently, do many scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Using television ratings to estimate that one-third the world's
population ``connected'' with Diana's death, Boston's Emerson
College has sponsored a trilogy of conferences under the title,
``The Global Rhetorical Phenomenon of Diana, Princess of Wales.''
At the second, conducted in French in Paris at the six-month mark
in late January, scholars debated such propositions as ``Diana is
not dead because she never `existed.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the third conference, held at the ivy-covered University of
London last week, academics from Britain, Australia, and the United
States discussed her effect on the monarchy, Diana as a feminist
icon, and the ethics of using her as poster princess for seat-belt
safety campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   They dissected the significance of ``Dianaiana'' _ a term coined
to describe everything from the tea towels that commemorated her
wedding to her biographies, which one scholar numbered at 175.
</P>
<P>
   While they insisted that tabloids were not invited, the
organizers apparently could not resist a few tabloid aspects. There
were special presentations by the doctor who treated Diana, her
lover's former butler, and the first British reporter to confirm
her death, as well as a special ``artistic salute'' by singer Jose
Feliciano.
</P>
<P>
   But why all this scholarly attention to Diana, a woman, as one
scholar sniffed, ``whose highest aspiration was to dance with John
Travolta''?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a characteristic of our time, when everything is so
concentrated in time because of the media, that things are
immediately processed,'' said Rabbi Howard A. Berman, who traveled
from Worcester to attend the conference. ``The modern intellectual
approach is far more immediate than the past, where someone had to
be dead for 50 years before you took them seriously. I don't think
that's true anymore, and I think we're the better for it.''
</P>
<P>
   As has been said so many times in this anniversary week,
scholars say Diana inspires inquiry because she related to so many
people on so many different issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you have popular figures who provide a meaning or a
case study of a theory you might be advocating, so that figure
becomes useful to discussions of those issues,'' said Gregory
Payne, a professor of communication at Emerson. ``So if you have,
say, a feminist perspective, you can take her strong stand against
Charles, her strong stand against the monarchy and make her a
feminist icon. She becomes relevant to discussions of feminist
theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Women to whom Diana is frequently compared _ Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis or Mother Teresa _ did not draw the same inquiry, Golden
says, because they did not champion as many issues _ or,
practically speaking, appear in so many photographs.
</P>
<P>
   They also did not draw so much controversy. And as the life of
Diana had its controversies _ from her days as nursery school
teacher to her frolics with Dodi Fayed in the Mediterranean _ so
does the scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially there was the rush to sainthood,'' Payne said. ``Now
we have voices of revision, questioning whether the outpouring of
grief was appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   But the revisionists are in for a fight with the hard-core
Dianaianaists.
</P>
<P>
   Their latter-day skepticism ``smacks of elitist snobbery and
ivory tower arrogance,'' Berman said. ``She was a major cultural,
social phenomenon in late 20th century life, and it's very
appropriate that she is the subject of serious inquiry.''

FOR CONGRESS, A DIGNIFIED WAY OUT OF THE MESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Trent Lott started it back in March. He got no
bandwagon rolling _ the Senate majority leader rarely does _ but
the idea of Congress officially condemning President Clinton's
behavior, assuming it doesn't include an actual and proved abuse of
his office such as obstruction of justice, has hung around.
</P>
<P>
   Even now it is not gaining ground, but it has gained some
attention. It deserves to gain more as long as various carts are
not placed before various horses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the somewhat increased level of attention for
what shorthand is calling a ``censure'' of Clinton, what I find
most interesting is that the topic is being discussed way up the
president's chain of command. That's far from official, or even an
indication of his own views, but it is plenty interesting, and
trial balloons have flown with a lot less helium than that.
</P>
<P>
   From this perspective, censure stinks if by that is meant a
distinct measure drafted and approved by both houses of Congress.
But there are other ways of skinning the same cat.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the only use of censure on a president in
American history left an aroma that is still around. In 1834, a
Whig-controlled Senate formally censured President Andrew Jackson
for a controversial use of power regarding a giant bone of
contention in those days, the national bank. Jackson rightly
accused his Whig opponents of lacking the guts to impeach him, and
when they lost the Senate two years later, the censure was promptly
withdrawn. No one has seriously attempted such a stunt since.
</P>
<P>
   For another, a motion of censure would set weird, if not bad,
precedents. Since the grounds would presumably be an appalling
sexual liaison with a young woman and an effort to keep it secret
that included lying to the public, the question would arise whether
that is the standard that Congress means to set for such an action.
What about other presidential lies, for example, and what about
other examples of lies with huge public consequences (like the
Vietnam War) that get de facto grandfather status?
</P>
<P>
   There's still a way, however. The independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, is finally on the verge of presenting evidence to the House
of Representatives. Assuming for discussion that there is no
direct, dramatic, and unquestionable proof of obstruction or
subornation of perjury that could overcome the public's
overwhelming antipathy to further proceedings, Congress, even
though it doesn't have to, could vote to ``accept'' Starr's report.
And in the measure accepting Starr's report, it could include
language condemning the president's behavior. That limits it to
this case.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage is that it would give official voice to genuine
feelings of horror and worse that people have about Clinton's
admitted conduct.
</P>
<P>
   It is still early for this, though not too early to have a few
decent ideas on the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the president remains in seclusion with his
family, a delicate and properly private process that must still be
resolved before anything else matters. Clinton may need a similar
process to see if he can repair relations with his official and
political families.
</P>
<P>
   He will also need to say more to the public than he did last
week to truly deliver the three Cs his chief of staff, Erskine
Bowles, falsely advertised that the president's brief speech was
about to deliver _ confession, contrition, and closure.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest short-term cost of those remarks was the anger of
the very Republicans poised to try to find a way past this mess _
Orrin Hatch in the Senate and Henry Hyde, the Judiciary Committee
chairman, in the House _ who have said Congress should not even
proceed toward an inquiry into possible impeachment on the sole
basis of a sex and sex-lies case.
</P>
<P>
   That stance, if maintained, would probably split Republicans,
many of whom insist that the president go or be tossed out of
office. Even those leaders who have no stomach for a sex-based case
_ like Newt Gingrich himself and chairman Gerald Solomon of the
Rules Committee _ talk of expanding a Starr report on the Monica
Lewinsky affair into a reinvestigation of everything the prosecutor
has already investigated in his four-plus year, even if he has
found no evidence of impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Out of respect for the public's views and to avoid that kind of
madness, this may be a matter that cries out for responsible
settlement, unless the pure facts in Starr's report clearly
indicate otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   But first we all need a signal from the first family. In one of
the least-noticed, most direct sections of his speech, the
president said, ``I must put it right, and I am prepared to do
whatever it takes to do so.''

<P>
   MONTREAL _ Bad feelings are boiling along the world's
friendliest border.
</P>
<P>
   A move by Congress to tighten requirements for Canadians
entering the United States has Ottawa in a tizzy. Officials north
of the border say the scheme to force Canadians, like other
foreigners, to fill out immigration cards and undergo tighter
scrutiny upon entering the United States is a betrayal of the
``special relationship'' that has allowed citizens of both
countries extraordinary freedom in passing back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Canadians, American business and political leaders
from New England to the Pacific Northwest warn that Section 110 of
the immigration law _ which goes before the House of
Representatives next month _ will result in the loss of hundreds of
millions of dollars' worth of trade and tourism by discouraging
travel and creating hours-long traffic backups at busy border
crossings.
</P>
<P>
   But conservatives in Congress say Canadians should be treated no
differently than any other foreigners. They accuse Canada of
providing safe haven to terrorists under notably lax asylum laws,
and warn that maintaining soft entry rules along the northern
border exposes the United States to danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an open border that is an open invitation to people
who want to smuggle in drugs or people or terrorism,'' said
Representative Lamar Smith, the Texas Republican who is the main
author of the tough new immigration law. Although the law was
passed in 1996, enforcement of Section 110 _ the requirement that
Canadians fill out entry/exit forms _ has been delayed because of
bitter opposition from Ottawa and congressional leaders from
northern states.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Smith's office characterized Canada as a
``gateway for terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help Canada's case that the country's own spy agency,
the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, reported last April
that major international terrorist groups have ``established
themselves in Canada, seeking safe haven, setting up operational
bases and attempting to gain access to the USA.''
</P>
<P>
   One prominent case involved a Palestinian, Gazi Abu Mezer, who,
shortly after gaining refugee status in Canada, sneaked across the
border and was arrested in July 1997 for allegedly plotting to bomb
subways in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Canadian officials say the real border problem for
the United States is with Mexico, source of more illegal
immigrants, drugs, and other contraband in any given week than is
smuggled from Canada in a year. They say the law will cause
headaches and hassles for Canadians who pose no threat to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Section 110 is terrible for trade, terrible for tourism, and
just terrible overall for both sides,'' said Rodney Moore,
spokesman for the Canadian Embassy in Washington. ``Congress
essentially seems to be trying to address problems the US has on
its southern border without recognizing that the northern border is
not at all similar.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Canadians are in an uproar over a different part of
the immigration law that has already gone into effect that gives US
border inspectors sweeping and arbitrary powers to impose a
five-year entry ban on any non-citizen they suspect of
``misrepresenting'' his or her reason for coming to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The law was intended to provide officers with a way of turning
back would-be illegal immigrants, most notoriously from Mexico, who
try to enter the United States claiming to be short-term tourists
when their real aim is find permanent work.
</P>
<P>
   Critics in the north, however, assert that officers of the US
Immigration and Naturalization Service have used their new
authority to come down hard on Canadians for seemingly minor border
infractions.
</P>
<P>
   There is no judicial appeal process for the so-called expedited
removals _ the on-the-spot five-year bans that can now be imposed
by any border inspector.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a system wide open for abuse,'' said Anna Marie
Gallagher, a lawyer with the American Immigration Law Foundation,
which has filed a federal lawsuit in Washington, D.C., challenging
the law. ``It's giving low-level government officers power to act
as judge, jury, and executioner.''
</P>
<P>
   Last March 4, Donald Chatwin of Abbotsford, British Columbia,
was making the daily trip across the border to a job as a
consultant with a Bellingham, Wash., computer firm, of which he is
also a part-owner.
</P>
<P>
   But on that day, INS officers accused him of violating a
condition of his visa by performing sales duties for the company
when his application for the work permit claimed that the job only
entailed providing technical advice. He was grilled for several
hours, fingerprinted, photographed, and summarily banned from the
United States for five years under the controversial new procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Chatwin is reluctant to discuss the order, which he is trying to
have legally overturned, saying only, ``It's had a pretty drastic
impact on my life. It seems punishment out of all proportion to a
misunderstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Chatwin's lawyer in the United States, Greg Boos of Bellingham,
put it more bluntly. ``The new powers given immigration officers is
turning the border into a ruder, more surly, and even frightening
place for Canadians.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent headlines in Canada certainly seem to suggest so.
</P>
<P>
   ``US border crackdown keeping Canadians out,'' proclaimed a
recent front-page article in the Toronto-based Globe &AMP; Mail, while
the Montreal Gazette ran this banner headline: ``US inspectors turn
trips into nightmares.''
</P>
<P>
   Accurately or not, this perception has become common in Canada
since US immigration officers started wielding their new authority
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a bullying attitude at the border that wasn't there
before,'' said Ontario businessman Bud Williamson, who makes
frequent trips to the United States. ``And a lot of good will at
our borders is going down the drain. It's a huge issue for
Canadians, but Americans seem oblivious to the bad feelings your
new laws are causing among your best friends.''
</P>
<P>
   US border officials, however, say they are fed up with ``wild
rumors created by a Canadian media frenzy,'' in the words of
Russell A. Bergeron Jr., spokesman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue has been overblown, hyped by Canadian newspapers and
TV seizing on a few cases,'' he said. ``The actual numbers of
Canadians subjected to expedited removal is minute, a tiny fraction
of 1 percent of the millions of Canadians who enter without any
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he warned, ``misrepresentation is
misrepresentation, a lie is a lie. Anyone who tries to enter by
twisting the truth or telling a half-truth is violating the law.
That's true in the US, just as it is true in Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Since April 1997, when immigration inspectors started exercising
their new authority, a total of 62,706 foreigners seeking to enter
the United States from Canada or Mexico have been ejected and
slapped with five-year entry bans. But only 470 were Canadians; the
huge majority were Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   The most common misrepresentations are by Canadians entering the
United States to do business, legally or not, who claim to be
traveling on holiday, since they assume that will create less
hassle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a unique and special relationship on the northern
border,'' Bergeron said. ``But there is also supposed to be honor
between friends. A Canadian does not have an absolute right to
cross for any reason. A Canadian is not entitled to tell a white
lie just in hopes of avoiding legitimate questions from immigration
officers enforcing US law.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the cases of a few dozen Canadians hit with the
bans for seemingly petty infractions _ as opposed to Canadians
caught carrying drugs or blatantly trying to deceive _ have
generated extraordinary bad feeling in this nation. Special legal
seminars on ``how to enter the US'' attract thousands of
businesspeople fearful that the slightest slip of the tongue or
forgotten document will result in sanctions that might ruin their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a public relations disaster for the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   So much so that US Ambassador Gordon G. Giffin implored Canadian
Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy not to let a ``few
misunderstandings'' harm relations.
</P>
<P>
   Top Canadian officials, for their part, are far less worried
about the expedited removal issue than the possibility that Section
110, imposing the new travel requirements, might still go into
effect Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new law could put a real chill in relations as well as
causing incalculable harm to businesses on both sides of the
border,'' said a senior Foreign Ministry official.

financial turmoil, the Russians are preparing for Tuesday's summit
meeting. What do they want out of it at this point? By Michael
Wines.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-RESCUE (Undated) _ How to rescue the Russian economy? The
choices seem limited to just three: Tighten Moscow's direct control
over the economy and adopt foreign exchange controls; strike a new
compromise with the International Monetary Fund, paying at least
lip service to tight money, budget balancing and orderly debt
restructuring; or, most radically, link the country's finances to a
strong foreign currency like the dollar. The trouble is that the
choice Russia seems to be leaning toward, a populist package of
command and control measures, is one that seems the most likely to
lead to hyperinflation, social unrest and a lurch toward
nationalism. By Sylvia Nasar.

Russian crisis before he leaves for Moscow and the summit meeting.
By James Bennet.

<P>
   CLINTON-WORLD-IMAGE (Undated) _ In the eyes of many of his
fellow leaders and ordinary people around the world, President
Clinton has suffered a loss of stature following investigations of
his private life and his admission that he had an inappropriate
relationship with a White House intern in the Oval Office. But he
has lost little of the authority and power conferred on him by the
presidency. By Craig R. Whitney.

   NKOREA-MISSILE (Tokyo) _ In a move that immediately raised
tensions in the region, North Korea fired a ballistic missile into
the Sea of Japan Monday. The launching may have been a test, but
North Korea offered no explanation. By some accounts, part of the
missile flew over northeast Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean.
If that is confirmed, it will add to the apprehension by
underscoring the range of North Korea's new class of missiles. By
Sheryl WuDunn.

at the large phone company after reaching a tentative agreement on
a new three-year contract. The Communication Workers of America
left messages on hot lines and on the Internet late Sunday that the

signs. By James Brooke.

<P>
   NY-STATE-FAIR (Syracuse, N.Y.) _ For many city slickers familiar
with state fairs only through old movies or television shows, the
annual, end-of-summer events are anachronistic bastions of quaint
pastoralism. And to some extent, that's an accurate appraisal. The
wonders of cultivation, from monstrous zucchini to mammoth swine,
are still celebrated. The divine arts of pickling, canning, cookie
baking and jelly making still win intensely coveted blue ribbons.
But while the 152nd New York State Fair includes cows being trotted
out by breeders eager to show off their livestock, it also features
llamas leaping over a gradually raised bar for no purpose other
than entertainment. By Frank Bruni. (1000 plus)

   SCI-DEBAKEY-SURGERY (New York) _ Dr. Michael E. DeBakey moved
like a dancer in a pas de deux, anticipating his surgical partner's
every move during a quadruple bypass operation on a woman at The
Methodist Hospital here the other day. As DeBakey deftly
manipulated scalpels, scissors and forceps for more than three

   SCI-DEEPSEA-DIVING (Undated) _ Alvin, the world's first craft to
roam the ocean's abyss with relative ease, is getting a major
overhaul that may extend its reach and allow it to match and
possibly even surpass newer submersibles abroad, making it the
world leader. In a remarkable bonanza from the end of the Cold War,
the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, which runs Alvin, has
just received from the Navy a submersible known as Sea Cliff, which

</P>
<P>
   SCI-MENS-FACES (Undated) _ A timeless movie scene many people
may they could forget: Leonardo DiCaprio climbing to the bowsprit
of the ``Titanic'' and crowing, ``I'm king of the world!'' The
latest word from scientists: He may have a point. Or, rather, a
fetching bit of roundness. In a new study of facial attractiveness,
researchers from Scotland and Japan have found that, much to their
astonishment, people of both sexes prefer feminine-looking men over
rugged, manly-miened men. By Natalie Angier.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MATH-IMAGE (New York) _ The movie ``Good Will Hunting''
offers some of the worst stereotypes of mathematics and
mathematicians. The elegance of the subject, or its relevance to
science are not even suggested, while all the cliches are
exploited. But three other popular works of art are mathematically
inspired, showing that math is not just a collection of complicated
problems studied and understood by a few, but that it is a subject
which on a very profound and intuitive level speaks to all of us.
By Dan Rockmore.

<P>
   SCI-ANIMAL-ORIGINS (Undated) _ The first animals may have been
shocked into existence by the evolutionary one-two punch of a
climatic episode so cold that the oceans froze _ snowball earth _
followed by one of the hottest periods in earth history, according
to a new hypothesis based largely on studies of carbon atoms in
ancient sediments. ``We think we have, finally, an explanation for

   SCI-HEARING-LOSS (Undated) _ Researchers say they are making

within the ear that are often irreparably damaged or killed by
excessive noise. It may also be possible, they add, to develop
drugs that can be taken in advance to protect against damaging
sounds. By Warren E. Leary.

creatine's popularity. Unlike the anabolic steroids that mimic the
effects of the male sex hormone testosterone, creatine does not

N.Y. JUDGE DISCOVERS HIS NAME ON CYANIDE MAILING LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MELISSA GRACE and CAROL DEMARE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A New York state judge, who in 1994 committed a
woman to an Albany psychiatric hospital, says his name appeared on
the former patient's list of persons to whom she allegedly planned
to mail packets of sodium cyanide.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Harold J. Hughes says he was
contacted by California authorities last Monday with a warning not
to ingest anything he received by mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did call up my wife and warned her,'' Hughes says of the
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Schoonover, 50, was arrested on Aug. 23 outside a post
office in Marina Del Rey, Calif., after she was spotted wearing
rubber gloves and filling cellophane packets from a can marked
poison. Authorities said she was preparing to send more than 100
packages containing the deadly cyanide.
</P>
<P>
   Schoonover, who spent two months in the Capital District
Psychiatric Center in Albany in the summer of 1994, faces up to 20
years in prison on each of two federal counts of using the mail to
send poison in an attempt to injure and kill. The charges are in
connection with two employees of the psychiatric facility who were
involved in Schoonover's treatment and who received suspicious
packets in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   More charges are likely, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   The judge remembers a June 1994 mental hygiene hearing at which
he committed Schoonover to the psychiatric center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any trouble deciding that if I let this lady go,
she'd get hurt,'' Hughes said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   John Sherman, the judge's law clerk, said his name also appeared
on Schoonover's list and that he received a similar call Monday
from California. Neither the judge nor Sherman received a packet
from Schoonover either at home or at the office, they said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the hearing, Sherman was an assistant state
attorney general and represented the psychiatric center, a state
facility.
</P>
<P>
   The judge and law clerk vividly remembered the proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gave me a wild story, that she was a professor, and she
was going to a meeting at Harvard,'' Hughes said. ``But she had no
identification.'' Hughes recalled that Schoonover sat to his right
during the hearing in a room on the fourth-floor of the County
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   When Hughes ruled against releasing her, Schoonover stood up and
pretended to faint, while at the same time squirting a packet of
ketchup over her front. For an instant, people in the room thought
it was blood, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Schoonover had contested her involuntary confinement and
attorneys were assigned to advocate on her behalf.
</P>
<P>
   In correspondence with the Albany Times Union newspaper over a
three-year period beginning in 1994, Schoonover said the drugs and
other medications given her at the psychiatric center killed her
unborn child.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities told the newspaper at the time that she was not
pregnant and not mistreated at the center.
</P>
<P>
   According to medical records she sent the newspaper, Schoonover
was diagnosed as suffering from severe mental illness. In an
hour-by-hour and day-by-day diary of her stay at the facility,
Schoonover mentioned Hughes and Sherman and asserted they said
``there was insufficient evidence to indicate that I had been
invited to (Vice President) Al Gore's party,'' after graduation
exercises. Schoonover said she had maintained she was not invited
to Gore's party.
</P>
<P>
   When discharged on Aug. 12, Schoonover was given a one-way bus
ticket to Boston, according to documents she sent the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   After arresting her, sheriff's investigators in California
seized two ``hit lists'' from Schoonover's van, in which she was
living. Included on the lists were names of health care and law
enforcement professionals she believed wronged her.
</P>
<P>
   Federal court papers filed Wednesday alleged that Schoonover, a
cancer patient, sent packets of sodium cyanide disguised as
nutritional supplements in April or May to Kathleen Elbrecht of
Niskayuna, a nurse manager at the psychiatric center, and in June
to John Georgiopolos of Selkirk, a social worker at the facility.

HOLLYWOOD, B.C.: EXCHANGE RATE HAS U.S. FILMMAKERS FLOCKING TO
VANCOUVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By M.L. LYKE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ Mulder and Scully have blown town, taking
their dough and their cult cachet with them. The dollar's on a
serious slide, and poised to plunge even lower.
</P>
<P>
   So why are film executives in ``Hollywood North'' smiling?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the enviable position of turning away business right
now,'' says Peter Leitch, vice president and general manager of
North Vancouver's Lions Gate Studios, a 14-acre lot that looks
decidedly more L.A. than B.C. ``Right now every single stage is
rented.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes the five stages at Lions Gate that were occupied
by the extra-eerie, extra-terrestrial ``X-Files'' for five years.
Series stars David Duchovny (Fox Mulder) and Gillian Anderson (Dana
Scully) packed up at the end of spring and headed to Tinseltown
with their high-profile show, amid tearful farewells and much media
hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   The mourning period was a short one. You could almost hear the
door slam on Duchovny's back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think `X-Files' leaving had a very big impact,'' says
Sheila Mombouquette, director of the British Columbia branch of the
Canadian Film and Television Production Association. ``It just
freed up some badly needed studio space.''
</P>
<P>
   Space is, indeed, at a premium in film-happy Vancouver. The
cause, ironically, is bad news. And it has nothing to do with
``X-Files'' and everything to do with the X-change rate.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, a Canadian dollar was worth 75 cents American. Last
week, the rate was below 64 cents. That figure is a siren call for
bargain-hunting producers in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means every time they run a budget in Los Angeles, we come
out the low-cost alternative,'' says Peter Mitchell, director of
the British Columbia Film Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Sweetening the deal is Vancouver's increasingly sophisticated
talent pool _ 97 percent of the cast and crew on any set is
Canadian _ and a user-friendly government that cheerily opens
doors, bends rules and even intervenes in labor disputes for
Hollywood films.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell calls this a ``policy awakening,'' and cites as a
recent example a shoot for ``Pittsburgh,'' a film that began
filming Aug. 3 with Jim Carrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pittsburgh'' producers sold a placement ad for a beer company,
and wanted to plaster a billboard with the name of the beer for a
shoot. But laws in Canada prohibit advertising alcohol on
billboards. ``Ten years ago, it would have been a huge problem,''
says Mitchell. ``But I called the attorney general's office and,
within two hours, we had the go-ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The government similarly came to the rescue when Hollywood
filmmakers threatened to beat it east to Ontario, a province
competing with B.C. for ``Film capital of Canada'' status. To
entice filmmakers, Ontario passed generous tax incentives for film
projects. ``We were losing work to Toronto,'' says Mitchell. ``We
were forced to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   By June, the B.C. government had put together its own incentive
package, one that returns 11 percent of all labor costs on a film
project to foreign production companies. Fickle Hollywood producers
quickly unpacked their bags and settled back in to Vancouver digs.
``All our studios breathed a sigh of relief,'' says Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   He estimates 25,000 British Columbians are employed full or part
time in the film industry. And while some local cast and crew have
complained publicly about Hollywood attitudes _ criticizing what
they call a ``Mexicans with sweaters'' view of the low-wage work
force _ most in the city embrace the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a restaurateur, it has probably increased our business an
amazing 25 percent,'' says Umberto Menghi, a superstar on the
culinary scene with five Vancouver restaurants, including Il
Giardino, the elegant place to see and be seen. ``It's given us a
certain pride, a certain prestige. Vancouver people feel special
because Hollywood loves us.''
</P>
<P>
   Scorned lovers south of the border, meanwhile, are nursing their
wounds. ``The exchange rates are going to kill us,'' says Suzie
Kellet, who heads the Washington State Film Commission,
headquartered in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Once adored for its moody landscapes, Seattle has been
particularly hard hit by the Canadian dollar's long slide downhill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Filmmakers have been flying over us on the way to Vancouver
for so long, they've lost a sense of us,'' says Kellet.
</P>
<P>
   Figure comparisons tell the story. Total film production
expenditures in Washington declined from $55 million in 1994 to
nearly $29 million in 1997. During the same period, expenditures in
British Columbia increased from $432 million Canadian ($275 million
U.S. at current exchange rates) to $630 million ($400 million).
Figures for 1998 could be $760 million Canadian ($483 million).
</P>
<P>
   It's a market flush with Hollywood money. Which raises a problem
for British Columbia's resident filmmakers. Many find it
increasingly difficult to shop for cast, crews and production
facilities with their weakened dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It drives up prices,'' says Vancouver producer Julia Keatley,
during a break from shooting ``Cold Squad,'' a celebrated Canadian
TV series. ``I still want top-notch crew, so I have to pay more.''
</P>
<P>
   Tabs can be staggering. ``Vancouver is the most expensive place
for an indigenous producer to shoot,'' says Keatley.
</P>
<P>
   Indigenous filmmakers account for about 10 percent of B.C.
production. The rest of the industry is dominated by Hollywood. At
Lions Gate Studios, a major player in Canada's film industry, the
figures are even more skewed. ``Ninety-five percent of our sound
stages are taken by American productions,'' says Leitch, sitting at
a conference table with fresh-off-the-press blueprints spread out
before him.
</P>
<P>
   The blueprints are plans for a new sound stage at Lions Gate. It
will be the seventh at the state-of-the-art studio, owned by former
securities honcho Frank Giustra and designed to resemble a
Hollywood lot. The studio contains production and distribution
facilities under one roof, so filmmakers can see a project from
start to finish on-site.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the studio's gated grand entrance is a bustling back-lot
scene. Actors and crew mill around mobile dressing rooms and
catering trucks parked by the sound stages.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the yawning buildings, a crew works around a crashed
spaceship on the set of ``Max Q,'' a Disney TV movie. Inside
another is a ``morgue'' with half-full beakers and a steel autopsy
table, a set for the TV series ``Millennium.'' There are signs
leading to ``Pittsburgh'' production offices, and a small crew is
arriving to finish pick-up shots for ``Snow Falling on Cedars.''
Trucks are just beginning to bring in props for ``Dudley
Do-Right,'' a feature action film that begins filming tomorrow,
with Brendan ``George of the Jungle'' Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   Stages are so packed, producers are subletting space to one
another, and construction crews are maxxed out. In the mill shop,
electric saws screech, hammers pound and drills hum as workers
build new sets, too busy to look up. ``We're building another
construction mill, and we already need two more,'' says Leitch.
</P>
<P>
   The cacophony paints a rosy picture of ``North Hollywood's''
future. Leitch cites reports that project British Columbia's film
industry will double in the next 10 years. Other insiders say
production expenses could reach the $1 billion (Canadian) mark by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That could all change if Canada's economic bad news turns good.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of the Canadian dollar recovering may be a happy one
for shoppers who like to dip across the border to the United
States, but it's a nerve-racking one for industry insiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, there was a real sense that if the exchange
rate changed, the industry would go away,'' says Mitchell. ``We're
certainly at risk _ but even if the rate went up 10 percent, it
would still be 72 cents to a dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Insiders see the 80-cent dollar as a kind of benchmark. ``Up to
80 cents, we're going to have business,'' says Leitch. ``At 90
cents, it's pretty close to zero savings.''
</P>
<P>
   Would Hollywood call off the romance at that point? Could the
love dry up over dollars?
</P>
<P>
   No one's sure. But Leitch, for one, is banking on a lasting
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to understand that this industry is very
portable and can go elsewhere,'' says the studio executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we don't get too greedy, we can keep it here.''

   Once again Russia is having a change of government. This is
symptomatic of a dangerous problem. The highly touted ``energetic
technocrat'' whose approval by the legislature was obtained after
much arm-twisting is out. The acting prime minister is Viktor
Chernomyrdin, sourly dismissed a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The pundits are at a loss wondering how to interpret these
developments. The answer, however, is simple. Another attempt to
force a set of impossible economic programs on the country has
failed. Now our failed leaders are casting about for a straw to
grasp.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the policy course pursued since 1992 is so
obvious that it has now been recognized officially.
</P>
<P>
   The country is being swept by a new devastating wave of the
financial crisis. The stock market hits new lows every day. Despite
having obtained multibillion dollar loans abroad, the Russian
government has been forced to take emergency measures to halt the
free-fall or at least to ease the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The devaluation of the ruble and the real threat of bankruptcy
have demonstrated that the system born of the reckless, selfishly
conceived reforms of the 1990s is unsustainable. A speculative
economy, a corrupt government, a criminalized environment, tens of
millions of forgotten and abandoned people: Such is the outcome of
the Yeltsin era.
</P>
<P>
   The defining fact today is the credibility gap dividing the
authorities and Russian society. The crisis is not so much economic
as political.
</P>
<P>
   Until very recently, the president and his entourage tried to
ignore this fact. Today they seem to be waking up to what's
happening. Continuing to cling to power while closing their eyes
and plugging their ears could be self-defeating. The appointment of
Chernomyrdin as acting prime minister is therefore likely to signal
the beginning of the process of transferring power to an heir
apparent. We are witnessing Yeltsin's political sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a hidden agenda here. By all indications, the
president wants to use Chernomyrdin to try to prolong his political
existence, to somehow make it to the constitutionally mandated
election time. The new premier has thus been assigned the role of
the chief firefighter called in to save the regime.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Chernomyrdin too needs time to raise his
extremely low popularity rating in preparation for presidential
elections. The prime minister's office gives him leverage to do
that, but it is unlikely that he will succeed, given the depth of
the crisis and the current lineup of political forces.
</P>
<P>
   But is there perhaps some hope that the ``heavyweight''
Chernomyrdin has been called in for a different purpose _ that at
long last he will form a government capable of changing the course.
</P>
<P>
   Much as one might wish to believe it, it is unlikely. The
extraordinary difficulties Russia is experiencing today began, as
everyone knows, on Chernomyrdin's watch and with his involvement.
Thus the reemergence of Chernomyrdin does nothing to address the
federal authority's credibility problem. It does not create the
trust needed to solve any major issue.
</P>
<P>
   The call for early elections, therefore, continues to be timely
and urgent. Indeed, early elections of the president and of the
Duma, which bears its share of responsibility for what has happened
to Russia, are indispensable, as is a referendum to amend the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   I am convinced that the role of the legislature should be
increased. It is very important to normalize the presidency. Russia
needs a balanced system of institutions of government. Only a
strong, functional parliament and an effective cabinet and
president can implement policies of economic growth and Russia's
revival.
</P>
<P>
   The state has to play an essential regulating role to help
realize the country's enormous potential.
</P>
<P>
   Today conditions are still in place to conduct early elections
in an orderly way, taking advantage of the fact that the widespread
popular discontent has not yet burst out in extreme forms. But the
legendary patience of the Russian people should not be tested too
long. It has its limits.

   SCI-DEBAKEY-SURGERY (New York) _ Dr. Michael E. DeBakey moved
like a dancer in a pas de deux, anticipating his surgical partner's
every move during a quadruple bypass operation on a woman at The
Methodist Hospital here the other day. As DeBakey deftly
manipulated scalpels, scissors and forceps for more than three
hours, his hands never quivered. What made it an extraordinary
operation is that DeBakey, the pioneering heart surgeon, turns 90
on Sept. 7. By Lawrence K. Altman. (2150 words)

   SCI-DEEPSEA-DIVING (Undated) _ Alvin, the world's first craft to
roam the ocean's abyss with relative ease, is getting a major
overhaul that may extend its reach and allow it to match and
possibly even surpass newer submersibles abroad, making it the
world leader. In a remarkable bonanza from the end of the Cold War,
the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, which runs Alvin, has
just received from the Navy a submersible known as Sea Cliff, which
has been decommissioned in the wake of military cutbacks and
changing priorities. By William J. Broad.

   SCI-MENS-FACES (Undated) _ A timeless movie scene many people
may they could forget: Leonardo DiCaprio climbing to the bowsprit
of the ``Titanic'' and crowing, ``I'm king of the world!'' The
latest word from scientists: He may have a point. Or, rather, a
fetching bit of roundness. In a new study of facial attractiveness,
researchers from Scotland and Japan have found that, much to their
astonishment, people of both sexes prefer feminine-looking men over
rugged, manly-miened men. By Natalie Angier.

   SCI-MATH-IMAGE (New York) _ The movie ``Good Will Hunting''
offers some of the worst stereotypes of mathematics and
mathematicians. The elegance of the subject, or its relevance to
science are not even suggested, while all the cliches are
exploited. But three other popular works of art are mathematically
inspired, showing that math is not just a collection of complicated
problems studied and understood by a few, but that it is a subject
which on a very profound and intuitive level speaks to all of us.

   SCI-ANIMAL-ORIGINS (Undated) _ The first animals may have been
shocked into existence by the evolutionary one-two punch of a
climatic episode so cold that the oceans froze _ snowball earth _
followed by one of the hottest periods in earth history, according
to a new hypothesis based largely on studies of carbon atoms in
ancient sediments. ``We think we have, finally, an explanation for
the first appearance of animal life on earth,'' said the Harvard
geologist who led the study. By William K. Stevens. (1250 words)

   SCI-HEARING-LOSS (Undated) _ Researchers say they are making
progress against noise-induced hearing loss and have begun testing
treatments that may be able to rescue hearing in ears damaged by
unusually loud noise. Military researchers say they have developed
a technique that may be able to restore health to delicate cells
within the ear that are often irreparably damaged or killed by
excessive noise. It may also be possible, they add, to develop
drugs that can be taken in advance to protect against damaging
sounds. By Warren E. Leary.

McGwire's effort to capture the seasonal home run record set by

creatine's popularity. Unlike the anabolic steroids that mimic the
effects of the male sex hormone testosterone, creatine does not
cause hair loss or make the testicles shrink. Although virtually
nothing is known about possible long-term hazards, no obvious
adverse effects have been linked to creatine use. By Jane E. Brody.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Figuring out Diana
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our jet landed at London's Heathrow the day after Diana's
funeral. My guess was that the city still would be gridlocked.
Crowd estimates the previous day were just about anything you cared
to make them. Those of us headed north out of London figured we'd
have a tough time getting there.
</P>
<P>
   To our surprise, the city had pretty well cleared out. The
highways were open. Even the papers were sedate by British
standards. By the time I arrived north, people were beginning to
wonder what it all had been about. Aside from a few bouquets
beginning to wilt on a monument in the center of town, life had not
changed notably.
</P>
<P>
   We've had a year to consider. Television is serving up lots of
Diana, although insight quotient has not enhanced. The Diana story
has, in fact, become even more settled. Except for the cause of the
accident _ drunken foul-up? MI6 rubout? _ we have come to a
consensus view of Diana. Gorgeous superstar. Anguished, insecure
bulimic. Victim. Dedicated mum. Caring celebrity. Sly tease.
Accomplished manipulator of press and public. Cleverer than all the
Royals (no major accomplishment). She wickedly called them ``The
Leper Colony,'' and her husband's mistress ``The Rottweiler.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the sum of all these things that made Diana engrossing.
Diana was one of those people who cannot quite be brought into
focus. We keep making minute adjustments of the lens to clarify the
picture. It never works. Marilyn was like that.

<P>
   RUSSIA-RESCUE (Undated) _ How to rescue the Russian economy? The
choices seem limited to just three: Tighten Moscow's direct control
over the economy and adopt foreign exchange controls; strike a new
compromise with the International Monetary Fund, paying at least
lip service to tight money, budget balancing and orderly debt
restructuring; or, most radically, link the country's finances to a
strong foreign currency like the dollar. The trouble is that the
choice Russia seems to be leaning toward, a populist package of

WHO WILL DECIDE TO FILE FUTURE `MEGA-SUITS'? 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Attorney General Dan Morales wasn't exactly the
Lone Ranger when he began shooting it out with the tobacco industry
two years ago. He had a posse of private trial lawyers who are
still hoping to cash in their silver bullets for a $2.3 billion
reward.
</P>
<P>
   But Morales acted independently of the rest of state government,
particularly the governor and the Legislature, when he sued
cigarette makers over smoking-related health-care costs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ironically, Morales' success may end up clipping the wings
of future attorneys general who may want to punish other corporate
goliaths for any number of alleged sins.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement that Morales negotiated with the tobacco industry
is not the issue, because even the attorney general's harshest
critics aren't about to thumb their noses at $17.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is how Morales rounded up his legal team, signing
without legislative approval _ which the attorney general said he
didn't need _ a contingency fee contract guaranteeing the private
lawyers 15 percent of whatever the state won or negotiated from the
tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Morales said it was necessary to contract the legal work out
because the Legislature never would have appropriated the millions
of dollars necessary to prepare and try such a complex, high-stakes
suit. As part of the deal, the private lawyers agreed to pay the
up-front legal expenses, which wouldn't have been reimbursed if the
state had lost.
</P>
<P>
   Morales also insisted that he needed the toughest, most
experienced plaintiffs' lawyers to wage war on a previously
unbeatable industry, and you don't find that caliber of legal
talent or experience working on the attorney general's state
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   No one challenged the contingency agreement when it was signed
in 1996 because 15 percent seemed like a pretty good deal. It was
less than half the percentage plaintiffs' lawyers normally obtain
in fees.
</P>
<P>
   And, if the truth be known, few other state officials expected
the attorney general to win the suit anyway. At that time,
cigarette makers hadn't started surrendering.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas secured a record settlement, and a federal judge
awarded the full 15 percent contingency. The sheer size of the
agreement made the lawyers' cut huge, and suddenly their fees were
an even larger controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The fees sparked a war, which raged the first half of this year,
between Morales on one side and Gov. George W. Bush, several
legislators and civil justice reformers on the other. There is a
temporary truce now, but the dispute still hasn't been settled, and
some lawmakers already are making plans to curb the independence of
Morales' successors.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, who isn't seeking re-election, will leave office in
January.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Bill Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, the influential
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, didn't challenge the
legal fees in the tobacco case and doesn't want to outlaw
contingency deals.
</P>
<P>
   But he believes the Legislature, as the budget-setting branch of
state government, should change the law during next year's session
to prohibit the attorney general or any other state official from
agreeing to contingency fees without the Legislature's approval.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislative Budget Board's approval could suffice when the
full Legislature isn't in session, Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that would compromise the attorney general's
independence any more than the Legislature already does when it
approves the attorney general's budget,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The founding fathers intended for the Legislature to control
the purse strings.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the two nominees for Morales' job differ on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Republican John Cornyn, a former Texas Supreme Court justice,
said he believes the Texas Constitution requires lawmakers'
approval of contingency fee agreements because the fees amount to
an appropriation of state money.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, who filed a suit challenging the tobacco fee arrangement
earlier this year, said he would support legislation to clarify the
Legislature's authority in future cases.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic candidate Jim Mattox, a former attorney general and
self-described champion of the ``little people,'' suggested the
attack on contingency fees was part of an effort by big businesses
and insurance companies, which heavily lobby the Legislature, to
seek more protection from public interest suits.
</P>
<P>
   The debate will continue.
</P>
<P>
   If the Legislature gives itself the clear-cut authority to veto
contingency deals, lawmakers _ and not the state's top lawyer _
would effectively decide how many, if any, ``mega-suits'' the state
files in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Their decisions could impact environmental, health and other
concerns of importance to millions of Texans.

PERSONAL HEALTH: THE MUSCLE-BUILDING SECRET IS OUT OF THE BOTTLE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   As baseball fans cheer on Mark McGwire's effort to capture the
seasonal home run record set by Roger Maris in 1961, manufacturers
of a dietary supplement called creatine are cheering wildly, too.
The Cardinals' first baseman says he has been aided in his quest by
the muscles and strength he acquired through creatine-supplemented
workouts.

Anderson, another creatine user who has been transformed from a
virtual 97-pound weakling into a hulk, and the many other
professional athletes who swear by it, countless prospective
athletes and scrawny teen-age boys are now spending upwards of $200
million a year on creatine. By taking this perfectly legal but
minimally tested and unregulated substance, they hope to improve
their scores and/or physiques. As a result, creatine has become one
of the hottest selling supplements.
</P>
<P>
   There is good reason for creatine's popularity. Unlike the
anabolic steroids that mimic the effects of the male sex hormone
testosterone, creatine does not cause hair loss or make the
testicles shrink. Although virtually nothing is known about
possible long-term hazards, no obvious adverse effects have been
linked to creatine use. Although sales fell significantly last year
after the deaths of three wrestlers taking creatine, the supplement
was subsequently cleared of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   And since creatine is a substance naturally present in common
foods and manufactured by the body, it has not been _ nor is it
likely to be _ banned from use in athletic competitions. Another
over-the-counter supplement used by McGwire and others,
androstenedione, is converted to the steroid hormone testosterone
in the body and has been banned by several leading athletic
associations. Athletes who test positive for steroid use can be
stripped of medals or forbidden to compete, but it would not be
possible to tell whether an athlete got creatine from a steak or a
bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Creatine may also prove helpful beyond the playing field to
counter the muscle wasting that occurs, for example, in AIDS
patients, the elderly and people with cancer or chronic heart
failure.
</P>
<P>
   Creatine is an amino acid made in the liver and kidneys and
acquired in the diet from animal protein foods, especially meats,
milk and some fish. The muscles of a 154-pound person need about 2
grams of creatine a day (more or less depending on muscle mass).
Meat eaters get about half that from their diets (a half-pound of
meat has about 1 gram); the rest is made in the body. As might be
expected, creatine levels are lower in vegetarians.
</P>
<P>
   Creatine is stored in muscle cells as the compound
phosphocreatine, which the body uses to enhance the action of the
muscles. It also increases the water content of muscle cells, which
adds to their size and probably their ability to function as well.
The typical user of creatine supplements gains weight from an
increase in lean body mass, not body fat. Users also are likely to
experience a rise in blood levels of the heart-protective HDL
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Studies of the effects of creatine supplementation on athletic
performance have clearly shown that its benefits are limited to
anaerobic activities that involve short intense bursts of energy,
like weight lifting, sprinting and jumping and, it seems, slamming
a baseball over the outfield fence. Unlike endurance pursuits like
running, swimming and cycling, anaerobic activities do not require
a steady supply of oxygen. Researchers say that creatine is of no
particular benefit to endurance athletes, who may in fact be slowed
down by creatine supplements because of the weight gain they cause.
</P>
<P>
   Creatine's benefits are likely the result of an increased
ability to train intensely and gain strength and improve body
composition as a result of such training. Creatine offers no
particular benefit to a sedentary person _ you have to work out
regularly when taking it to reap its rewards. Nor is it likely to
be helpful to weekend athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise experts who have studied creatine offer the following
dosage recommendations to those who decide to take it: Start with
20 to 25 grams a day for five or six days, which loads muscle cells
with the most creatine they can hold. Absorption is enhanced when
creatine _ which can be taken in capsule, powder or other forms _
is taken with a high-carbohydrate drink, although the common advice
to take it with fruit juice has been nixed by some experts. After
the loading dose, take a maintenance dose of two to five grams a
day. As long as the maintenance dose is continued, the cells will
remain saturated with creatine, these experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Can you safely take it indefinitely? The answer to this question
remains unclear. What is known, however, is that taking more than
the recommended amount of creatine is a waste and may increase the
likelihood of an adverse reaction. Side effects reported
anecdotally include gastrointestinal distress, nausea and muscle
cramping, although these effects have not been noted in the course
of scientific studies of the supplement.
</P>
<P>
   However, people with kidney disorders are advised not to take
creatine supplements. Creatine supplements also increase the
likelihood of dehydration and should not be used when dehydration
is a risk, for example, when exercising in extreme heat or when
trying to make weight in wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   It is generally a good idea to have a thorough medical checkup
before starting creatine supplementation and, since there are no
long-term safety studies, to have periodic kidney and liver
function tests and cardiac examinations.
</P>
<P>
   A word to wise young athletes and their parents: No studies have
been done on the effects of creatine supplements on the growth,
development or health of children and adolescents, said Dr. William
O. Roberts of MinnHealth SportsCare in White Bear Lake, Minn., a
family physician and consultant to the magazine The Physician and
Sportsmedicine.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, too, that because creatine is sold as a dietary
supplement and not as a drug, it is not required to meet the
standards of the Food and Drug Administration for purity or safety.
Quality assurance is up to the manufacturer, and not all producers
are equally careful or honorable. Be sure to choose a reputable
brand; a bargain may be no bargain.

HOW TO COPE WITH EMERGING FEARS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week was a painful lesson in how scary it can be to invest
in emerging, undeveloped stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Mexico reported that its gross domestic product
rose 4.5 percent in the second quarter, but that hasn't stopped the
Mexican stock market from plummeting 40 percent from the start of
this year through last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   So what do you do now? If you have Latin American investments,
do you bail out or stay? If you don't hold any of these
investments, is this bottom-fishing time?
</P>
<P>
   Answering that question based on the advice from experts is
difficult because they offer contradictory advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not just run in and try to catch a falling knife,''
said David Doherty, a principal at Crawford-Doherty Capital
Management Group in Houston, a money management firm that
specializes in global investing. ``If you're trying to bottom-fish
right here, you're probably not going to reach the bottom and it
could go lower.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Wolper, associate editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds in
Chicago, which covers mutual funds, was more willing to take a look
at buying there now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have reason to be positive in that region, then this is
a good time because of the fall-down in the markets, but if you're
not that familiar with the region and you're just looking at the
prices, I wouldn't say you should jump in because they can always
fall further.''
</P>
<P>
   The Latin American markets could fall another 5 to 10 percent,
said Hamilton Lewis, a technical market analyst and head of
Hamilton Lewis Capital Management in Houston, a money management
firm.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, nobody knows when the markets will hit bottom and
how much further they'll fall. This is why it's important for
investors to follow the cardinal rules of investing that over time
have generally held true.
</P>
<P>
   One of those rules is to buy and hold an investment for the long
term. By doing this, you don't have to worry as much about the
normal downs in the market because you know that over the long
haul, the stock market gives you the biggest bang for your buck.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S. market, that philosophy has done well for investors
because stocks return an average 10 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   But that wisdom doesn't always hold true when you invest in
foreign stocks, especially those in developing markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexico Fund, a closed-end investment company, had a negative
0.8 percent average annual total return in the five years ended
July 31.
</P>
<P>
   That compares with a 5 percent average annual total return for
Latin America funds for the same period.
</P>
<P>
   And an average annual total return for foreign stock funds in
the five years ended July 31 was 11.6 percent, Wolper said.
</P>
<P>
   Portfolio theory holds that the safest way to make money over
the long term is to hold a broad mix of asset classes, including
small stocks, bonds, foreign stocks and domestic large-company
shares.
</P>
<P>
   It really pays to diversify. During these tough times, it
doesn't pay to own a fund that invests in stocks of a single
country.
</P>
<P>
   If you were diversified, the pain would have been less during
these turbulent times in the market. The challenge here is to find
ways to determine whether it's time for you to sell.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're like most investors, you're likely to react to the
market and get out at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt Associates, an employee benefits consulting firm, which
started an index to measure the behavior of those who invest in
401(k) retirement savings plans, found that those investors are
moving out of stocks when the market falls, and into stocks when
the market rises.
</P>
<P>
   That's the opposite of the investment adage of buy low, sell
high. Selling out now will lock in losses.
</P>
<P>
   Ask yourself if you can afford further losses in your Latin
America investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have the long-term perspective, you stay right where
you are,'' Doherty said.
</P>
<P>
   However, don't pour too much money into the region. Invest a set
amount consistently.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would not want to have more than 8 percent of your assets
in Latin America,'' Doherty said.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have the skills to adequately evaluate where the markets
in the region are going?
</P>
<P>
   ``It requires a long-term outlook and it requires the capability
of identifying appropriate vehicles,'' said Jack Borland, manager
of the foreign exchange group at Chase Bank of Texas in Houston.

   &UR; Backyard Bugs &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How many insects and other arthropods might you find in a
Northeastern backyard?
</P>
<P>
   A. The number of individuals and species would depend on many
variables, like soil condition and chemical use, but if the first
few inches of soil were included, the totals might be impressive,
said Dr. Kefyn Catley, a scientist at the American Museum of
Natural History in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A former curator at the museum, Frank Lutz, surveyed backyard
insects in the 1930s and collected 1,402 species, including 467
butterflies and moths, 258 flies, 259 beetles and 167 wasps, bees
and ants from a 75-by-200-foot garden in a northeastern New Jersey
suburb. He did not include arachnids like spiders and mites.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would like to do the same survey 60 years later and
compare changes,'' Catley said.
</P>
<P>
   A suburban lawn is a monoculture, a single-crop field, Catley
emphasized, ``and since, in general, biodiversity increases with
complexity, the number of large easily visible arthropod species on
the surface of the soil or in the grass itself would be fairly
low.'' He estimated 25 to 50, with the number greatly reduced if
pesticides had been used.
</P>
<P>
   ``However,'' he continued, ``if we include the fauna of the
litter layer and top few inches of the soil, provided it was not
compacted, we could find huge numbers of individuals of springtails
and mites, as many as tens of thousands per square meter, and up to
50 species of springtails per square meter have been found in
woodland soil.''

CLINTON VOWS MORE U.S. HELP IF RUSSIA STICKS WITH FREE ENTERPRISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Clinton, heading into the deepening economic
and political storm sweeping Russia, vowed Monday to provide U.S.
help to Russia if the beleaguered nation sticks with democracy and
free enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's promise, which didn't include details, came as he left
Washington to fly to Moscow for his fourth one-on-one summit with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Yeltsin are lameduck presidents who have been
weakened halfway through their second-terms by domestic political
crises. Clinton is trying to recover his footing and deflect
demands for his resignation after admitting an improper sexual
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, too, is battling demands that he resign following the
unraveling of his six-year overhaul of the once-centralized
economy. The economic crisis here forced the Kremlin on Aug. 17 to
devalue the Russian currency by 34 percent, freeze banks'
hard-currency payments to western creditors and halt government
payments on government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton departed for Moscow, a chamber of the Russian
legislature _ the Communist-dominated Duma _ voted 251 to 94 to
reject Yeltsin's emergency appointment of Viktor Chernomyrdin as
prime minister. Chernomyrdin needed 226 votes for confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Yeltsin, who deal with each other on a ``Bill and
Boris'' basis, are expected to focus on the crumbling Russian
economy during their two meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to do is to go there (Russia) and tell them that
the easy thing to do is not the right thing to do,'' Clinton said.
``The easy thing to do would be to try to go back to the way they
did it before _ and it's not possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that if Russia continues on the road to reform,
``then I believe America and the rest of the western nations with
strong economies should help them and indeed have an obligation to
help them.'' He made his remarks to an elementary school audience
in Herndon, Va., before boarding Air Force One for an overnight
flight here.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, both reformers and supporters of the old system
warned of chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is on the verge of political and economic collapse,''
Chernomyrdin declared.
</P>
<P>
   Communist party chief Gennady Zyuganov warned that the
Communists, Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin must agree to throttle back
economic reform and soften the hardships among the Russian public
or ``everything will spill out to the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Kotenkov, a Yeltsin supporter in parliament, said
continued gridlock between Yeltsin and the anti-reformers in the
legislature could ignite ``a popular uprising _ merciless and
senseless.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Duma rejected Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin vowed to
immediately resubmit his appointment, setting the stage for the
Duma to take up the nomination about the same time that Clinton is
scheduled to arrive Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has the power under the post-Soviet constitution to
resubmit his nomination three times and then to disband parliament
and install his selection without parliamentary approval if the
Duma continues to oppose his choice.
</P>
<P>
   In his pre-departure remarks, Clinton said America must support
Russia to stem potential chaos across a nation of 148 million that
could imperil the security of a Cold War-era nuclear arsenal or
prompt desperate Russians to sell nuclear weapons to terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said U.S. ``partnership'' with Russia also remains
essential to quell a threatened nuclear arms race between India, an
ally of Russia, and Pakistan, an ally of China. Clinton also cited
U.S.-Russian cooperation to end the Bosnian civil war and the need
for cooperation to prevent expanded communal warfare in the
predominantly-Albanian province of Kosovo in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Clinton nor his aides here in Moscow outlined what the
administration has in mind for additional assistance to Russia. The
Russian economic crisis is already forcing the U.S.-led
International Monetary Fund to reexamine the scope and terms of a
$22.6 billion bailout loan over 18 months. A $4.3 billion
installment is scheduled to be paid to Russia on Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Clinton's remarks foreshadowed a personal appeal to
Russians that he planned to deliver here Tuesday at Moscow State
University of International Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton addressed Russians at the same site in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS - STORY MAY END HERE)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin reverted back to Chernomyrdin after sacking Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, the little known bureaucrat whom he
elevated five months ago to replace Chernomyrdin. The switch was
urged by the wealthy oligarchy of Russian business leaders who have
taken over many of the state-run enterprises that sustained the
Soviet Union before its downfall in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma's vote on Monday was the latest chapter in a power
struggle between Yeltsin and the Communists, who hold 138 seats in
the 450-seat Duma. The Communists are seeking control of 10 of the
Kremlin's more than 30 government ministries and the promised
resignation of Yeltsin once Chernomyrdin is confirmed.

DEEP SEA EXPLORER MAY TAKE RESEARCH TO NEW LOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(HLW) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sea has millions of dark secrets. And now, a famous explorer
is to illuminate more of them.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a third of a century, Alvin, the world's first
craft to roam the abyss with relative ease, has been ferrying
American scientists into the planet's sunless depths and racking up
a staggering record of discovery, including dark ecosystems that,
with riots of tube worms and other bizarre creatures, rival rain
forests in richness.
</P>
<P>
   But the plucky, white, 25-foot-long craft has its shortcomings.
Most notably, it can plunge down only so far without the deep's
pressures suddenly crushing its crew capsule (and three occupants).
For dives, the safety limit is 2.8 miles.
</P>
<P>
   That distance is little more than the sea's average depth and
far short of its deepest spot, seven miles down, much lower than
Everest is high. The upshot is that a large part of the seabed,
with its dark recesses and riddles and perhaps even a den or two of
undiscovered monsters, is out of Alvin's reach. Off limits is an
area larger than Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Alvin is getting a major overhaul that may extend its
reach and allow it to match and possibly even surpass newer
submersibles abroad, making it the world leader.
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkable bonanza from the end of the Cold War, the Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institution, which runs Alvin, has just received
from the Navy a submersible known as Sea Cliff, which has been
decommissioned in the wake of military cutbacks and changing
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Woods Hole and its federal patrons have insufficient money to
run Sea Cliff, designed for military work, as a separate vehicle.
But Woods Hole is happy to cannibalize its parts to improve Alvin,
a process now getting under way. The trove is rich. Alvin cost
about $50 million, and Sea Cliff about $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   The crown jewel of Sea Cliff is its crew capsule. The walls are
made of a thick layer of super-strong titanium that can withstand
pressures down to depths of 3.8 miles (or 6 kilometers). So Woods
Hole is now studying whether the capsule can be transferred to
Alvin, a move that would extend the reach of the tiny submersible
by a full mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a responsibility to make sure it's the best,'' Dr.
Robert B. Gagosian, the director of Woods Hole, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to push even deeper and capitalize on the politics of the
moment, the institution is seeing whether further strengthening
would allow Alvin to plunge down to depths of 4.3 miles (or 7
kilometers) _ deeper than any of the rival submersibles now
operated by Russia, France and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been the leaders in exploration,'' Dr. Gagosian said.
``In order to continue that tradition, we need to have the
deepest-diving submersible. It's that simple. We want to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say major questions of geology, biology and even
archaeology now lie beyond Alvin's current reach, not to mention
the unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's important science to be done'' in the sea's deeper
regions, said Dr. Daniel J. Fornari, head scientist for the deep
submergence program at Woods Hole. ``It's such a compelling part of
the planet. We've got this sitting in our backyard and we know so
little about it. It's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, Alvin users have been the first to glimpse the
seabed's dark ecosystems, its hot chimneys, its cold seeps, its
rocky chains of mountains longer than the Andes and its lost human
worlds, such as the Titanic. The explorers have also brought to
light thousands of new species of animal life, including slimy
things seemingly fit for monster movies.
</P>
<P>
   This record of ongoing excellence is causing some of the
submersible's users to view any renovations warily.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing is clear,'' said Richard F. Pittenger, head of
marine operations at Woods Hole. ``We don't want to screw up the
reliability in the process of trying to make the submersible
better.''
</P>
<P>
   When Alvin was first proposed by Woods Hole in the 1960s, it was
considered a curiosity. Most military officials and scientists of
the day cared little about people exploring the deep. No regular
Navy contractor wanted job. So the submersible was built by General
Mills, the maker of breakfast cereals.
</P>
<P>
   The situation changed after a Navy submarine, the Thresher, sank
with 129 men in 1963. Its wreckage remained lost for months. In the
catastrophe's wake, the Navy decided to throw itself into mastering
the abyss.
</P>
<P>
   No expense was too great. The Navy built two Alvin look-alikes,
Sea Cliff and Turtle. Both were heavier and faster than their
forerunner. Eventually, in 1984, Sea Cliff dove much deeper, with
its stronger crew capsule.
</P>
<P>
   However, foreign submersibless began to rival Sea Cliff's
maximum depth of 3.8 miles and to make new discoveries. In 1990,
the Japanese pulled ahead with a new submersible that plunged down
4 miles. Woods Hole scientists looked on sheepishly in 1994 as the
Japanese submersible, Shinkai 6500, set an Atlantic depth record.
Today, the 31-foot-long Japanese submersible is still unrivaled.
</P>
<P>
   Such competitive pressure is one reason Woods Hole is eager to
have Alvin go deeper. The more important reason is raw knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say the inky deep is not only inherently provocative
but important to understand if people are to be good planetary
stewards. It is the Earth's largest habitat, containing, by some
estimates, 97 percent of the space inhabited by living things.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the planet's lifeblood. Its voluminous waters supply
vital elements that sustain life on the surface and regulate
planetary heat flow, keeping the land temperate.
</P>
<P>
   Geologically, the deep is the planet's most dynamic feature, the
place where huge slabs of crust are created and destroyed. About 90
percent of the Earth's volcanism happens undersea.
</P>
<P>
   Gagosian, the Woods Hole director, said a deeper-diving Alvin
could better study these cauldrons, which also support lush
ecosystems and are suspected of being the place where life arose
four billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A deeper-diving Alvin, he said, could not only explore the sites
directly but could wire the ocean with sensitive detectors meant to
track distant seaquakes. A great opportunity for such wiring lies
in old telephone cables that criss-cross the sea's abyssal plains,
Gagosian said.
</P>
<P>
   This month, one such cable between California and Hawaii is to
be lifted from a depth of 3.1 miles and fitted with geologic
detectors _ an oceanographic first. A deeper Alvin could service
such devices, eliminating the need for lifting the cable, which is
a risky job.
</P>
<P>
   A deeper Alvin would also be able to visit more of humanity's
lost worlds. The luxury liner, Titanic, resting at a depth of more
than two miles, is now within Alvin's reach and was visited in 1986
by the tiny white submersible, but thousands of other wrecks lie
deeper.
</P>
<P>
   One is the I-52, a Japanese submarine sunk in World War II while
carrying a shipment of two tons of gold, 146 bars of it packed in
metal boxes. Discovered in 1995 more than three miles down on the
Atlantic abyssal plain, the I-52 wreckage is now slated for further
exploration as the salvage team searches for vehicles than can go
that deep.
</P>
<P>
   Bits of Sea Cliff are already being transferred to Alvin. The
first to go was the military submersible's digital sonar.
</P>
<P>
   Barrie B. Walden, manager of deep submergence at Woods Hole,
said incorporating Sea Cliff's crew capsule into Alvin might cost
$15 million, a sum as yet unapproved by federal planners. He said
the upgrade could be done during the sub's next major overhaul,
which is scheduled for the end of 2000, allowing it to start the
new millennium on an auspicious note.
</P>
<P>
   With Alvin diving to depths of 3.8 miles (or 6 kilometers), the
region outside its reach would shrink dramatically, contracting
from something larger than Asia to the size of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Gagosian, eager for even greater penetration of the sea's
darkness, has asked Woods Hole experts to assess the feasibility of
Alvin's plunging to depths of 4.3 miles (or 7 kilometers). But
achieving that may take more than Sea Cliff's sphere, and might
cost $100 million _ big money in a field that gets about $20
million a year in federal money.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists feel such money is unlikely to materialize. But
others are hopeful, saying that the potential returns are huge and
the cost is extraordinarily low compared with other Federal science
investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's way underfunded,'' Fornari said of the nation's efforts
at deep exploration, still led by Alvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's appalling how little it gets and how much gets done.''

   In a recent television profile, Sting argued that he was more
than just a pretty face. ``Rock stars and footballers are supposed
to be  &UR; idiot savants &LR; ,'' he trilled. ``We're not supposed to have
read Proust.'' Monsieur Sting's erudition may indeed be staggering,
but chances are  &UR; idiot savant &LR;  didn't come into his vocabulary by
way of Swann.
</P>
<P>
   First coined by the British doctor J. Langdon Down (he of the
famous syndrome) in 1887, the expression doesn't particularly
benefit from a Gallic accent _ since it is virtually unknown in
France.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for  &UR; double entendre &LR; ,  &UR; affaire d'amour &LR;  and
 &UR; resume &LR; . At SoHo galleries, such expressions give one's dialogue a
cachet, a certain  &UR; je ne sais quoi &LR;  ( &UR; n'est-ce pas, cheri? &LR; ). At a
Bastille vernissage, they'll provoke embarrassing silences,
incomprehension and slack jaws.
</P>
<P>
   When the French want to say a song has two meanings, one of
which is  &UR; risque &LR;  (which, incidentally, implies that it is
dangerous, not daringly suggestive), they'll describe it as  &UR; a
double sens &LR; , not a  &UR; double entendre &LR; . When they talk about
 &UR; affaires &LR; , they mean business, not  &UR; aventures amoureuses &LR; . And a
 &UR; resume &LR;  is the plot summary that precedes the final installment of
a  &UR; telefilm &LR;  _ unlike a  &UR; curriculum vitae &LR; , or CV, which precedes
the arrival of the job applicant.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's French or English doing the borrowing, most loan
words should be handled with more than a  &UR; soupcon &LR;  of suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Terms like  &UR; le fastfood &LR; ,  &UR; le jogging &LR;  and  &UR; le weekend &LR;  are
routinely cited as examples of how, faced with a changing world
tragically tongue-tied by a rigid, rule-bound lexicon, the French
are forced to borrow words wholesale from the more dynamic,
flexible English language. Unfortunately, the ``English'' that most
French people speak is a bizarre, English-like pidgin that would be
Greek to anyone born on this side of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   You may be able to muddle through a Parisian's complaint about
 &UR; le barman &LR;  who makes customers order at least  &UR; un dry &LR;  (martini,
that is) before he'll allow them to play  &UR; flipper &LR;  or  &UR; baby-foot &LR; 
(pinball or Foosball), let alone use  &UR; les waters &LR;  (the ones in the
closet,  &UR; bien sur &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   But when someone tells you that she threw on a  &UR; sweat &LR;  (as in
shirt, but pronounced like a brand of saccharin), hopped into her
 &UR; break &LR;  (station wagon) and headed to the Bois de Vincennes for
some  &UR; footing &LR;  (a jog or a brisk walk), you know you've entered a
linguistic no man's land.
</P>
<P>
   Parisians expect Anglophones to understand them when they
discuss  &UR; la speakerine &LR;  (newscaster) who went to Switzerland for
 &UR; un lifting &LR;  (of the face), accuse one another of  &UR; snobisme &LR;  or
complain about how it's impossible to rent a luxurious apartment
 &UR; de standing &LR;  on the strength of a mere  &UR; shake-hand &LR; . After all,
these are English words with an impeccable pedigree _ or so most
French people seem to think.
</P>
<P>
   The German linguist Herbert Pilch called this process
pseudoborrowing and noted that it was endemic among the
sesquilingual of Europe _ his name for those who have mastered one
and a half languages. Pilch argued that since English had become
Europe's de facto second language, speech peppered with Anglo-Saxon
expressions was becoming a hallmark of a higher education.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he pointed out, was that though many Europeans had
at one time studied English, they retained only a superficial
knowledge of the language. Since the sesquilingual in Europe aren't
routinely in contact with native English speakers, they chatter
away in quasi-English without fear of correction or contradiction.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the blissful persistence of words that bear a structural
resemblance to English: the misplaced apostrophes of  &UR; pin's &LR;  _ for
a metal lapel badge _ and  &UR; jean's &LR;  and the absurd gerund endings of
 &UR; le shampooing &LR;  (the product, not the process),  &UR; le travelling &LR;  (a
dolly shot in cinematography) and  &UR; le brushing &LR;  (a blow-dry).
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, English _ which has earned a reputation for being a
promiscuous language _ isn't guilty of too much pseudoborrowing, at
least when it comes to French. The sad fact is, since most North
American English speakers can only dream of speaking one and a half
languages, they're hardly capable of inventing words that look
foreign.
</P>
<P>
   Native English speakers prefer to haul out aging French
expressions, accents and italics intact, for ostentatious display
at gallery openings and cocktail parties and in op-ed pieces.
</P>
<P>
   A little linguistic knowledge can be a useful thing. The next
time you find yourself buttonholed by a tiresome snob proud of his
 &UR; repartee &LR;  (that's  &UR; repartie &LR;  in Paris), you might want to feign
incomprehension of some of his more egregious and obsolete
Gallicisms.
</P>
<P>
   If he mentions, for example, that he chose a  &UR; nom de plume &LR;  that
reflected the sophisticated milieu of his first novel, just look at
him blankly, wait a beat and reply: ``Ohhh, you mean you chose a
 &UR; pseudonyme &LR; .'' Taken aback, he'll scold you for not having heard
of his book, a literary  &UR; nonpareil &LR;  that was a real  &UR; succes de
scandale &LR;  thanks to its cast of  &UR; outre &LR;  characters.
</P>
<P>
   Imitate his pronunciation of ``ooo-tray,'' arch an eyebrow and
ask him what his characters were so outraged about. After
suggesting that he meant to say  &UR; outrancier &LR;  _ which is closer to
outrageous _ and  &UR; une chose sans pareille &LR; , ask him to explain
 &UR; succes de scandale &LR; . Along with  &UR; toupee &LR;  ( &UR; une moumoute &LR;  or
 &UR; postiche &LR; ) and  &UR; brassiere &LR;  ( &UR; un soutien-gorge &LR; ), the expression
has dropped out of French idiom.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that our language would be better off if a
few such overused expressions were bundled up in the middle of the
night and forcefully expatriated via Concorde and Eurostar Express.
``That's life'' and ``so-so'' would get along just fine without
their pretentious Continental cousins  &UR; c'est la vie! &LR;  and  &UR; comme
ci, comme ca &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   A few French phrases, however, express ideas more succinctly and
evocatively than any in English and deserve to be coaxed into
day-to-day use. I'd like to be able to  &UR; chambrer &LR;  a bottle of wine,
for example _ bringing it to room temperature sounds like too much
trouble. Sleeping off that same bottle the next morning has
something sordid about it, but I could  &UR; cuver &LR;  any amount of
Bordeaux with dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, I miss being in a country where sleeping in after a
night on the town _  &UR; une grasse matinee &LR;  after  &UR; une nuit blanche &LR;  _
is not a sign of shameful sloth but a national pastime.

GREAT HEAT AND COLD MAY HAVE SPAWNED ANIMALS ON EARTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(HLW) 
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first animals on Earth may have been shocked into existence
by the evolutionary one-two punch of a climatic episode so cold
that the oceans froze _ snowball Earth _ followed by one of the
hottest periods in Earth history, according to a new hypothesis
based largely on studies of carbon atoms in ancient sediments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we have, finally, an explanation for the first
appearance of animal life on Earth,'' said Dr. Paul F. Hoffman, a
geologist at Harvard University who led the study, a report of
which appears in the current issue of Science. It is, he said, a
question that ``has bedeviled paleontologists since before
Darwin.''
</P>
<P>
   Living things had materialized by 3.8 billion years ago, 700
million or 800 million years after the planet was formed out of the
same interstellar dust cloud that gave birth to the sun. But as far
as scientists can tell, for the next 3 billion years life consisted
of nothing more complex than bacteria and algae. The first tiny
animals, simple disk-shaped creatures, are thought to have appeared
about 600 million years ago, and the first diverse animals soon
afterward. Both events occurred near the end of a period of
alternating episodes of snowball Earth and hothouse Earth. ``We
think it's not a coincidence,'' Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Cataclysmic changes in the environment, it is now widely
believed, have often provided the impetus for evolutionary change
by wiping out some species and paving the way for others to arise.
Many such episodes have been documented, but they are far less
drastic than the events proposed by Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Their novel idea about the relationship of the snowball-Earth
cycles to the rise of animal life is untested. It is not clear that
a direct connection exists between snowball Earth, hothouse Earth
and the appearance of animals, said Dr. Douglas Irwin, a
paleontologist at the Smithsonian Institution who studies
large-scale evolutionary patterns. ``But clearly, these kinds of
extreme environmental fluctuations, if borne out, would provide a
very powerful motor of evolutionary change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hoffman study may also lend weight to the controversial
theory of snowball Earth itself, and help explain how the Earth
recovered from that long-ago superglaciation _ and why there has
never been another so severe. The animals themselves, it seems, may
play a role in preventing the latter occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of snowball Earth was proposed in 1992 by Dr. Joseph L.
Kirschvink of the California Institute of Technology as a possible
explanation for magnetic and chemical evidence that ice had once
existed near the equator and that little or no oxygen had entered
the ocean from the atmosphere at that time.
</P>
<P>
   The idea stirred instant contention. Some scientists thought
that the overturning of ocean layers could explain the puzzling
data. Others believed a tilt in the Earth's axis different from
today's might have been responsible. And computer models of the
climate system had suggested that once the Earth entered a totally
frozen state, it would not be able to recover from it.
</P>
<P>
   But other experts, including Dr. Ken Caldeira, now of the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, and Dr. James
F. Kasting of Pennsylvania State University, as well as Kirschvink,
suggested a possible way out: emissions of carbon dioxide from
terrestrial volcanoes, which would trap heat in the atmosphere and
build up over millions of years, rewarming the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman and his colleagues have examined isotopes of carbon
buried in ancient ocean sediments in what is now Namibia between
750 million and 570 million years ago. The relative amounts of the
two isotopes, carbon 12 and carbon 13, vary depending on how much
organic carbon, the residue of dead microbes, is being buried in
the sediments. A low ratio signifies that none is being buried, as
would happen if the Earth froze over. This is because
photosynthesis in the ocean would cease, and no carbon-containing
microbes would exist to die and be buried.
</P>
<P>
   The carbon evidence was the piece of the puzzle Hoffman needed
to flesh out the new hypothesis. According to it, at least four
snowball glaciations took place between 750 million and 570 million
years ago, each followed by a hothouse episode. A much earlier
glaciation might also have frozen the seas about 2.2 billion years
ago. The glaciations were touched off, according to the hypothesis,
when an ancient supercontinent called Rodinia broke into several
continents. This created many thousands of miles of shoreline
sediments, along the coasts of the newly formed Pacific Ocean and a
precursor of the Atlantic, for instance, where carbon could be
buried. The scenario then continues:
</P>
<P>
   As more carbon was buried, less of the element, in the form of
carbon dioxide, remained available for the atmosphere. The planet
cooled as a result. Eventually, accumulating snow and ice reflected
so much of the sun's heat that the catastrophic snowball state was
reached, with ice covering the seas.
</P>
<P>
   But terrestrial volcanoes replenished the atmospheric carbon
dioxide over several million years. Eventually, the ice and snow
melted, a process that might have taken only a few thousand years.
After the melting, less heat was reflected from the planet, and the
warming atmosphere evaporated more water from the oceans. Water
vapor is an even more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.
The result, according to the Hoffman hypothesis, was a catastrophic
warming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the story,'' Kasting said. ``It appears to fit. From a
climatic standpoint, it makes a lot of sense.'' On the other hand,
he said, ``it's going to be controversial.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Dr. Louis Derry, a geochemist at Cornell University,
called the hypothesis ``speculative'' and the evidence on which it
is based ``ambiguous.'' The idea is ``kind of neat,'' he said, in
that it provides a framework with which to try to explain several
kinds of evidence. But, he said, ``It's not clear that it's
compatible with all the data we have.''
</P>
<P>
   How might the cataclysms have stimulated the appearance of
animals? First, Hoffman contends, most of the microscopic creatures
in the sea would have died, dwarfing any mass extinction since. But
a few, because of their genetic makeup, would have been tough
enough to survive, and they could have repopulated the world in new
forms once the icebox and hothouse climates had passed. Some
experts now even postulate that environmental stress can prompt
organisms to change their genetic makeup to overcome the stress.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said the rise of animals might have prevented the
snowball Earth from recurring. Snails and worms in the coastal
sediments eat organic carbon and churn the sediments so that it is
difficult to bury carbon there, according to this view. That means
more carbon is recycled into the atmosphere, keeping the planet
warm.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is subject to further testing and investigation, as
Hoffman noted. Derry called the part about the origin of animals
``highly speculative,'' and Kasting noted that it was puzzling how
a mass extinction of the order proposed by Hoffman could have gone
unnoticed by scientists. ``Maybe it's just the paucity of the
fossil record,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hoffman contends that his hypothesis explains ``all the
major geological features of this time period.'' That, he said,
``is when you know you're on the right track.''

PHONE COMPANIES CREATE TRAFFIC JAM ON ROAD TO INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 (jt)  
 By ROB FIXMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next high hurdle for the personal computer industry is
keeping many a chip maker and computer manufacturer awake at night,
because after 15 years of building ever faster and more powerful
machines, the wizards of silicon increasingly find themselves at
the mercy of local phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   The hurdle is the capacity of a channel to carry signals from
one point to another, known as bandwidth. The channel in question
is the local telephone network, and as the future of computing
comes to rest more and more with the Internet, the phone companies
represent a serious bottleneck. No matter how much faster the
microprocessors and memory chips, no matter how much more efficient
the architecture of the machines, the finest computer technology
dead-ends with the phone jack in every consumer's wall.
</P>
<P>
   Computer technology gave us the Internet; telephone technology
gave us the World Wide Wait. The reason for this is rooted in vast
differences between the two industries.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing in microscopic distances, the chip makers have grown
accustomed to improving performance continually and exponentially
by finding ways to reduce the lengths of paths that electrons must
travel within silicon wafers while at the same time multiplying the
number of paths within the chips and between components. The net
result has been an enormous increase in bandwidth _ and in power.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp.'s 8088 microprocessor, the brains of the original
IBM PC, could carry out about 750,000 instructions per second and
ran at a speed of 8 million cycles per second, or megahertz.
Today's Intel Pentium II processor can carry out 855 million
instructions per second at a speed of up to 450 megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   Things have not moved so fast in the world of telephones. True,
digital switches and fiber optic cables have greatly expanded the
total number of calls that can be placed at any one time. But the
capacity of the typical phone line in a typical home is virtually
the same today as it was in the 1960s. Only so many electrons can
be squeezed through a copper wire.
</P>
<P>
   The computer industry has long struggled to compensate for this
weakness. The first breakthrough came in the late 1970s when Ward
Christensen, an engineer with International Business Machines Corp.
and an early personal computer enthusiast, invented an
error-correction technology and released it to the public domain.
Until then, modems _ devices that enable computers to communicate
over telephone lines by converting digital signals into sounds on
one end of the call and from sounds back to digital signals at the
other end _ were largely useless because phone lines were so noisy
that the receiving modem often failed to differentiate signal from
noise.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, modem makers have made enormous strides in error
correction and in pushing ever more information through standard
phone lines. First the Hayes Corp. and later USRobotics led the way
in accelerating data transmission from 300 bits per second in the
early 1980s to 1,200, then 2,400 and on up to today's 56K modems,
which can theoretically receive 56 thousand bits per second.
</P>
<P>
   But 56K modems are limited by federal telephone rules to 53
thousand bits per second. And the erratic quality of local phone
service limits them even more.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a state of the art USRobotics 56K modem (now made
by the 3Com Corp.) can achieve a speed no greater than 26,400 bits
per second in many of the most densely populated areas of the East
Coast, including big parts of Manhattan and New Jersey, because the
local phone company, Bell Atlantic, has not upgraded its cables and
switches to the demands of high-speed data. In fact, in many
instances, it has installed technologies that compress bandwidth in
order to carry more voice calls, which coincidentally reduces the
capacity of its lines to carry data calls.
</P>
<P>
   A Bell Atlantic customer service representative informs an
inquiring consumer that the company is not obligated to carry
high-speed data calls, so unless the customer is willing to buy a
special modem and fork over a hefty installation fee plus high
monthly charges for an ISDN (integrated services digital network)
line, he or she will be living with a maximum speed of 26,400 bits
per second, or less, for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, Bell Atlantic, like the other local phone
companies, says it cannot keep up with the demand as families order
separate lines for children, fax machines and modems. Critics
respond that this says more about the corporate culture of a
regulated monopoly than it says about the nature of telephone
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the computer industry knows that pointing fingers
accomplishes nothing; at the end of the day, a lot of computer
power is still dammed up behind the modem. So the industry has
begun wooing the local phone companies with incentives.
</P>
<P>
   The carrot is a standard for ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber
line), a technology that offers simultaneous voice and data calls
at speeds up to 8 million bits per second over standard copper
wires. This technology and other flavors of digital subscriber
lines have been around for a long time, but the phone companies
have quarreled bitterly over a standard.
</P>
<P>
   So earlier this year, Compaq, Intel and Microsoft helped to form
the Universal ADSL Working Group and anointed a standard known as
G.lite (the period is pronounced ``dot''). Yet the phone companies
have not yet ratified G.lite, so the first modems will not be
available until at least well into next year, and it could take
decades for this technology to reach all American homes.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the stick: building specific circuitry, known as ethernet,
into its machines to allow them to connect directly to cable modems
without a special installation. The most recent example of this is
the Apple iMac, a home-market computer that has built-in ethernet
circuitry. Ethernets are the standard networks used in businesses,
but the only use for such technology in the vast majority of homes
is to connect the computer to the phone companies' most dangerous
competition in data bandwidth _ cable television companies that
offer high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   And just in case that fails to get the local phone companies'
attention, Microsoft's chairman, William Gates, earlier this year
invested $1 billion in the Comcast cable television network, one of
the most aggressive marketers of cable modem services, while the
Bells' progenitor, AT&AMP;T, is buying TCI, the nation's largest cable
television operator and the largest stockholder of At-Home, the
leading cable modem service.
</P>
<P>
   If the local phone companies fail to make ADSL widely available
soon and at a competitive price, the computer industry is poised to
quickly embrace cable or other alternate channels. And many of
those channels will one day offer local and long-distance phone
services.

   RUSSIA: AT A GLANCE -- Here's a look at Russia and the problems
that brought it to its political and economic crisis:
</P>
<P>
   Population: 146.5 million, and declining as the death rate
outpaces the birth rate. Poor health-care and alcoholism means the
life expectancy for males is 58; 72 for women.
</P>

   Area: The largest country in the world, encompassing 11 time
zones and 6.5 million square miles -- or about 1.8 times the size
of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Government: President Boris Yeltsin is an almost monarch-like
leader, who appoints a prime minister and cabinet to run the
government. The 450-member Duma, the lower house of parliament, is
controlled by the Communists and other hard-line and nationalist
political factions. Its powers are limited, but as it has recently
demonstrated, it can flex its muscle on budget and tax issues and
approval of Yeltsin's appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Politics: Yeltsin, a former Communist official whose crusade for
democracy helped bring down the Soviet Union in 1991, holds
enormous powers granted him by the 1993 constitution. But his
tenure has been marked by repeated economic and political crises.
Russians enjoy personal freedoms unknown during Soviet times, but
the transition to democracy has been slow, in part because Yeltsin
holds almost dictatorial powers. He also has been unable or
unwilling to transform his economic promises into a truly free
market
</P>
<P>
   Economy: In terms of gross domestic product (GDP), the country's
total output of goods and services, Russia does not make the list
of the world's top 20 economies. In GDP, the economy actually
shrank about 40 percent from 1993-97. Oil is the leading export,
but flat world prices mean less-than-expected revenues. Projections
for 1998 show Russia's gross domestic product at just 5.5 percent
of the U.S. GDP. Since the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia has moved
slowly towards a free-market economy. But the privatization of
Soviet-era industry left the bulk of the country's wealth in the
hands of a small number of industrialists and financiers.
Meanwhile, most ordinary Russians have seen their standard of
living drop and the average monthly salary totals only about $200.
</P>
<P>
   Military: Russia's economic problems have forced it to cut back
its armed forces, but it remains the world's second largest nuclear
power. Russia has an estimated 22,000 nuclear weapons and caches of
weapons-grade materials.
</P>
<P>
   THE CURRENT CRISIS: STEP BY STEP
</P>
<P>
   How it began:
</P>
<P>
   Russia showed a glimmer of economic growth in 1997 after years
of declines since the Soviet Union fell. But having failed over the
years to enact economic reforms, unable to collect most taxes and
reliant on oil exports, the economy had deep flaws. Russian
financial markets have suffered since the Asian crisis hit the
economies of the Far East last fall.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next:
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors who poured into Russia in 1996 and 1997, began
pulling out, putting pressure on the government to borrow heavily
from banks abroad, increasing its already substantial debt. In
March, Yeltsin fired the government of Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, saying it had not done enough to fix the economy. He
appointed former banker Sergei Kiriyenko, 36, as prime minister to
lead a team of other young reformers.
</P>
<P>
   Why things didn't get better:
</P>
<P>
   Russia's financial markets continued to slide as investors
continued to bolt and world oil prices slumped. Also, with millions
of Russian workers awaiting back-pay from the state, miners and
other laborers began a series of strikes across the country. The
government was forced to ask for international help. The
International Monetary Fund in July assembled a $22.6 billion
bailout plan intended to give Russia time to enact reforms and get
its house in order.
</P>
<P>
   Why that didn't work:
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's one economic success over the past year had been his
ability to keep inflation low and the ruble, the country's
currency, steady. Russia's Central Bank continued spending its
hard-currency reserves to protect the ruble from falling in value
on currency markets. Eventually, the cash would run out, or Russia
would default on its loans.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis:
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, the government announced a controlled devaluation of
the ruble and a moratorium -- a de-facto default -- on the payment
of about $40 billion in foreign debt. The announcement sent already
dismal financial markets plummeting further and threatened a
free-fall of the ruble. On Aug. 23, Yeltsin announced the surprise
firing of Kiriyenko and his government, naming Chernomyrdin to
replace him. That shook the financial markets even further and sent
the ruble out of control. It also raised speculation that Yeltsin
would hand his presidency to Chernomyrdin when Yeltsin's term ends
in 2000, if not sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Getting out of the crisis:
</P>
<P>
   It won't be easy. The economic problems are deep and severe --
and are beginning to be felt on the street with a rise in consumer
prices and a loss of spending power. The crisis has raised a
fundamental debate over whether Russia should revert to a state
command economy as it had during Soviet times, or pursue meaningful
reforms to seek a free-market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Politics is now deadlocked, meaning Russia is without a
government and with no one leader clearly in charge.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Duma rejected Chernomyrdin as Yeltsin's nominee
for prime minister. If the chamber rejects the nominee or another
Yeltsin choice a total of three times, Yeltsin can appoint a prime
minister by decree and dissolve the legislature. New elections
would take place within three months. That could also bring
Yeltsin's regime crashing down.

RADIOACTIVE `SEEDS' USED ON CANCERS IN PROSTATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)

 By NANCY BETH JACKSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patients with prostate cancer may be able to avoid radical
surgery and subsequent incontinence and impotence with radioactive
seeds, no bigger than grains of rice, that are strategically
implanted in the prostate, says a Seattle doctor who has monitored
152 cancer patients over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, published Tuesday in Cancer, the journal of the
American Cancer Society, show that of patients undergoing the
treatment _ both with and without additional external irradiation
therapy _ 97, or 64 percent, remained clinically and biochemically
free of the disease at the 10-year mark. Only three, or 2 percent,
died of prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In other studies, survival rates after radical prostatectomy and
external beam irradiation, the more conventional forms of
treatment, were comparable or significantly lower than with the
seed implants, said Dr. Haakon Ragde, the lead author of the study
and a urologist at Northwest Hospital in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Although the seed-implant procedure, brachytherapy, has been
around since the turn of the century in a less accurate form, in
the newer procedure iodine-125 seeds are strategically injected
into the prostate using the guidance of ultrasound. The seeds
produce low-level X-rays that destroy tumors from the inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is very little escape of radiation outside the
prostate,'' said Ragde, who pioneered the ultrasound technique in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   Ragde chose subjects ranging in age from 53 to 92 with low to
high grades of prostate cancer as measured by the Gleason score,
which gauges aggressiveness of tumors. ``We selected patients with
a high indication that the cancer was confined to the prostate,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ragde said the procedure was standardized over
the last 10 years. He has done more than 2,000 implants and
``stopped counting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What has surprised me is that it is so easy on the patients,''
Ragde said. ``If a patient has the implant in the morning, he can
have lunch with his wife at noon.''

DISCOVERING BEAUTY IN THE PARABLES OF MATHEMATICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dan Rockmore is an Associate Professor of Mathematics at Dartmouth
College.)  
(The Science Times) 
(HLW) 
 By DAN ROCKMORE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a mathematician, I lately seem to find myself discussing the
movies a lot. Copies of this year's Oscar-winning ``Good Will
Hunting'' are now lining the shelves in the video store; Darren
Aronofsky's ``Pi'' about a reclusive mathematician obsessed with
patterns is becoming a cult classic. Friends, acquaintances,
students all want to talk to me about these movies because they are
``all about math.'' Are they?
</P>
<P>
   Let's take ``Good Will Hunting,'' which I liked. Moviegoers may
be familiar with the story of Will, a young man of college age, who
lives alone in South Boston and works as a janitor at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. He's a genius, with a particular talent
for mathematics. While cleaning the halls one day he sees a problem
that has been left as a challenge on a blackboard and solves it.
His novel solution lands him a place at MIT as an assistant to an
arrogant former young genius who is confronting the diminution of
his mathematical prowess. Along the way Will (Matt Damon) meets a
beautiful woman (Minnie Driver) from the other side of the tracks
(Harvard) and a therapist (Robin Williams) who teach him about
love, trust and life.
</P>
<P>
   So, how is this about math? Well, we hear that the problem
derives from graph theory and is solved using something called
``Fourier systems'' (more properly called Fourier analysis) but
this is of course peripheral.
</P>
<P>
   The main messages of the movie are old and trite: You are either
someone who can do math or you are not; mathematics is impossible
to explain to others, even other mathematicians, and to be a
mathematician and to think about mathematics is to separate
yourself from most of society. After all, what could be more at
odds with Will's working-class, street-wise background than a
talent for mathematics?
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the worst stereotypes of mathematics and
mathematicians, propagated within the discipline as well as
without. The elegance of the subject and its relevance to science
are not even suggested. We see it only as an arcane competition
among arrogant men. To the extent that ``Good Will Hunting'' plays
up the cliches while neglecting the core of mathematics, I'd have
to say that it is hardly about mathematics at all.
</P>
<P>
   The pervasiveness of mathematics is subtle. Life and experience
mainly present us with the apparent manifestations of mathematical
laws underpinning reality, not the equations that describe it.
Similarly, subtlety will be at the heart of any truthful rendering
of a mathematical idea. Identifying these connections need not lead
to madness (as it does for the hero of ``Pi''), but can bring a
deeper appreciation of science and art.
</P>
<P>
   To this end, I would like to juxtapose three other pieces of
current artwork that are (to my eye) deeply mathematically
inspired. Each of these examples, from the movies, visual arts and
literature, acts (intentionally, or unintentionally) as a powerful
metaphor for complex and important mathematical ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Howitt's movie ``Sliding Doors,'' released last spring and
starring Gwyneth Paltrow, is a wonderful illustration of the way
the long-term behavior of a system can be highly sensitive to its
initial conditions, a notion that is at the heart of chaos theory.
The action begins when the heroine leaves work early one day. As
she rushes down the steps to the subway, she swerves to avoid a boy
making his way up the stairs. The movie follows the two paths her
life could take, depending on whether she just misses the train, or
just makes it.
</P>
<P>
   These two possibilities are handled in a beautiful, and in some
ways a very mathematically precise, way. We see the two possible
trajectories of her life intersect many of the same people and
events, each a perturbation of the other, until ultimately they
reach very different final states. This is a clever and
intellectually honest rendering of the much-publicized ``butterfly
effect'' of chaos theory, usually explained as the way small
changes in initial weather conditions, such as the beating of a
butterfly's wings over China, can ultimately mean the difference
between, say, a pleasant day in Hanover, N.H. and a stormy one.
</P>
<P>
   What this simple explanation omits is precisely what the movie
shows so well, how these different outcomes evolve as accumulations
of small differences along the way. It is a beautiful mathematical
parable.
</P>
<P>
   The painter Chuck Close's retrospective, recently at the Museum
of Modern Art, gives expression to the deep ideas that underlie
much of the mathematics of image compression, used in computer
graphics and for sending pictures and movies over the Internet.
Close is best known for his large portraits, created by taking a
photograph, drawing a grid over it, and interpreting the original
photo square by square onto the canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the repertoire of shapes, colors and even media
in each of Close's tiny squares has grown, giving rise to a
tremendous range of expression and feeling. Each variation says
something dramatic and insightful about our natural abilities to
perceive and construct a whole from parts.
</P>
<P>
   Investigations just like this go on in the engineering and
mathematics of image processing, where scientists are trying to
understand the ``best'' ways of representing many kinds of images,
ranging from mammograms to family portraits, as combinations of
smaller more fundamental elements of shape and color. In
particular, the popular Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG)
format, known to almost anyone who has digitized a picture,
proceeds much like an automated Close: transforming an image block
by block, preserving only the most important (perceptible) aspects.
</P>
<P>
   Both approaches, artistic and mathematical, seek to extract the
essence of the whole, to provide honest, compact representations of
the original.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Carol Shields' novel ``Larry's Party'' (Viking, 1997)
is a portrait of the quietly twisting and turning life of Larry
Weller, a landscape architect who specializes in botanical mazes
and labyrinths. As Larry well appreciates, the beauty and appeal of
these constructions are rooted in some deep emotional connection
that we all make with symmetry and geometry of the mazes of our
lives: obstacles that direct us to opportunities, entrances
balanced by exits, the winding paths that we navigate through an
emotional-physical continuum to arrive at what in retrospect looks
like a necessary conclusion. Geometry seeks to understand and
describe the relation of objects in space; symmetry, in the form of
abstract algebra, has always been one of its most important tools.
``Larry's Party'' shows how the symmetries of life can illuminate
our relationships to others, the geometry of experience.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is just a mathematician viewing the world with a
mathematician's eye. I'd like to think that it's a bit more; that
the acclaim received by each of these works shows that mathematics
is not just a collection of complicated problems studied and
understood by a few, but that it is a subject that on a very
profound and intuitive level speaks to all of us. So, I believe
that some of the best art really is about mathematics, but we may
have to dig a little to see it. After all, mathematics, like
beauty, is more than skin-deep.

   &UR; Pollinating Tongue &LR;
</P>
<P>
   And now, easy-on, easy-off pollination.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anton Pauw, a botanist at the University of Cape Town in
South Africa, has uncovered a remarkable mechanism this is used for
pollinating a type of milkweed.
</P>
<P>
   Sacs of pollen have a clip that attaches directly to the tongue
of a foraging sunbird, only to be unclipped when the bird arrives
at the next flower.
</P>
<P>
   The clip, called a corpusculum, has a tiny groove in one side.
In varieties of milkweed known to be pollinated by insects, the
groove catches on a small appendage on an insect body.
</P>
<P>
   The type of milkweed Pauw examined, however, is off-limits to
bugs. The petals of its flowers remain twisted shut, with tiny
insect-proof slits providing the only access to the nectar and
pollen within.
</P>
<P>
   A sunbird pokes its beak through one of the slits and sticks its
tongue out to reach the nectar. That tongue is a high-performance
tool: its edges roll up to form two tiny tubes for sipping, and its
frayed tip forms a perfect attachment spot for the pollen sacs.
</P>
<P>
   Pauw, who reported his findings in a recent issue of Nature,
believes this is the first example of pollination by a bird's
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Troubling Tsunamis &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have been puzzled by the size of the tidal waves that
struck Papua New Guinea on July 17, killing 3,000 people. The
disaster followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.0 on the Richter
scale; normally such huge waves, or tsunamis, are generated by more
powerful tremors.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after surveying the area, a team of American researchers
has suggested that the quake caused an undersea landslide
relatively near the coast, where the sea floor falls off sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The dislocation of a massive amount of material _ as much as 2
cubic miles' worth, the researchers estimate _ would help explain
the size of the three waves, the first calculated at more than 40
feet high and stretching back 2{ miles from the crest.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who were financed by the National Science
Foundation, warn that there are other areas around the Pacific Rim,
including some off the United States, where similar undersea
conditions could turn what might not be a devastating earthquake
into a catastrophic event.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fossilized Innards &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Most fossils are simply a collection of mineralized bones or
shells, with the softer tissues and organs long since vanished
through decay. Those from deposits known as the Burgess Shale in
the Canadian Rockies are an exception.
</P>
<P>
   There, sea organisms were preserved in fine clays in the
Cambrian period, half a billion years ago, the time of the earliest
invertebrates.
</P>
<P>
   Details of their innards have remained as well, proving a boon
to the study of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting in Nature, scientists from England have tried to
determine how these features were preserved.
</P>
<P>
   To do so, they mapped the distribution of clay minerals in
several fossils, and found that the maps correspond closely to the
observed anatomical features.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in specimens of marrella splendens, a
thumbnail-sized creature perhaps related to modern crustaceans,
concentrations of potassium and aluminum are elevated in an area
that corresponds to the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers say this is evidence that the fossilization
occurred as clay minerals crystallized around the organism, with
different minerals precipitating on or binding to different tissues
depending on each tissue's chemical composition.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the clay minerals replicated the structure of the
living tissues.

RICHEY KICKS DOWN FIRST BARRIER, ANYWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ So what was it you wanted to know about the 49ers
again?
</P>
<P>
   I mean, you did have questions, right? A few things still
puzzling you as the old town team finishes yet another summer
vacation? Not sure that this is your Super Bowl champion a'borning?
</P>
<P>
   Well, here's something to tide you over until next Sunday,
anyway. They have a kicker. Maybe. We're not sure yet. With these
guys, we never are.
</P>
<P>
   The new pied du jour is an annoyingly thin, exceedingly
boyish-looking fellow named Wade Richey, who seems to have won the
job the way 49ers kickers usually do _ by being the only guy on
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not by default, actually. Richey celebrated his fourth day
as a 49er by making an actual impression in Friday's 21-20 loss to
Seattle. A 53-yard field goal. A 45-yard field goal. Five kickoffs
in the end zone. And finally, a 62-yard game-winning attempt that
fell short, but not so short that he wasn't congratulated by 49ers
and Seahawks alike.
</P>
<P>
   An impostor? A cruel hoax? A damned funny hoax? Nope. A 49ers
kicker who can actually be asked to kick a field goal from longer
than 30 yards, and can reach the end zone from his own 30. The
SciFi Channel has more believable stuff in its Godzilla-Meets-Rodan
library.
</P>
<P>
   But it's true. Wade Richey has leg, and he works in San
Francisco. Thus, unless the Falcons get drunk Sunday and cut Morten
Andersen, and then Andersen gets even drunker and decides he wants
to kick for the minimum salary, Richey is on his way.
</P>
<P>
   Well, kind of on his way. You can never tell with the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, let's not put him in the Hall of Fame yet,'' special
teams coach George Stewart said. ``You have to give a lot of credit
to the Seahawks' special teams coach (Pete Rodriguez, who had
Richey here until last week's cuts) for teaching him so much. He
still rushes a little bit, so we'll have to work on slowing him
down, but under the circumstances, he did very well. So we'll bring
him back to Santa Clara, and hope I don't screw him up.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, though, Stewart probably won't have enough time to
screw Richey up. The NFL waiver wire may emit a few intriguing
kickers Sunday afternoon, but Richey is already here, and even a
team as anti-kicker as the 49ers will tend to err on the side of
the guy whose moving expenses have already been paid. And the real
games start next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt great about tonight,'' Richey said, wearing the smile
he stole off Sally Field's face the night she won her second Oscar
for Best Actress. ``But I still have a lot of work to do. I wasn't
very good before the game kicking from the left hash mark, so I
think they strategically put me on the right hash. I have a natural
break with my ball, but I'm trying to straighten it out. It's just
not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he didn't quite get all of his 53-yarder, and got
under the 62-yarder. ``I'd love to have that one back again,'' he
said in all seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even as the last one died on the ``H'' in the end zone
``Seahawks,'' he was given warm and heartiest from players on both
sides. ``I got a high-five from Steve Young,'' he said with a smile
that seemed to say, ``And I know kickers don't get high-fived
around this place very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Richey will be the sixth 49ers place-kicker of the decade, which
entitles him to a Styrofoam plaque and a key chain inscribed by all
the members of Eddie DeBartolo's Louisiana grand jury. No other NFL
team has been so relentlessly dissatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   And all Richey had to do, really, was kick poorly enough with
the 'Hawks to get cut in time for the 49ers to pick him up, which
coincidentally was right about the time they had made up their
minds that John Becksvoort had too many consonants, or not enough
leg, or something. It's hard to know what they like in a kicker,
because the only staff person who has ever been seen with a 49ers
kicker (other than the punter, who has to hang around with the
kicker just to have someone to bitch to) is Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   And Stewart tempered his rave just enough to keep from being
disappointed again. In his three years in Happy Valley, he has had
Jeff Wilkins, and then Ryan Longwell, and then Jon Baker, and then
Gary Anderson, and then Becksvoort, and now Richey. He has learned
not to get attached to kickers any more than you would get attached
to a steeplejack.
</P>
<P>
   So when Stewart cautioned against calling Canton, he was doing
it partly out of history, partly out of caution, and partly to
quell his own enthusiasm. To his sure amazement, he saw Young
kicking his foot and calling to coach Steve Mariucci to let Richey
try the 53-yarder with 5:35 left in the game. No 49ers quarterback
has been so enthused about a kicker since Steve Spurrier in 1970 _
and he was the punter.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if Richey can't maintain this glorious pace once he
gets to Candlestick, he may end up on the bone yard with his
illustrious predecessors: Anderson and Wilkins and Tony Zendejas
and Doug Brien and Mike Cofer. The 49ers did not get to where they
are by showing patience with a guy who never needs his uniform
laundered.
</P>
<P>
   But for one otherwise meaningless night, they liked their
kicker. Sally Field would have been proud.

NOTHING BECOMES A MAN MORE THAN A WOMAN'S FACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By NATALIE ANGIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A timeless movie scene we wish we could forget: Leonardo
DiCaprio climbing to the bowsprit of the ``Titanic'' and crowing,
``I'm king of the world!''
</P>
<P>
   The latest word from scientists: He may have a point.
</P>
<P>
   Or, rather, a fetching bit of roundness. In a new study of
facial attractiveness, researchers from Scotland and Japan have
found that, much to their astonishment, people of both sexes prefer
feminine-looking men over rugged, manly miened men. When shown a
series of computerized photographs of young men whose images had
been manipulated to make them look either more masculine or more
feminine than the norm, viewers designated the artificially
feminized faces as somewhat more attractive than the average faces,
and more appealing by far than the masculinized versions. The
results held cross-culturally, whether the faces shown or the
people passing judgment were Japanese or Caucasian.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists had predicted that such traditional hallmarks of
male dominance and maturity as a big jaw, square face, prow nose,
and heavy brow would prove irresistible to women, who in theory are
ever on the lookout for their alpha mate, and impressive to men.
Instead, appraisers seemed drawn to a touch of girlishness _
slender nose, cupid's lips, lightened brow, adorable chin.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Leo rules! So, too, do the likes of Johnny Depp,
Matt Damon and Ralph Fiennes, and Paul McCartney when his top still
mopped, and his Monkee clone Davey Jones, and the young Elvis in
white and the young Brando in buff, who were both so pretty you
could swear they wore Maybelline. Far from putting a man at a
competitive disadvantage, it seems, femininity may be a source of
sexual and social strength.
</P>
<P>
   The results appeared in the August 27 issue of the journal
Nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team has been working on this study for four years,'' said
Ian Penton-Voak of the University of St. Andrews in Fife, Scotland.
``When it was found early on that there was a preference for
feminized male faces, nobody believed it, so we did it again, and
again. The preference for a feminized face keeps coming up.'' Most
recently, he adds, ``we've even replicated this work among
hunter-gatherer tribes in the Amazon.'' Penton-Voak, one of the
authors of the new report, is a graduate student working in the
laboratory of David Perrett.
</P>
<P>
   In the same study, the scientists also found that viewers
preferred ultra-feminized women's faces over either average female
faces or those that have been slightly masculinized. That result,
at least, was in keeping with their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The new report adds to a growing body of evidence that beauty
may not be restricted to the eyes of a beholder, and that a sense
of it may be more innate and less culturally fungible than we care
to believe. At the same time, the results underscore that the
meaning of beauty is still up for grabs and open to any number of
Kiplingesque Just-So interpretations. Perrett and his colleagues
suggest that women might choose feminine-looking men as their mates
because such men give the appearance of being sensitive, honest and
potentially reliable fathers, yet they admit that assumption to be
speculative at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite interesting that people like feminized male
faces,'' said Stefano Ghirlanda of the University of Stockholm in a
telephone interview. ``But the significance of the work is not
clear. We understand so little about what faces mean, or what the
information content of any particular feature may be.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   In the latest experiment, the researchers started with the
assumption that people would find most appealing those faces that
displayed ``sex-appropriate'' signs of ostensible genetic and
reproductive fitness, and that the more obvious the signs, the more
attractive the face should be. By this notion, an attractive female
face should look unmistakably female, which means it has been
shaped by sufficient stores of estrogen, the principal hormone of
female fertility. Estrogen is thought to help make the bottom half
of the face narrower than the top half, for example, and to make
the cheeks high and round. And because female fertility declines
sharply with age, female attractiveness has also been linked to
signs of youthfulness, including wide, bright eyes (the pupils of
the eyes shrink with age, the corneas get ever cloudier, and the
upper lids tend to droop), a small nose (being cartilage, the nose
continues to grow throughout life), and full lips (lips lose their
connective tissue and thin out over time).
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the male hormone testosterone is known to enlarge
the jaw and to thicken the brow and upper bridge of the nose. If a
woman is looking for a man who is clearly a man and who brims with
male hormones, she theoretically should be drawn to a face with a
comparatively square jaw and strong brow. In other species, the
traits and behaviors that males use to attract females, like the
capacity to grow a long, showy tail or to sing a complex melody,
are also under the control of testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, if a woman is looking for a mature man who
hypothetically has the resources to invest in her and offspring,
she should care little for youthfully full lips or wide eyes.
</P>
<P>
   To test the degree of masculinity or femininity preferred, the
researchers began by making computer composites. For each ethnic
group they studied, they took photographs of 20 men and 20 women in
their early 20s, digitized the images and defined 174 salient
features _ for example, nose-tip _ as ``facial landmarks.'' Those
features were then used to calculate a single image of an average
white man and average white woman, or average Japanese man and
average Japanese woman. The scientists defined ``masculinity'' and
``femininity'' as the measurable ways that the composite images of
the two sexes differed from one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seemed the best and most logical place to start,'' said
Penton-Voak.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 50 students and university staff members in Scotland
and a similar number in Japan served as judges. Sitting at a
computer console, the appraisers could manipulate the images with a
mouse, morphing the pictures in either a more masculine or feminine
direction. All the features would change simultaneously as the
mouse moved, which meant that the appraisers did not have the
option of sculpting features to their particular liking _ say, by
enlarging the jaw of the man while keeping his nose and brow
comparatively slender.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the judges preferred, on average, significantly
feminized female faces for both sexes. Female faces were rated as
most attractive when they were about 20 percent more feminized than
the female norm, while male faces were judged most appealing when
they were about 15 percent more feminine than the standard male
composite. Interestingly, when people were rating the faces of
their own ethnic group, they liked an even greater degree of
feminization of both male and female faces than when they were
ranking the faces of a different ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to associate certain characteristics with masculine
or feminine faces, appraisers said that masculinized male faces did
indeed look more dominant and mature than the average male face,
but they also gave the masculinized faces comparatively lower
scores in qualities like warmth, honesty, emotionality,
cooperativeness and parenting abilities. The feminized male faces
were given top ratings when it came to all the sensitive-guy
personality traits.
</P>
<P>
   For the female faces, masculinization also lent the women a look
of comparatively high dominance and low warmth and trustworthiness,
while the feminized faces ranked high in all aspects of sweetness
and light. When it came to picking out the aspect of a potentially
good mother, though, appraisers preferred the average female face
to that of a feminized face. This quirky result raises the question
of what, from an evolutionary perspective, a man is choosing if he
designates as highly attractive an ultra-feminized face that he
doesn't necessarily think belongs to a woman capable of rearing his
brood.
</P>
<P>
   As Ghirlanda and others point out, the results of the study
raise at least as many questions than they put to bed. Perrett and
his colleagues suggest that the preferences they have detected show
there is a limit to how sexually distinctive, or dimorphic, the
faces of men and women can be. In many species, competition between
males for the eye of females has resulted in profound sexual
dimorphism, the most famous example being the difference between
the ostentatious peacock and the drab peahen. By the Perrett
scenario, social skills like cooperativeness, honesty and
gentleness proved generically desirable in the early stages of
human evolution. Because such nurturing traits are associated with
femaleness and juvenileness, the appeal of the feminine, youthful
look became pansexual, and helped to counter such standard engines
of sexual dimorphism as competition between males.
</P>
<P>
   However, as some critics have observed, the Perrett study does
not account for at least one source of considerable aesthetic
dimorphism in humans _ facial hair. None of the men photographed
for the study had beards or moustaches. The role of facial hair in
human evolution, and why men have it while women do not, remains a
mystery. In theory, though, prehistoric men had neither the time
nor the wherewithal to shave, and so may have looked as distinct
from prehistoric women as antlered male elks do from bare-headed
does.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific study of beauty is rife with mysteries and
contradictions. A number of reports have demonstrated that a
composite face is usually deemed more attractive than any one
particular face _ that is, a consolidated image of 60 people is
voted more attractive than is the image of most of the individual
members. The classic evolutionary explanation for the triumph of
the norm is that an average-looking person conveys a comforting
familiarity, and is unlikely to harbor any unusual genetic
mutations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the exaggerated pretty face has been shown to be favored
over the average. If the faces of the 15 people rated as most
attractive of the original pool of 60 are merged into a composite
image, that averaged face outranks the first composite. And if the
features of the top-15 composite are then pushed to extremes, by
raising and emphasizing the cheekbones, for example, the image is
reckoned more beautiful still.
</P>
<P>
   What remains to be understood is why one sort of extreme signal,
like prominent cheekbones, should be considered alluring, while
other extreme features, like a big nose, should be rejected in
favor of a mainstream profile. If the norm is the most likely to be
genetically healthy, why be drawn to any sign of genetic deviance?
Extreme beauty is not necessarily a sign of superior reproductive
potential. For instance, there is a genetic condition called
androgen insensitivity syndrome, in which a fetus with male
chromosomes lacks the capacity to respond to the male hormones its
embryonic testes produce. As a result, the fetus' body develops as
female. Girls with the condition often grow into unusually
beautiful women, with long legs, clear skin, ample breasts and
thick hair; a number of famous models and actresses are thought to
have androgen insensitivity syndrome. Yet women with AIS lack
normal reproductive organs and are infertile. By a cold Darwinian
reckoning, their beauty is deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   And, hey, Leonardo DiCaprio may not be as sweet as he looks,
either, but do his lusting young fans really care?

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The world is awash with noise, an endless banging,
ringing, thumping and clanging that not only annoys but also
steals. The deafening din slowly takes away the hearing of many
and, in cases of enormous assault, can result in deafness within
days.
</P>
<P>
   Now, researchers say they are making progress against
noise-induced hearing loss and have begun testing treatments that
may be able to rescue hearing in ears damaged by unusually loud
noise.
</P>
<P>
   Military researchers say they have developed a technique that
may be able to restore health to delicate cells within the ear that
are often irreparably damaged or killed by excessive noise. It may
also be possible, they add, to develop drugs that can be taken in
advance to protect against damaging sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our early results are exciting and encouraging, but also very
preliminary,'' said Col. Richard D. Kopke, a physician with the
Army Medical Corps. ``Our work with animals is very promising, but
we've just begun human testing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kopke and colleagues at the Defense Department's Spatial
Orientation Center, a treatment and research facility for all the
services based at the Naval Medical Center in San Diego, have
devised a way to place miniature catheters deep into the ear and
dispense medicine in the exact place it is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Using this approach, tested extensively in guinea pigs and
chinchillas, Kopke's group treats delicate hair cells within the
ear, key components in sound detection, with antioxidant drugs to
counteract toxic compounds generated by injury.
</P>
<P>
   If treated in time, the researchers say, these sensitive cells _
which the body cannot replace _ can be saved before there is
permanent hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers have tested the therapy on three patients, with
apparent success in all of them. Within the next six months, they
hope to treat 50 more.
</P>
<P>
   The military is interested in treating hearing and other ear
problems that can affect balance and orientation, at least in part
because of the high price _ an estimated $1.5 billion a year in
compensation, retraining and equipment costs _ stemming from these
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Loud noises produced by artillery, gunfire, jet engines and
shipboard machinery all contribute to the noise-induced hearing
problems that affect more than 11 percent of members of the armed
services, according to the military.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jochen Schacht, a pioneer in the treatment of hearing loss,
who is at the Kresge Hearing Research Institute at the University
of Michigan in Ann Arbor, said the military researchers had a solid
scientific basis for their technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``The approach of using antioxidants is not new,'' Schacht said,
``but the combination of the technique and the antioxidants is
unique here. As far as I know, no one has tried local delivery of
antioxidants in humans. They could be the first.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Leonard P. Rybak of Southern Illinois University Medical
School in Springfield called the technique ``a good approach with a
rational basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Rybak, whose own research involves finding ways to keep the
widely used anti-cancer drug cisplatin from damaging patients'
hearing, said it had recently become apparent that many of the
things that injure the inner ear could have a common destructive
mechanism _ the production of toxic free radical oxygen compounds,
known as free radicals, which antioxidants are designed to
counteract.
</P>
<P>
   Free radicals are unstable, electrically charged molecules that
are highly reactive with other substances. Free radicals of oxygen,
formed briefly in most natural chemical reactions with oxygen, set
up chain reactions in the body as they interact with other
molecules, and that process can damage cells and even the genetic
material they contain.
</P>
<P>
   Research now shows that drugs that can damage the inner ear _
including cisplatin and the aminoglycoside family of antibiotics
like streptomycin and gentamicin _ do so, at least in large part,
by causing the production of harmful free radicals. And the
pressure and vibrations generated by loud noise can damage cells in
the ear, causing them to generate free radicals that cause further
injury and cell death, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Kopke's work, which is supported by the Office of Naval
Research, involved threading a tiny catheter through the outer ear,
under the ear drum and up to the membrane at the end of the
cochlea, a fluid-filled, snail-shaped structure in the inner ear
that contains thousands of hair-like cells. The pressure of sound
waves on the cochlea membrane sends vibrations through the fluid,
moving the hairs and sending signals that eventually travel through
nerves to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription antioxidants then are delivered through the
catheter, allowing the hair cells to receive an effective dosage,
the researchers said. If the drugs were given orally or through
injection, the rest of the body would have to endure large doses of
the drugs for a sufficient level to reach the ear. And many of
these drugs have damaging side effects in large doses, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The catheter can be left in place so that doctors can administer
medicine every two or three days for two weeks, or the catheter can
be hooked to a small automatic pump, attached to the patient, that
can dispense a daily infusion of the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Cmdr. Michael Hoffer, a Navy doctor who works with Kopke,
applies a different twist to the catheter technology to treat a
condition called Meniere's disease, an inner ear abnormality whose
symptoms include vertigo or severe dizziness and ringing in the
ears. He puts toxic antibiotics into another part of the ear to
destroy a different type of hair cell involved in Meniere's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative to traditional surgery, Hoffer and colleagues
are using the new system to selectively kill cells that produce
excess liquid in the ear that contributes to symptoms of Meniere's
disease, as well as certain balance cells that send signals to the
brain. In tests on 18 patients, the researchers said they were able
to reduce symptoms in most of the patients without invasive
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health estimates that up to 5 million
Americans suffer from varying degrees of Meniere's disease. In
addition, 30 million people have some degree of hearing loss, about
one-third of whom have been affected by noise. Noise-induced
hearing loss can result from a one-time exposure to an extremely
loud sound, as well as repeated exposure to high levels of sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Kopke said he had tested a number of prescription antioxidant
drugs approved for other uses to treat hearing loss, including some
that scavenge up free radicals and others that cause the body to
produce more of certain enzymes that are natural antioxidants. Some
of these drugs can also remove some of the body's excess iron,
which can encourage the production of free radicals.
</P>
<P>
   A primary goal of the research is to develop oral medicines,
probably new types of antioxidants, that can be taken either before
or after hearing dangerously loud noises.
</P>
<P>
   Kopke acknowledged the possibility of abuse if scientists
developed a drug that protected against hearing loss caused by
noise. ``This is not meant to be a substitute for common sense or
using mechanical hearing protection when needed,'' he said. ``I
don't want people to say `I'll just pop a few pills and turn my
amplifier up.'''

<P>
   ``Genealogies of a Crime'' is a spooky French film by
writer-director Raoul Ruiz (``Three Lives and Only One Death'').
The subject is the ridiculousness of a certain brand of French
intellectuality and Ruiz and co-writer Pascal Bonitzer skewer it
with gusto.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Genealogies'' inadvertently is about the flaccidity of
modern film. With French film ever placing itself in the vanguard
of self-analysis, the movie is one of those overly self-conscious
treatises on the meaning of life, truth and other verities. It
bends awkwardly under the weight of its pretentious content.

   Catherine Deneuve, who seems to grow colder and more vacant as
her ageless face defies time, plays two roles. First, she is
Solange, a criminal attorney famed for taking on impossible cases
and losing them.
</P>
<P>
   She agrees to defend Rene (Melvil Poupaud), a young man raised
by his rather cold-hearted psychiatrist aunt Jeanne (also Deneuve)
from childhood and treated by her as a laboratory specimen for
observation. Referred to as ``the monster'' from his earliest
years, Rene proves his dastardliness one day by killing said aunt.
</P>
<P>
   Like the lawyer in ``Jagged Edge,'' Solange is taken for a ride
by her client, but Rene is aided in his ruse by the members of a
controversial psychiatric society that is being investigated for
fraud and that is headed by a certifiable loony named Georges (the
incomparable Michel Piccoli).
</P>
<P>
   As flashback overshadows flashback, and as Solange reprises the
victim role once played by Jeanne, the circumstances of the murder
become fuzzier. There is Rene's version, and the version of the
only witness, who happens to be the barking mad Georges. Solange,
confused, remains dutiful about her responsibility to her client.
</P>
<P>
   The movie starts to seem pretty darn barking itself when Solange
falls in love with the vile Rene. You can imagine the mess this
creates.
</P>
<P>
   The nuttiness of psychiatrists becomes a running gag in this
otherwise humorless movie, thus members of the besieged
professional society are portrayed as powerless cultists. And
sometimes it seems as if the actors are treating the material as if
it were ``Alice in Wonderland,'' keeping straight faces while
uttering complete nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   I guess Francophiles may find it all irresistible. Moi, non.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Dr. Michael DeBakey moved like a dancer in a pas de
deux, anticipating his surgical partner's every move during a
quadruple bypass operation on a woman at the Methodist Hospital
here recently. As DeBakey deftly manipulated scalpels, scissors and
forceps for more than three hours, his hands never quivered. What
made it an extraordinary operation is that DeBakey, the pioneering
heart surgeon, turns 90 on Sept. 7. With bushy eyebrows, long dark
hair that is combed back on a balding scalp, and a tinge of gray on
his sideburns, DeBakey looks 20 years younger. Though he takes
fewer surgical cases these days, he maintains a whirlwind schedule
of travel and consulting. He is celebrating his 50th year at Baylor
College of Medicine, and only a disability will make him retire,
DeBakey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You haven't changed a bit,'' friends told DeBakey at a golden
wedding anniversary party for another couple here the same night he
performed the operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't you nice to say that,'' a smiling DeBakey replied. ``I
have been blessed so far.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent check-up found DeBakey in the physical shape of a man
much younger, with normal heart function, cholesterol and other
blood tests, he said. He has been a hospital patient twice. Once
was for surgery for a near-fatal bleeding ulcer in 1984. The other
was for smoke inhalation suffered in rescuing his infant daughter,
Olga, after a Christmas tree caught fire in his home in 1978. ``I
just barely made it out,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As a child growing up in Lake Charles, La., the usual fare was
fish and fresh vegetables from the family garden. Now, he says, he
consumes whatever he wants but is a light eater and often skips
lunch because of work. He said he has never deliberately exercised,
takes no vacations and last visited his 1,000-acre ranch in the
nearby Texas hill country two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Trim at 160 pounds and 5 feet 11 inches, DeBakey can fit into
his Army uniform from World War II. In those years, he helped
develop the mobile military army surgical hospitals, now popularly
known as MASH units, and systematic follow-up of veterans with
certain medical conditions in the Veterans Administration medical
system.
</P>
<P>
   As a civilian, DeBakey went on to pioneer many heart and blood
vessel operations, perform at least 65,000 operations, teach and
build Baylor College of Medicine into a top-flight institution,
serving 10 years as its president (from 1969-79) and then 17 years
as its chancellor (from 1979-96).
</P>
<P>
   Though now so firmly rooted in Texas that he wears gleaming
white cowboy-style boots in the hospital, DeBakey has stamped out a
glamorous career as an international medical statesman. He
experienced a taste for life abroad while doing surgical training
in Europe in 1935 and 1936, and he speaks Arabic, French and
German.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, DeBakey will visit Aspen, Col.; Brussels,
Belgium; Istanbul, Turkey; Stockholm, Sweden; New York, and
Washington in 12 days.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the United States, DeBakey is probably best known in
Russia, which he has visited at least 30 times to perform
operations and to work on cooperative health programs.
</P>
<P>
   It was 88-year-old DeBakey, not a younger American surgeon, whom
President Boris Yeltsin's doctors summoned to Moscow for
consultation for Yeltsin's quintuple bypass operation in 1996. In a
foreword to the Russian edition of DeBakey's 1997 book ``The New
Living Heart,'' written with Antonio Gotto (Adams), Yeltsin
described DeBakey as ``a magician of the heart'' and ``a man with a
gift for performing miracles.''
</P>
<P>
   Around Baylor, DeBakey's inexhaustible energy has led to the
nickname ``The Texas Tornado,'' and his demanding standards have
intimidated many of his staff members. When young doctors failed to
meet his expectations, DeBakey said, he would rebuke them: ``You
have four fingers and a thumb like I do. Why can't you use them the
way I do?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George Noon, a former student and trainee with whom DeBakey
has worked for 30 years, said that over the years ``there were many
DeBakeys _ the chancellor, chairman of the department of surgery,
the teacher, the national and international leader.'' He often held
the positions simultaneously. ``He was good at getting everything
organized, but delays and disruptions made him mad,'' Noon said.
``Now his schedule is not as demanding, and he is less
high-strung.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his reputed temper, DeBakey said in his Louisiana
drawl, ``Maybe I should be more compassionate with people who do
not think as fast as I can.'' But he added, ``I have little
tolerance for incompetence, sloppy thinking and laziness.''
</P>
<P>
   A lengthy visit in late August attests that DeBakey still hates
to waste a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before performing the bypass operation, DeBakey went
straight to the office upon returning from a long weekend trip to
Azerbaijan, where he advised President Heydar Aliyev on the
creation of a new 100-bed heart center.
</P>
<P>
   DeBakey lives a five-minute ride from the hospital in the same
house he lived in 50 years ago. The day he performed the operation,
DeBakey awoke at 5 a.m., had fruit juice and yogurt for breakfast,
read a newspaper and worked on a paper analyzing long-term findings
on thousands of operations he had performed. Before 8 a.m., he left
for the hospital, where he made a videotape promoting an
experimental device his team is developing to assist failing
hearts, before going to the operating room.
</P>
<P>
   DeBakey heads the search committee for a top position at the
Baylor-affiliated Veterans Administration Hospital, and after
returning from the operating room, he interviewed a candidate.
Later, he reviewed the special heart X-rays known as angiograms of
three patients and advised them on the need for surgery. He also
answered a number of calls. DeBakey left the hospital about 6:30
p.m., as he does on most days.
</P>
<P>
   On this evening, his family was away. His second wife, Katrin,
an actress and artist he met as a widower at a party at Frank
Sinatra's home, was visiting in her native Germany. Olga, their
daughter, is spending her junior year in college studying in
Lebanon. (He has four sons from his first marriage; none are
doctors.) DeBakey spent nearly three hours at the anniversary
party, drove home in his Toyota Land Cruiser, and went to bed about
11.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   On other days, DeBakey worked on additional projects chiefly
related to heart disease, which is the leading cause of death in
developed countries. He talked about women and heart disease at a
luncheon sponsored by the American Heart Association; advised
doctors on plans to develop new cardio-vascular centers in China,
Lebanon, Turkey and Russia; worked on arrangements for the first
implantations of the heart-assist device in patients in Germany,
Sweden and Switzerland, and consulted through the Internet with
colleagues in foreign countries on complicated cases.
</P>
<P>
   His path to medical celebrity was set, indirectly, by his
father, who left Lebanon to escape religious persecution and
settled in Lake Charles, in the French-speaking Cajun country. His
father owned rice farms, real estate and drug stores, which became
a hangout for doctors. ``I became enamored of them,'' DeBakey said.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1930s, DeBakey and his mentor at Tulane University,
Alton Ochsner, both non-smokers, became two of the first scientists
to link the early rise in lung cancer to cigarette smoking. At the
time, other medical leaders attributed the cancer increase to the
aftereffects of the 1918 influenza epidemic, inhalation of
poisonous gases in World War I and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   DeBakey's mother taught him to sew. In the early 1950s, he drew
on that know-how to make grafts from Dacron and use them to repair
aneurysms, or balloonings, in all parts of the aorta. Such grafts
are now part of standard treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really opened that field,'' DeBakey said.
</P>
<P>
   Peers acknowledge DeBakey's many talents, as well as his ample
pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, he has a pretty big ego,'' said Claude Lenfant,
the head of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, a federal
agency in Bethesda, Md. But, Lenfant added, ``his contributions
have been enormous, and he will leave an amazing legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other famous surgeons, ``Dr. DeBakey has exported
his know-how to the world,'' said Lenfant, who first met DeBakey
when he demonstrated open-heart operations as a visiting professor
at his medical school in France in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   DeBakey has a knack for telling a good story and an appetite for
publicity. A framed copy of DeBakey on the cover of Time magazine
on May 28, 1965, is among hundreds of mementos that adorn the walls
of his office.
</P>
<P>
   When he first arrived in Houston, his ever-rising profile used
to get DeBakey in hot water with the doctors in the local medical
society. ``They did everything to denounce me because I was a
threat to them,'' DeBakey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I've done has been resisted,'' DeBakey said, citing
such problems as revising the standard of surgical training in
Houston; overcoming the resistance of doctors and nurses in
starting the first intensive care units at Baylor, and admitting
black patients to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, he is treated with the deference of a living
legend. Around Houston, DeBakey is recognized instantly. At the
hospital, employees ask if they can have their picture taken with
him, and he complies. Even during the quadruple bypass, a young
surgeon stationed himself behind DeBakey so he would be included in
a photograph of the master performing the heart operation.
</P>
<P>
   After the operation, DeBakey took the elevator and inserted a
key that allowed it to climb nonstop from the third-floor operating
room to his ninth-floor office. The key was a compromise; a
benefactor wanted to build a private elevator for DeBakey, who
rejected the idea and settled for the key.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor has no age limit on those performing surgery there,
DeBakey said. He said he does fewer operations now ``because the
surgeon in charge of the operation has responsibility for the
post-operative care, and I have been away more than I have been
here recently.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Operations tie you down,'' DeBakey said. So he refers many
patients needing surgery to Noon.
</P>
<P>
   DeBakey freely talks about the rich and famous patients he has
treated. Sometimes it is to instruct, as in his American Heart
Association talk to women when he described the operation he
performed on Marlene Dietrich, the actress, to relieve blockage of
arteries in her legs.
</P>
<P>
   He also sprinkles his conversations with stories about meeting
Queen Elizabeth, about royalty from Belgium, and about the
generosity of patients whom he proudly said he recruited as donors.
His own name is affixed to buildings and medical wings at Baylor
and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   DeBakey said he told wealthy patients like Stavros Niarchos and
Aristotle Onassis, who asked about his fees, that he would not send
them a bill. Instead, brought up his foundation: ``I said I would
like for you to consider making a contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation now contributes $2 million a year to Baylor's
research program, DeBakey said.
</P>
<P>
   DeBakey's persuasiveness has shown up on the political front as
well. After World War II, he played a major role in replacing a
decrepit library in Washington run by the Army with the National
Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health, which is
in Bethesda, Md. It is now the world's premier medical library.
</P>
<P>
   DeBakey thought the library should be near government
researchers on the Bethesda campus, but at first, published
accounts relate, James Shannon, the NIH director, did not agree.
DeBakey convinced him otherwise by asking Shannon how he started
his pioneering kidney research at New York University. By reading
in the library, Shannon replied.
</P>
<P>
   But The American Medical Association wanted the library built
next to its headquarters in Chicago, and with little interest in
the issue, Sam Rayburn of Texas, then the House speaker, held up
the bill backing the Bethesda site, which was sponsored by Sen.
Lister Hill of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   DeBakey, though, had once operated on the husband of the
secretary of the national Democratic Party, Dorothy Vredenberg, and
he asked her for help. The next day she told DeBakey that Rayburn
would let the bill through.
</P>
<P>
   High on DeBakey's list of accomplishments is a Houston high
school he help start 25 years ago for students, mostly minorities,
seeking careers in the health care field. The school is now named
for DeBakey.
</P>
<P>
   Another source of pride is the 1,000 American and foreign
surgeons he has trained. Many of those surgeons are working in top
positions, including Renat Akchurin, who performed the quintuple
bypass on Yeltsin. Yet, DeBakey said: ``I'm shocked to hear some
are retired. Where did the time go?''

FIRM FINDS NEW WAY TO USE NET 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   UNDATED - As the Internet has gone mainstream, tales of how
people are putting it to use are getting more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Take what happened at New Vision International, a $200 million
Tempe, Ariz., company that distributes nutritional supplements
around the world via a network of 700,000 salesmen.
</P>
<P>
   It was the week of Aug. 9, and all was looking good. The company
was humming along. Plans were being finalized for a
company-sponsored convention in Las Vegas. About 3,000 distributors
and others were expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mother Nature took over. A monsoon storm dumped so much
rain on Tempe one night that the roof of the company's
50,000-square-foot warehouse and headquarters building collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Stock was damaged, and the company's computer system _ the heart
of its communications with its distributors _ went down with the
roof.
</P>
<P>
   Employees worked all night to bring order back to the sudden
chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Brothers Jason and BK Boreyko, who co-own New Vision,
immediately expanded their World Wide Web site, describing the
damage and cleanup efforts and reassuring distributors that orders
would be filled _ albeit a bit late.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site at www.new-vision-intl.com and at www.nviworld.com
also provided important last-minute details to the thousands of
people headed to the Las Vegas convention, which was held in late
August.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, New Vision went far beyond that important
content, adding interesting first-person accounts of what happened
as the storm hit. For example:
</P>
<P>
   New Vision employee Mike Tucker: ``I was sitting in my office,
just across from the computer room, and the ceiling began to shake.
I remember we had just installed a new air-conditioner above the
computer room and thought it might be off balance. Thinking nothing
of it, I walked around and sat back down again. My eyes widened
when the walls began to shake.''
</P>
<P>
   Company spokeswoman Myra Richman said, ``They would definitely
be out of business if it wasn't for their ability to update
everybody via the computer and the Internet.'' &QL; 
(at)j  &QL; 
Doggone it, that's funny
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our recent contest that invited readers to write in with their
examples of how things would have gone if God had used a PC for
creation has prompted several people to send in related humor.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one reader sent in a list of 20 reasons why dogs
don't use computers.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few of the funnier (and cleaner) examples:
</P>
<P>
   _ They can't stick their heads out of Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's hard to read the monitor with their heads cocked to one
side.
</P>
<P>
   _It's too difficult to ``mark'' every Web site they visit.
</P>
<P>
   _Involuntary tail wagging a dead giveaway when they visit porn
sites.
</P>
<P>
   _Three words: Carpal Paw Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   _Can't help attacking the screen when they hear ``You've got
mail!'' &QL;

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: COVERING THE CLINTON STORY, OH SO
APOLOGETICALLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Add yet another count to the accumulation of misdemeanors being
assembled against President Clinton: He has incited a flurry of
moralizing by television journalists, who have enrolled themselves
among the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there is whining from reporters that they have been
compelled to devote themselves to Monica Lewinsky when they are
longing to cover Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to find one of these arbiters of appropriate behavior
who is satisfied with the president's unapologetic public apology,
but no trouble at all finding prescriptions for what he should have
said and done and should be doing.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus is that the president has failed the contrition
test. Bill Kristol of ABC, a predictable critic (he said that his
former boss Dan Quayle would never have behaved so dishonorably),
summed up the prevailing spirit with a call for a ``bending of the
knee.'' The presidential knee would have had to be bent in defiance
of anatomical possibilities to satisfy Kristol, who sees Clinton as
``fundamentally corrupting,'' or to receive absolution from William
Bennett, proprietor of public morals, who on ``Meet the Press''
called the president a ``serial liar,'' a ``serial adulterer'' and
a ``felon.'' (He had to take back ``felon.'') But everybody has a
favorite apology that Clinton has neglected to make. The president
himself has drawn public attention to the virtues of forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the criticisms heard on ``Larry King Live'' and
other exhorters of Presidential penitence:
</P>
<P>
   _ The president should have apologized to his wife and to
Chelsea, whose ratings seem to be rising, perhaps as a consequence
of this neglect.
</P>
<P>
   _ He should have apologized to the Cabinet members,
congressional supporters and White House functionaries who were
thrown before the cameras week after week to say they had no
suspicion of events that most of the nation took for granted.
</P>
<P>
   _ He should have apologized to Kenneth Starr for tempting the
special prosecutor's peeping-Tom propensities.
</P>
<P>
   _ He should have apologized to parents who found themselves
embarrassed by what their children were learning on news programs
that do not carry warnings about content.
</P>
<P>
   _ He should have apologized to Ms. Lewinsky for giving her a
romantic impression of their relationship and, as long as he was at
it, to all other White House interns and their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   _ He should have apologized to the Oval Office for irreverent
use of federal property during working hours.
</P>
<P>
   _ And he should have apologized more feelingly to ``the American
people,'' a phrase that easily wins the Nexis award for the most
frequently resorted-to safe haven for television pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it turns out that journalists, too, lay claim to a
share in the groveling stakes. Tim Russert, who presides over
``Meet the Press'' in a tough-minded, often rewarding way, also
works for MSNBC, his network's cable entry in Monicamania. Here, on
a channel distinguished by nonstop cablegabble, he announced, ``No
one has relished covering this squalid story.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, if only Clinton had taken into account what his
``inappropriate'' behavior was forcing the television community to
do, he might have had second thoughts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Russert's report or confession is as hard to swallow as, say,
the president's understanding of what constitutes a sexual
relationship. It's like believing in the reformation of Geraldo
Rivera. But let's try to take it seriously.
</P>
<P>
   What Russert must mean is that the whole company of cable news
eminences are in thrall to ratings; that their consciences ache as
they keep spewing scraps of information, bits of gossip, gobs of
speculation and free-floating opinions; that they are mortified at
the memory of the ideals that may have drawn them into reporting
and are pained by the recognition that significant events are being
thinly addressed while hours and weeks and months are lavished,
especially on MSNBC, on what Russert has called a ``squalid
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I can believe much of it. Journalists, like other wage
earners, do what they have to do; that applies even to the network
stars who set the standards for television. This is commerce, after
all. In particular, those who draw their livelihoods from cable
operations cannot afford much independence of market forces. In
tight competition for ratings and in the gaps between mourning for
Diana, Princess of Wales, a tale of presidential sex is their
channels' chance at drawing a sizable audience, all those people
who declare themselves to be sick of the story yet cannot get
enough of it.
</P>
<P>
   So all sympathy to Russert and colleagues. And now we know whom
to blame if many reporters are not proud of their puerile
assignments yet will continue to carry them out. That must be
Clinton's fault.

AMERICAN MODERNIST MOVEMENT REDISCOVERED AT CALIFORNIA EXHIBIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Detroit Institute of Arts is CQ in 8thgraf; contains optional

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID BONETTI

<TEXT>
<P>
   MORAGA, Calif. _ One of the most fascinating episodes in
American art occurred during the first decades of the century when
many artists grew dissatisfied with the ossified styles that were
being taught in the art academies and looked for new ways to make
art.
</P>
<P>
   Far from Europe, where radical new aesthetic ideas were being
hatched with shocking regularity, they fell back on their own
resources, looking eagerly at the few works of European modernism
that came their way and poring over the small black-and-white
reproductions that appeared in newspapers and art journals. But for
the most part, they had to make it up for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the nascent American avant-garde centered in New
York City has been often told, and the ultimate success of the New
York School after World War II retroactively turned artists like
Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley and Arthur Dove into heroic
precursors. But the artists existed all over the United States, and
many of them, especially those who worked in the West, have still
not received the attention their pioneering work deserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``C.S. Price: Landscape, Image and Spirit,'' at the Hearst Art
Gallery of St. Mary's College through Sept. 27, attempts to bring
critical attention back to at least one West Coast modernist.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton Price (1874-1950) lived a uniquely Western life. Brought
up on a ranch in Wyoming, as a young man he hired himself out as a
cowhand, working cattle drives across the plains. He showed
drawings of animals and other aspects of life on the range in
saloons, and when he was 32 a local rancher sent him to St. Louis
to study art.
</P>
<P>
   In 1915, Price went to San Francisco. He attended the
Panama-Pacific International Exposition, where, among 11,000 works
of art on display, he saw paintings by Cezanne, Gauguin, van Gogh
and Munch that confirmed his own inchoate attitude toward painting.
He also met Gottardo Piazzoni, the dean of the San Francisco art
community, who encouraged his explorations into a painting that
could convey both how things felt and looked.
</P>
<P>
   Piazzoni encouraged Price to move to California coastal
community of Monterey where an active art scene flourished. While
there he roomed with Augustus Gay, one of the Oakland-based Society
of Six painters who were also transformed by their experience of
European modernism at the Panama-Pacific Exposition.
</P>
<P>
   In 1929, Price moved to Portland, Ore., and in his old age, he
received national attention. In 1946, he was included in an
important exhibition of new American art at the Museum of Modern
Art in New York that also included work by Robert Motherwell,
Arshile Gorky and Mark Tobey, and he also showed in two prominent
New York galleries. The Metropolitan Museum, the Brooklyn Museum
and the Detroit Institute of Arts, as well as museums in Portland
and Seattle, purchased his work.
</P>
<P>
   Then he died and his work fell back into obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Mary's retrospective, which will travel to Eugene, Ore.,
and Monterey, suggests that rediscovery is merited.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition opens with ``Wolves,'' a 1944 work that shows
Price's mature style at its best. When I first walked into the
gallery, the 26-by-30 inch painting looked abstract. Then, I became
discomforted by two pairs of eyes staring out at me. Gradually, the
rough forms of two wolves came into focus.
</P>
<P>
   The oil paint, primarily dark with a few dramatic light
contrasts, was crudely spread on with a palette knife. The paint
surface was further scored by stabs of paint, and squiggles were
cut into the palette knife's broad marks with sharp instruments.
Using a repertory of mark-making techniques utterly lacking in
finesse, Price successfully captured a sense of the primordial, the
elemental, that was a common goal among advanced artists of the
era.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are very different, Price's ``Wolves'' shares a
world view (and subject) with Jackson Pollock's contemporaneous
``The She-Wolf.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, which includes 33 paintings and two etchings, is
divided into three categories by subject: landscape, boats and
animals.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The landscape section includes some of Price's earliest mature
works, painted during his decade in Monterey. Two of the most
impressive are ``Coastline'' (circa 1924) and ``Monterey
Landscape'' (circa 1925), which are built up from bold color blocks
derived from post-Impressionism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coastline,'' particularly, captures the feeling of being on
the verge between two states of being that was also a subject in
the work of Hartley, Price's almost exact contemporary. Both men
knew what it was to live alone, and both men knew the power and the
terror of nature made manifest at the ocean's edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coastline'' is a handsome picture that Price could have turned
into a formula for a successful career, which was never his
motivation. Instead, he moved on to greater abstraction and more
direct expression of his feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Price's paintings featuring animals gave him the liberty to
explore life at its most elemental. As you would expect of someone
who spent the first 30 years of his life on a ranch, Price has
particularly insightful things to say in paint about horses.
</P>
<P>
   A little picture like ``Waterhole at Night'' (circa 1935) is
made of only a few daubs of paint scraped across a board, but it
plumbs Price's depth of feeling about the mysterious world of
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Also Hartleyesque is ``Fisherman'' (circa 1941), which shows a
solitary fisherman standing in a boat, his net spread out upon the
waters. Although Price's spiritual impulses seemed to be
uncontained by any religious dogma, the Christian symbolism here is
unavoidable.
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Hearst Gallery also is showing ``Small Wonders: The Etchings
of August Gay.'' Price's Monterey pal is best known as an original,
fauve colorist, but he also made a number of etchings in the late
'20s that were largely forgotten until fairly recently.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was an earlier show at St. Mary's that brought Gay's
printmaking to light. After an artist's retrospective, things tend
to come out of the woodwork, and a box of Gay's copper etching
plates, many of which had never been printed, was discovered at
that time. With permission of the estate, David Kelso made prints
from the plates, and the current show is the result.
</P>
<P>
   Gay's prints might not win prizes, but they are interesting
enough. His subjects are predictable: scenes of old Monterey,
houses from the Mexican era, boats in the harbor, fisherman's
shacks, cannery row _ but they hold a picturesque and nostalgic
appeal.

   Recently on a family trip to North Carolina, our 4{-year-old
son, Doron, was acting difficult. His justification was that he
missed Brooklyn, where we live. He proceeded to list all the things
he loved about the borough, including his friends and his favorite
activities. Out of frustration that we might never be able to take
a vacation again, we asked him if there might be some other place
he would be willing to travel to. He paused for a moment and then
replied, ``Manhattan.''

   There were only two passengers aboard a Madison Avenue bus late
one evening and Judy Bucey was startled out of her reverie by the
ringing of the other passenger's cell phone. The surprise turned to
amusement when the driver called out, ``If that's my wife, tell her
I'm not here.''
</P>
<P>
   On another Madison Avenue bus, two women in their upper middle
years were discussing the sweltering weather. Monica Sands
overheard the following exchange:
</P>
<P>
   First Woman: ``It's so hot today, I think I'll call off my
appointment with my acupuncturist.''
</P>
<P>
   Second Woman: ``Why do that? It might cool you off. With all
those needles poking little holes in you, you'll be well
ventilated.''

<P>
   Emery Davis, an orchestra leader who describes himself as
aggressive, recently had an unusual experience _ brought on by
himself.
</P>
<P>
   He was in a taxi on 57th Street, headed to Madison Square
Garden. ``Get on to Ninth Avenue, to 31st Street and then around to
the Garden,'' he instructed the driver. An old-time cabby, the
driver not only ignored him but also remained where he was, in the
slower of two lanes. Davis suggested that they might move a little
faster in the other lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think you can do it better?'' the driver said in a
challenging tone. ``Yes,'' Davis said. The driver pulled over to
the curb. ``OK, you drive,'' he said. The two traded places and
Davis, using every ounce of his aggression, whizzed along his
preferred route. When they got to the Garden, Davis was so pleased
with himself, he added a generous tip. His reward: ``Not bad,'' the
driver said.

   Bothered by the litter of expired Metrocards at bus stops and

   Basil C. Levine wasn't the only one amused by the comment of his
8-year-old granddaughter, Carling, as she inspected an abstract
sculpture at a Manhattan art gallery. The sculpture, titled ``The
Dog,'' consisted of rectangular metal bars connected with wire.
Carling's reaction: ``If that's a dog, he's got a lot of
problems.''

   Though a senior citizen, I still adhere to the rules of behavior
instilled in me as a child.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, while seated in a subway car that had no
vacant seats, an elderly man, leaning on a cane, accompanied by a
young woman in her teens, entered the car and happened to stand in
front of me. I immediately jumped up and offered him my seat. He
thanked me and, apparently a gentleman of the old school of
manners, proceeded to offer my seat to the young woman who,
smilingly, accepted it. Talk of chutzpah!
</P>
<P>
   Standing over her and glowering, I said, ``Miss, I gave up my
seat for this gentleman, not for you. As you appear to be a few
years younger than both of us, and if this man does not want the
seat, please return it to me, its rightful owner.'' She started to
say something, thought better of it and gave back the seat. I was
pleased to note a number of looks of approval.

   A Manhattan doctor who, for obvious reasons, doesn't want his
name used, was standing near the door, about to get off the train
to the Hamptons when a man, also about to depart, joined him.
</P>
<P>
   The man look at the doctor and said ``Lovely tie. Hermes?''
``Yes,'' said the doctor. The man went on to further judgment.
``Gift,'' he said, with not even a question in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   How did he come to this conclusion? ``The rest of you is a
slob,'' he said, sotto voce. The train stopped, and the two got off
without a further word.

   Gladys M. Distler was taking in the exhibition of Chaim Soutine
paintings at the Jewish Museum _ thickly painted canvases with bold
colors and distorted figures. Two other women were nearby, and as
she was leaving, she heard one say to the other, ``He's a good
painter _ but not for my living room.''
</P>
<P>
   I was in a packed matinee of ``Madeline'' with my 5{-year-old
niece and her father, across the aisle from a very noisy 4- or
5-year-old. A woman behind us finally blurted out, ``Can't you at
least try to control your child?'' The child's mother turned and
said, ``It's a children's movie _ that's what children do.''
</P>
<P>
   The other woman replied, ``But there are other children here who
are quiet and we can't hear because of yours.''
</P>
<P>
   The testy exchange continued until finally the mother of the
noisy child said, ``Would you like to step outside and settle
this?'' It took three nearby men to calm the situation.
</P>
<P>
   I love R-rated action movies, where bad guys are shot and
buildings get blown up. But it was only at ``Madeline,'' a G-rated
movie for children, that I got to see real New York City mean
street action.

   Dr. Samuel I. Joseph was at the delicatessen counter of a market

   Edward G. O'Hara had to double-park when he recently took his
95-year-old father and 94-year-old mother to the doctor in
Brooklyn. As they were en route to the examination room, both
parents using canes, they passed through the waiting room where a
dozen elderly patients were silently waiting to be called.
</P>
<P>
   When his parents were finished and the three were leaving, again
via the waiting room, O'Hara stopped and with one parent clinging
to each arm, said in a loud voice, ``Which one of you is going to
drive home?'' The men and women in the waiting room broke up
laughing, and began talking to one another. O'Hara was pleased, and
his pleasure lasted until he got outside. His car had a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   It was very hot. I was the only customer at my favorite small
consignment shop, looking for a summer dress.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a woman burst through the door. Out of breath, she
panted her way to a saleswoman. She was desperate. ``I need white
pants,'' she breathed. In a matter of minutes, the saleswoman
pulled out a few pairs of white pants in different styles. She held
up the first pair _ white linen bell-bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   The desperate customer took one look. ``Oh no, not in a million
years,'' she said. ``Maybe not even then.''

   NEW YORK _ ``Brazilfest '98,'' a condensed program at the
Damrosch Park Band Shell on Sunday night, was pure Rio suavity,
most of it borne on the broad shoulders of Antonio Carlos Jobim,
with replications of original arrangements of his songs. The singer
Bebel Gilberto, daughter of Joao Gilberto, performed, as well as
the young singers Patricia Marx and Carol Saboya and the
light-classical chamber music group Quinteto D'Elas.
</P>
<P>
   But the deepest note was struck by the headlining act, Leila
Pinheiro, a popular Brazilian singer in her late 30s who is barely
known to New York audiences. A long-running candidate in her
country for the bossa nova princess of her generation, she radiates
sophistication. As she sang, accompanying herself at the piano for
half the set, her stage manner was self-possessed.
</P>
<P>
   She, too, sang some Jobim songs, including ``Corcovado'' and
``Garota de Ipanema.'' But when she sang a song from her recent
album, with music by Guinga (the composer Carlos Althier) and words
by the poet Aldir Blanc, the mood changed. Their collaborations on
the album result in intellectual urban songs about identity, chatty
and delicate. Ms. Pinheiro gets the best of them, with a quick,
understated delivery. The one she sang, ``Catavento e Girassol''
(``Windmill and Sunflower''), is about irreconcilable differences
in a relationship between adults who have settled into emotional
trenches with the man acting and the woman reacting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a withdrawn manner, and you're expansive,'' she sang in
one lyric. ``I side with Mia Farrow, you with Woody Allen.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a sad song but hyperarticulate about who the speaker is and
how she thinks. She carried it off, with just the right mixture of
introverted fatalism and expressive fizz.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too quickly, it was away from her new repertory and back
into Jobim land, with a double encore of ``Aguas de Marco,''
performed by everyone on the bill.

   Recently on a family trip to North Carolina, our 4{-year-old
son, Doron, was acting difficult. His justification was that he
missed Brooklyn, where we live. He proceeded to list all the things
he loved about the borough, including his friends and his favorite
activities. Out of frustration that we might never be able to take
a vacation again, we asked him if there might be some other place
he would be willing to travel to. He paused for a moment and then
replied, ``Manhattan.''

   There were only two passengers aboard a Madison Avenue bus late
one evening and Judy Bucey was startled out of her reverie by the
ringing of the other passenger's cell phone. The surprise turned to
amusement when the driver called out, ``If that's my wife, tell her
I'm not here.''
</P>
<P>
   On another Madison Avenue bus, two women in their upper middle
years were discussing the sweltering weather. Monica Sands
overheard the following exchange:
</P>
<P>
   First Woman: ``It's so hot today, I think I'll call off my
appointment with my acupuncturist.''
</P>
<P>
   Second Woman: ``Why do that? It might cool you off. With all
those needles poking little holes in you, you'll be well
ventilated.''
</P>
<P>
   Emery Davis, an orchestra leader who describes himself as
aggressive, recently had an unusual experience _ brought on by
himself.
</P>
<P>
   He was in a taxi on 57th Street, headed to Madison Square
Garden. ``Get on to Ninth Avenue, to 31st Street and then around to
the Garden,'' he instructed the driver. An old-time cabby, the
driver not only ignored him but also remained where he was, in the
slower of two lanes. Davis suggested that they might move a little
faster in the other lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think you can do it better?'' the driver said in a
challenging tone. ``Yes,'' Davis said. The driver pulled over to
the curb. ``OK, you drive,'' he said. The two traded places and
Davis, using every ounce of his aggression, whizzed along his
preferred route. When they got to the Garden, Davis was so pleased
with himself, he added a generous tip. His reward: ``Not bad,'' the
driver said.

   Bothered by the litter of expired Metrocards at bus stops and
around turnstiles? Bob Fowlow offers a solution that he spotted on
a Queens bus. A small homemade container beside the fare box
sported a sign that read, ``Cemetery for Used Metrocards. ''

   Basil C. Levine wasn't the only one amused by the comment of his
8-year-old granddaughter, Carling, as she inspected an abstract
sculpture at a Manhattan art gallery. The sculpture, titled ``The
Dog,'' consisted of rectangular metal bars connected with wire.
Carling's reaction: ``If that's a dog, he's got a lot of
problems.''

<P>
   Though a senior citizen, I still adhere to the rules of behavior
instilled in me as a child.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, while seated in a subway car that had no
vacant seats, an elderly man, leaning on a cane, accompanied by a
young woman in her teens, entered the car and happened to stand in
front of me. I immediately jumped up and offered him my seat. He
thanked me and, apparently a gentleman of the old school of
manners, proceeded to offer my seat to the young woman who,
smilingly, accepted it. Talk of chutzpah!
</P>
<P>
   Standing over her and glowering, I said, ``Miss, I gave up my
seat for this gentleman, not for you. As you appear to be a few
years younger than both of us, and if this man does not want the
seat, please return it to me, its rightful owner.'' She started to
say something, thought better of it and gave back the seat. I was
pleased to note a number of looks of approval.

   A Manhattan doctor who, for obvious reasons, doesn't want his
name used, was standing near the door, about to get off the train
to the Hamptons when a man, also about to depart, joined him.
</P>
<P>
   The man look at the doctor and said ``Lovely tie. Hermes?''
``Yes,'' said the doctor. The man went on to further judgment.
``Gift,'' he said, with not even a question in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   How did he come to this conclusion? ``The rest of you is a
slob,'' he said, sotto voce. The train stopped, and the two got off
without a further word.

   Could this possibly be a new fashion, replacing body piercing?
Victor Del Favaro was in the Metropolitan Museum of Art recently
when he spotted the familiar circular metal entrance tag, usually
folded onto a lapel, on the corner of a young man's lower lip.

   Gladys M. Distler was taking in the exhibition of Chaim Soutine
paintings at the Jewish Museum _ thickly painted canvases with bold
colors and distorted figures. Two other women were nearby, and as
she was leaving, she heard one say to the other, ``He's a good
painter _ but not for my living room.''
</P>
<P>
   I was in a packed matinee of ``Madeline'' with my 5{-year-old
niece and her father, across the aisle from a very noisy 4- or
5-year-old. A woman behind us finally blurted out, ``Can't you at
least try to control your child?'' The child's mother turned and
said, ``It's a children's movie _ that's what children do.''
</P>
<P>
   The other woman replied, ``But there are other children here who
are quiet and we can't hear because of yours.''
</P>
<P>
   The testy exchange continued until finally the mother of the
noisy child said, ``Would you like to step outside and settle
this?'' It took three nearby men to calm the situation.
</P>
<P>
   I love R-rated action movies, where bad guys are shot and
buildings get blown up. But it was only at ``Madeline,'' a G-rated
movie for children, that I got to see real New York City mean
street action.

   Bix Janni recently called a major airline's reservation desk and
had this conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Janni: I want to book a direct flight to Atlanta and would like
to pick up my tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Clerk: Where would you like to pick them up?
</P>
<P>
   Janni: In midtown.
</P>
<P>
   Clerk: How do you spell ``midtown''?
</P>
<P>
   Janni: Try ``New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   Clerk: What's the closest airport?
</P>
<P>
   Janni: JFK.
</P>
<P>
   Clerk: We have a pickup counter in the Plaza Hotel but it's
permanently closed.
</P>
<P>
   Janni used another airline.

   Rhoda Dolobowsky was leaving a concert of the Wayne Chamber
Orchestra in Wayne, N.J., when she heard one woman ask her friend
if she had enjoyed it. The second woman replied, ``It was good but
there were too many notes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Samuel I. Joseph was at the delicatessen counter of a market
in Baltimore when he heard a customer addressing the clerk. ``I'd
like some smoked turkey if it isn't too dry _ last week it was very
dry.'' A voice in the crowd called out, ``So how was it the week
before?''

   Edward G. O'Hara had to double-park when he recently took his
95-year-old father and 94-year-old mother to the doctor in
Brooklyn. As they were en route to the examination room, both
parents using canes, they passed through the waiting room where a
dozen elderly patients were silently waiting to be called.
</P>
<P>
   When his parents were finished and the three were leaving, again
via the waiting room, O'Hara stopped and with one parent clinging
to each arm, said in a loud voice, ``Which one of you is going to
drive home?'' The men and women in the waiting room broke up
laughing, and began talking to one another. O'Hara was pleased, and
his pleasure lasted until he got outside. His car had a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   It was very hot. I was the only customer at my favorite small
consignment shop, looking for a summer dress.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a woman burst through the door. Out of breath, she
panted her way to a saleswoman. She was desperate. ``I need white
pants,'' she breathed. In a matter of minutes, the saleswoman
pulled out a few pairs of white pants in different styles. She held
up the first pair _ white linen bell-bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   The desperate customer took one look. ``Oh no, not in a million
years,'' she said. ``Maybe not even then.''

</P>
<P>
   ``According to Newsweek, Kenneth Starr is preparing a 300-page
report that is going to include graphic descriptions of the
President's sexual encounters with Monica Lewinsky. The report will
be distributed to all members of Congress and their 13-year-old
sons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been reported that an early draft of President Clinton's
speech contained an apology to Monica Lewinsky. And an even earlier
draft of the speech contained a thank you to Monica Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Home-run hitter Mark McGwire has admitted to taking a
supplement that boosts your testosterone level. He also bragged
that if he keeps taking the supplement, he's not going to need a
bat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is Macaulay Culkin's 18th birthday. Apparently, he spent
a romantic evening celebrating around town with just his wife and
their fake IDs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On Martha's Vineyard yesterday, a large crowd on land cheered
as President Clinton went by on a boat. Mainly because they thought
he was leaving the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, the Clinton family did spend the whole day out on a
boat with Walter Cronkite. Afterwards, the First Lady admitted, 'It
was a little odd. I'm not used to being around the most trusted man
in America.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, the Little League
World Series is going on. Once again this year, Michael Jackson
asked if he could sing the national anthem and then just sort of
hang around for a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier tonight on a special episode of 'Nightline,' Ted
Koppel spent 12 hours in a federal prison's solitary confinement
ward. Apparently, he was trying to simulate the conditions of
President Clinton's vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, a 10-year-old girl became the first person in
history to sing the national anthem at all 30 Major League baseball
parks. Then, after breaking the record, the little girl admitted
she's been taking a testosterone enhancing supplement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A new study shows that many New York City classrooms have more
than 30 kids. And that's not counting their 30 kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Flatley, 'The Lord of Dance,' said he's going to star
in a brand new movie that will encourage people to follow their
dreams. Which is odd because most people's dream is to never see
Michael Flatley again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, Boris Yeltsin delivered a speech to the Russian people
about their economic crisis. In his speech, Yeltsin said that
things have gotten so bad, not only is the ruble worthless, but
they've also run out of ice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, the president of CBS television announced that
despite rumors, the network isn't for sale. Although he said
they'll take the best offer for Andy Rooney.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow is Michael Jackson's birthday. He turns 40 years old.
When asked to comment, Jackson said his age doesn't depress him,
but Macaulay Culkin's does.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, the organizer of Harlem's Million Youth March said
Mayor Giuliani is the devil. Immediately afterwards, the actual
devil held a press conference and said, 'Oh yeah, like I would have
shut down New York's strip clubs.'''

   ``Do you know how hurricanes get their names? They are all named
after stupid local TV reporters who died standing outside in the
last hurricane. 'Hi, my name's Bonnie. The winds are picking up
now. Everyone's evacuating except me. Aaahh!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see what's going on in Washington. Vice President Al
Gore returned from his two-week vacation in Hawaii. I didn't know
he was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the latest polls, if Bill Clinton and Al Gore
were running for election today, it would be a dead heat. Al Gore
would be dead and Bill Clinton would be in heat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see what's going on with Monica, or as President Clinton
calls her, 'My little humidor.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a rather obscure joke: what do Monica Lewinsky and
Lucille Ball have in common? They both had an intimate relationship
with a Cuban.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why this Ken Starr investigation has taken so long. For
the last five years he's been looking for a smoking gun. He
should've been looking for a smoking cigar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to producers at Playboy Television, you know where
the most uninhibited women in the world are? Russia. They said
Russian women love to get naked in public places. What a
coincidence. President Clinton's going there next week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This coming January 23, 50-year-old George Foreman fighting
48-year-old Larry Holmes. The excitement, the drama. Let's get
ready to stumble.''

   There were only two passengers aboard a Madison Avenue bus late
one evening and Judy Bucey was startled out of her reverie by the
ringing of the other passenger's cell phone. The surprise turned to
amusement when the driver called out, ``If that's my wife, tell her
I'm not here.''
</P>
<P>
   On another Madison Avenue bus, two women in their upper middle
years were discussing the sweltering weather. Monica Sands
overheard the following exchange:
</P>
<P>
   First Woman: ``It's so hot today, I think I'll call off my
appointment with my acupuncturist.''
</P>
<P>
   Second Woman: ``Why do that? It might cool you off. With all
those needles poking little holes in you, you'll be well
ventilated.''

   Emery Davis, an orchestra leader who describes himself as
aggressive, recently had an unusual experience _ brought on by
himself.
</P>
<P>
   He was in a taxi on 57th Street, headed to Madison Square
Garden. ``Get on to Ninth Avenue, to 31st Street and then around to
the Garden,'' he instructed the driver. An old-time cabby, the
driver not only ignored him but also remained where he was, in the
slower of two lanes. Davis suggested that they might move a little
faster in the other lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think you can do it better?'' the driver said in a
challenging tone. ``Yes,'' Davis said. The driver pulled over to
the curb. ``OK, you drive,'' he said. The two traded places and
Davis, using every ounce of his aggression, whizzed along his
preferred route. When they got to the Garden, Davis was so pleased
with himself, he added a generous tip. His reward: ``Not bad,'' the
driver said.

   Bothered by the litter of expired Metrocards at bus stops and
around turnstiles? Bob Fowlow offers a solution that he spotted on
a Queens bus. A small homemade container beside the fare box
sported a sign that read, ``Cemetery for Used Metrocards. ''

   Basil C. Levine wasn't the only one amused by the comment of his
8-year-old granddaughter, Carling, as she inspected an abstract
sculpture at a Manhattan art gallery. The sculpture, titled ``The
Dog,'' consisted of rectangular metal bars connected with wire.
Carling's reaction: ``If that's a dog, he's got a lot of
problems.''

   Though a senior citizen, I still adhere to the rules of behavior
instilled in me as a child.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, while seated in a subway car that had no
vacant seats, an elderly man, leaning on a cane, accompanied by a
young woman in her teens, entered the car and happened to stand in
front of me. I immediately jumped up and offered him my seat. He
thanked me and, apparently a gentleman of the old school of
manners, proceeded to offer my seat to the young woman who,
smilingly, accepted it. Talk of chutzpah!
</P>
<P>
   Standing over her and glowering, I said, ``Miss, I gave up my
seat for this gentleman, not for you. As you appear to be a few
years younger than both of us, and if this man does not want the
seat, please return it to me, its rightful owner.'' She started to
say something, thought better of it and gave back the seat. I was
pleased to note a number of looks of approval.

   A Manhattan doctor who, for obvious reasons, doesn't want his
name used, was standing near the door, about to get off the train
to the Hamptons when a man, also about to depart, joined him.
</P>
<P>
   The man look at the doctor and said ``Lovely tie. Hermes?''
``Yes,'' said the doctor. The man went on to further judgment.
``Gift,'' he said, with not even a question in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   How did he come to this conclusion? ``The rest of you is a
slob,'' he said, sotto voce. The train stopped, and the two got off
without a further word.

   Gladys M. Distler was taking in the exhibition of Chaim Soutine
paintings at the Jewish Museum _ thickly painted canvases with bold
colors and distorted figures. Two other women were nearby, and as
she was leaving, she heard one say to the other, ``He's a good
painter _ but not for my living room.''

<P>
   I was in a packed matinee of ``Madeline'' with my 5{-year-old
niece and her father, across the aisle from a very noisy 4- or
5-year-old. A woman behind us finally blurted out, ``Can't you at
least try to control your child?'' The child's mother turned and
said, ``It's a children's movie _ that's what children do.''
</P>
<P>
   The other woman replied, ``But there are other children here who
are quiet and we can't hear because of yours.''
</P>
<P>
   The testy exchange continued until finally the mother of the
noisy child said, ``Would you like to step outside and settle
this?'' It took three nearby men to calm the situation.
</P>
<P>
   I love R-rated action movies, where bad guys are shot and
buildings get blown up. But it was only at ``Madeline,'' a G-rated
movie for children, that I got to see real New York City mean
street action.

   Edward G. O'Hara had to double-park when he recently took his
95-year-old father and 94-year-old mother to the doctor in
Brooklyn. As they were en route to the examination room, both
parents using canes, they passed through the waiting room where a
dozen elderly patients were silently waiting to be called.
</P>
<P>
   When his parents were finished and the three were leaving, again
via the waiting room, O'Hara stopped and with one parent clinging
to each arm, said in a loud voice, ``Which one of you is going to
drive home?'' The men and women in the waiting room broke up
laughing, and began talking to one another. O'Hara was pleased, and
his pleasure lasted until he got outside. His car had a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   It was very hot. I was the only customer at my favorite small
consignment shop, looking for a summer dress.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a woman burst through the door. Out of breath, she
panted her way to a saleswoman. She was desperate. ``I need white
pants,'' she breathed. In a matter of minutes, the saleswoman
pulled out a few pairs of white pants in different styles. She held
up the first pair _ white linen bell-bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   The desperate customer took one look. ``Oh no, not in a million
years,'' she said. ``Maybe not even then.''

BUGS, TRANSFORMATION AND SUBTERFUGE IN A RE-INVENTED EDEN 
</HEADLINE>

 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Ever since cave painters began sketching horses, bison,
elephants and the like, artists have wrestled with the relationship
between man and nature. Fast-forward 20,000 years to the rural and
maritime landscapes and the still-life oils of the
post-Renaissance, and the question remained unchanged. How should
art respond to nature?
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, the Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art is
not claiming to have found an original theme in its latest show,
``Etre Nature,'' or ``Being Nature,'' which runs in Paris through
Sept. 20. But it has at least advanced the debate by gathering
together works by a score of contemporary artists who find their
inspiration in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, this is neither pastoral symphony nor environmental
expose (although one artist, the Polish-born Brazilian sculptor,
Frans Krajcberg, does implicity decry the burning of the Amazon).
Rather, the artists have found myriad ways, both concrete and
abstract, of linking nature to the human experience. And in the
process, they offer a different take, at times even a trompe
l'oeil, on both art and nature.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the simplest exhibit, ``Theatrum Botanicum,'' frequently
puzzles visitors to the Cartier Foundation's modern glass-and-steel
building on Boulevard Raspail. It is almost a cultural diktat that
French gardens be severely manicured. But when the center opened in
1994, the German artist Lothar Baumgarten designed a sort of
``anti-garden'' full of weeds and wild flowers as his way of being
truer to nature. Today, this permanent display seems to capture the
spirit of ``Etre Nature.''
</P>
<P>
   So is untouched nature already a form of art? The foundation's
director, Herve Chandes, appears to believe so because the catalyst
for this show was the opportunity to present for the first time
hundreds of crawling and flying tropical insects from the
collection of Anne and Jacques Kerchache. What makes them art and
not entomology is that they are not identified and exist only for
their stunning colors and shapes.
</P>
<P>
   Some artists have simply transformed natural elements. Andy
Galsworthy, an English sculptor, has created a sphere that
resembles a giant tumbleweed from the fallen branches of an oak
tree, while Wolfgang Laib from Germany has used yellow pollen to
make a temporary floor painting. Another German, Olaf Nikolai,
presents what he calls ``biological sculptures'' in the form of
rocks covered with miniature vegetation accompanied by blow-up
photographs that suggest the tiny plants are large trees. The
American Peter Campus is showing black-and-white transparencies of
rocks that, seen in a dark room against a black background, take on
the appearance of asteroids.
</P>
<P>
   Chandes said he was particularly struck by the photography of
the 80-year-old Japanese artist Yukio Nakagawa, who has turned
ikebana, the Japanese art of flower arrangement, into contemporary
art. Typical of his work is ``Discovery'' (1976), which is included
in this show: he has taken 5,000 crushed tulips and tied them into
a bundle that resembles a large piece of raw meat. In another work,
``The Blues'' (1993), the cold white form of a cabbage evokes a
Chinese ivory sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Vija Celmins, a Latvian-born artist who lives in New York, has
exploited the double take through double images in a series called
``To Fix the Image in the Memory,'' where one plus one does indeed
add up to more than two. The show includes two works in which she
has taken roughly colored stones and placed identical painted
bronze replicas beside them. Thus, nature is replicated but the
copy is not revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hawkinson, a Los Angeles-based artist, has achieved a trompe
l'oeil effect in a still more personal way. His exhibits include
the tiny skeleton of a bird, an egg and a feather, but in this case
his own body has provided the raw material: the egg and the feather
are made with the artist's hair, the bird skeleton with bits of his
fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   Krajcberg is the only exhibitor here to refer to man's abuse of
nature. He does this through wooden sculptures of blackened trunks
of trees resting on a bed of charcoal. Some of the trunks carry
colors as if to remind the viewer that the burning of the Amazon
continues. Another sculpture seen here shows the thick roots of a
tree springing from its blackened trunk almost like the legs of a
giant tarantula.
</P>
<P>
   Giuseppe Penone, an Italian sculptor, is also interested in
trunks and boughs of trees, but these he reproduces in glass and,
in this case, has placed them amid the vegetation of Baumgarten's
``anti-garden.'' The work of Tunga, a Brazilian artist who
frequently gives strange forms to everyday objects, is represented
here by a large viper made of braided black electric wire.
</P>
<P>
   Two artists have brought art and nature together in a way
guaranteed to appeal to visitors. In a work called ``Le Pont''
(1993-1995), which resembles a small glass-covered footbridge, the
Paris-based Chinese artist Huang Yong Ping has juxtaposed 18th- and
19th-century Japanese bronzes of animals, snakes and dragons with
live tortoises and snakes. (An obligatory notice records that the
live animals are being treated according to official regulations.)
As it happens, the real snakes and tortoises are usually as
immobile as the bronzes, but on one recent afternoon a sleeping
snake was at least wrapped around an even more exotic bronze
serpent.
</P>
<P>
   Still more fascinating is the work done by a French artist,
Hubert Duprat, with the larvae of the caddis fly. These small
wormlike life forms are aquatic and live in slender cocoons that
they build out of threads, tiny twigs and sand. Since 1983, Duprat
has been giving them flecks of gold, pearl and precious stone with
which to make their cocoons. In the exhibition, a continuous film
shows one worm busily at work in massive close-up. A few feet away,
the sight of several of them in a pool of running water building
their temporary jewel-like homes _ they later become moths _ brings
the surprise that they are only 1-inch long.
</P>
<P>
   Like any group show, ``Etre Nature'' can offer no single
conclusion beyond the commonplace that, in face of the vastness of
nature, artists can be little more than anecdotal. Yet, the
inclusion of the Kerchache collection of tropical insects does at
least propose that there is no line between art and nature. It is a
view that the great French anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss would
endorse. ``A bird, a beetle, a butterfly,'' he once said, ``call
for the same rapt contemplation that we reserve for a Tintoretto or
a Rembrandt.''

URBAN LEGENDS FIND NEW LIFE IN HOLLYWOOD, ON INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MONTY PHAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED) - This is a true story. We swear.
</P>
<P>
   The people quoted are real, and we didn't use any friends of a
friend, even though they're all totally reliable. Sure, you may
have heard parts of this story before, but if you don't believe
them, don't blame us. That's just what we heard.
</P>
<P>
   But here's one truth we find to be self-evident: Urban legends,
in one form or another, seem to be popping up on TV and in the
movies more often lately. They're the stories those friends swore
were in the paper a few months back, the same ones we pass on in
letters, faxes or e-mails over the Internet, the medium that did
for urban legends what Las Vegas did for sin.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, however, the legends recirculated by Hollywood
and Madison Avenue are campier versions of the original tales,
seemingly poking fun at the exaggerated logic of having a houseful
of people chopped up just to point out that you should lock your
door at night. And in the true spirit of urban legends, the stories
have been changed to fit the times.
</P>
<P>
   These days, it's camp that sells. Take a look at the
``Scream''-type movies, those horror flicks that mock cliches of
horror flicks while adhering to those same cliches. In fact, come
Sept. 25, a film called ``Urban Legend'' opens, telling the tale of
a killer who offs unsuspecting students by bringing popular, untrue
legends to life (or, rather, death).
</P>
<P>
   (Example: Considerate college student comes home late, leaves
light off for sleeping roommate, wakes up to dead roommate and
``Aren't you glad you didn't turn on the light?'' written in blood
on the wall. Note to college freshmen: It's false. But, hey, keep
those doors locked. We told you once already.)
</P>
<P>
   In a way, they're our present-day parables. Sure, most legends
are false, but many have some form of moral to them. For instance,
the lack of documented Halloween-related candy poisonings have led
researchers and folklorists to conclude that that legend is untrue,
but that doesn't mean we should trust all candy-bearing strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Because the movie ``Urban Legend'' is a slasher flick, it
focuses on some of the more violent tales. Like the ``Aren't you
glad you didn't turn on the light?'' story, those legends use
exaggeration to teach safety.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Urban Legends Archive (www.urbanlegends.com),
most such stories share certain traits, among them questionable
origins and elements of humor or horror. Other legends reflect
current concerns, such as Internet hoaxes that boast of an
increasing Big Brother-like technology. Basically, they're legends
in our own minds. One making the rounds of late is an e-mail
offering a prize to users who help Bill Gates and the Walt Disney
Co. test an e-mail tracking program by forwarding it to 10 people.
</P>
<P>
   Many also have a basis in fact, such as the one about Craig
Shergold, a British boy who, in 1989, was diagnosed with terminal
cancer. On his behalf, family members appealed to the masses to
send him get-well cards so he could set the world record.
</P>
<P>
   He made it into the ``Guinness Book of World Records'' with 33
million cards in 1992 before the category was retired. However,
forms of his story kept circulating the globe. E-mail did the most
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Shergold regressed in age, becoming a 7-year-old boy. He still
was dying of cancer. His last name became Shefford or Sherwood. He
lived in Atlanta. And then someone substituted the Phoenix-based
Make-A-Wish Foundation for The Children's Wish Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Shergold, incidentally, is a healthy 19-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' says Shergold, from his Wallington, England,
home. ``People are always getting the story wrong. I just wish it
would stop now.''
</P>
<P>
   The national office in Phoenix still gets about 100 calls a
week, and that's not including its 82 chapters nationwide. It even
has a toll-free number, 800-215-1333, to explain the legend.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Wallington, the Shergold family deals with four to
five bags of mail a day; the family estimates Craig has received
about 250 million cards. But the get-well card requests may have
saved Shergold: Because of the commotion, a Virginia billionaire
found out about the boy's story and paid for both the family's trip
to the United States and for Craig's operation, which resulted in
the removal of all but a benign part of the tumor.
</P>
<P>
   But while the basis of the Shergold legend is easy to pinpoint,
the origin of the urban legend featured in another film, ``Dead Man
on Campus,'' is less apparent. The movie, which opened Aug. 21 and
is produced by MTV Films, is a dark comedy about two flunking
college kids who discover their school's little-known rule that if
your roommate commits suicide, you automatically get a 4.0. So,
instead of improving their grades by studying, they spend their
time looking for suicidal roommies.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, no college has a rule like that, but good luck
finding a campus without some form of the ``Suicide Rule.''
According to the Urban Legends Reference Pages (www.snopes.com), a
Web site maintained by the San Fernando Valley Folklore Society,
the legend was started in the mid-1970s and reflects students'
anxiety to maintain good grades.
</P>
<P>
   Young people are legendarily impressionable, so it's no
coincidence that the current ``Dead Man on Campus'' and the
upcoming ``Urban Legend'' cater to the late teens and college
crowd. They're easy targets, after all, and have yet to be exposed
to many of the legends adults have heard over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Gibson, an executive creative director at the
Minneapolis-based Campbell Mithun Esty ad , says he had the image
of free-spirited youth in mind when Kmart asked the company to
produce TV commercials for its Route 66 brand of clothes.
</P>
<P>
   While doing research on the road, the company kept happening
upon Route 66-related folklore. That led to two commercials: The
first was ``Concrete Car,'' in which a jealous cement-truck driver
returns home to an unfamiliar convertible car in his driveway and
his wife inside laughing with another man. So he fills the car with
cement, only to discover that his wife bought the car as a birthday
gift and had just signed the final papers with the salesman.
</P>
<P>
   In the other commercial, ``Last Dance,'' a college-age character
tells the story of a group of kids who have brief car trouble while
driving to a dance. They stop at a motel, where a girl asks them
for ride. At the dance, she borrows one boy's shirt, then
disappears. When the group returns to the motel the next day to
retrieve the shirt, they talk to the girl's mother, who says it
couldn't have been her daughter because she died 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Both commercials show a group of young people listening to the
storyteller, who starts off the former commercial with ``my cousin
knew this guy'' and the latter one with ``my brother knew these
guys.'' Part of the reason the commercials show young people is
because Kmart wanted to market the Route 66 line to that age group.
But Gibson says the ad agency's reason for using urban legends went
deeper than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're drawn to the mystery of it as well as the
humor of it,'' he says. ``Young people find mystery intriguing in
stories like that. You're in on something and I feel that's
important. You want to feel like you're connected to something
important and different at that age.'' &QL;

A SPECTACULAR TALE IN ITS MYTHIC HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In a giant courtyard of the Forbidden City, a woman's
voice soars gloriously into the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   Spotlights illuminate a 580-year-old Ming Dynasty temple where
emperors once made sacrifices to their ancestors. Now hundreds of
Chinese soldiers and dancers move to the music and to instructions
shouted over a loudspeaker. Two ancient-looking pavilions at the
front of the vermilion temple hall eerily glide toward center
stage, then spew forth dozens more soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Framed by scores of scurrying carpenters, the scene the other
night in this corner of the Imperial palaces was a spectacle worthy
of Cecil B. De Mille as preparations got under way for the first
presentation of ``Turandot'' in the Forbidden City, the very
setting Puccini imagined for his Orientalist fantasy of an icy
princess who succumbs to love.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang Yimou, the director of ``Raise the Red Lantern'' and ``Red
Sorghum,'' sat on a chair in the middle of the audience area,
wearing black high-tops, black jeans and a black T-shirt. He stared
ahead as though mesmerized, occasionally conferring with his
choreographer, Chen Weiya.
</P>
<P>
   Chen held a microphone, calling directions to the army of
soldiers onstage, who were literally from the Chinese militia.
``Pay attention to the music!'' he shouted as someone opened a door
too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The director and choreographer, engaged in intimate
collaboration, glanced back and forth from the temple to a
television monitor that played a videotape of the ``Turandot'' they
staged with Zubin Mehta in Florence last year. The soundtrack of
that video, which Chen controlled with a remote, roared into the
night, giving the place a slightly frantic and surreal quality.
</P>
<P>
   This week Mehta is expected to be on hand for full dress
rehearsals. The 120-piece Maggio Musicale Fiorentino/Florence Opera
orchestra, a chorus of 200 and the divas all fit in front of the
temple along with a cast that will approach 1,000 members in the
grand finale.
</P>
<P>
   In the eight performances scheduled on consecutive nights
beginning Saturday, three singers will alternate in each of the
main parts. Giovanna Casolla, Audrey Stottler and Sharon Sweet will
play Princess Turandot, Angela Maria Blasi, Barbara Frittoli and
Barbara Hendricks will play Liu, and Lando Bartolini, Kristjan
Johansson and Sergej Larin will play Prince Calaf.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ecker of Austria, the impresario who pulled off this
coup after four years of haggling with Chinese officials, called
the staging ``the last great cultural event before the millennial
festivities begin.''
</P>
<P>
   The event has been warmly greeted by government officials, in
sharp contrast to the thwarting of another grand cultural exchange
this summer. Last month a culture commissar in Shanghai blocked the
export of a performance of a 22-hour Ming Dynasty opera, ``The
Peony Pavilion,'' which had been sponsored by Lincoln Center. Ecker
admitted to having lost some sleep when the Shanghai city
government prevented that cast from leaving for the United States
on the ground that the production (by a Chinese-American) was
pornographic and disrespectful of tradition. Lincoln Center had a
signed contract.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang, whose films and free thinking have not always endeared
him to Communist officials, said he had to show authorities a
written description of his plans to get approval for ``Turandot''
but that there had been no interference. Asked about the ``Peony
Pavilion'' debacle, he said, ``I haven't heard much about this.''
</P>
<P>
   The China Performing Arts Agency is co-producer of ``Turandot,''
a commercial venture that is worlds away from the sternly moral
revolutionary operas of Mao's Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The production is establishing new standards for spending on an
opera _ close to $15 million _ and for attracting jet-set opera
fans, thousands of whom are zooming in from Europe, the United
States and the rest of Asia. It is also a new high for ``corporate
hospitality'' as companies like Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse First
Boston and Elle magazine buy large blocks of seats to the show and
the 15-course Imperial dinner that follows each staging, the better
to entertain choice clients and cultivate guanxi, or personal ties,
with Chinese officials. The performances will be taped for
broadcast abroad, and CDs will be for sale.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on the palace steps after an early rehearsal,
Zhang seemed exhilarated but admitted to some frustration trying to
control such a sprawling enterprise. ``We see so many people up
there, and we're trying to bring some order out of this and keep it
all in tone with the opera,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   At the rehearsals, which often ran from 8 p.m. to midnight,
Mehta's assistants sat at a table behind the director, reading the
score as they watched scenes take shape. At another table were
lighting designers from Florence. Specialists from the Vienna State
Opera hoped to give the outdoor space the acoustical quality of a
concert hall.
</P>
<P>
   In the back hall of the temple hung many of the 1,000 costumes,
designed, along with the set, by two Beijing artisans commissioned
by Zhang as part of his effort to make the production as authentic
to the Ming Dynasty as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the scene was one of controlled chaos. During the
production last year in Florence, which was in effect a
smaller-scale rehearsal for the Beijing show though a hit in its
own right, Zhang learned what a nail-biting experience it is to
pull together an opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I discovered 30 problems on opening night,'' he recalled.
``Others told me not to worry, it's impossible to have a perfect
performance.'' Making films, he said, he can shoot and reshoot, and
study his film again and again.
</P>
<P>
   In repose, Zhang often looks as if he is about to cry, but his
face becomes animated when he talks about his goal to recreate
``Turandot'' with a genuine Chinese spirit. Many Chinese viewers,
perhaps unschooled in Western opera, may feel bemused, he said.
``Though there's a huge cast of Chinese extras and dancers, the
singers are all fat foreign people,'' he said. ``So Chinese viewers
may feel it's funny in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   By providing meticulously authentic sets and costumes and by
staging ``Turandot'' in a classical Chinese manner, the director
hopes to create a new sense of an opera that was composed by an
Italian who never visited China.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang said he knew little about opera before Mehta and Ecker
approached him about the project. ``When I first saw this opera, I
felt it had nothing to do with China; it was a myth that could be
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't touch the music, of course, he said, but in his
staging he wanted to convey the simple emotional themes of the
opera with the poetic and romantic methods of traditional Chinese
literature.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang cited a Chinese fable for illustration. A girl who is
about to be murdered tells her killer that if his act is wrong,
then it will snow in summer _ and so it does.
</P>
<P>
   The director has used that fantastical approach in staging, for
example, the scene in Act I when the Persian Prince who has failed
to solve Princess Turandot's riddle is executed. Zhang said he had
seen other performances in which this and similar scenes are simple
and direct: ``They hold up a severed head and that's it.'' But in
his version, as the man is executed, the soldiers' dark uniforms
turn to white, the traditional Chinese color of mourning.
</P>
<P>
   While Zhang works to wring order out of a thousand pieces,
Ecker, the producer, has worked in hyperdrive to make the
enterprise pay off. Ecker is with Opera on Original Site Inc., a
group based in Switzerland that earned its name by staging Verdi's
``Aida'' in Luxor, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government seems to be embracing the show, with the
official press extolling the role of the home-grown director and
designers, and tourist officials cheered by the prospect of
thousands of well-heeled visitors. The Chinese government will
receive 200 complimentary tickets to each show (of close to 4,000
available seats each night), and President Jiang Zemin is expected
to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Two performances of ``Turandot,'' one a general rehearsal and
one an official performance, were reserved for Beijing residents at
reduced prices and sold out in five days. The cheapest tickets, at
$150, are gone. Remaining are $350 seats, which include the dinner.
About 1,000 Americans are expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:15 p.m. the other night, Zhang ended the rehearsal early,
prompting cheers from the hundreds of extras. He huddled with Chen,
the choreographer, and others to solve problems in the coordination
of crowd movements, set and music.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these things are going on at the same time, and then
there's the music,'' Zhang said later. ``I can't imagine how things
will turn out. So opening night is really going to be stressful.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brisk jet stream winds from the southwest will steer strong
Hurricane Danielle parallel to, but well away from, the Eastern
Seaboard Tuesday. Scattered thunder near the Carolina coast will
develop along a stalled front, but are not directly related to the
hurricane. Otherwise, large swells will continue to reach the
shoreline from northern Florida to the Middle Atlantic states.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Storm Earl, with sustained winds near 50 miles an hour,
is expected to gradually strengthen in the central Gulf of Mexico
Tuesday. Bands of tropical showers and thunderstorms will produce
downpours near the central Gulf coast. Other thundershowers will be
widely separated near and inland from the coast, from Texas to
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front will sweep though the upper Midwest. Due to limited
moisture, only a few isolated showers will accompany the front.
Meanwhile, a jet stream disturbance will spark a cluster of
southward-moving storms in the middle Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A large ridge of high pressure near 18,000 feet will remain over
the West. A pocket of moist air in the lower half of the
atmosphere, stuck over the central Rockies due to light and
variable winds aloft, will sponsor clusters of thunderstorms from
the southern Sierra to Colorado. Meanwhile, sunshine and near
record heat will occur in parts of the interior Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a wedge of dry air will allow for ample sun and a
pleasant afternoon from the eastern Ohio Valley to the Northeast.
Temperatures in the 70s to lower 80s will be close to the long-term
average.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Related Rains
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 5 p.m. on Saturday, rainfall at Nome, Alaska, for
August reached 8.45 inches, making August the town's wettest month
on record. The previous monthly mark was 8.43 inches, set in July
of 1920. For much of August, a large, sprawling trough of low
pressure held steady at 18,000 feet over the Bering Sea and the
northern Gulf of Alaska, setting the stage for recurrent, heavy
rains. Because of the natural spacings between large troughs of low
pressure, another trough anchored itself over eastern Asia for much
of the month, touching off prodigious, flooding rains in parts of
China.

URBAN LEGENDS FIND NEW LIFE IN HOLLYWOOD, ON INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MONTY PHAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED) - This is a true story. We swear.
</P>
<P>
   The people quoted are real, and we didn't use any friends of a
friend, even though they're all totally reliable. Sure, you may
have heard parts of this story before, but if you don't believe
them, don't blame us. That's just what we heard.
</P>
<P>
   But here's one truth we find to be self-evident: Urban legends,
in one form or another, seem to be popping up on TV and in the
movies more often lately. They're the stories those friends swore
were in the paper a few months back, the same ones we pass on in
letters, faxes or e-mails over the Internet, the medium that did
for urban legends what Las Vegas did for sin.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, however, the legends recirculated by Hollywood
and Madison Avenue are campier versions of the original tales,
seemingly poking fun at the exaggerated logic of having a houseful
of people chopped up just to point out that you should lock your
door at night. And in the true spirit of urban legends, the stories
have been changed to fit the times.
</P>
<P>
   These days, it's camp that sells. Take a look at the
``Scream''-type movies, those horror flicks that mock cliches of
horror flicks while adhering to those same cliches. In fact, come
Sept. 25, a film called ``Urban Legend'' opens, telling the tale of
a killer who offs unsuspecting students by bringing popular, untrue
legends to life (or, rather, death).
</P>
<P>
   (Example: Considerate college student comes home late, leaves
light off for sleeping roommate, wakes up to dead roommate and
``Aren't you glad you didn't turn on the light?'' written in blood
on the wall. Note to college freshmen: It's false. But, hey, keep
those doors locked. We told you once already.)
</P>
<P>
   In a way, they're our present-day parables. Sure, most legends
are false, but many have some form of moral to them. For instance,
the lack of documented Halloween-related candy poisonings have led
researchers and folklorists to conclude that that legend is untrue,
but that doesn't mean we should trust all candy-bearing strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Because the movie ``Urban Legend'' is a slasher flick, it
focuses on some of the more violent tales. Like the ``Aren't you
glad you didn't turn on the light?'' story, those legends use
exaggeration to teach safety.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Urban Legends Archive (www.urbanlegends.com),
most such stories share certain traits, among them questionable
origins and elements of humor or horror. Other legends reflect
current concerns, such as Internet hoaxes that boast of an
increasing Big Brother-like technology. Basically, they're legends
in our own minds. One making the rounds of late is an e-mail
offering a prize to users who help Bill Gates and the Walt Disney
Co. test an e-mail tracking program by forwarding it to 10 people.
</P>
<P>
   Many also have a basis in fact, such as the one about Craig
Shergold, a British boy who, in 1989, was diagnosed with terminal
cancer. On his behalf, family members appealed to the masses to
send him get-well cards so he could set the world record.
</P>
<P>
   He made it into the Guinness Book of World Records with 33
million cards in 1992 before the category was retired. However,
forms of his story kept circulating the globe. E-mail did the most
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Shergold regressed in age, becoming a 7-year-old boy. He still
was dying of cancer. His last name became Shefford or Sherwood. He
lived in Atlanta. And then someone substituted the Phoenix-based
Make-A-Wish Foundation for The Children's Wish Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Shergold, incidentally, is a healthy 19-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' says Shergold, from his Wallington, England,
home. ``People are always getting the story wrong. I just wish it
would stop now.''
</P>
<P>
   The national office in Phoenix still gets about 100 calls a
week, and that's not including its 82 chapters nationwide. It even
has a toll-free number, 800-215-1333, to explain the legend.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Wallington, the Shergold family deals with four to
five bags of mail a day; the family estimates Craig has received
about 250 million cards. But the get-well card requests may have
saved Shergold: Because of the commotion, a Virginia billionaire
found out about the boy's story and paid for both the family's trip
to the United States and for Craig's operation, which resulted in
the removal of all but a benign part of the tumor.
</P>
<P>
   But while the basis of the Shergold legend is easy to pinpoint,
the origin of the urban legend featured in another film, ``Dead Man
on Campus,'' is less apparent. The movie, which opened Aug. 21 and

`KING LEOPOLD'S GHOST': GENOCIDE WITH SPIN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes at end of review)  
(lb) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Conrad's ``Heart of Darkness'' is frequently read as an
allegorical or Freudian parable, while its murderous hero, Kurtz _
the renegade white trader, who lives deep in the Congo jungle
behind a fence adorned with shrunken heads _ is regarded as a
Nietzschean madman or avatar of colonial ambition run dangerously
amok.
</P>
<P>
   As Adam Hochschild's disturbing new book on the Belgian Congo
makes clear, however, Kurtz was based on several historical
figures, and the horror Conrad described was all too real. In fact,
Hochschild suggests, ``Heart of Darkness'' stands as a remarkably
``precise and detailed'' portrait of King Leopold's Congo in 1890,
just as one of history's most heinous acts of mass killing was
getting under way.
</P>
<P>
   Under the reign of terror instituted by King Leopold II of
Belgium (who ran the Congo Free State as his personal fief from
1885 to 1908), the population of the Congo was reduced by half _ as
many as 8 million Africans (perhaps even 10 million, in
Hochschild's opinion) lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Some were beaten or whipped to death for failing to meet the
rigid production quotas for ivory and rubber harvests, imposed by
Leopold's agents. Some were worked to death, forced to labor in
slavelike conditions as porters, rubber gatherers or miners for
little or no pay.
</P>
<P>
   Some died of the diseases introduced to (and spread throughout)
the Congo by Europeans. And still others died from the increasingly
frequent famines that swept the Congo basin as Leopold's army
rampaged through the countryside, appropriating food and crops for
its own use while destroying villages and fields.
</P>
<P>
   Although much of the material in ``King Leopold's Ghost'' is
secondhand _ the author has drawn heavily from Jules Marchal's
scholarly four-volume history of turn-of-the-century Congo and from
``The Scramble for Africa,'' Thomas Pakenham's wide-ranging 1991
study of the European conquest of the continent _ Hochschild has
stitched it together into a vivid, novelistic narrative that makes
the reader acutely aware of the magnitude of the horror perpetrated
by King Leopold and his minions.
</P>
<P>
   It is a book that situates Leopold's crimes in a wider context
of European and African history while at the same time underscoring
the peculiarly modern nature of his efforts to exert ``spin
control'' over his actions.
</P>
<P>
   As depicted by Hochschild, the people in ``Ghost'' emerge as
larger-than-life figures, the sort of characters who might easily
populate a Victorian melodrama were it not for the tragic and very
real consequences of their actions.
</P>
<P>
   Leopold himself comes across as a cartoon-strip megalomaniac _ a
mad, greedy king obsessed since adolescence with the idea of
running a colony of his own and intent throughout his career on
covering his lust for money and real estate in honeyed talk of
philanthropy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   As for Henry Morton Stanley, the world-famous explorer whom
Leopold retained as his agent, he is depicted as a Dickensian bully
and chronic liar who allowed his own monumental celebrity to be
used by Leopold for the worst possible ends. He eventually
persuaded hundreds of Congo basin chiefs to sign over their land
and their rights to the king of the Belgians.
</P>
<P>
   With the sheaf of treaties Stanley had acquired firmly in hand,
King Leopold embarked on a worldwide lobbying campaign to win
diplomatic recognition of his new colony.
</P>
<P>
   He succeeded in winning this recognition, Hochschild argues, by
playing one great European power against another and by portraying
his control of the Congo as a kind of benevolent protectorship that
would bring a civilizing influence to the continent while thwarting
the malign designs of Arab slave-traders eager to exploit the same
region.
</P>
<P>
   In actuality, Leopold saw the Congo as his personal domain (his
power as sovereign of the colony was not shared with the Belgian
government) and as a rich source of rubber, ivory and other natural
resources that could fatten his coffers at home.
</P>
<P>
   Marchal, the Belgian scholar, estimates that Leopold drew some
220 million francs (or $1.1 billion in today's dollars) in profits
from the Congo during his lifetime. Much of that money, Hochschild
suggests, went to buying Leopold's teen-age mistress, a former call
girl named Caroline, expensive dresses and villas, and building
ever grander monuments, museums and triumphal arches in honor of
the king.
</P>
<P>
   Those profits came at the price of terrible suffering by the
Congolese people. Not only was their land summarily annexed _ most
of the chiefs who signed Stanley's ``treaties'' had no idea what
they were signing _ but they were also coerced into the arduous job
of gathering rubber for Leopold's men as well.
</P>
<P>
   Those who refused or failed to meet their quotas were brutally
whipped, tortured or shot, Hochschild reports; others saw their
wives and children taken hostage by Leopold's soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hochschild, hostage-taking and the grisly severing
of hands (from corpses or from living human beings) were part of
the government's deliberate policy _ a means of terrorizing others
into submission.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the ``rubber terror'' spread through the Congolese rain
forest, Hochschild adds, entire villages were wiped out: Hundreds
of dead bodies were dumped in rivers and lakes, while baskets of
severed hands were routinely presented to white officers as
evidence of how many people had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Hochschild writes about these horrifying events with tightly
controlled anger, and he brings equal passion to his account of the
small band of protesters who orchestrated resistance to Leopold's
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Those protesters include Edmund Dene Morel, a British
shipping-company employee, who brought the king's crimes to world
attention; George Washington Williams, a black American journalist
who chronicled the grisly conditions in the Congo in an open letter
to King Leopold; and Roger Casement, an Irish member of the British
consular service, who sent home a torrent of dispatches condemning
specific atrocities and the entire way the colony was run.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts of these men and others helped bring international
pressure to bear on Leopold, and in 1908 he turned over the Congo _
in effect, sold it _ to the Belgian government.
</P>
<P>
   Leopold, in the meantime, tried to ensure that his crimes would
never make it into the history books. Shortly after the turnover of
the colony, Hochschild writes, the furnaces near Leopold's palace
burned for eight days, ``turning most of the Congo state records to
ash and smoke.'' ``I will give them my Congo,'' the king is
reported saying, ``but they have no right to know what I did
there.''
</P>
<P>
   With this book, Hochschild, like other historians before him,
ensures that King Leopold has not gotten away with his efforts to
erase the memory of his brutal acts.

SHOT PUTTER FIGHTING FOR REPUTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The irony has not been lost upon Randy Barnes. He hit a golden
``home run,'' of sorts, two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd stood and roared then, too, just like the cascades of
cheers that Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa are now hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But now Barnes worries. He wonders if his golden sheen has been
forever lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish Mark McGwire nothing but the best,'' Barnes says. ``I
hope he breaks Roger Maris' record.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, yeah, I think it's ironic.''
</P>
<P>
   On a sultry night in Atlanta two summers ago, Barnes, the former
Texas A&AMP;M shot putter, soared from sixth place to the Olympic gold
medal on one dramatic, final toss. It was the first gold medal in
track and field won by the United States at the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   In April testers showed up at Barnes' South Charleston, W.Va.,
home for a routine, nothing-out-of-the-ordinary, out-of-competition
drug test. All world-class track and field athletes have to undergo
the random tests.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, Barnes was stunned to hear the world
governing body for track and field, the IAAF, announce that he had
tested positive for a prohibited substance and thereby faces a
lifetime suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' sample contained androstenedione, the nutritional
supplement at the center of the McGwire controversy.
</P>
<P>
   He took the stuff. Barnes makes no show of denying that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have one sport where there's no penalty at all for taking
what he did,'' Barnes says, underlining the irony. ``And you have
another sport where they try to ruin your reputation and ban you
for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes stands by his original statement after the IAAF
announcement _ that he ``never willingly did anything illegal,
immoral or unethically wrong.'' He would rather have any more
comments come from his attorney, Greg Duplantis.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes is appealing the suspension. He is expected to argue that
androstenedione was added to the International Olympic Committee's
list of banned substances only last December and, hence, the shot
putter had no idea the supplement was on the X-list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it as an over-the-counter, nonprescription supplement
that anybody can buy at a health food store,'' Barnes says, echoing
baseball's argument.
</P>
<P>
   Duplantis says they finally saw the updated list _ after the
suspension had been announced.
</P>
<P>
   Ignorance of the X-list, unfortunately, has never been a warmly
received defense when the Drug Hearing Board convenes. But therein
lies the despotic reasoning that permeates the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC doesn't know conclusively whether andro is harmful.
There isn't a lab rat on the planet that does. But because the IOC
does try to regulate levels of testosterone, it apparently slapped
a knee-jerk ban on andro, which is said to naturally enhance the
production of testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   There are all forms of other ``cousin'' drugs on the IOC banned
list. Valium, for instance, is OK, but certain varieties of
Tylenol, Dristan and Dimetapp are not. The IOC lumps them all under
the category of stimulants.
</P>
<P>
   Enlightened thinking remains discouraged. When IOC head Juan
Antonio Samaranch boldly said last month that it's time that the
Olympic fathers distinguish between drugs that are known to be
harmful and those that aren't, his own people cried that he was
misquoted. Still, a global Olympic summit has been called for
Switzerland in January to discuss, among other doping issues, what
to do about supplements like androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the Barnes case is a prior suspension in 1991 for
testing positive for methyltestosterone, a true anabolic steroid.
Barnes argued that a chain of unusual, messy handling procedures
should have made his sample invalid, and a U.S. panel concurred.
But the IAAF stuck by its two-year suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Duplantis hopes Samaranch's words don't come too late for
Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for people to imagine that in one sport it's
completely OK,'' he says, ``and in the other you're a druggie.
They're going to make you wear the scarlet letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes says he ``stands behind'' McGwire. He will be pulling for
him to break the record.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Barnes says, he feels empathy with the home-run
hero. He shares a particular pain at the foul publicity that
McGwire has been getting because of taking andro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a marvelous career,'' the Olympic champion says.
``But the thing I'm fighting for most is my reputation _ and how my
sport is going to remember me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not, he hopes, with a scarlet letter.

TEXAS A&AMP;M'S DEFENSIVE LINEMEN EAGER TO MAKE PRESENCE FELT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Like most football coaches, Bill
Johnson expects film study from his players. But this request was a
little different.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of breaking down the blocking techniques of upcoming
opponents, the Texas A&AMP;M defensive line coach wanted his troops to
examine the uppercuts of Sylvester Stallone. During two-a-days,
``Rocky'' became required viewing for Aggies' defensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the pop quiz. Johnson asked players the lesson to be
learned from Rocky Balboa, Philadelphia street bum turned
heavyweight boxing contender.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, no one who will suit up for the 14th-ranked Aggies in
tomorrow's Kickoff Classic against second-ranked Florida State in
East Rutherford, N.J. offered the correct response.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all talked about how tough he was,'' Johnson said. ``But
that's not the point. The story of ``Rocky'' is how a guy from
nowhere took advantage of an opportunity and turned some heads in
the big city. That's what our defensive line is going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   With no returning starters from last year's 9-4 team, A&AMP;M's
defensive line is cloaked in anonymity. Three sophomores, led by
the aptly named Rocky Bernard, are expected to make their first
career starts. They have combined for 37 tackles at the college
level, almost half by Bernard (17).
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum is realistic about what to expect when
defensive ends Bernard (6-foot-3, 269 pounds) and Ron Flemons (6-5,
247) join nose guard Ron Edwards (6-3, 262) in locking horns with a
Flordia State offensive line that averages 315 pounds per man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect all three of them will be in shock after the first
series,'' Slocum said.
</P>
<P>
   How well they respond, Slocum said, will tell a lot about what
the Aggies can expect from their guys in the defensive trenches in
1998. The three starters, as well as the top four reserves, were
all members of A&AMP;M's 1997 signing class. They lack size and
experience but have ample quickness, strength and desire, in
Johnson's estimation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talent level is not a question in my mind,'' Johnson said.
``We've got plenty of athletic ability. Whether our personnel will
execute what we call, that's the biggest factor. If we can do that,
we'll hold our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Assignment busts have decreased daily during two-a-days, Johnson
said. But coaches remain curious about what will happen when
Bernard (17 tackles, 2 sacks), Edwards (11 tackles) and Flemons (9
tackles) perform together as a group for the first time under game
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be honest. They're not going to play their best career
games the first time out,'' Johnson said. ``But to hit a home run,
you've got to step up to the plate. We'll have a lot better idea
where we stand when this game is over.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, said Johnson, the situation is similar to 1994.
That year, an all-newcomer defensive line opened the season at LSU
and an unheralded performer named Brandon Mitchell registered three
sacks and three tackles for losses in an 18-13 victory. A&AMP;M
finished the season 10-0-1, in large part because of breakthrough
years from Mitchell and nose guard Edward Jasper, who were
considered question marks during fall drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a lot of similarities between this group and that
group,'' Johnson said. ``But I'd say we have more quality depth
now. In the past, we've only been comfortable playing three or four
guys, for the most part. This year, we'll have seven or eight guys
that can play at a pretty high level without a lot of dropoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of that pack are Bernard, Flemons and Edwards. While
outsiders raise questions, they express confidence in each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what kind of abilities we have and I expect us to
surprise some people,'' Flemons said. ``Besides, when you look
around around the locker room, there's no one left. You ask
yourself, `If not me, then who?' That gets you excited to know it's
up to you to produce.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said the Aggies' defensive line has the potential to
rank among the nation's best ``if not by the end of this year, then
by next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard anticipates a quicker introduction to Elite Street. In
his personal version of ``Rocky'', he visualizes recording a couple
of sacks in an upset of Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about it every night before I go to sleep,'' Bernard
said. ``People call us question marks, but I think they're wrong.
We'll be a dominating force by the end of the year. As time goes
on, we'll be recognized as one of the great defensive lines in
college football.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like Rocky Balboa, another former unknown, ultimately
emerged as an American movie icon.

URBAN LEGEND: THE WAY THE COOKIE CRUMBLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Every time the phone rings and the person on the other
end says ``cookie,'' Kitty Broderick just wants to put her head
down on her desk. As the public relations specialist for Neiman
Marcus in Arizona, she has spent years dealing with the fake recipe
legend that refuses to die.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 years, Neiman Marcus has been plagued by this particular
urban legend. Before that, in the mid-1980s or so, the story was
attached to Mrs. Field's Cookies. And long before that, a similar
urban legend about recipe retaliation involved the
Waldorf-Astoria's Red Velvet Cake.
</P>
<P>
   The outline of the Neiman Marcus story exemplifies all three
legends. A woman is dining in a Neiman Marcus restaurant and orders
the cookies for dessert. She likes them so much that she asks for
the recipe. She is told that it costs ``Two-fifty.'' But when her
Visa bill comes later in the month, she is shocked to find a charge
for the recipe for $250, not $2.50. Her lawyer says she must pay
the bill, but in revenge, she gives the recipe to everybody she
knows, and urges them to circulate it, too.
</P>
<P>
   All this is hopelessly, permanently wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't even take Visa,'' Broderick said. ``And we've never
charged for a recipe, ever, in this store or any store. And we
don't make or serve cookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's like the cookie recipe that refuses to die. We can
say it until we're blue in the face, and it turns up on the
Internet and everywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Because this particular urban legend urges people to ``spread
the word,'' there are instances where people have received the
recipe via the Internet from more than one source on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail is the fastest growing cookie-myth spreader,''
Broderick said. ``You look at these e-mails and each has been sent
to hundreds of people. There's no stopping this. It's like a bad
dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the Internet Web sites debunking urban legends
materialized, the major works on urban legends were books by
University of Utah English professor Jan Harold Brunvand. His 1990
``Curses! Broiled Again! The Hottest Urban Legends Going''
theorized that the cookie-recipe hoaxes have their roots in the
Waldorf-Astoria hotel story.
</P>
<P>
   In that one, a woman is billed $1,000 for a recipe for the
hotel's Red Velvet Cake, who gave out the recipe after learning the
hotel chef's ``secret'' ingredient is red food dye.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Neiman Marcus made up a cookie recipe to give out,
``just to be helpful,'' Broderick said. She said she made the
purported recipe once and it wasn't very good.
</P>
<P>
   Broderick is so sick of this myth that she just laughs now, she
said. But her mother called her not long ago to say she attended a
charity auction where one of the items on the block was the Neiman
Marcus Cookie recipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote a letter,'' Broderick said, to tell the group they had
auctioned off a bogus recipe. ``I said, `I hope you got a lot of
money for it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yes. At least $2.50. &QL;

ASSESSING SAMPRAS' NET VALUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pete Sampras has vanquished all comers, and stands as the
unquestioned king of his generation of tennis players.
</P>
<P>
   He has beaten Ivan Lendl and Andre Agassi to win the U.S. Open.
He has beaten Boris Becker to win Wimbledon. He beat the best of
the day when he arrived on the scene as a teen-ager, and he
continues to beat the pretenders to the throne as a 27-year-old
veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Only one foe remains.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras begins the quest for his fifth U.S. Open crown tomorrow
in New York. Across the net will stand flesh-and-blood players, but
if he can defeat them, Sampras will stand face-to-face with the
toughest opponent of them all: history.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Open championship would allow Sampras to stake a claim as
the best ever. It would be his 12th singles title in a Grand Slam
tournament, tying Roy Emerson for the most ever. He is tied with
Rod Laver and Bjorn Borg for second.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll certainly go down as one of the greatest players,'' said
Tony Trabert, who has been involved in tennis as a player, coach
and broadcaster since 1950. ``Whether he'll go down as the best
remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   History will be difficult to conquer. It has the relentless
attack of Laver, the strategy of Bill Tilden, the shotmaking of
John McEnroe, the booming serve of Pancho Gonzalez, the service
return of Jimmy Connors, the endurance and grit of Emerson, the
backcourt game of Borg, the backhand of Ken Rosewall, the strength
of Lew Hoad, the power of Jack Kramer and the work ethic of Ivan
Lendl.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras counters with a pretty good game of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a big serve, first and second,'' Trabert said. ``His
backhand isn't great, but it's good enough. He has a good forehand.
And, like most champions, he doesn't like to lose. He has a
tremendous ability to make a shot when he needs to.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras clearly is a great player.
</P>
<P>
   Is he the greatest?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good question,'' said Brian Gottfried, the French
Open finalist in 1977. ``It is really a different day and age now
than when we were playing and growing up and even the generation
before. Players are different, the equipment is different, the
conditions are different. So I think it's really hard to compare.
You can say one thing and I can say another, and neither is right
or wrong. You can have a good sports discussion, but really it's
just two guys talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who is talking, any discussion of the best ever
will include the same names.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras clearly belongs in the debate. His 11 majors and
five-year reign atop the computer rankings leave no room for
argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Sampras has an amazing amount of talent,'' said
Johan Kriek, a contemporary of Borg, Connors, McEnroe and Lendl.
``To have won that amount of grand slams is amazing. Sampras has
had a tremendous run at the top. He's a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   Laver is also. The 5-foot-8, 145-pound Australian ``Rocket''
twice won the Grand Slam, winning all four of the majors _ the
Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open _ in 1962
and again in '69. Don Budge (1938) is the only other man to win the
Slam.
</P>
<P>
   Laver turned pro after winning the Grand Slam in '62,
effectively locking himself out of the four majors until the open
era dawned in 1968. He won Wimbledon that year, and achieved his
second Slam the next.
</P>
<P>
   Had Laver remained in the amateur ranks, he easily could have
won an unreachable 20 or more Grand Slam titles. But prior to 1968,
pro players were not eligible to compete in the slam events.
</P>
<P>
   The best-ever discussion also must include Emerson, who won more
majors than anyone else. Ten of his 12 came while some of the best
players of his day toiled in the pro ranks, but he did beat Laver
in the final of the U.S. and Australian Opens in '61.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion of the best ever also would have to include ``Big
Bill'' Tilden, who dominated the amateur ranks in the '20s before
turning pro; Kramer, the best player of the '40s; and Gonzalez,
whose resume lacks an abundance of majors only because he turned
pro in 1950 at age 21.
</P>
<P>
   The short list wouldn't be complete without Borg, Connors,
McEnroe and Lendl, the best players from the mid-1970s until the
late-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I played it was Lendl, Borg, McEnroe and Connors,'' said
Kriek, who won the Australian Open in '81 and '82. ``At various
stages these guys dominated.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, one of the arguments against Sampras being the best
ever is the ease with which he has dominated his era. He lacks a
true rival who could challenge his supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect foil for Sampras should have been Andre Agassi, but
injuries and inconsistency have taken his game from giddying
heights to unbelievable depths.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that hurt tennis in the last five years is the
Agassi-Sampras thing never materialized,'' Kriek said. ``Agassi was
on top, then he was gone for a couple of years. When he comes back
and beats Sampras, Sampras has to deal with him. It's probably
something that could work on his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The other argument against Sampras is he never has won the
French Open, the only major played on clay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think he'll be the best ever, others say he's
never won on clay,'' said Trabert, who won five titles in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The other knock against Sampras is he isn't always at his best
in non-major tournaments _ he was booed for a lack of effort in
losing in a U.S. Open warm-up in New Haven, Conn. _ and his
conditioning isn't the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure he's in good enough shape to win the U.S. Open,''
Trabert said. ``I wish he worked harder off the court so he'd be
more fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, his results clearly stamp him as an all-time great.
</P>
<P>
   But best ever?
</P>
<P>
   As in most of these debates _ Jack Nicklaus or Arnold Palmer?
Muhammad Ali or Joe Louis? Michael Jordan or Magic Johnson? Willie
Mays or Babe Ruth? _ there can't be a clear answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players all have strengths and they all have weaknesses,''
Gottfried said. ``You look at Sampras, and he's got a weakness. You
look at Laver, and he had a weakness. If they played each other,
how would they get around their weakness? The great players find
ways to get to their strengths at critical points in the match. How
would they do that against each other?''
</P>
<P>
   That remains the unanswered question.

URBAN LEGEND: THE WAY THE COOKIE CRUMBLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Every time the phone rings and the person on the other
end says ``cookie,'' Kitty Broderick just wants to put her head
down on her desk. As the public relations specialist for Neiman
Marcus in Arizona, she has spent years dealing with the fake recipe
legend that refuses to die.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 years, Neiman Marcus has been plagued by this particular
urban legend. Before that, in the mid-1980s or so, the story was
attached to Mrs. Field's Cookies. And long before that, a similar
urban legend about recipe retaliation involved the
Waldorf-Astoria's Red Velvet Cake.
</P>
<P>
   The outline of the Neiman Marcus story exemplifies all three
legends. A woman is dining in a Neiman Marcus restaurant and orders
the cookies for dessert. She likes them so much that she asks for
the recipe. She is told that it costs ``Two-fifty.'' But when her
Visa bill comes later in the month, she is shocked to find a charge
for the recipe for $250, not $2.50. Her lawyer says she must pay
the bill, but in revenge, she gives the recipe to everybody she
knows, and urges them to circulate it, too.
</P>
<P>
   All this is hopelessly, permanently wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't even take Visa,'' Broderick said. ``And we've never
charged for a recipe, ever, in this store or any store. And we
don't make or serve cookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's like the cookie recipe that refuses to die. We can
say it until we're blue in the face, and it turns up on the
Internet and everywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Because this particular urban legend urges people to ``spread
the word,'' there are instances where people have received the
recipe via the Internet from more than one source on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail is the fastest growing cookie-myth spreader,''
Broderick said. ``You look at these e-mails and each has been sent
to hundreds of people. There's no stopping this. It's like a bad
dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the Internet Web sites debunking urban legends
materialized, the major works on urban legends were books by
University of Utah English professor Jan Harold Brunvand. His 1990
``Curses! Broiled Again! The Hottest Urban Legends Going''
theorized that the cookie-recipe hoaxes have their roots in the
Waldorf-Astoria hotel story.
</P>
<P>
   In that one, a woman is billed $1,000 for a recipe for the
hotel's Red Velvet Cake, who gave out the recipe after learning the
hotel chef's ``secret'' ingredient is red food dye.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Neiman Marcus made up a cookie recipe to give out,
``just to be helpful,'' Broderick said. She said she made the
purported recipe once and it wasn't very good.
</P>
<P>
   Broderick is so sick of this myth that she just laughs now, she
said. But her mother called her not long ago to say she attended a
charity auction where one of the items on the block was the Neiman
Marcus Cookie recipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote a letter,'' Broderick said, to tell the group they had
auctioned off a bogus recipe. ``I said, `I hope you got a lot of
money for it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yes. At least $2.50. &QL;

RUNDOWN? NOT COWBOYS' EMMITT SMITH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith choked down a
bowl of cereal, then finished off his training-camp dinner with two
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the Midwestern State University dining hall with its
pasta bar and deli depot must have offered more fitting fare for a
three-time NFL rushing champ. Certainly the workhorse of the
Cowboys running game, in his ninth NFL season, must need more
substantial replenishing after two-a-days in the searing Wichita
Falls heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you seen the food here?'' Smith asked.
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing is, Emmitt Smith never gave his dubious diet a
second thought. He is not in a refueling mode despite public
contention Emmitt is low on fuel after a second consecutive
sub-Smith season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lying to say it hasn't been frustrating,'' said Smith,
who limped through a 1997 season that ended with 1,074 yards
rushing (second-lowest in his career) and career-lows of two
100-yard-plus games and four touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you don't become a three-time rushing champion by being a
fluke,'' he continued. ``There is a lot of character and
determination that goes into it. People criticized me before I came
in, saying I was too small and all that. I've been here before. I
got plenty of gas left in my tank and tread on my tires. Don't
think I can't do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Underneath the bells and whistles of Cowboys coach Chan Gailey's
new offense, which features five-receiver sets and the shotgun
formation, the Cowboys' plan to move the football is founded on the
principle of a strong ground game. Despite the off-season addition
of former Pro Bowl running back Chris Warren from Seattle, the
Cowboys are counting on Smith to carry the load.
</P>
<P>
   Healthy and spiritually content after rededicating his life to
Christianity last season, Smith said he is ready to prove to his
critics the wear and tear of more than 2,500 career carries have
not left him run down. Smith said there is no merit to accusations
his high number of rushing attempts have taken a toll on him just
as they did legendary Houston Oilers bruiser Earl Campbell, who
experienced a sharp decline at the end of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think there has been a dark cloud over my head the past
two years,'' said Smith, a native of Pensacola, Fla. ``Behind every
dark cloud there is sun. The key is enduring through the dark
cloud. When the sun comes out, there is going to be a new day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys coaches contend Smith can regain the form that
enabled him to top the 1,400-yard season-rushing total five
consecutive years. Like Smith, they blame his diminished output on
the erosion of the Cowboys offensive line and the team's stale
offensive attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of circumstances to Emmitt not having the
year we're all accustomed to Emmitt having,'' said Gailey, who
replaced Barry Switzer as head coach in the off-season and
installed a new offensive attack. ``To put it all on Emmitt, and
say he's down the tubes, that's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey didn't come to that conclusion lightly. He and running
backs coach Clarence Shelmon analyzed Smith's game tapes from 1997
and determined he had the physical tools necessary to be a major
contributor.
</P>
<P>
   Shelmon said Smith has been the victim of his own success and
few players could duplicate the numbers he put up on a yearly
basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't hit the wall in my mind,'' said Shelmon, who coached
running backs in Seattle last season. ``Any player that plays that
long, there will be certain amount of wear and tear. By the same
token, from what I saw in his play, there is enough burst, enough
vision, enough instincts that he could still be one of the best
backs in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' offensive line for 1998 seems to be improved over
last season because of the off-season signing of guard Everett
McIver, the weight reduction of guard Nate Newton, the addition of
rookie Flozell Adams and the return of fullback Daryl Johnston, who
missed the bulk of last season with a neck injury.
</P>
<P>
   Also key in the Cowboys' assessment of Smith is the new running
scheme in Gailey's offense. The Cowboys' offense is based on zone
blocking, rather than man blocking as in the past. This will
require Smith to be more patient and run more instinctively.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, I've been so accustomed to power football,''
Smith said. ``I would hit the hole and take everything I see. This
offense forces me to let things develop and set things up more. I
have confidence I can succeed in this style. I'm not fast but I got
good vision and some shakes.''
</P>
<P>
   So far so good. In his only significant playing time of the
preseason, Smith rushed 12 times for 110 yards and a touchdown in
the first half against the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   The preseason also proved to be the testing ground for another
Cowboys addition _ running back Warren. Though confident in Smith,
Gailey said the Cowboys needed to bring in another running back in
place of Smith's former backup, Sherman Williams.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Gailey has maintained Warren was brought in
to complement Smith by lessening his load. Gailey said Smith would
be the starter and Warren would be the third-down back and relieve
Smith when tired.
</P>
<P>
   However, Smith's two-year decline, Warren's stature as one of
the league's top runners and his relationship with his former
Seattle coach and friend Shelmon fueled preseason speculation
Warren was here to replace Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Smith admitted he was initially surprised when the Cowboys
signed Warren, 30, who in eight seasons in Seattle rushed for 6,706
yards and 44 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be tripping and lying if I said it didn't raise my
eyebrows,'' Smith said. ``But I had the feeling it was going to
happen because of the closeness with him and Clarence. It's easy to
think that Clarence might cut for Chris. But I try not to allow
myself to think like that. I understand they are close. But from my
understanding, it's my job unless I get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelmon said his relationship with Warren won't impact on-field
decisions. Warren, who said Shelmon was the reason he came to the
Cowboys, added there is no way he could supplant Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to spell Emmitt and be the third-down guy,'' Warren
said. ``I don't see me coming to take anybody's job. I know my role
and I accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Cowboys owner Jerry Jones signed Warren, he said he
envisioned it as an opportunity to be smarter about how the Cowboys
used Smith and to prolong his career. That was originally the plan
with a healthy Warren, but the running back now is expected to miss
four to six weeks with a strained groin. If Warren can return
sometime soon, it could lead to big returns for Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been a legitimate debate to whether Emmitt's been
overused,'' Jones said. ``People have always questioned whether we
should be using him as much as we have. The name of the game is
managing his time, so we have the best of Emmitt at the right
juncture of the season and hopefully extend his career in the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever he does run out, Smith said he is prepared. And though
he said the past couple of years have been a struggle because he's
seen the true side of people who have abandoned him during the down
times, he said he's better for the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's opened my eyes,'' Smith said. ``You find out quickly who
is truly behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, one of three Cowboys who were baptized along with
cornerback Deion Sanders after a game last season, said he's
endured because he's leaned on his faith and allowed his
relationship with Christ to take over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has allowed me to see things differently in stressful
times,'' Smith said. ``I think that helped me out a great deal. I
found great comfort in my faith rather than try to figure things
out for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   What Smith no longer is trying to figure out is where he fits in
history among NFL running backs and how he will end his career.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered a threat to break Walter Payton's NFL rushing
record of 16,726 yards, Smith is a longshot after the past two
subpar seasons that have left him at 11,234 yards and needing
another five 1,000-yard-plus seasons to catch Payton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a distant goal, but I'm nowhere close to it,'' Smith
said. ``I'm going to take it one day at a time, one year at a time.
If I get closer to it, then it becomes a real goal again.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith can make a run at some other high-water marks. With 1,079
yards rushing, he would break into the NFL's all-time top five.
With 12 rushing touchdowns, he would eclipse Marcus Allen's NFL
career record of 123. And with 803 yards, he would supplant Hall of
Famer Tony Dorsett as the team's all-time leader rusher.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith said he won't hang around just to try to break the
record if he's not being productive. He said he would like to play
out the remaining five years on his contract and finish his career
as a Cowboy. However, considering that he is expected to earn $25
million in base salary over the next five years, the salary cap
situation and the fact that the Cowboys might go through a
rebuilding process, Smith said anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Still baffled his toughness was questioned last season after
bruised ribs and other injuries forced him from four games when
they ``didn't question it when my arm was hanging off against the
Giants in 1993,'' Smith said nothing would surprise him. He rushed
for 168 yards in that game, despite playing the entire second half
with a separated shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't rule out anything,'' Smith said. ``Maybe the Cowboys
might want to make a major change. I would love to finish out my
career here. But I'm not going to be a fool and think it's a
guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said if the Cowboys decided to go in another direction and
he wasn't ready to quit he would consider playing somewhere in his
home state of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how it turns out this year or in the future, Smith
said he's at peace with himself and his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not content,'' Smith said. ``I would like to get another
1,500 or 1,600-yard season. But the main thing I want to do is do
my job and keep getting better. I know I've given my all to the
Cowboys. As long as continue to do that, I can look in the mirror
and say, `Job well done, you have run your race, you have finished
your course.'''

SELE, RODRIGUEZ LIFT RANGERS PAST WHITE SOX, 5-3
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Two starting pitchers found themselves in deep trouble
in the sixth inning yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers starter Aaron Sele found a way to keep the Chicago White
Sox from scoring. White Sox pitcher Mike Sirotka couldn't do the
same, then blamed his defense afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Sele's fortitude proved the difference in a hard-fought
nationally televised game that the Rangers won, 5-3, at Comiskey
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Sirotka had a 3-1 lead going to the sixth, but the Rangers
rallied by putting together some intense at-bats and went ahead on
Ivan Rodriguez's three-run homer. Sele kept them in front by
striking out three consecutive hitters after walking Frank Thomas
and giving up a single to Albert Belle to start the Chicago sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaron turned it up a notch, got ahead of the hitters and put
them away,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Sele has done that lately while winning his past three starts.
He also did that early in the season with an 11-4 start that put
him on the American League All-Star team. However, during a
nine-game, midsummer slump, Sele lost six of eight decisions
because he couldn't pitch out of trouble. The Rangers, who trail
Anaheim by two games in the AL West, couldn't afford another lapse
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``For everything people have said about the way I've been
pitching, it just seems like I've been one pitch away a lot of
times and haven't been able to make that pitch,'' Sele said. ``It
just a case of you have to keep trying to make quality pitches. You
can do that sometimes, sometimes you can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele did yesterday after surviving a rough first inning in which
the White Sox scored their three runs. Sele got the trouble started
when he dropped a short flip from first baseman Will Clark on Mike
Caruso's one-out grounder. Doubles by Thomas, Belle and Ventura
then gave the White Sox a 3-0 lead. It could have been worse but
the defense rescued Sele.
</P>
<P>
   After Greg Norton struck out, Magglio Ordonez lined a single to
left. Rusty Greer charged the ball hard then made a strong throw to
the plate. Ventura beat the throw, but Rodriguez blocked the plate
and made the tag for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that was a big play,'' Rodriguez said. ``Rusty made a
great throw, a nice one bounce and that gave me time to block the
plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele took it from there, allowing only two hits and two walks
during the next seven innings. The only trouble was in the sixth,
but he struck out Ventura, Norton and Ordonez. Ordonez was 8-for-9
this season against Sele before that strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed him to turn it around after the first,'' Oates said.
``We needed some innings from him. You couldn't ask anything more
from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele said his goal was to keep it close, ``because you know our
offense just needs time.''
</P>
<P>
   That proved true in the top of the sixth. Sirotka had held the
Rangers to four hits through five innings, but Mark McLemore led
off with a blooper to left that fell in front of Belle. Greer then
reached on a one-out infield single, a grounder into the right side
hole that second baseman Ray Durham knocked down with a diving
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Sirotka thought both balls should have been outs, a debatable
point each time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sele had all the plays made for him,'' Sirotka said afterward.
``When you give extra outs to a team like that, it's going to
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   That part was true. Juan Gonzalez worked the count full and
lined a single to left that drove in McLemore. Will Clark also
singled to left, but Belle got to the ball quickly and threw out
Greer trying to score.
</P>
<P>
   However that was only a temporary reprieve for Sirotka.
Rodriguez dug out a low curveball and smacked it over the
left-field wall to give the Rangers a 5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was only one pitch that I'd take back, and that was the
one to'' Rodriguez, Sirotka said. ``It was still a pretty good
pitch. We just couldn't quite make the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele needed no such excuses.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Most visitors to this city's teeming, colorful
Chinatown would probably never notice Hang Ah Alley. A concrete
corridor between a restaurant and a playground, it looks like
nothing more than a broad, tidy sidewalk, spruced up with a few
adolescent trees and several new wooden benches.
</P>
<P>
   But those trees and benches, along with several informational
legends carved into the immaculately polished pavement, signal the
recently completed renovation of the passageway, the first of 31
alleys in Chinatown scheduled to get face lifts over the next few
years with $2.9 million of city money.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to make over the alleys reflects the constant
efforts, marked by enduring angst, to keep Chinatown, San
Francisco's second most popular tourist destination, at once
authentic and accessible, historic and modern, redolent of
tradition without being petrified in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two decades, Chinatown has changed slowly but
surely, in small increments that have yielded big results. Its
architecture and adornments have in many ways grown less
flamboyantly distinctive _ the golden, curled eaves on the corners
of buildings less prominent, the individualized woodwork and tile
patterns on the facades of many stores less common.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic, glass, economy and efficiency have challenged, if not
quite usurped, showmanship. And relentless tourism has wrought the
same effect on Chinatown that it has on Fisherman's Wharf, San
Francisco's most popular destination for visitors, which lies just
a few miles away.
</P>
<P>
   In both places, what began as a working neighborhood devoted to
a particular enterprise or ethnicity has been homogenized, at least
in part, into an all-purpose visitors' bazaar, rife with T-shirts
and trinkets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just all mumble-jumbled,'' said Enid Lim, a longtime
resident. ``The food markets have moved to the fringes, and the
merchandise that the shops in the center are selling is schlocky.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lim belongs to the Chinatown Community Development Center, a
group trying to steer the future of Chinatown in a direction that
respects its past. The alleys are one of the group's projects, and
they represent the nexis of historic preservation and contemporary
adaptation.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the alley project is designed to restore to use
a network of commercial passageways, lined by tiny shops with doors
but no display windows, that were traditionally as vital to many
Chinatown residents as the major avenues.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the project gives a nod to the interests of
tourists, festooning the alleys with historical lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hang Ah means fragrant in Chinese,'' explains the carved
letters on one of a series of legends that a person walks over
while traversing Hang Ah Alley. The alley got this name, the legend
explains, ``when a German chemist opened a perfumery.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the alley renovation has been greeted with almost
unanimous approval, other bids at historic preservation have not
always been so popular. For example, attempts over the last two
decades to have Chinatown declared a historic district failed, in
large part because many merchants, property owners and developers
worried about building restrictions and other rules that would
impede profitability.
</P>
<P>
   That opposition shone a light on an ongoing tension in
Chinatown: Is it best served by letting it adapt to market forces,
the way other neighborhoods do _ or by conserving its more
individual characteristics?
</P>
<P>
   Philip Choy, another longtime Chinatown resident, said that too
much conservation was an impediment, an insult of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like saying we're people in this little artificial zoo
for visitors to see,'' Choy said. He added that he used the word
artificial because what is commonly perceived as traditionally
Chinese about Chinatown's architecture is, in fact, an invention to
please outsiders. ``It was never really Chinese in the first
place,'' he said. ``It was pseudo-Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Choy and other historians of Chinatown noted that most
of the brightly lighted pagodas and fancifully detailed buildings
were constructed after the 1906 earthquake, in a calculated attempt
by Chinese residents to stave off city officials' plans to move
them out of the city center. The idea was to create a neighborhood
so appealing and idiosyncratic that no one would want to dismantle
it.
</P>
<P>
   But time, tourism and soaring real estate values around San
Francisco's Financial District, which threatens to encroach on
Chinatown, have done some of what city officials at the turn of the
century could not. In a few cases, small stores have ceded their
lots to office towers; in other cases, the Chinese stationery store
with its ornate bronze door, or the Chinese grocer with his
pungent, savory offerings, has been replaced by the glass-walled
electronics shop.
</P>
<P>
   Those changes sit uneasily with many of the estimated 15,000
residents of Chinatown, about 85 percent of whom are Chinese.
``Chinatown is not just for tourists,'' said Rose Pak, a consultant
to the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. ``It's still for living. The
question is how can we maintain the character and integrity of
Chinatown while keeping it functional?''

NEBRASKA DUMPS LOUISIANA TECH, 56-27
</HEADLINE>

By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. _ Frank Solich conceded that he was relieved to
finally get his first game as a head coach out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   File this debut under ``successful but shaky.'' Nebraska's
offense appears healthy, but its defense might need some help.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska made Solich a winner with a 56-27 triumph against
Louisiana Tech in the Eddie Robinson Classic yesterday. However,
the Bulldogs rolled up 590 yards passing and wide receiver Troy
Edwards set an NCAA record with 405 receiving yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only interested in the win,'' Solich said when learning of
Louisiana Tech's gaudy statistics. ``For a first game, it was OK.
I'm satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   After 25 years, Tom Osborne wasn't on the sidelines for a
Nebraska game. He was not in attendance, preferring to take care of
``personal business'' rather than serve as a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska's first play under Solich, a former Cornhuskers
fullback, was pure vanilla. Two tight ends, I formation, fullback
Joel Mackovicka up the middle for 12 yards. Solich had joked that
his first play call would be a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   He saved that for the third play. Sophomore quarterback Bobby
Newcombe hit tight end Sheldon Jackson down the middle for a
46-yard touchdown. It took the Cornhuskers 39 seconds to score
their first 1998 touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the first quarter, Nebraska had 174 yards to
Louisiana Tech's 14. When the Bulldogs scored their first touchdown
to make it 21-6, Nebraska responded with a 99-yard kickoff return
by Joe Walker of Lamar High School.
</P>
<P>
   But in the second half, Louisiana Tech's throw-it-every-time
offense started to wear out the Cornhuskers in the 90-degree heat.
Quarterback Tim Rattay was 46-of-68 for 590 yards and four
touchdowns; Edwards had 21 receptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They passed all over us in the second half,'' defensive end
Chad Kelsay said. ``Rattay gets the ball off fast and with that
three-step drop, we had trouble getting any pressure on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Newcombe was impressive in his first start. He completed nine of
10 passes for 168 yards and was solid running the option. And
sophomore I-back Correll Buckhalter had 143 yards rushing and two
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers totaled 462 yards, a typical day at the offense.
But that paled when compared to the work of the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   Solich described the second half as ``sloppy.'' Nebraska went to
the locker room with a 35-6 lead, but the expected 50-point rout
never developed. Edwards' three long touchdowns in the second half
kept the 76,021 at Memorial Stadium/Tom Osborne Field uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A win's a win,'' Kelsay said. ``But we've got a lot of work to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of it on the defensive side.

INSTEAD OF PLAYING OUT DREAM, FRESHMAN JILTED BY TCU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JEFF SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The TCU baseball cap Brian Brookhart once
wore lies abandoned in the corner of his bedroom. The picture of
him sitting on the TCU Superfrog's lap at his fourth birthday party
also has been discarded.
</P>
<P>
   However, Brookhart hasn't found a way to erase the picture in
his Crowley High School yearbook of his sister, Ashlie, and him
wearing TCU sweatshirts. Even more painful is the caption that
reads, ``Go Frogs.''
</P>
<P>
   While Brookhart is able to rid himself of each physical reminder
of his lifelong love affair with TCU, the mental images linger. The
memories of a nightmare that began 17 days ago, one day before
Brookhart was to register for classes and officially begin living
his dream of playing college basketball for his hometown school.
The day it was suggested to him by assistant coach Brian Fish that
he'd be better off not coming to TCU this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the perfect story and that day, the dream just went
away,'' says Ashlie, a TCU senior who was a cheerleader for the
men's basketball team for two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Brookhart, 18, now a part-time TCU student looking to
transfer, had his dream swept away by the cold reality of Division
I athletics, where education and the ``college experience'' often
lose out to athletic interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd graduate from TCU with a good education and some
great memories from playing basketball, but I guess I've had my
first experience with how the real world works,'' Brian says.
</P>
<P>
   The experience has angered the Brookhart family and left the TCU
coaching staff red-faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I underestimated how important being at TCU right away was to
him,'' Fish says. ``It wasn't about academics or trying to ruin his
dream, I was just trying to be honest. I gave him my advice that a
junior college would speed up the progress of his game. I feel bad
for Brian and I feel bad for myself. I've been sick about the whole
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Billy Tubbs, who was out of town when the first
meeting with Brookhart and Fish took place, takes responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for Brian, but we were just suggesting a junior
college would be best for him. When we signed him, I knew he wasn't
an impact player, but in a few years, I thought he could make a
contribution. ... Looking back, I wish I could've talked with him,
but once his father stepped in and went above our heads, there was
nothing I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Brookhart's father, Pete, disagrees, saying Tubbs should have
rectified the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think all programs work like this but the system
allows people to manipulate it,'' he said. ``I hold Mr. Tubbs
accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   When he signed a scholarship with TCU last November, Brookhart
had no doubt the next four years would be the most memorable of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't expect to be a star, at least not right away. He spent
the summer working out virtually every day, trying to add weight
and muscle to his slender frame. A good student, he wanted to earn
his bachelor's degree in business and pursue a master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   After an early morning haircut Aug. 13, he stopped by the
family's house in the Overton South section of Fort Worth. His
mother, Joanne _ who received her master's degree from TCU in 1987
_ informed him Fish had called and asked for Brian to stop by the
office that afternoon. Brookhart was about to depart for the first
day of freshman orientation. Since Fish was the coach responsible
for recruiting Brookhart for TCU, Brookhart said he thought nothing
of Fish's request.
</P>
<P>
   Brookhart arrived in Fish's office around 1 p.m. and noticed
Fish was speaking to someone from Collin County Community College.
After he hung up, Fish told Brookhart he needed to talk about the
upcoming season. Fish explained that Brookhart could do one of two
things, either enroll in a junior college _ Fish's suggestion was
Collin County _ or redshirt his freshman season and receive little
or no practice time with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Players who redshirt, or sit out a season without losing
eligibility, typically practice with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that with Lee Nailon not going to the NBA like we
expected that everyone would move down the depth chart at the
`five' position and that a junior college would allow him to become
a better player,'' says Fish, who admits he would have chosen
different words were he allowed to have the discussion again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't understand,'' Brookhart says. ``They told me during
the recruiting process that redshirting was a possibility, and that
was fine with me, but this really shocked me. I didn't know what to
do. Why would I go to a junior college when I didn't have to?''
</P>
<P>
   At the time Brookhart gave his oral commitment to TCU in
October, several other Division I schools had offered him
scholarships. If he had waited for the spring signing period, he
undoubtedly would have gotten more offers. The 6-foot-10, 215-pound
center helped lead Crowley to a school-record 23 victories while
averaging 17 points and nine rebounds per game.
</P>
<P>
   From that first conversation, events unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling TCU didn't want him and knowing he wouldn't get practice
time, Brookhart discussed the situation with his family. He decided
not to register at TCU as scheduled on Friday. His father,
meanwhile, wanted answers as to why, on the eve of the school year,
TCU wanted Brian to attend a junior college. He put in phone calls
to athletic director Eric Hyman, Chancellor Michael Ferrari and
Tubbs.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Brookhart was assured Brian's scholarship would be
honored, but if Brian wanted to transfer, he would be forced to sit
out the 1999-2000 season because of NCAA rules. If Brookhart
remained at TCU as a full-time student _ even if he wasn't involved
with the basketball team _ he would be under a basketball
scholarship, meaning NCAA rules would prevent him from playing
elsewhere next season.
</P>
<P>
   Another option was not enrolling and looking elsewhere for a
scholarship. But Brian didn't want to fall behind academically and
his parents had not prepared for paying their son's college
education this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman offered a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   TCU would grant Brian a release from his basketball scholarship
and Brian could attend TCU as a part-time student this fall and
possibly next spring. He would get his tuition and books paid for
using non-athletic department funds, which is legal according to
NCAA rules. By taking only nine hours of classes, Brookhart would
be eligible to play basketball anywhere during the 1999-2000
season.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't make Brookhart happy, but, after talking with his
family, he agreed it was his best option. At least he would get
some schooling paid for and retain his options to play basketball
next season at a Division I school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met with the Brookhart family last week and I understood
their concerns,'' Ferrari said. ``I am disappointed how this
particular instance was handled and think it would have been more
effective and appropriate if Brian's options were presented to him
at an earlier time. Coach Tubbs also should have been there for
that first meeting and I have spoken to him and my athletic
director about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyman refers to the episode as a ``misunderstanding between the
basketball staff and the Brookhart family.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Brookhart has not spoken to Tubbs since before his meeting
with Fish. He said he will not follow the Frogs this season, except
for looking for how his friends do in the box score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blame the system and the individual,'' Brian says. ``It's
the system's fault because if it had done its job, this wouldn't
have been able to happen and it's the individual's fault because if
(Tubbs) didn't want this to happen, it wouldn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   In choosing his new school, Brookhart says he'll do more
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to say that I wouldn't look back on this when the
recruiting process starts again, but I know that I'll be more
careful to look into how things work at each school and how they
treat their players.''
</P>
<P>
   Now only if the Superfrog would make one final visit _ this one
into Brookhart's closet _ and take the remaining TCU memorabilia.
Then there would be nothing left.
</P>
<P>
   They've already taken his heart.

FORTUNATELY, TOM HICKS DOESN'T FIT THE MOLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Concerned about the Texas Rangers? You are not alone. So is Tom
Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   Excited about the Dallas Stars? Then join Tom Hicks in eager
anticipation of another NHL season.
</P>
<P>
   Heard the rumor about Hicks preparing to also buy the Dallas
Mavericks? Not so quick there. Actually, he and Junior Perot are
even on civil terms these days.
</P>
<P>
   But now for a personal note. As a jock-world franchise owner,
Hicks continues to be bad for business _ my kind of business.
</P>
<P>
   Sports-page columnists of this era greatly depend on rich-guy
team owners like Hicks to provide us with an easy work day. Just
sit back, wait, watch and listen. A juicy column, heavy on rip
jobs, will eventually be dropped right into your lap-top.
</P>
<P>
   Know what I mean, Mr. Jones?
</P>
<P>
   Or as the late great Burt Hawkins once said of a former Rangers'
owner, ``he runs his company with brainpower and his baseball team
with ego. How can he be that smart, yet not smart enough to know
the difference?''
</P>
<P>
   But thus far _ and I do stress ``thus far'' _ Hicks has defied
the stereotype, the logic, the whole package of what normally
happens when the highly successful businessman ventures into sports
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of waiting, watching and listening, that has been the
Hicks method. He's going on three years as owner of the Stars, and
three months as the official owner of the Rangers. Hicks stays
plugged in, but he also stays out of the way. What happens with
most owners in sports is they become fans, and they start to think
like fans, and throw around their opinions like fans. The next
thing you know, the owner is saying he's in charge of everything,
even socks and jocks.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, so far, stops way short. He's a hockey fan and a baseball
fan. Large-time. For that matter, he's also a football and
basketball fan. But beyond that, he waits, watches and listens to
the Bob Gaineys, the Ken Hitchcocks, the Doug Melvins, the Johnny
Oates.
</P>
<P>
   According to his baseball and hockey people, they know the hard
questions are coming when they privately go to Hicks with an
``idea.'' That usually means, of course, an idea that involves
spending more money. Provide all the right answers for Hicks, and
...
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull happens. The Rangers' trading deadline deal of a
month ago happens. A much-needed bouncer for the Stars happens.
Additional payroll expense happens. Locally, Hicks continues to
expand his reputation as a whatever-it-takes-to-win owner.
</P>
<P>
   But before departing Sunday morning for a business trip to South
America, Hicks was asked to comment on a variety of sports-related
topics.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his answers:
</P>
<P>
   On the Rangers' divisional race: ``Yeah, I'm a little concerned.
We certainly have our lapses when it comes to what seems to be
mental toughness. Defense, pitching, timely hitting _ every area
has been affected. But let this last month play out, and let's see
where we are. A lot is going to depend on how we do between now and
the end of September.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Hicks already looking ahead and planning for next season?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Do the plans include pitching help?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he repeated.
</P>
<P>
   On the buying the Mavericks rumor: ``I don't think it's a secret
I tried to buy the team once before,'' Hicks said. ``Ross and I at
one time even tried to find a way to have joint ownership. But
things have gone in a different direction since. I'm very happy
with that direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working with Ross on the new arena, that's gone real well.
Hillwood \RPerot's company\S is the developer and they are doing a
great job. From what I see, this will be the best indoor arena in
the country, plus the development around the arena is going to be
something that benefits Dallas and the whole area.''
</P>
<P>
   On last week's signing of Brent Severyn as the Stars'
long-awaited tough guy: ``We absolutely had to have that,'' said
Hicks. ``In player personnel, it was the last piece of the puzzle.
Now, will everything fit into a team thing? I can't wait until we
get started so we can find out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the future, it would not be a surprise if Hicks adds the
Mavericks to his ownership cartel. But of more immediate interest
will be the baseball off-season, no matter if the current Rangers
win a divisional title or not. Remember, Hicks didn't officially
take over the baseball team until June.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks has financed the Stars into a championship-caliber team,
and he has even more reason to do so with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Above all else, however, Hicks has also taken the poison out of
newspaper pens. Whatever he's done, he's done it right.

TCU READY FOR SEASON-OPENER AGAINST IOWA STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERRANCE HARRIS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ After nearly three weeks and more practices
than he cares to count, TCU offensive tackle Michael Keathley is
ready for something different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a nice change to get after some new people,''
he said. ``We've worked hard, and we've pushed each other like you
wouldn't believe in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like we're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU coach Dennis Franchione has the same inkling but says he
can't be certain until Saturday, when the Horned Frogs travel to
Iowa State for their season opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we are ready to play a game, but we're ready
to find out though,'' Franchione said. ``We're probably at a point
where we have to play a game to really get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a 1-10 season, the Frogs had plenty of room to
improve but also had several questions to answer. With only four
days of practice left before the season opener, here is how the
coaching staff has addressed many of the pressing issues they faced
heading into two-a-days:
</P>
<P>
   The staff appears to have settled on a starting offensive line
for the opener, with tackles Keathley and Russ Sanders, guards
Robert Wallace and Jeff Millican, and center Shane Ladewig.
Redshirt freshman guard Victor Payne had been an early favorite to
start, but a turf-toe injury sidelined him much of two-a-days.
Senior Greg Davis should vie for a starting job once his one-year
suspension is completed after the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Converted receiver Patrick Batteaux will be the Horned Frogs'
starting quarterback. His speed, quickness and understanding of the
offense gave him an edge in spring practice, and he never let the
others catch up. Two-year starter Jeff Dover and Kevin Colon are
battling for the backup spot.
</P>
<P>
   An injury to senior linebacker Cody Mortensen has prolonged the
battle for the starting inside linebacker job. Sophomore Shannon
Brazzell has performed admirably in Mortensen's place, and the
coaching must choose the starter opposite senior Joseph Phipps.
</P>
<P>
   In the defensive backfield, only the strong safety spot remains
unresolved. Sophomore Russell Gary has looked good since Eric
Anderson went down with a career-ending neck injury. Gary is
competing with Barry Browning, who seemed to bounce back this week
from nagging injuries and a change from cornerback to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione has said he would like to redshirt all of his
freshmen, but he won't this season. Tight end B.J. Roberts could
start the season opener depending on the offense's first alignment.
Former Wyatt star Jason Goss has made the transition from receiver
to defensive back smoothly this summer and will compete for time,
and Frank Montgomery or LaTarence Dunbar should emerge as the third
tailback. Joey Biasatti from Burleson is set to handle the kickoff
duties.

TITLE SERIES REDUCES PRESSURE AT KICKOFF CLASSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Some years, Florida State coach Bobby
Bowden admits, he has turned a deaf ear to promoters seeking to
include his Seminoles in a high-profile contest to open the college
football season.
</P>
<P>
   But not this year. With the inaugural Bowl Championship Series a
reality in January, Bowden said some of the risk has been removed
from rolling the dice against a fellow heavyweight in August.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason Bowden agreed to bring his second-ranked
Seminoles to Giants Stadium for Monday's 7 p.m. meeting with No. 14
Texas A&AMP;M in the 16th annual Kickoff Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever loses this game still has a chance to win the national
championship,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden bases that belief on the advent of the Bowl Championship
Series, which will use a four-part formula to match the top two
teams in college football Jan. 4 in the Fiesta Bowl. Part of the
formula is strength of schedule, which both teams will be enhancing
Monday by squaring off on national television.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the year, there's a good chance that everyone
might have a loss,'' Bowden said. ``With them matching No. 1
against No. 2, you're still in the running, even if you lose. Plus,
you've played an extra game against a quality team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year we won the national championship (1993) was the last
time we played in a game like this. We were 12-1 and Notre Dame was
11-1. At the end of the year, that one extra game can make the
difference. People see that and think a 12-1 might be better than
an 11-1. That's the plus side.''
</P>
<P>
   The downside is a history that shows the Kickoff Classic has
hardly been a springboard to glory for the team that loses. While
all of the game's 15 winners _ including two national champions _
went on to earn spots in the final rankings released by The
Associated Press, only four teams that lost the Kickoff Classic
were in the Top 25 at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the past eight teams to begin the season with a loss in
Giants Stadium have been shut out at the ballot box in January.
That tends to shoot holes in Bowden's theory that Monday's loser
will remain in the national championship hunt. But Bowden insists
the Bowl Championship Series provides a safety net unavailable to
previous participants.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said he has not spent much time
pondering the championship implications for his team, win or lose
against the Seminoles. As a two-touchdown underdog, he is more
interested in making sure the Aggies remain on an even keel after
the contest, regardless of the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a lot of downside for us, no matter what happens.
No one is going to be shocked if we lose,'' Slocum said. ``But if
we win, we have a considerable upside. It would be a huge lift for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   That stands in marked contrast to 1996, when A&AMP;M opened the
season with a 41-37 loss to Brigham Young in the Pigskin Classic.
The Aggies ``rebounded'' three weeks later with a
confidence-shattering loss against Southwestern Louisiana, 29-22,
and stumbled home at 6-6.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum said a shorter break between games (A&AMP;M plays again Sept.
12) and a more mature nucleus of players should prevent a repeat of
the team's 1996 collapse if his team falls in another August
matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're further along mentally than we were two years ago,''
Slocum said. ``There's not a fragile nature about this team. We're
not going to roll out there and be in awe of Florida State. No
matter what happens, we're not going to get killed off by these
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M linebacker Dat Nguyen agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team we had two years ago wasn't nearly as focused as the
one we have now,'' said Nguyen, a fifth-year senior and four-year
starter. ``What happened against BYU, there's not a danger of that
happening again. We're not going to let one game ruin our season.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor would they let a victory swell their egos, quarterback
Branndon Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing this game for the challenge,'' Stewart said.
``When people talk about the top five teams in college football, we
want our name thrown in there. And right now, it's not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until you beat a big-name team, people won't talk about you or
vote you very high in the polls. And once you beat somebody good,
you've got to be able to follow it up and be consistent or they'll
forget about you real quick.''
</P>
<P>
   National-championship ramifications, at this juncture, seem
premature to A&AMP;M coaches and players. They simply seek consistency
and respect. Bowden, on the other hand, has an eye on the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got more to lose. We're favored,'' Bowden said.
``They'll climb high if they win, and we'll drop far if we lose.
But we won't disappear, no matter what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not. But if Monday's loser rebounds to finish in the Top
25, that team will be plowing fresh ground for a Kickoff Classic
participant.

COLORADO COACH GETS TOUGH IN HIS APPROACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rick Neuheisel worked his way up from a walk-on to a Rose Bowl
most-valuable-player quarterback at UCLA. After a 20-4 record in
his first two seasons as a college head coach, Neuheisel appeared
to have a golden touch.
</P>
<P>
   But Neuheisel understands how soon prospects become suspects.
And he knows that his coaching position at Colorado is under
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the lessons I learned last season is you don't inherit
success,'' Neuheisel said. ``You come to expect winning and the
fruits of that winning, instead of remembering the ingredients. I
experienced that firsthand, and hopefully the lesson has been
learned.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the Buffaloes were expected to be a top-10 team;
``The Sporting News'' picked Colorado as its preseason No. 1. But
after a humbling 27-3 loss at eventual co-national champion
Michigan, the Buffs played like Biffs, finishing 5-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never recuperated from that game,'' linebacker Hannibal
Navies said. ``Colorado teams in the past played through adversity,
no matter the situation. Last year, we didn't do that. That's got
to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel, 37, basked in the glory of 10-victory seasons in his
first two years. His New Age coaching style, which emphasized
happy-happy, joy-joy, appeared to be a perfect fit in Boulder, an
idyllic college town.
</P>
<P>
   But let the penalties mount, the mental mistakes multiply, and
the fans and media quickly pointed out that Neuheisel was too soft,
that he wasn't a strict disciplinarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone from two years of having people saying, `Please
stay' to having people say, `Please go' after last season,''
Neuheisel said with a laugh. ``I've learned to gain perspective.
I'm not as good as everybody thought I was, and I'm not as bad as
everybody thought I was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outsiders will look at this as a big point in my career. In
this profession, you learn to deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Buffaloes ranked 69th nationally in rushing
offense and 97th in rushing defense. Both statistics were evidence
that Colorado had lost its toughness. In off-season meetings with
his staff, Neuheisel decided a get-tough policy was needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mistake I made last year was basically giving starting jobs
to seniors just because they were seniors,'' he said. ``This year,
we opened up every position on the team in the spring. All the kids
fought for jobs, and I think that will make us a better football
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The most bitter battle was at quarterback. Neuheisel picked Mike
Moschetti, a junior-college transfer, as the starter. Junior Jeremy
Weisinger, who thought he had earned the job, has announced he will
transfer to Texas A&AMP;M. Sophomore Adam Bledsoe, Drew's younger
brother, is the backup, but Neuheisel has to be careful that
Bledsoe doesn't grow disenchanted, as Weisinger did.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado faces a difficult opener Saturday against Colorado
State in Denver. The Rams opened the season Saturday with a 23-16
victory against Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot as far as setting the tone for our season,''
Navies said. ``Obviously, they're going to be ranked ahead of us.
We have a lot to prove to the nation, that we are back. It's more
than our first game. It means the season for us, basically.''

IF IT'S ILLEGAL FOR SOME TO BUY GUNS, WHY AREN'T THEY BEHIND BARS
FOR TRYING?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL K. HARRAL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was growing up in the rural Southwest, there was usually
a .22-caliber rifle around somewhere _ in the trunk or the gun
rack. Maybe a pistol under the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Snakes, you know.
</P>
<P>
   And I spent many pleasant Sunday afternoons shooting at bottles
out at the city dump.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is to say that I am comfortable around firearms and
have owned _ and still own _ a fair number. But I'm not a member of
the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   No particular reason, since I generally agree with the NRA about
the Second Amendment, except that I'm not much of a joiner other
than church and, beyond that, I have some difficulty with the more
extreme sides of the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   See, I'm not worried about the government knowing what weapons I
own. I don't mind waiting periods and background checks. I won't
ever need to buy a firearm instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me to the Brady Act.
</P>
<P>
   I figure if the law stops even one killing, it's probably
worthwhile. (And no, I don't want to debate this. We're not going
to convince each other, so let's not try.)
</P>
<P>
   But every time we write about the Brady Act and include the
number of people rejected since its passage that the Clinton
administration is throwing around, I get calls asking a very
legitimate question:
</P>
<P>
   If it is illegal for certain people to possess handguns, isn't
it also illegal for them to attempt to possess them? And why aren't
those people being prosecuted?
</P>
<P>
   The question as presented may be somewhat disingenuous. It's in
the best interests of the anti-Brady people to prove that the law
is a fruitless waste of time and money _ and, since we obviously
aren't enforcing the laws already on the books, we don't need new
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the answer, says Justice Department spokesman Gregory
King, lies in understanding the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intention was not to create a new tool for prosecutors,''
he says. ``It was to keep guns out of the wrong hands. Congress
never intended that every single person who violated the Brady Act
would be prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress didn't appropriate the money to do that, he says. But
there is another issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to prosecute each and every one of those people,
you would tie up the courts and tie up the time and resources of
the prosecutors all over the country,'' King says. Just like with
any other crime, ``prosecutors have to make judgments as to which
crimes to put their resources behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent story in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram cited
figures from the Bureau of Justice Statistics for the years 1994-97
inclusive, saying there were 242,000 rejections out of 10.4 million
attempts to purchase handguns.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA figures that those numbers include rejections from both
Brady Act and Brady-exempt states. States that already had or have
passed laws calling for waiting periods, instant checks or other
restrictive requirements don't fall under Brady. Some of the most
deadly cities in the United States _ New York, for example _ have
never been subject to it. Twenty-three states are covered
presently.
</P>
<P>
   If you are on the list of people prohibited from buying a
handgun by the Federal Gun Control Act of 1968, you'd have to lie
on the forms you fill out, and that in itself is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   And state laws dealing with parole or probation may also come
into play, says the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action Research
and Information Division.
</P>
<P>
   But the NRA _ citing a Dec. 24, 1997, Department of Justice
report that used statistics from the Executive Office of United
States Attorneys _ notes that ``during Fiscal Years 1994-1997 only
599 individuals were convicted of providing false information on
either federal forms 4473 (used to document retail firearms
purchases) or Brady handgun purchase application forms. During this
period, a minimum of 75 of those convicted provided false
information on Brady forms.'' The latter information comes, the NRA
says, from a letter from Acting Assistant Attorney General John C.
Keeney to Sen. Richard J. Durbin, D-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Asking why there aren't more prosecutions is reasonable when
Congress has assessed severe penalties for the felon who buys a
handgun, says NRA spokesman Bill Parkerson. Parkerson is director
of the Research and Information Division of the Institute for
Legislative Action of the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's important enough to say, `You're going away for 10
years to the federal joint,' I think it's a really legitimate
question to say, `What are we doing here?''' Parkerson said.
``We're putting on severe penalties and then saying we don't have
the time to enforce them?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no real easy answers and I think that's part of what
Brady is all about,'' he says. ``It's feel-good legislation: Tell
the American people we're doing something about it and yet we're
not locking up the bad guys who are trying to buy guns illegally
because we don't have the money? We don't have the time?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell the people that,'' he says. ``That might be told to you
when you call the Justice Department, but I don't hear it in press
conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the get-go, if you look at GAO \RGeneral Accounting
Office\S reports, they've always said, `This is not a prosecution
tool. That's not what we're about.' But that's never mentioned when
President Clinton is up in the Rose Garden with Sarah Brady,''
Parkerson said.
</P>
<P>
   But there may be change coming, says King.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there have been concerns raised, we are working on
developing a protocol that we hope will be in place at the time the
national instant check system comes on board,'' he said last week.
Such a protocol would spell out more specifically when prosecution
is to be pressed.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of this column is not to settle this issue, because
I'm not sure it can be settled.
</P>
<P>
   But it is to say that I think news stories about the success or
failure of the Brady Act are incomplete _ no, they are misleading _
if the reporters do not ask the obvious next question. Readers
can't make an intelligent decision about something if they are
getting only part of the story.

</P>
<P>
   _ John 8:32
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Oh, how we mess things up when we fail to heed those words of
Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   We dig ourselves into a hole when we lie or deliberately
withhold the truth when it should be told. And once we get started,
the hole often just gets deeper and deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at the mess we find ourselves in today because someone
lied or withheld the truth when it should have been revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us now think we have a president who is a liar. That is
tragic.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has lied _ although he does not seem able to
bring himself to use that word _ to us about his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky. It undoubtedly is not the first time he has looked
us square in the eye and ``lied.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has implied that this relationship is none of our
business. Bull corn! It became the public's business the minute he
put the issue before us and lied about it.
</P>
<P>
   How he goes about mending his ways with his family is a
different matter. That is a private matter, and the public needs to
butt out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lying is a tragic matter. Many will now be suspicious
of many of his actions.
</P>
<P>
   I do not think that our attacks on the installations in Sudan
and Afghanistan were attempts by Clinton to divert our attention
from the Lewinsky affair. I pray that they were not. If they were,
being ousted from office would be too good for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It is also sad for this nation that people are rejoicing about
Clinton's problems because they hate him. I suspect that in God's
eyes, hatred is probably a greater sin than are sins caused by
raging hormones.
</P>
<P>
   There is a wide gulf between hatred and criticism of another.
Hatred simply worsens a bad situation.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton's political support diminishes, I think the chances
of his resignation grow. If special prosecutor Kenneth Starr
presents sufficient evidence to warrant an impeachment, I think
Clinton will resign before he would permit all of the details of
his relationship with Lewinsky to be presented in detail to the
world.
</P>
<P>
   At least I would hope he would resign for our sake, his family's
sake and his own sake. This sordid matter needs to come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   And look at what withholding of the truth did to the Dallas
Cowboys during training camp.
</P>
<P>
   You remember the case. Cowboys player Everett McIver vanished
from the practice field. The rumors had it that he had been cut in
the neck and required stitches. The Cowboys, undoubtedly at the
orders of owner Jerry Jones, refused to disclose details of the
incident, calling it a ``family matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Bull corn!
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agencies in Wichita Falls, where the team was
training, apparently bought the line at first. I wonder if they
would do so if the owner of a bar would ask them to leave after a
stabbing because the owner considered it a ``family matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The shield of silence raised by the Cowboys certainly triggered
suspicions. Word gradually leaked out that star receiver Michael
Irvin had stabbed McIver with a pair of scissors during a ruckus
about who was to be next in line for a haircut.
</P>
<P>
   Some suspected that Jones had ordered the shield of silence
because he feared that Irvin would end up in prison if the truth
became known. Irvin, you know, was on probation for felony drug
possession.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors continued to find their way into the newspapers and onto
radio and TV. One report had McIver being given a financial
settlement by Jones to prevent him from pursuing criminal charges
against Irvin. This finally brought a denial from Jones.
</P>
<P>
   District Judge Manny Alvarez of Dallas, who had put Irvin on
probation, finally had investigators for his probation department
look into the matter. Alvarez later informed the news media that
the investigation revealed that the stabbing was an accident, not a
deliberate act by Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little wrestling match started out innocently and someone
got hurt,'' the judge concluded. He considered the case closed.
</P>
<P>
   If that is true _ and I know of no reason to doubt the judge's
report _ then Jones did a terrible disservice to Irvin by clamping
a lid of silence on the matter. He subjected Irvin to unwarranted
suspicion simply because the truth apparently was withheld from the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Clinton owes the public an apology (say clearly and
distinctly, ``I have lied to you; I am sorry''), so too does Jones
owe an apology to his team, and especially to Irvin, for the
confusion, doubts and suspicions caused by the withholding of the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   All of us can learn lessons from these incidents.

UNIVERSITY'S TROUBLES BEHIND HIM, FALWELL LAYS PLANS FOR NEW
SANCTUARY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell has had his ups and downs. Only a year
ago, the school he founded, Liberty University, was in trouble as
school officials sought to pay off a $100 million debt they had
owed for several years.
</P>
<P>
   But retired insurance tycoon Art L. Williams of Palm Beach,
Fla., came to the rescue in December with a $70 million donation.
The university has reduced its debt to $10 million and is moving
forward, Falwell said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Now Falwell, who emerged on the national scene in 1980 as
founder of the Moral Majority, is diving headlong into a new
project: building a 12,000-seat sanctuary for his 22,000-member
Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The new church will be near Liberty University, about five miles
from the current 3,300-seat church, in central Lynchburg.
Groundbreaking is set for this fall, and the sanctuary is to be
completed by Christmas 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the largest sanctuary in North America,'' Falwell
said in a phone interview from Lynchburg.
</P>
<P>
   John Vaughan, founder of Church Growth Today, confirmed that
Falwell's sanctuary would be the largest. The largest now is the
10,145-seat Crenshaw Christian Center in Los Angeles, where the
Rev. Fred K.C. Price is minister, Vaughan said.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell's new church is expected to cost at least $20 million.
Falwell says three donors plan to contribute $5 million apiece,
although the money isn't in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the large donors back out, Falwell is expected to find a
way to carry out his plans.
</P>
<P>
   That has been his history since founding the Thomas Road church
in 1956. He began with 35 members who met in a 50-by-30-foot
building that formerly housed the Donald Duck Bottling Co.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell still keeps some of the soft drink bottles from the old
plant on his desk.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Lynchburg, Falwell was an improbable candidate for
the ministry. His 1987 autobiography, ``Strength for the Journey,''
says that his grandfather was an atheist and that his father, a
successful businessman, had a bootleg whiskey operation during
Prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   But Falwell's mother made the difference, he has said.
</P>
<P>
   Every Sunday morning, she would waken her son with the smell of
bacon and eggs cooking. And she always had the radio tuned to the
sermons of Charles W. Fuller.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell says he first began thinking about becoming a Christian
when listening to Fuller, one of the first nationally broadcast
radio evangelists. Falwell attended Lynchburg College and later
graduated from Baptist Bible College in Springfield, Mo., a
fundamentalist Baptist institution.
</P>
<P>
   An avowed fundamentalist, Falwell has forged ties with the
Southern Baptist Convention since its leadership turned toward
conservatism. His church holds dual membership in the Southern
Baptist Convention and the Baptist Bible Fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Falwell and members of his church were
messengers, or delegates, at the Southern Baptist national
convention in Salt Lake City this year.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell, who turned 65 on Aug. 11, has handed over some church
leadership duties to his son, the Rev. Jonathan Falwell, 32, who is
now executive pastor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the preaching pastor, but he runs the church,'' Falwell
said.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks proudly of all his children. His oldest son, Jerry
Falwell Jr., 36, is an attorney and chief counsel for Liberty
University. His daughter, Jeannie Falwell Savas, 34, is a surgeon
in Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very blessed,'' said the elder Falwell, who has been
married to his wife, Macel, for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although at the traditional retirement age, Falwell says he's
not thinking of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have a good 20 years left in me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides building the giant church, Falwell plans to be involved
in the upcoming presidential election. He believes Texas Gov.
George W. Bush will be the next president.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my conservative friends would disagree with me,'' he
said. ``But I'm a Bush man all the way.''

`TITANIC' VIDEO RELEASE HAS MARKETING FOLKS GOING OVERBOARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where the heck's an iceberg when you need one?
</P>
<P>
   Not that there's much chance of one holding up in this heat. But
I'll take anything that will send the juggernaut that is
``Titanic'' mania to a well-deserved watery grave. The film's
release on home video Tuesday adds yet another swell to the
hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   OK, before the entire North American chapter of the Leonardo
DiCaprio fan club pulls out their official ``King of the World!''
ice blue stationery to fire off angry missives, or worse, before
director Jim Cameron phones the editors demanding a front-page
rebuttal, let me preface this rant with a clarification: I love
``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   When I first saw the movie in a packed octoplex last summer, I
was convinced then, as I am now, that Cameron's epic filming of the
1912 maritime disaster produced one of this decade's finest
American movies. ``Titanic'' encapsulates every emotional response
possible _ it's funny, frightening, romantic, angering and
extremely moving. I, along with millions of other moviegoers, can't
wait to relive the experience on video.
</P>
<P>
   What I hate is the ridiculous sea of hype the film has
generated. Tuesday's video release adds an entirely new level of
studio-generated ballyhoo, one so dizzying that even P.T. Barnum
would be reaching for the Dramamine.
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster Video, a company big on subtlety, is staying open
till 2 a.m. Tuesday morning to make tapes available the first
minute it's ``officially'' okey-doky to go on sale (12:01 a.m). All
158 outlets in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex will be planning
activities, according to a company spokeswoman. There will be a
6-foot ice sculpture of the ship and the iceberg it hit (an ice
sculpture of an iceberg?) at the chain's flagship store on McKinney
Avenue in Dallas. The store will also feature a music trio _ like
the ill-fated musicians who went down with the ship. Store
employees will be decked out in life jackets while passing out
snacks.
</P>
<P>
   At least one store in Fort Worth is featuring life-jacket races
(whatever those are) from 10 p.m. to midnight; another is treating
video buyers to ``Titanic'' trivia.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint plans to give away vouchers for a free copy of the film
if you switch your long-distance service. And Max Factor will
introduce a fall line of makeup in colors ``inspired'' by the film.
</P>
<P>
   All this is tied to the release of the video, which retails for
about $25. The two-tape set is available in pan-and-scan and
wide-screen editions _ traditionally you have to wait for the
wide-screen. An estimated 25 million copies of the video are due to
hit the shelves the first day. (Most fans signed up for copies
months ago.) QVC began pre-selling the title in June for $19.95 and
has reported taking orders for more than 200,000 units so far.
Paramount has reportedly pre-sold 3 million to 4 million copies
industrywide.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest crime against consumers, of course, is that soon
after they buy the video, they will be assaulted with ads for even
better versions of the movie. Once the initial buying tide begins
to ebb, expect a ``deluxe'' edition to hit stores with extra
footage, behind-the-scenes stuff and interviews _ prompting fans to
drop more cash.
</P>
<P>
   Then, once the overall feeding frenzy has slowed, there's even
more chum to dump onto the unsuspecting market. The ``Titanic'' DVD
edition, due next year but rumored to be available as early as
November, promises even more ``extras.''
</P>
<P>
   Does any of this sound familiar? It should. Fox did the same
thing to ``Star Wars'' fans with countless versions of the trilogy,
each supposedly better than the last. Whether you call it
distributing savvy or niche marketing, it still amounts to
premeditated fleecing, and the folks who are ultimately left out in
the cold are the film's fans _ too impatient to wait for the
``ultimate'' edition or too zealous to care.
</P>
<P>
   To heck with the lifeboats, I'm abandoning ship.
</P>
<P>
   That is, as soon as I get my copy.

   WASHINGTON _ He's the Cal Ripken Jr. of fighter jocks, the
``iron man'' of the Air Force. Maj. Michael J. Brill, who makes his
living flying F-16 fighter planes, passed a milestone recently that
_ in the rarefied ranks of his calling _ is every bit as awesome as
Ripken's feat of playing in more than 2,600 consecutive
major-league baseball games. When ``Iron Mike'' took to the skies
Aug. 21 at Hill Air Force Base near Ogden, Utah, he logged his
4,000th hour in the cockpit of an F-16. That's more than any other
pilot has ever flown in the Fighting Falcon. And no other F-16

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a true diva, technique is irrelevant. Her performance is
about a beloved sound, a celebrated personality and a repertory
that magnifies them both. That was the kind of performance Nina
Simone gave on Sunday afternoon at the New Jersey Performing Arts
Center in Newark, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   It was her first concert in the New York area since 1993, and
she declared, ``If you're going to come see me again, you've got to
come to France, because I ain't coming back.'' Ms. Simone has lived
abroad since the early 1970s; she also announced that she was
building a house in Ghana.
</P>
<P>
   Her adoring audience, primed by the rarity of her appearance,
was there to pay tribute to Ms. Simone's indomitable spirit and her
lifelong project of celebrating an African-American heritage of
dignity, spiritual fervor and resilience.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, when she could have had a supper-club
career, Ms. Simone had the nerve to sing material like
``Mississippi Goddam,'' about the brutality of last-ditch
segregation. Ms. Simone, who is now 65, has become an icon of the
struggle for civil rights. In Newark, she raised a fist and had the
audience chant ``Power!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Simone delved into nearly every African-American genre older
than hip-hop. She was by turns sanctified and lascivious, righteous
and tender. Her set started with gospel and spirituals, including
her hymnlike tribute to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., ``Why
(the King of Love Is Dead''), which now mentions Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   With a diva's prerogative, she stretched her first song, ``Every
Time I Feel the Spirit,'' with two extended reprises, starting the
song anew twice after waves of applause, spurring ever stronger
call-and-response. At one point, Ms. Simone sang about praying five
times a day to Allah, something not usually heard in a gospel song.
</P>
<P>
   The set also included blues and blues-based songs (``I Want a
Little Sugar in My Bowl,'' ``My Baby Just Cares for Me''), pop
standards (her early hit ``I Loves You Porgy''), a song rooted in
African-American work songs (``See Line Woman,'' with just
percussion and her voice) and the gospel-charged ``Mississippi
Goddam,'' with its responsorial chorus, ``Too slow!'' and Ms.
Simone's insistent ``Just give me my equality!''
</P>
<P>
   As she sang Randy Newman's ``Baltimore,'' about a decaying city
where it's ``hard just to live,'' her band slipped a reggae beat
behind the chorus. At the end, she changed the name of the city to
``Newark,'' drawing hometown cheers.
</P>
<P>
   There is still power in her voice, but little of the subtlety
that made her such a striking singer when she emerged at the end of
the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   With a voice that plunged to the baritone range and rose to a
self-possessed soprano, Ms. Simone had an aural presence that was
dignified and almost androgynous. Her tone could be sultry and
velvety, or it could shade into a raw groan that was both weary and
foreboding, the sound of someone who has been working far beyond
fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tone that encompasses sufferings that date back to
slavery, and Ms. Simone uses it as both a complaint and a rallying
cry, one that galvanizes her listeners.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In ``Sinner Man,'' about a God who demands tribute in prayer
from someone with nowhere else to turn, her voice seemed desperate
and forsaken, and in ``Four Women,'' about America's heritage of
miscegenation, she used that rough-hewn tone over an inexorably
repeating piano line, giving the song a bitter clarity.
</P>
<P>
   But the lush side of Ms. Simone's voice has eroded through the
years, changing the balance toward dryness and bluntness. Her tone
made ``I Want a Little Sugar in My Bowl'' more comic than alluring,
as Ms. Simone cackled, ``You need some too?''
</P>
<P>
   Her version of ``I Loves You Porgy,'' which was once a hushed,
delicate, almost motionless confession, had sharper angles, with
Ms. Simone's phrasing almost brusque against a shimmering backdrop
of vibraphone and little bells. And as her notes arrived flat, she
turned a song like ``My Baby Just Cares for Me'' into a
near-parody.
</P>
<P>
   Yet her fans didn't mind. Ms. Simone was still singing, still
tough, still forthright. ``You're beautiful,'' she told the
audience during one of the standing ovations. ``Be strong!''

HASKELL UNIVERSITY ON MISSION TO BECOME NATIONAL EDUCATION CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE CARROLL  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE, Kan. _ Rose Rodriguez grew up in mainstream America,
attending an inner-city high school in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But during the summers, she'd slip away to the Paiute Indian
Reservation north of the city to visit her aunts and grandmother.
There she heard about a college called Haskell where American
Indians like herself could learn about their culture and heritage _
and get a two-year college degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd come for two years, get a good base and move
on,'' said Rodriguez, now a 20-year-old sophomore at Haskell Indian
Nations University in Lawrence, Kan. ``When I found out (this year)
that American Indian Studies was going to be a four-year program, I
said, `Whoa, I'm staying.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Haskell took a big step this month in its mission to become a
national center for Indian education.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime Lawrence institution received permission to add
three baccalaureate programs to the one it began offering five
years ago in elementary education. Haskell President Bob Martin
said he hopes the new offerings will help boost the number of
four-year degrees earned by American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at the high dropout rates of many Native Americans
at mainstream institutions and we knew that if we could give them
the opportunity to complete not only an associate but also a
baccalaureate degree that we could increase the numbers that are
graduating,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Haskell is preparing for an influx of students. Within five
years, it expects enrollment to increase by as much as 75 percent,
from 850 students this year to roughly 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Haskell was founded in 1884 as a boarding school for American
Indian children. The federal government set it up to help the
children assimilate into Western culture and to prepare them for
vocational jobs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the school's more prominent students was athlete Jim
Thorpe. He enrolled at age 10 in 1898. Thorpe was a member of the
Oklahoma Sac &AMP; Fox tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the school began offering secondary and
post-secondary classes. In 1970, about the time that tribes began
setting up their own community colleges, the institution changed
its name to Haskell Indian Junior College.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were (American Indian) students who were going to
colleges, but the success rates were so bad,'' recalled Carol
Davis, a vice president at Turtle Mountain Community College in
Belcourt, N.D., who was involved in the early tribal college
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty tribes now operate their own community colleges, and many
are beginning to provide four-year degrees, said Paul Boyer, the
author of two reports on tribal colleges for the Carnegie
Foundation. Haskell is unique, he said, because it serves all
tribes in the nation that are recognized by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Haskell) has done a very intriguing transformation over the
decades,'' Boyer said. In the beginning, he said, its mission was
to squelch Indian culture, traditions and languages. ``That in no
way reflects the current philosophy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Haskell and the tribal colleges are succeeding because they are
able to provide environments that honor and propagate Indian
culture, Boyer said. Their clear mission _ to prepare students to
become leaders in their tribal communities and in the nation _ also
is one of their strengths, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many mainstream universities have worked very hard to create
programs and service that encourage greater American Indian
enrollment,'' Boyer said. ``But as many as 90 percent of American
Indians who enroll at mainstream universities leave before getting
a degree.''
</P>
<P>
   American Indian students, more than any other ethnic group, are
considered to be at risk for failure: They have high percentages of
single-parent families, low family incomes, high sibling dropout
rates and limited proficiency in English, mathematics and reading.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics provided by Haskell illustrate the poor progress of
American Indians:
</P>
<P>
   Only 9 percent of American Indian adults have completed four
years of college, compared to 20 percent for the total U.S. adult
population.
</P>
<P>
   Only 34 percent of American Indian eighth-graders expect to
finish college.
</P>
<P>
   American Indians make up about 1 percent of the U.S. population,
but they account for only 0.4 percent of the scientific work force.
Only 0.2 percent earned doctorates in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Students who attend Haskell do not have to pay tuition or room
and board. Their fees amount to $105 a semester.
</P>
<P>
   The educations are provided by the federal government, part of
the deal set up in treaties long ago that forced American Indians
to give up their land.
</P>
<P>
   The price sounds low, but students generally need at least
$3,000 to cover expenses during the year, said Rodriguez, the Los
Angeles student who plans to major in American Indian Studies.
Students who live off campus pay much more because the government
does not pay for their room and board.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Haskell decided to work toward becoming a
four-year institution. Two of its newly approved programs _
business administration and American Indian Studies _ begin this
year. The other, in environmental science, will begin next year.
</P>
<P>
   Haskell opened a new dormitory last year and this year is
renovating two others. When the renovations are done next year, the
school will be able to accommodate about 950 students on campus, up
from 700 now. About 200 generally live off campus, a number Haskell
also hopes to increase.
</P>
<P>
   The school expects to pick up another 300 to 400 students
through satellite campuses and distance learning, which allows it
to offer classes electronically with computers. Enrollment should
total 1,450 to 1,550 within five years, Martin said.

(THIS COMMENTARY APPEARS IN TUESDAY'S ARIZONA REPUBLIC)  
 NEW COPYRIGHT BILL IS CORPO RATE WELFARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS S. KARJALA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED- Lost in all the talk about ``welfare reform'' is a
corporate welfare bill that, if adopted, will result in a wealth
transfer of millions of dollars from the pockets of ordinary
Americans into the hands of large corporations and descendants of
creative authors from the distant past.
</P>
<P>
   A bill has passed the U.S. House of Representatives and is being
held up in the Senate only because other special interests are
using it as a tool to try to enlarge their own slice of the
copyright pie.
</P>
<P>
   A copyright in a pre-1978 work of authorship lasts for 75 years,
which is also the term for current works by corporate authors. (The
copyright on current works by individual authors continues for 50
years after the authors' death.)
</P>
<P>
   The pending bills would add 20 years to the term of copyright
protection for all works - not just those created today or in the
future but even those already in existence. This would include
books, music, and films from the 1920's of great historical and
cultural significance that otherwise are about to enter the public
domain.
</P>
<P>
   Schools that wish to publicly perform plays and music,
archivists who wish to restore lost or forgotten works, scholars
and creative artists who wish to use these cultural building blocks
in creating new works, and the U.S. public in general through its
royalty payments, will foot a very heavy bill.
</P>
<P>
   New creativity will suffer. For example, the entrance of Frances
Hodgson Burnett's`` The Secret Garden'' into the public domain
resulted in an explosion of new book, film, and stage versions. The
recent spate of films based on works from such authors as Jane
Austen, Thomas Hardy, and William Shakespeare shows the value of
the public domain. If term extension passes, no new works will be
subject to this kind of creative adaptation for a full 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, we can expect these same copyright owners to
return to Congress in 20 years seeking yet another extension -
unconstitutional perpetual copyright on the installment plan. Under
the prior statute, the last of George Gershwin's songs would have
gone into the public domain in 1993, but the copyright term was
extended by 19 years in 1976. The Gershwin family trust will
collect millions of dollars during those extra 19 years that George
Gershwin himself had no idea he would be entitled to (if he thought
about copyright at all!).
</P>
<P>
   Still, the nephews running the trust are among the strongest
lobbyists for another extension. If they inherited any of
Gershwin's talent, wouldn't we all be better off if they used it to
write new songs? And if they lack that talent, why shouldn't they
have to work for a living like the rest of us?
</P>
<P>
   Disney, another bill supporter and itself a major user of the
public domain in its own productions (``Snow White,'' ``The Little
Mermaid,'' ``Mulan,'' to name only a few), is having apoplexy at
the thought that the copyright on Mickey Mouse is due to expire in
2004. So, as far as this multibillion dollar corporation is
concerned, you can explain to your children that they must wait
until 2024 to paint this American cultural icon on the walls of
their day care centers without paying royalties.
</P>
<P>
   When a popular book goes into the public domain, new publishers
almost immediately come out with a wide range of versions of
differing production qualities and prices, giving the public more
choice at a lower price. When popular and well known plays and
musicals go into the public domain, schools, churches and community
theaters can stage them without worrying about what if often a
prohibitively high royalty payment.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to 1988, for example, small community and youth orchestras
had to pay $540 for the right to perform Ravel's`` Mother Goose
Suite'' for just two public performances. Now that it is in the
public domain, they can buy the sheet music for $70 and, of course,
perform it as often as they like. The savings no longer go into the
pockets of Ravel's distant heirs but can be used to pay the
musicians more, to reduce ticket prices to the public, or to pay
for more recent works not yet in the public domain, thereby
increasing the variety the orchestra is able to offer the public.
</P>
<P>
   Excessive copyright terms hurt the general public but feather
the nests of copyright interest groups. Librarians, educators, and
consumer advocates are worn out with the continuous assault on the
public domain. As Congress moves toward taking this big bite out of
the public domain, the territory lies virtually undefended.
</P>
<P>
   It will eventually pass unless a true public interest spirit is
instilled in enough voices to make Congress listen. Arizona's Sen.
Jon Kyl is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which
oversees copyright legislation in the Senate. He is therefore in a
position to help stop this ill-advised legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kyl wisely voted in the public interest and against term
extension when the bill came before the committee two years ago. He
should be encouraged to maintain, and indeed intensify, his
opposition to taxing the public for the benefit of special
interests.

THERE'S MORE TO A HEALTHY TREE THAN LOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Trees add much to a property, including beauty,
wildlife, noise absorption, shade and a buffer to the cold of
winter.
</P>
<P>
   But even healthy-looking trees can be ailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because your trees are green or have green leaves doesn't
mean they are necessarily safe or healthy,'' said Sal Pezzino,
president of the New York State Association of Arborists and owner
of Artistic Arbor Culture in Huntington.
</P>
<P>
   Pezzino and other tree experts say homeowners can do early risk
detection once they learn to recognize some telltale signs of poor
tree health.
</P>
<P>
   Some common problems are unknowingly created by homeowners
thinking they're doing the right thing, Pezzino said. It's why he
said, ironically, that ``when I see an ugly lawn, I know the trees
are doing better.''
</P>
<P>
   One simple but potentially deadly problem is overwatering.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a potential for tree roots to not fully expand if they
get too much water,'' Pezzino said. ``Tree roots tend to stay
shallow in turf areas that are on an irrigation system and watered
two to three times a week. When the soil isn't allowed to dry out,
the root system won't get bigger and go deeper in search of
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Another danger comes from misusing lawn treatment chemicals,
Pezzino said.
</P>
<P>
   He said a great deal of stress is inflicted on trees by the use
of an overabundance of herbicides to kill lawn weeds and as a
result, end up killing tree roots as well. He also advises not to
use too much nitrogen-based fertilizer, which causes the tree to
produce more green growth (leaves and needles) than its root system
can support.
</P>
<P>
   Fungicides also can kill off mycorrhizae, a fungus that lives on
and around tree roots and helps trees to absorb water and
nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Groll, owner of Groll Tree Service in Hudson, N.Y., pointed
out other signs that are directed toward impaired tree health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look for things such as large rot spots or hollows in the
tree,'' Groll said. ``Carpenter ants are another danger sign, even
if they are in your house. They could be coming from a tree nearby.
Major cracks or splits in any branch, dead branches or if the root
system has moved in any way or heaved upward or at an angle
(especially through sidewalks or patios) are other red flags. Seek
help if a tree is losing more limbs than normal, especially during
a wind storm, or shedding leaves before fall, such as in
mid-to-late August. These are signs that your tree is weak,
diseased or sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Pezzino noted that when most trees blow over, it actually has to
do with damage done to the root system.
</P>
<P>
   ``You rarely loose any trees during a regular storm if they have
been trimmed and properly maintained,'' Pezzino said. ``Dead trees
never fall down in a storm; they usually fall down one day from
lack of support.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to maintaining healthy trees is regular maintenance. A
certified or consulting arborist can tell homeowners a lot about
their trees by doing a thorough inspection of them. Arborists
usually charge an hourly fee of approximately $65 to $140.
</P>
<P>
   ``A full canopy may make your tree top-heavy and cause it to
fall down because of the weight, or it can kill off the roots from
all the pressure,'' Pezzino said. ``Having your trees pruned and
inspected by an arborist on a regular basis may save them from
gravity and wind, and you from any danger, especially if the trees
are soft woods, such as a tulip, poplar or willow.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some homeowners like to do their own pruning, it may
not be feasible for them to do it themselves, especially if it's a
big job.
</P>
<P>
   Groll stressed that homeowners should never attempt to prune
tree branches in or around power lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always call your local power company,'' said Groll, a former
power company lineman. ``They don't want inexperienced people
messing around power lines. You may not see the line through the
branches or slip and grab for a branch and touch the wire. They are
happy to come out and take care of the problem for you and they do
it for free.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arborists also can help detect hidden problems and potential
dangers down the road.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, root damage often is found near roads if they have
been paved or widened, and around sidewalk improvements, Pezzino
said. Severe root damage will decay the tree from the center
outwards.
</P>
<P>
   A problem that may not become apparent for 20 years or more
stems from new construction, Groll said. As a house's foundation is
being dug out with a backhoe, the vehicle may be shearing off
anchor and feeder roots that are essential to the life of a tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a few years for the tree to die, but it will die,''
Groll said. ``We see this constantly around treed areas that have
undergone some type of construction.''

CONGRESS ALL ATWITTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The tortured dithering of House Speaker Newt
Gingrich and House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt last week
typified the confusion in Congress over how judicious or how
partisan to be toward President Clinton's potential impeachment
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Befitting their position as national political leaders, both men
made noble attempts to sound statesmanlike on the subject of
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's pending report to Congress.
They tried to strike the fair-minded pose that would best serve
their mutual presidential ambitions in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich urged Republicans not to rush prematurely into
impeachment hearings and suggested that Congress should not take
any action unless the Starr report deals with serious crimes beyond
the evidence of illicit sex. He said that ``a pattern of felonies''
should be the criterion for launching any congressional crusade to
bring down the president.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, for his part, conspicuously failed to defend Clinton
against possible accusations of perjury and obstruction of justice
and conceded that the impeachment process might be unavoidable.
``We (House members) have to, under the Constitution, carefully
examine the facts and then make a judgment as to whether or not he
should be expelled,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   But both men beat a fast retreat from such responsible positions
within days, under pressure from their own outraged partisans.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders could not even count on their own deputies to
support their reasoned views. Rep. Tom DeLay, Gingrich's third in
command, is busily mobilizing a crusade to get Clinton to resign.
Rep. David Bonior, Gephardt's deputy, insisted that Democrats
should support Clinton and the country should abandon speculation
about how to punish him.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich was accused of being too soft on the president and
undercutting GOP conservatives who want to campaign by taking
credit for leading him to the political guillotine. They have
pre-judged Clinton and are proud of it.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich hastily issued a statement revising his message to
insist that ``any evidence'' of possible presidential wrongdoing,
``whether one incident or many, would clearly have to be
investigated ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt got complaints that he was being too tough on the
president and encouraging Democrats to abandon him in the fall
campaign. By even acknowledging the legitimacy of a possible House
review of the president's actions, he had suggested that the
Democratic hierarchy would not require, or expect, party loyalty to
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt rapidly softened his tone, expressing the support for
Clinton that was missing in his original neutrality. ``I thought he
apologized,'' Gephardt said, falling back on the familiar party
refrain that it is time forget the scandal and to move on.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and Gephardt are caught in the contradictory pressures
their congressional troops feel as they face a campaign for
re-election in November. For so much at stake, too little is
predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side can be confident how the public will react when the
Starr report actually materializes sometime this fall. Neither side
knows what will be in it, despite all the educated guesses.
</P>
<P>
   If it is devastating to the president, the election is likely to
become a national referendum on his conduct. No candidate wishing
to maintain a moral standing with constituents is going to defend
Clinton's fatal attraction to an aggressive young intern, let alone
his lies about it.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what Gephardt says, the Democrats will have trouble
putting distance between themselves and their president. It is not
easy to deplore his personal behavior while supporting his public
agenda. The party is bound to lose seats. In that case, the
impeachment process will go forward in the hands of an expanded,
triumphant GOP congressional majority.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Starr report is limited to titillating but
inconclusive data about the Monica Lewinsky affair, giving the
president a pass on other investigations into financial and
political questions, its impact may be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Voters may stick to what they tell the pollsters now _ a
majority does not think Clinton should be impeached _ and
Republicans overeager to punish him could feel a backlash. If that
causes them to lose seats, any subsequent impeachment hearings
would become less likely because they would amount to a politically
reckless defiance of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   It cannot be repeated too often that impeachment is a political
process more than a legal one. The rules are not written in stone.
</P>
<P>
   President Lyndon Johnson used to tell the story of an aspiring
teacher interviewed by a conservative school board for a
prospective position. Asked his view of the world, the nervous
candidate replied, ``I can teach it round or flat.''
</P>
<P>
   Torn between long-term and short-term worries, what Gingrich and
Gephardt would like to do is hedge their current political bets by
teaching it oblong.

F-16'S `IRON MAN' A CAREER CASE OF PLANE GREATNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL D. TOWLE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He's the Cal Ripken Jr. of fighter jocks, the
``iron man'' of the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Michael J. Brill, who makes his living flying F-16 fighter
planes, passed a milestone recently that _ in the rarefied ranks of
his calling _ is every bit as awesome as Ripken's feat of playing
in more than 2,600 consecutive major-league baseball games.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Iron Mike'' took to the skies Aug. 21 at Hill Air Force
Base near Ogden, Utah, he logged his 4,000th hour in the cockpit of
an F-16. That's more than any other pilot has ever flown in the
Fighting Falcon. And no other F-16 pilot is even close.
</P>
<P>
   Brill, a 1979 Air Force Academy graduate, took his first flight
in the Fort Worth-made fighter in October 1980. He sat down and
wrote to his girlfriend _ now his wife _ about his new sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her I was in love, and found what I wanted to do for
the rest of my life,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``It
sounded so much like a Dear John letter that at the end, I had to
tell her I was talking about an airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen years and 4,000 flight hours later, Brill is still
assigned to F-16s. As a full-time member of the Air Force Reserve,
he is operations officer for the 466th Fighter Squadron of the
419th Fighter Wing at Hill AFB.
</P>
<P>
   Brill, who lacks the cocky demeanor of the stereotypical fighter
pilot, said he is flattered that people compare his flight time in
the F-16 to the consecutive-game record of Ripken, who plays third
base for the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone once asked me if they could call me the Cal Ripken of
aviation,'' said Brill, 41. ``I would not say that, but I guess
there is some room for comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Ripken played in his 2,131st consecutive game
Sept. 6, 1995, breaking a mark set by Lou Gehrig of the New York
Yankees. Ripken has since extended his streak to more than 2,600
games.
</P>
<P>
   Brill said he could set his record partly because he is a
weapons specialist, a job that requires a lot of training as new
weapons systems come on line. He has also been a flight instructor
since 1984 and has participated in such competitions as Gunsmoke
and William Tell, the Air Force's worldwide air-to-ground and
air-to-air weapons competitions, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``The big reason I've been able to do this is that
I have had absolutely zero breaks from flying over 18 years. I have
never gone more than two weeks without flying.''
</P>
<P>
   Brill's feat is unlikely to be matched any time soon. Worldwide,
more than 3,000 pilots have 1,000 hours in the F-16. More than 400
have 2,000; only 21 have passed the 3,000-hour milestone, which
Brill reached first.
</P>
<P>
   No one is chasing his exhaust to reach 4,000. The Air Force said
it is almost unheard of for a pilot to log 4,000 hours in one type
of fighter plane. In fighters, the typical training mission lasts
less than 1 1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I've been driving the same car for 18 years,''
Brill said of the F-16, which is built by Lockheed Martin Tactical
Aircraft Systems in west Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The F-16 has changed so significantly ever since it was built.
It seems like every other year, there is a new capability you are
challenged to master. It keeps you fresh, that's for sure. I like
the current version the best, but there is something about every
version that was attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials speak of Brill the way baseball fans talk of
Ripken: as a person who always shows up for work and does the best
he can, whether he's briefing fellow pilots, shuffling papers or
scooting around the sky in the Fighting Falcon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about Major Brill is that he never passes up
an opportunity to fly an airplane,'' said Col. Wayne Conroy,
Brill's commander at the 419th. ``He is thorough in his planning
and his execution. He is just a great role model for younger
pilots.''
</P>
<P>
   Brill, who lives with his wife and three children near the Utah
air base, says he's not sure when he will stop his streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll keep going as long as I still enjoy it,'' he said.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Staging a Charlie Parker Jazz Festival worthy of its
name is a difficult job, but the sixth annual edition of the
concert, at a packed Tompkins Square Park on Sunday afternoon, did
the trick in a way that was neither curatorially exact nor some
sort of seance.
</P>
<P>
   The great saxophonist's style of harmony, phrasing, composition,
tone, choice of repertory and bravado are part of the modern jazz
player's kit, and that was the conceptual starting point for all
four acts. The audience was a rare example of a jazz-concert crowd
that was full of musicians, laughing at musical jokes, cooing at
references.
</P>
<P>
   At times Parker's music was played, and the performers were
explicit about it; at other times, the connection was only there by
metaphor or a vague link. But the performances connected several
different generations of players _ which is something Parker also
did _ and healthily suggested many different ways of playing jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The Julius Hemphill Sextet, an all-saxophone band led by the
saxophonist Marty Ehrlich, played a strong set of Hemphill's
compositions. (He died in 1995.) With the rhythmic kick of Alex
Harding's baritone saxophone, the music represented the blues as
sophisticated and jocular chamber music.
</P>
<P>
   Each tune had a different soloist, and parts for different horns
kept wrapping around one another in twisty pieces that shivered
with modernist dissonance. Then a bass line would appear _ the one
in ``The Hard Blues'' resembled the down-and-up steps of the
rhythm-and-blues song ``Lonely Avenue'' _ grounding the music in
gut bucket persuasiveness.
</P>
<P>
   It's lovely music; Hemphill wasn't close to being artistically
finished at the time of his death, and the music still sounds
alarmingly fresh.
</P>
<P>
   The conguero Ray Barretto played with his own sextet, folding
conventions of Latin jazz into shared space with mainstream jazz
arrangements. The group played some be-bop and soul-jazz, but
mostly captured the crowd when his 12-year-old son, Chris, played
Parker's ``Now's the Time'' with the band, carefully carving out a
solo which at least for its beginning followed the lines of
Parker's famous solo on that tune. ``That's a message to Bird,''
announced Barretto, proudly, at the close of his set. ``This music
will never die.''
</P>
<P>
   Since her short walk-on stood out in most accounts as a high
point of last summer's festival, it was good to see Etta Jones
given a long set to herself this year. There are many shadings to
her voice _ a blues honk, a nasal, girlish whine _ and her
phrasings are all her own. When she sang ``What a Wonderful
World,'' audience members attempted to sing along according to
Louis Armstrong's model, but she kept shaking them off and they
finally stopped altogether.
</P>
<P>
   None of her sung lines on standards could be predicted, whether
she would stretch them past their usual boundaries with long,
wailing vowels, or tartly gun them down in half her allotted space.
</P>
<P>
   Timbrally, she recalls no singer as much as Billie Holiday, but
she distinguished herself neatly on that score: Singing ``Fine and
Mellow,'' she mimicked Holiday in the final verse, and it was both
wickedly precise and sufficiently different from her own style for
a listener to appreciate its own excellence.
</P>
<P>
   On several tunes she was accompanied by the violinist Claude
``Fiddler'' Williams, 90, who played in the late 1930s with Count
Basie; he took long choruses of his own, including a bit of
hurtling be-bop chromaticism into his warm, luxuriant swing.
</P>
<P>
   The alto saxophonist Lou Donaldson, one of the cheeriest
presences on jazz bandstands, finished the afternoon with endless
jokes and a with decidedly more down-home, roadhouse version of
Parker's repertory. Like Chris Barretto, he played the ``Now's the
Time'' solo, extending its narrative and taking it to new, earthier
conclusions; he did the same thing again with ``Parker's Mood.''
</P>
<P>
   The guitarist Peter Bernstein and organist Dr. Lonnie Smith also
delivered galvanizing improvisations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Powerful music, the blues,'' Donaldson remarked, launching
into a story about a sad-sack friend who ``fell in love so fast he
didn't check it out,'' and went on to sing a funny, repetitive
blues about the source of his friend's troubles: a woman who put
whisky in her coffee, her tea and her whisky. It was a warm,
offhanded way to end the day.

   Beginning Tuesday, in a series of screenings titled ``Laurence
Olivier: Four Crowning Achievements,'' the Museum of Television and
Radio, in both New York and Los Angeles, will showcase the actor's
art as it was applied to the intimate medium of television in
collaborations with such colleagues as Alan Bates, Katharine
Hepburn, Malcolm McDowell, Leo McKern and Helen Mirren, among
others. In ``A Voyage Round My Father,'' playing Tuesday through
Sept. 20, Olivier portrays an irrepressible old lawyer; in ``The
Collection,'' Sept. 22 to Oct. 11, he is an aging couturier caught
in a romantic quadrangle; in ``Love Among the Ruins,'' Oct. 13 to
Nov. 1, he stars with Ms. Hepburn as an aging lawyer with a
troublesome client, and in ``King Lear,'' Nov. 3 to Nov. 29, he
gives a performance that won him his fifth and final Emmy.

   Going Home

<P>
   Maybe it seems like carrying coals to Newcastle, but Romulus
Linney's ``Gint,'' a very American version of Henrik Ibsen's
Norwegian epic ``Peer Gynt,'' will be performed by a troupe from
New York on Wednesday and Thursday in Oslo. But there's a story
behind it. The Theater for the New City production of ``Gint'' was
invited to Oslo by the National Theater of Norway to take part in
its International Ibsen Stage Festival. Every two years since 1990,
it has been inviting selected companies from around the world to
stage their Ibsen productions in Norway. The Theater for the New
City production, which had its world premiere in New York in
February, is billed as the first from the United States to be
selected for the festival.
</P>
<P>
   What to Be?
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Shakespeare Company has chosen a Dutch architect,
Erick Van Egeraat, to design its new home in Stratford-on-Avon, but
it is not clear what it will look like. Until recently, the idea
was to refurbish and modernize the existing Royal Shakespeare
Theater, which opened in 1932 and has long been considered
impractical. Now the company has disclosed that it may build an
entirely new theater on the same site on the banks of the River
Avon. No final decision is expected until 2000, although company
officials say they believe that a new building may prove to be the
cheaper option. Either way, the key variable may be whether the
company can get an $80 million grant from national lottery profits
and cover the rest of the estimated $137 million budget through
private donations.
</P>

   Upward Bound
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mandy Patinkin's hit one-man concert, ``Mamaloshen''
(``Mother Tongue''), is headed for Broadway after its sold-out run
last month at a former synagogue on the Lower East Side. Beginning
on Oct. 13, his evening of musical numbers sung in Yiddish _
everything from ``Maria'' (from ``West Side Story'') to ``Take Me
Out to the Ball Game'' _ will play 28 performances, through Nov. 7,
at the Belasco Theater.  &QL;

NEW NETWORK EMPHASIZES FAMILY VALUES, BUT DOES IT HAVE A HIDDEN
MISSION?
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by BC-PAXTV-BOX) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pax TV, the self-proclaimed seventh network, has been doing its
hard-sell best to drum into your head that it isn't out to conquer
the world, that it doesn't want to play God, instill spiritual
values, preach community responsibility or save our sick, morally
decaying society.
</P>
<P>
   It says it is simply this: a clean alternative to the TV filth
we consume from a daily diet of network and cable-television fare.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's because its programming chief is Jeff Sagansky, a
sharp, experienced chap who learned during his days as head of CBS
that two of the broadcasters' Ten Commandments are ``Thou shalt not
touch politics'' and ``Thou had better steer clear of
spirituality.''
</P>
<P>
   Pax TV launched its broadcast lineup Monday with a healthy dose
of off-network shows augmented by original infotainment and
children's programs. And Sagansky and his network were so careful
to distance themselves from anything religious and political that
the start-up propagated an atmosphere of distrust, suspicion and
fear.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the public relations hole they've dug for
themselves is by professing not to be something they clearly are.
We're supposed to believe that the biblical white dove on its logo
means nothing in particular, and that attendees of a recent Pax TV
luncheon in Dallas just happened to be met at the door by a woman
dressed as an angel.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by Lowell ``Bud'' Paxson, 63, a born-again Christian
whose co-creation of the Home Shopping Network made him a
multimillionaire, Pax TV claims that it isn't based on Christian
beliefs as much as spiritual peace; that it's a venture combining
faith with fortune. (''Pax'' means peace in Latin.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this explains all the angels, which also dominate Pax
TV's programming. Reruns of ``Touched by an Angel'' and the angelic
``Highway to Heaven'' are staples of prime time; one original
children's program is ``Cloud Nine,'' hosted by a group of teen-age
angels running a public-access cable TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Another original show is ``It's a Miracle,'' a weekly hourlong
series with country singer Billy Dean and actress Nia Peeples
introducing ``miracles'' and human-interest stories that illustrate
``the power of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that some people give the phrase `family
values' a political connotation,'' Sagansky says, clearly unnerved.
``People think that we've got some right-wing agenda or some
religious agenda. We don't. But the paranoid people are always
looking to see if there's some conspiracy afoot. There's no such
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Jewish,'' Sagansky continues, ``so if that were true, he
(Bud Paxson) certainly wouldn't have gotten me to do this job. He
feels he has a calling from God. I don't feel I have the same
calling, but I do have a lot of idealism that I had when I started
in this business. We're young and we'll make mistakes. But we feel
we're onto something here.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has already been made of Pax TV's early mistake _ some
print ads in which the wording bordered on homophobia. A reference
to ``so-called creative people'' peddling ``every kind of
alternative language and lifestyle to our kids'' was yanked after
accusations that the wording was code for ``anti-gay.''
</P>
<P>
   What still concerns me is the overall tone of the network's $25
million publicity campaign, ads that are about as contradictory as
the network's hidden spiritual claims.
</P>
<P>
   Pax TV is against programming that teaches children to fear the
world, but its own ads prey on similar parental fears.
</P>
<P>
   One effective scared-straight commercial features an infant
watching television news as a narrator asks ``Is what your child
sees on television really the way you want him to see the world?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Great Day America,'' a one-hour, daily infotainment show that
kicked off the launch Monday, is designed as an alternative to
early-evening network news. ``Great Day'' will focus on parenting,
family finances, travel and the like, using a news-you-can-use
format along the lines of the last hour of NBC's ``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, and with shows like ``Eight Is Enough'' and ``Father
Dowling Mysteries,'' the Pax TV menu won't be edgy or hip or even
all that steeped in reality.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Pax TV's world seems sanitized and sterilized, devoid
of crime and ugliness _ and people of color. The highest-profile
black performer is Della Reese of ``Touched by an Angel'' and there
is no Hispanic presence to speak of. Sagansky says diversifying its
lineup is ``one of the things we have to work on,'' even though Pax
TV is already planted in 43 of the top 50 cities. (To its credit,
Pax is airing the civil rights-based drama ``I'll Fly Away.'')
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Paxson is deep-pocketed and well-connected, having made millions
by co-founding Home Shopping Network in 1982, and later by buying
radio and television stations. Pax TV consists of 88 UHF stations,
71 owned by the Florida-based Paxson Communications Corp., which
owns more TV stations than any other U.S. company.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, those airwaves were used for wall-to-wall
infomercials _ a typical night on Channel 68 featured shows selling
weight machines and hair-care products _ but that lucrative
business has plateaued.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson was helped out tremendously by last year's ``must carry''
legislation that forced cable systems to add his UHF station to
their lineups, suddenly making it accessible to cable audiences and
a legitimate network contender.
</P>
<P>
   The skeptic in me asks whether Pax TV offers anything different
from what is already supplied by cable networks such as the Family
Channel and the retro-TV channels like TV Land and Nick at Nite.
Sagansky says Pax TV will lure viewers interested in a seamless
flow of ``inspirational'' programming no matter the hour.
</P>
<P>
   Some media buyers attending the Dallas luncheon feel good about
Pax TV's chances but were concerned that most Pax channels were
weak UHF signals. Others wondered how long such feel-good
television would keep the attention of a viewing audience
conditioned to edgier programming, such as shows on such network
upstarts as the WB.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that some of the talk shows on TV tried to clean
themselves up, and it didn't work. The ratings dropped,'' says
Terry Hanson, general manager of the local PAX affiliate. ``It's a
sad state of affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he thinks all programming should mingle faith and
fortune, as Pax TV does, Hanson thinks a moment, smiles and
answers: ``There's a place for everything and anything. I'm just
glad `they' are carrying some of that everything.''

   Launch date: Monday
</P>
<P>
   Penetration: 88 stations reaching 74 million households,
including stations in all of the top-20 markets.
</P>
<P>
   Hours of programming: 24 hours, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Hours of original programming: Four. (Five beginning in
November.)
</P>
<P>
   Programming overview: Family-oriented programs free of excessive
violence and gratuitous sex. Aimed mostly at women and children.
Schedule includes off-network reruns like ``Touched by an Angel,''
augmented with infotainment programs, game shows and children's
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Chances of success: Good, actually; family-friendly
entertainment could generate a loyal following. Pax TV will get
minuscule numbers compared with the lowest-rated network
competitor. But a single ratings point (representing 980,000
households) could make the network profitable, because its
advertising is sold locally, and local ad rates typically are
higher than network rates.

architectural tours. There are three that might appeal to you.
Contemporary London, available Oct. 17 and Nov. 21, is a look at
the work of the three architects you mentioned _ masters of Hi-Tech
and Post-Modernism; other designers whose work is on the tour
include Robert Venturi, the American post-modernist.
</P>
<P>
   Docklands Regeneration, this Saturday and again on Oct. 24,
focuses on the buildings _ good, bad and ugly _ that have gone up
after the demise of the city's docks 25 years ago. Included will be
Rogers' Reuters building and Grimshaw's Financial Times building.
</P>
<P>
   And the City of London tour, Sept. 26 and Oct. 31, explores the
financial district, a mix of medieval buildings, Christopher Wren
churches and modern office towers. That last group includes the
Lloyds of London building (by the Richard Rogers Partnership),
which has its ductwork and stairways on the outside, giving it an
``inside-out'' look.
</P>
<P>
   All tours depart at 10:15 a.m. and return by 1 p.m. The price is
$30, students $18.80, at $1.71 to the pound. Tours leave from the
forecourt of the Royal Academy, Piccadilly; participants are asked
to arrive 10 minutes early. Reservations recommended.
</P>
<P>
   The special event you should know about is London Open House on
Sept. 19 and 20. More than 450 buildings in the city will be open
for free tours, with the list spanning centuries and encompassing
everything from private homes to government buildings. A special
program for children ages 8 to 14 turns them into architectural
``detectives,'' looking for clues in the buildings on the tour
list. For details, contact London Open House, Post Office Box 6984,

   &UR; Notes on Volts &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I recently returned from Russia, and I took my camcorder.
Luckily one of my friends had a converter that allowed me to
recharge the batteries, otherwise my highlight tape would have been
a short one because all this talk of volts and wattage is a mystery
to me. For future reference, how can I tell if I need a converter,
and where can I get one? _ Robert B. Garber, Glen Rock, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A. Let's use as an example your trip to Russia, which uses 220
volts at 50 cycles per second. Many electronic devices come with
power supplies that can handle the world's three main voltage
systems: Japan (100 volts), the Americas (120), and Europe, Asia
and Africa (220). The fine print on the side will list the voltages
accepted. A typical multivoltage power supply will say something
like ``100-240V50/60Hz,'' which means that it will accept anything
between 100 and 240 volts, at 50 to 60 cycles per second. If this
is the case, you only need an outlet adapter so that the
American-style plug will fit into a Russian outlet. Such adapters
are commonly available at airports and electronic stores throughout
the world. On the other hand, the power supply might say something
like 120V60, which indicates that only 120 volts is acceptable. In
this case, a transformer is needed to convert 220 volts from the
wall outlet to 120 volts. Radio Shack sells several models that
handle 50 to 1,500 watts. To estimate the wattage needed, look at
the label again to see the output in volts and amps. Multiply the
volts and amps to determine the number of watts; then add 50
percent as a safety margin to get a ball park figure for power. For
example: for an output of 6 volts at 2.2 amps, 6 times 2.2 equals
13.2, and 150 percent of that is about 20 watts. Most camcorders
should be able to use a 50-watt transformer, which costs about $20.
You'll still need outlet adapters, which cost a few dollars each.

   &UR; Portrait of Tuebingen &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I recently painted a winter scene of Tuebingen, Germany, from
a photograph. It piqued my curiosity about this city, which is on
the banks of the Neckar River. Can you give me some information
about it? _ James J. Curry, Point Pleasant, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A. You chose a very lovely subject for your canvas. Tuebingen,
in southwestern Germany, in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, is 25
miles south of Stuttgart. It has been a college town since 1477,
when the University of Tuebingen opened, and has produced such
luminaries as the astronomer Johannes Kepler and the philosopher
Georg Hegel. Although this community of 85,000 might not be as
famous as another German university city, Heidelberg, it is still
one of the prettiest cities in southern Germany. Steep, winding
streets rise up from the banks of the Neckar from the Am Markt, the
square that is at the center of the old quarter. Alumni of the
University of Michigan might want to know that Tuebingen is the
sister city of Ann Arbor, Mich., the home of that Big 10 school.
</P>
<P>
   Among its sights is the 15th-century Stiftskirche. The choir,
noted for its late-Gothic vaulting and ornate tracery, was probably
built around 1470. The relief figures in the north window openings,
most notably the one depicting the martyrdom of St. George, are
another highlight.
</P>
<P>
   The schloss (castle), above the city, has an Outer Gate built in
1606; the present building dates from the early 16th century and
rests on a site of a castle dating from the 11th century. In the
cellar are prison cells and an 18,700-gallon wine vat.
</P>
<P>
   The lower town has numerous half-timbered buildings facing the
Neckar. One of them, the Kornhaus, 10 Kornhausgasse, now contains
exhibits on the city's history and artifacts on printing and
publishing.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the better hotels are in the heart of Tuebingen. The
Hotel Krone, 1 Uhlandstrasse, PLZ 72072, telephone (49-7071) 13310,
fax (49-7071) 133132, has 66 rooms and charges $108 to $166 for a
double, at 1.75 marks to $1. At the Hotel Domizil, 5-9
Woehrdstrasse, PLZ 72072, (49-7071) 1390, fax (49-7071) 139250,
double rates in the 120 rooms are $111 to $131. The 20-room
Landhotel Hirsch, 28 Schoenbuchstrasse, 72074, (49-7071) 68027, fax
(49-7071) 600803, charges $137 to $154 for a double. All these
rates include breakfast, and there are less expensive hotels away
from the heart of the city. The Tuebingen tourist office is at An
der Neckarbruecke, Postfach 2623, 72016 Tuebingen; (49-7071) 91360,
fax (49-7071) 35070.

 &HT;    TRYPTOPHAN CONTAINS SUBSTANCE LINKED TO FATALITIES, REPORT SAYS
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A popular dietary supplement sold over the counter
in health stores contains low levels of a contaminant similar to a
substance implicated in 30 deaths and at least 1,500 cases of
nonfatal illness a decade ago, researchers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The supplement is 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, also known as
``5-HTP.'' It is recommended by alternative medicine practitioners
and health store operators for a variety of ailments, including
depression, insomnia, obesity and headache.
</P>
<P>
   Many health food enthusiasts turned to 5-HTP in the late 1980s
when a related substance, L-tryptophan, was withdrawn from the
market after being implicated in a nationwide outbreak of a
condition health experts identified as eosinophilia mylagia
syndrome (EMS).
</P>
<P>
   The condition was responsible for the death of 30 people and
about 1,500 cases of painful tissue damage associated with
increased levels of eosinophils (white blood cells).
</P>
<P>
   In an article to be published Tuesday in the scientific journal
Nature Medicine, scientists at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.,
report finding low levels of a contaminant that is chemically
similar to contaminants found in L-tryptophan linked to the EMS
cases.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the contaminant, known simply as ``Peak X,'' is the
same as that found in 5-HTP linked to a 1991 case of EMS, said Mayo
researchers Stephen Naylor and Gerald Gleich.
</P>
<P>
   Although Naylor and Gleich acknowledged in a press briefing that
they knew of no cases of illness associated with current
preparations of 5-HTP, Gleich said he personally believed anyone
taking the supplement should stop.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known how many Americans take 5-HTP, which is but one
of hundreds of so-called ``natural'' products that made health food
supplements a $14 billion industry last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dangerous practice and anybody taking 5-HTP as a
dietary supplement should be aware of the risk that he or she is
running as a consequence of this action,'' said Gleich, a
physician. ``We have sufficient evidence that links the contaminant
to disease that we felt it's important to alert consumers to the
potential dangers.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the two scientists have known of the presence of Peak X
in 5-HTP for about two months, but withheld an announcement in
order to accommodate a requirement that papers published in Nature
Medicine not be publicized until the day the journal publishes
them. Such requirements are common among scientific journals.
</P>
<P>
   Gleich and Naylor said they had informed the FDA of their
findings. An FDA spokesman said the agency was studying 5-HTP in an
attempt to see if its chemists also could detect Peak X in current
preparations.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Murray, a Seattle alternative medicine advocate and
author of a current popular book recommending 5-HTP for a variety
of illnesses, dismissed the Mayo report, saying the researchers had
used extremely sophisticated laboratory techniques to detect very
low levels of the contaminant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what the clinical significance of this finding
is,'' said Naylor. He said Peak X never was definitely identified
as the cause of the only case of illness ever linked to it and
added that the Mayo finding did not affect his enthusiasm for
5-HTP.

DECIDING FATE OF AILING JAPANESE BANK IS TEST CASE FOR GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ With markets crumbling at home and around the world, one
of Japan's very large, very frail banks is turning into a critical
test case for the government in its effort to prop up the financial
system here.
</P>
<P>
   The markets are watching nervously to see what happens to
Long-Term Credit Bank, which used to be one of the world's biggest
banks and now appears to be one of the world's shakiest. There is
broad agreement that a serious mistake in handling the bank could
amount to a new blow to international financial stability.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's parliament on Monday began discussions on what to do
with the bank, and the question goes to the heart of Japan's
efforts to revive its economy. Fundamentally, the question is what
to do with huge banks that are as weak as they are gigantic: can
Japan afford to let them fail? Can Japan afford not to let them
fail?
</P>
<P>
   The government of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi insists that
Long-Term Credit and others like it must be rescued, otherwise the
collapse of such a vast institution _ Long-Term Credit Bank has
$175 billion in assets _ would echo around the world and create new
panic.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Obuchi defended the bailout of Long-Term Credit
as the only way to avoid global financial consequences, saying ``it
would have a serious impact at home and abroad'' to leave the bank
to the mercy of market forces.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the government has been trying to force Long-Term Credit
Bank to merge with a stronger bank. Obuchi summoned the head of
Sumitomo Trust &AMP; Banking Co. to his residence to try to force him
to take it over.
</P>
<P>
   But while the government insists that its approach reduces the
risk of a global financial cataclysm, this approach has also turned
off investors who see it as just one more sign that Japan is afraid
of the pain of free markets and is unwilling to allow market
solutions. This perception among investors has added to the
weakness in the Japanese stock and currency markets and has further
eroded the already limited credibility of Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's parliament also began discussions Monday on whether to
use taxpayers' money to rescue the Long-Term Credit Bank, and it is
too soon to know how it will end up. Markets will be jittery in
either case.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition alliance and a wide swath of investors alike are
calling for a ``hard landing,'' a direct slap at the soft-landing
approach favored by the governing Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``A soft landing in Japan means a postponement of
difficulties,'' said Yoshio Suzuki, an opposition Liberal Party
member who was a former executive director of the Bank of Japan,
the nation's central bank. ``Our proposal is a scenario of a hard
landing.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that unhealthy banks, big or small, should be allowed
to fail, once a safety net is put in place. Even now, he said, the
Bank of Japan is prepared to pour liquidity into the marketplace
and to be the lender of last resort.
</P>
<P>
   Critics are furious at the thought of a rescue merger. They see
it as an old-style tactic that in the past has avoided the very
problems _ a weak capital base, piles of bad debt, poor management
and little financial disclosure _ that have festered within Japan's
banking system for years.
</P>
<P>
   `` Market knows best,'' said John Alkire, managing director at
Morgan Stanley Asset &AMP; Investment Trust Co.in Tokyo. ``They have to
kind of purge the system, clear the system and weed out the good
from the bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is that there is a sense of welling anger among
investors who want a clear sign from the government that it will
shed its anti-market ways and adopt modern-style capitalism. In
short, they are daring the government to let a big bank go under.
</P>
<P>
   ``People kind of feel frustrated _ they've lost a lot of money
in Japan,'' said a senior manager of derivatives at a foreign
financial firm, who spoke on the condition he not be identified.
``They're saying, `Let's get some blood because bankers are
extremely highly paid.' They want a pound of flesh for gross
mismanagement.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The government, of course, is petrified of what happens when
banks fail: when they allowed the Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, the
nation's 20th-largest bank, to fail last November, the Nikkei index
of 225 issues soared initially on hopes that the government was
letting the market decide. But the euphoria was short-lived.
Financial chaos ensued, with the collapse of other institutions,
and foreign banks increased interest rates for loans to Japanese
financial institutions. Share prices plummeted, the economy in
Hokkaido (where the bank was based) took a nose-dive, and
government officials rued the day they let a big bank fail.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that while some investors want blood, they will
probably flee at the first sighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is looking for a `Showcase Failure,''' said Michael
Yoshino, a Japanese business expert and a professor at Harvard
Business School. ``Bankers say it wouldn't hurt for one, two, three
major banks to go out of business. But if something happens, it
could trigger a chain of events.''
</P>
<P>
   The concern is the risk of a systemic crisis. If the government
allows one bank to fail, then investors might sell shares in other
banks believed to be on the verge of collapse and such a selloff
could trigger a liquidity squeeze and send another bank under.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, other banks have already begun to worry. Sakura Bank
declared on Monday that it would expand its capital base by 300
billion yen, or about $2 billion, by raising funds from its
shareholding companies, like Toyota Motor Corp. and the Mitsui
Group of companies, which are in close business partnership with
Sakura.
</P>
<P>
   The bank, which itself was the result of a merger of two banks
in 1990, has been pinned down by the market as a weak bank that on
its own might have difficulties surviving the next few years of
financial revamping.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of financial experts are saying that since
allowing banks to collapse would be too terrifying for Japan's
banking system, another solution would be for the government to
nationalize insolvent banks, with the goal of breaking them up. The
Liberal Party is also proposing this as an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``A radical solution is needed,'' said an executive at a foreign
financial firm who spoke on the condition he not be named.
``Effectively, they've got to nationalize the banking system.''
</P>
<P>
   For other investors, however, this would be too far from a
market solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's watching the movie backward,'' Alkire at Morgan Stanley
said. ``I don't think you can nationalize. We're in a free
economy.''

HONG KONG'S MARKET DROPS AFTER GOVERNMENT PULLS BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ The Hong Kong government continued to play
cat-and-mouse with currency traders Monday _ abruptly withdrawing
from the stock market after it had feverishly intervened last week.
Without the government to prop up shares, Hong Kong's market
promptly plunged 7.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the magnitude of the decline, several analysts said the
market had not tumbled as much as they had expected. That may have
been a result of persistent rumors here Monday that the government
would begin buying shares again if the benchmark Hang Seng index
sank below 7,200.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of trading without Hong Kong's most prolific buyer,
the Hang Seng declined 554.7 points to close at 7,275.
</P>
<P>
   Some market experts said the stock market would have to fall
another 8 to 10 percent before it reflected a level free of any
artificial support. But given the Hong Kong government's
uncompromising stance toward the traders _ whom it accuses of
improperly manipulating both its currency and its stock market _
Monday's withdrawal was seen as nothing more than a tactical pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they just stepped away for a moment,'' said Marc
Faber, the head of his own investment advisory firm here. ``They
may have gotten cold feet when they realized that they weren't just
supporting Hong Kong. They were supporting Hong Kong against every
other market in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, last week's intervention enabled Hong Kong to buck a
worldwide swoon in financial markets. And Monday's sharp decline
only reinforced Hong Kong's contrarian bent, since Asia's largest
stock market, Japan, actually eked out a 1.4 percent increase.
Other Asian markets were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   But the deteriorating state of the global economy has made Hong
Kong's campaign to support its market extremely costly. Traders
estimate the government has spent between $12 billion and $15
billion on shares in the last two weeks _ more than half of that in
an extraordinary buying spree on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My honest opinion was that it would trade even lower,'' said
Glenn Lesko, the director of sales and trading at ABM Amro
Securities in Hong Kong. ``There have been so many detrimental
events around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with its vast foreign exchange fund _ worth roughly $97
billion _ most analysts said Hong Kong could not afford a
run-and-gun battle with traders for more than a few weeks. And
experts are now focusing on how Hong Kong officials plan to
extricate themselves from this standoff.
</P>
<P>
   So far, much of the speculation has centered on new regulations
that Hong Kong's financial secretary, Donald Tsang, would like to
place on the market. He proposes to tighten restrictions on the
short-selling of stocks, and to increase disclosure requirements on
investors who purchase index futures contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's Futures Exchange took a half-step in that direction
by tightening its own rules. Starting Tuesday, investors who buy
more than 10,000 futures contracts will have to pay 50 percent more
for margin coverage. More investors who buy contracts will also be
required to disclose their identities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure some will believe that we have tarred our reputation
as the freest market in the world,'' Tsang said in an interview
this weekend on a Hong Kong radio station. ``But they must remember
that there are some points when there are improper, abrupt market
movements.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts said that efforts to cut back on short-selling of
stocks would be easy to get around. For example, investors may be
prohibited from short-selling a blue-chip stock like Hong Kong
Telecom. But they could simply sell short shares of that company in
London or New York.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all the criticism of the intervention, Hong Kong has
struck a chord among people in Asia who fear that the brute force
of the global capital markets is not allowing the region's fragile
economies to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, has drawn wide attention here for advocating
foreign-exchange controls as a way of giving Asian leaders the
breathing space to pursue reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The globalization of the capital markets has gone ahead of
international monitoring, let alone regulation,'' said Ronnie Chan,
a Hong Kong developer who supports intervention. ``In the absence
of international regulations, I understand the motives of a local
government imposing restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with Hong Kong's activist approach may be its
timing. Experts say capital controls would have been much more
effective when Asia was riding high _ and billions of dollars of
foreign investment was flooding in _ rather than during a recession
when Asia desperately needs capital.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of more pressing concern to people here is how Hong Kong plans
to get out of this campaign without huge losses. In a new report,
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. lays out three possibilities, none of them
particularly palatable.
</P>
<P>
   First, the government could stop buying shares and put its faith
in its monetary system. Under that system, which is called a
currency board, the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar
at a fixed exchange rate. When the currency comes under attack from
traders, the government raises interest rates, which encourages
investors to hold Hong Kong dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that a spike in rates would further weaken Hong
Kong's economy and could send the stock market into a renewed
tail-spin.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the government could dissolve the peg and allow the Hong
Kong dollar to float freely, like most other Asian currencies. That
would remove much of the motivation of traders to speculate against
the dollar. But it could also result in a wholesale flight of
capital from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Last, and most radical, the government could scrap the Hong Kong
dollar altogether and replace it with the U.S. dollar. Such a plan
has received attention here recently because, even more than a
floating exchange rate, it would eliminate opportunities for
speculation. But the report is skeptical of so-called dollarization
on both financial and political grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Hong Kong wins this cat-and-mouse game, some experts
worry that the price will be high. ``All of us have a lot of
sympathy with the government's desire to reduce the pain,'' said
Richard Margolis, a strategist with Merrill Lynch. ``But what
they've chosen to do is demonstrably not going to do that.''

AUTO MAKERS SEE TWENTYSOMETHINGS, BOOMERS AS NEW MARKET FOR COUPES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID WELCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Automakers think they have something that both Generation Xers
and baby boomers will agree upon: that two-door coupes are cool.
</P>
<P>
   Waves of 20-somethings are graduating from college and getting
jobs, making empty nesters of their parents. Automakers see this as
an opportunity to sell sportier cars with a little personality
(read: coupes) to both younger buyers with a taste for style, and
the baby boomers who no longer need minivans.
</P>
<P>
   So several automakers have been introducing new two-door models.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics _ including several analysts and consultants _ are
quick to point out that coupe sales have been dropping for years,
while motorists are climbing into trucks, sport utilities and
sedans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a risky segment to go in because it's been a declining
segment,'' acknowledged Alan DeCarr, vice president of sales for
Toyota Motor Sales USA in Torrance, Calif, which just introduced
its new Camry Solara mid-size coupe.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people used to be at a stage where they needed a
minivan,'' he added. ``Where do these people go when they get out
of a minivan?''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the market hasn't shown much interest in coupes yet.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for all coupes, ranging in size from the small Honda Civic
to the burly Cadillac Eldorado, dropped 18 percent in 1996 and
another 9 percent in 1997, according to Ward's Automotive Reports,
a Detroit trade publication. Since 1995, sales have dropped 25
percent to 1.8 million vehicles a year, according to Ward's.
Figures for this year have not been tabulated yet.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, coupes such as Geo Metro, Eagle Talon,
Ford Thunderbird and Probe have become extinct.
</P>
<P>
   Still, automakers keep introducing new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Honda redesigned the two-door Accord last year, Chrysler
released the Sebring and Dodge Avenger two years ago, while General
Motors in the past two years has launched coupe versions of the
Oldsmobile Alero and Pontiac Grand Am and Grand Prix, just to name
a few.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota, for one, explicitly cites baby boomers when discussing
the target audience for coupe. Marketing brass at Toyota reckon
that something like 1.5 million people become empty-nesters every
year.
</P>
<P>
   But the notion that a coupe is a reward vehicle for
empty-nesters has surprised some analysts and consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's manufacturers, despite all evidence to the contrary,
insisting that American auto buyers haven't changed since the
1960s,'' said Eric Noble, principal of Auto Pacific Inc., an
automotive consulting and research firm in Santa Ana, Calif. ``The
reality is, a coupe is not a reward, it's a punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Noble said that only 20 percent of consumers age 50 to 64 that
now drive a mid-size car, such as a Camry, will consider buying a
two-door car next time they shop, according to a survey by Auto
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of buyers in their 30s driving a mid-size car
would consider a two-door, and 29 percent of buyers in the same
segment in their 40s would consider one.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason coupes have been losing popularity is because
they don't offer much in exchange for sacrificing two doors, Noble
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you get in return for what you give up?'' Noble asked.
``Absolutely nothing. You can't even say that most of them get that
much more sex appeal by eliminating the back doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, cars like Pontiac Grand Prix have bold styling and don't
lose much with four doors, said Jim Wangers, senior analyst with
Warren, Mich.-based Automotive Marketing Consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Auto industry insiders won't dispute that the coupe segment has
been shrinking. But some are still optimistic about finding a
profitable niche.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Caddell, general product manager for Chrysler's small-car
operations, insists that two-door cars aren't dying out.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell pointed out that the large coupe segment is hurting the
most. Cadillac, for instance, has made sales gains with all of its
models in the first half of 1998 (before the GM strike) except the
Eldorado, a coupe.
</P>
<P>
   Honda has had success with the two-door Accord, selling 5,000 to
6,000 a month in the United States. Where manufacturers like to
keep 60 days worth of models in their inventory, Honda dealers have
just 10 days worth of two-door Accords, said Art Garner, a Honda
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But even with brisk sales, the coupe accounts for just 20
percent of Accord sales.
</P>
<P>
   Chyrsler's Caddell says the middle of the coupe segment is where
the growth is. That was Chrysler's thinking when the company
brought out the Dodge Avenger and Chrysler Sebring coupes, which
now sell about 80,000 cars a year.
</P>
<P>
   To sell successfully, coupes must have style, comfort and sporty
performance that beats most family sedans but aren't as aggressive
as hot rods or performance sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's Mercury division is chasing younger buyers with the
redesigned Cougar, said Charles Richardson, Cougar assistant brand
manager in Irvine, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury thinks the car will be a success because its styling is
more aggressive than most competitors, and it's fresher than
top-selling two-doors like the Chevrolet Cavalier, Dodge Avenger,
Mitsubishi Eclipse and Saturn SC2, Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   The risk to automakers in launching new coupes is plunging
vehicle development dollars into the segment.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate that Ford probably spent about $500 million to
develop the new Cougar, which is built on the Ford Contour/Mercury
Mystique platform. Using an existing platform reduces costs, but
redesign is still expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota has hedged its costs with Solara by sharing parts with
the Camry. And the company is keeping its expectations in check
with plans to build just 40,000 to 50,000 vehicles in its first
full calender of production next year, DeCarr said.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Toyota sold almost 400,000 Camrys in 1997, making
it the best-selling passenger car in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way to do it, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Wangers said coupes aren't dead. They will find some empty-nest
buyers. And healthy sales among vehicles like the Grand Am two-door
and Chevy Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire coupes show that young
buyers like them.
</P>
<P>
   As long as automakers keep their expectations realistic, a new
coupe can win, the analysts say.

   TECH-MEDIA _ As the Internet has grown in popularity, so has its

defraud and conduct scams. All is not lost, though. There are
plenty of ways to protect yourself. Many of the methods are
described in the September issue of PC World. The magazine

<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY _ The low computer prices are real. But they can be

   MAC-REPORT _ The developers of Mariner Write are nothing if not

   CYBERSCENE _ If you've ever seen the results for one of those

with the Internet's World Wide Web. If you ask your co-workers and

   MONEYTALK _ Even when the stock market goes kablooey, as it did
last week, there are people who still want to get into it. ``How,''
a tenderfoot bargain hunter asked the other day, ``does a person
buy stock if he doesn't have thousands to put into a brokerage
account?'' It's a good question. There are two good answers _
mutual funds that will open very small accounts and direct purchase
or no-load stocks. (Ezell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

responding to a poll commissioned by Sprint, named the computer the
most important back-to-school item. It ranked ahead of calculators,
stereos and televisions. (Clothier, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECHTOOLS _ Perhaps it is something left over from the film
``2001,'' but I have always felt rather self-conscious talking to a
computer. Nonetheless, since publishers are claiming great strides
recently in the advancement of voice recognition systems, I am
talking to mine on a regular basis these days. The results are
mixed, at best. (Warner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-MEDIA _ As the Internet has grown in popularity, so has its
appeal to criminals. They're using it increasingly to steal,
defraud and conduct scams. All is not lost, though. There are
plenty of ways to protect yourself. Many of the methods are
described in the September issue of PC World. The magazine
describes how to foil hackers and thieves, block junk e-mail and
scams and protect your credit card number. (Haddad, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY _ The low computer prices are real. But they can be
misleading, too. I'm not saying the stores are trying to deceive
you. What I am saying is that _ once you get in the store _ you may
find that the bargain basement PCs aren't for you. (Husted, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MAC-REPORT _ The developers of Mariner Write are nothing if not
courageous. They are releasing their simple but powerful word
processor just at the time when more and more people are playing it
safe by choosing Microsoft software. Maybe Write's developers hope
there's still a niche market for those looking for an inexpensive
alternative to Word 98, Microsoft's latest version of its word
processor. (Haddad, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSCENE _ If you've ever seen the results for one of those
surveys about what kind of television people watch, you know most
of us favor educational programs and care nothing at all for the
shows that flaunt sex, violence and lowbrow humor. It's the same
with the Internet's World Wide Web. If you ask your co-workers and
friends how they use the Web, you'll find that almost all of them
are engaged in serious research. (Husted, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MONEYTALK _ Even when the stock market goes kablooey, as it did
last week, there are people who still want to get into it. ``How,''
a tenderfoot bargain hunter asked the other day, ``does a person
buy stock if he doesn't have thousands to put into a brokerage
account?'' It's a good question. There are two good answers _
mutual funds that will open very small accounts and direct purchase
or no-load stocks. (Ezell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

 &HT;    CLINTON, YELTSIN TO OPEN SUMMIT AS RUSSIA POLITICAL CRISIS
DEEPENS
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-PRIMER-0901.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Clinton begins a two-day summit in Russia on
Tuesday much like a tourist searching out a familiar landmark, only
to find it in shambles and with the repairmen brawling.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived in Moscow early Tuesday (scheduled to arrive
7:40 a.m. local time/11:40 p.m. EDT Monday) with no one in charge
and officials warning that the country was on the verge of
political and economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist-dominated Duma, the lower house of parliament,
soundly rejected President Boris Yeltsin's nominee for prime
minister by a more than 2-to-1 margin on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After the embarrassing vote, Yeltsin resubmitted Viktor
Chernomyrdin's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But the impasse left Russia without a permanent government amid
the most serious power rift since Yeltsin ordered army tanks to
fire on dissident parliament leaders in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection of Chernomyrdin also prolonged the uncertainty of
how and when Russia will embark on a plan to fortify the plummeting
ruble and salvage a banking system about to disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   Before departing Washington for Moscow, Clinton said his goal
was to keep Russia ``on the path of reform'' -- and hold Yeltsin,
or his possible successors to a pledge to seek democracy and free
markets since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But in Moscow, the summit Tuesday and Wednesday between Clinton
and Yeltsin, their first since March 1997, was an after-thought
among anxious Russians. In contrived events planned well before
Russia's crisis erupted, Clinton will dart from one photo
opportunity to another -- laying a wreath at Russia's Tomb of the
Unknowns, visiting a school on the first day of classes and
speaking at a school for international relations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also will hold talks with Yeltsin, Chernomyrdin and
opposition parliamentary leaders. But economic turmoil -- not NATO
expansion or nuclear disarmament or the list of usual U.S.-Russia
topics -- will rule the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In just about the only area of agreement since the crisis
erupted in August, both Kremlin officials and their Communist
opponents warned Monday that the outcome of their dispute could be
disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we fail to reach an agreement here, everything will spill
out to the streets,'' said Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this chaos lasts for several more weeks, it may happen that
there will be neither Communists nor us,'' warned Yeltsin's
parliamentary envoy, Alexander Kotenkov. ``I mean a popular
uprising, merciless and senseless.''
</P>
<P>
   The world's second-largest nuclear power is threatened with a
crisis which may take the post-Soviet market reforms with it,
leaving much of what the United States and other Western nations
have sought for Russia in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   ```What I want to do is to go there and tell them that the easy
thing to do is not the right thing to do,'' Clinton said, referring
to pressure on Yeltsin from the Communists to enact Soviet-style
controls on industry and banking. ``The easy thing to do would be
to go back to the way they did it before, and it's not possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Some congressional leaders, including House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., questioned the wisdom of Clinton's trip to Moscow
and its buzzsaw of economic and political problems.
</P>
<P>
   The view from Moscow is that the summit could certainly do no
further harm to the politically enfeebled and isolated Yeltsin. The
trip also allows the United States to broaden its contacts with a
range of political figures -- and potential new leaders in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only thing more dangerous that a nuclear power with
despotic leaders, is a nuclear power with feeble ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain things that the United States cannot afford,
and Number 1 is chaos in Russia. There are too many nuclear
weapons,'' said Viktor Kremenhyuk, an analyst at the U.S.A.-Canada
Institute, a Moscow think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's message to the Russians is much like the message from
a well-meaning hospital visitor at the bedside of a friend: Stay
the course on Western free-market reforms and you'll be on your
feet in no time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our economies are increasingly interconnected ... The reason I
am going to Russia is because we have learned the hard way that
problems that develop beyond our borders find sooner or later their
way to our doorstep unless we help our friends and neighbors to
deal with them as quickly as possible,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is difficult to imagine what tangible support Clinton can
offer in the way of international help at a time when America's
economy is showing signs of decline and Congress is reluctant to
approve further foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned it will
withhold installments on a $22.6 billion support package if Russia
does not stick to economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to calm the fears of the Russian public, Chernomyrdin
announced Monday that the government would guarantee the savings of
every investor in Russia. The question is how, when the government
already cannot afford to pay salaries on time and repay its foreign
loans.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, who served as prime minister from 1992 until March
of this year, was derided by parliament, who called him responsible
for many of Russia's current problems. The vote for confirmation
was 94 for and 253 against; 105 Duma members did not vote.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament leaders agreed to hold talks Tuesday to formulate a
list of alternative candidates for prime minister to submit to
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists and other opposition parties want a prominent
place in the new government, including cabinet seats and a role in
shaping domestic policy.
</P>
<P>
   But if he was still seeking a compromise with the Kremlin after
the vote Monday, the Communist Party leader wasn't sounding
conciliatory. Zyuganov said Chernomyrdin ``does not possess a
single quality necessary for leading the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners also renewed calls for Yeltsin to step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president must guarantee that he will resign after the
government is formed,'' Viktor Ilyukhin, a Communist member of the
Duma said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the constitution, the Duma can vote three times on a prime
minister's nomination. If rejected, Yeltsin can appoint a prime
minister by decree and dissolve the legislature. New elections then
would take place within three months. But that kind of political
brinkmanship could also bring Yeltsin's regime crashing down.

   RUSSIA-CLINTON _ MOSCOW _ Viktor Chernomyrdin's chances of
becoming Russia's new prime minister appeared dim on Monday after
most parliamentary parties came out against him in a first
confirmation debate in the State Duma lower house. Sergei
Reshulsky, a senior Communist official, said before the start of
the debate that Chernomyrdin, prime minister between December 1992
and March 1998, was unlikely to garner more than 120 votes,
including those of his own party, a few dissident Agrarians,
Russian Regions deputies and independents. Will also analyze the

JAPANESE SECURITIES FIRM SEEKS U.S. INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yoshinari Hara, president and chief executive of Daiwa
Securities, is on a mission to New York this week to sell ratings
agencies, financial institutions and investors on the merits of a
purely Japanese securities firm.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be a hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese securities firms have struggled ever since the bubble
economy burst nearly a decade ago. Now deregulation has made things
worse, opening the firms to intense competition from foreign
concerns with expertise in products and services they know little
about.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders have already made big gains in Tokyo Stock Exchange
trading and pension-fund management. Merrill Lynch has taken over
Yamaichi Securities, and Salomon Smith Barney is in a joint venture
with Nikko Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Only Nomura Securities, the brawny leader of Japan's securities
firms, has a chance to survive as an independent, many analysts
suggest.
</P>
<P>
   So in July, when Daiwa, Japan's No. 2 brokerage, announced an
alliance with Sumitomo Bank, it was greeted with something verging
on disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Sumitomo, Japan's No. 2 bank after the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi,
is the core of the keiretsu, or business group, that includes
Daiwa, and the alliance was largely seen as just another case of
circling the wagons.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's Investors Services, which had already put four Daiwa
subsidiaries on notice for a possible downgrade, said the
announcement did little to dispel its concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it lends credibility and substance to the group,''
Leslie Muranyi, senior analyst at Moody's in New York, said of the
alliance. ``But it doesn't provide any new products or services, it
doesn't create a new management structure, and it doesn't provide a
substantial inflow of new ideas and know-how.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ayako Sato, an analyst at Warburg Dillon Read, wrote in a
report, ``We should not expect too much from this merger.''
</P>
<P>
   Hara and his new adviser, Wilbur Ross, a high-profile turnaround
strategist at Rothschild Inc., beg to differ. They see room for a
purely Japanese firm and say Daiwa is redesigning itself to
compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might get higher marks from overseas markets if we tie up
with overseas partners,'' Hara said. ``But since we will be
focusing our business in the Japanese market with Japanese
customers and clients, it is their evaluation that is important.''
</P>
<P>
   That is only partly true. A downgrade by Moody's would push the
ratings of Daiwa's four subsidiaries to junk-bond status, greatly
raising the cost of borrowing abroad.
</P>
<P>
   And with Japanese companies increasingly reliant on capital
markets, not banks, for financing, global investors cannot be
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Ross was retained. ``We wanted to know how we look
from the viewpoint of an overseas business consultant,'' Hara said.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, foreign consultants are usually retained merely as
window dressing. But so far, Ross has operated much the way he
would if working for an American company, calling reporters,
analysts and creditors to sing the praises of the Sumitomo alliance
and pushing Hara to do interviews, including this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge operation in an industry undergoing immense
change,'' said Ross, who has branched out from advising creditors
in bankruptcy cases to representing some of Asia's deeply troubled
corporations. ``Daiwa is undergoing probably the most radical
change of any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and reporters, he argued, have missed the fact that the
Sumitomo alliance will bring $1.25 billion to $2 billion to Daiwa
above and beyond the capital that will be transferred to the three
joint ventures Daiwa will form with the bank.
</P>
<P>
   That chunk of change _ which Ross said would be largely
tax-free, when counted against previous tax losses _ would buy
Daiwa the technical infrastructure it needs, with enough left over
to lure a few foreign professionals to manage new businesses like
derivatives and other exotic securities.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's Muranyi, though, said there was nothing in the numbers
he had seen to indicate that Daiwa would get anything close to that
amount from Sumitomo. He is expected to meet with Daiwa officials
and Ross soon.
</P>
<P>
   Ross also said analysts had not taken adequate account of
Daiwa's strengths in retail brokerage and investment banking and of
the way they will be enhanced by an overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   ``They, meaning Daiwa, haven't done a very good job of telling
people what this means,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Muranyi and other analysts agree that theoretically there are
benefits to the structure Daiwa is adopting, but they say the proof
will be in the pudding.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance is predicated on a reorganization of Daiwa
Securities into a holding company, a structure illegal in Japan
until recently.
</P>
<P>
   That structure, set to be in place by spring, is regarded at
Daiwa as an open invitation to foreign partners, and Hara says he
is in discussions with several foreign firms about running the new
asset-management subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Making an alliance with a separate subsidiary carries far less
risk of exposure to the parent's liabilities, which has been a
major concern of foreign investors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Seven subsidiaries will reside under the Daiwa Securities Group
umbrella. A retail brokerage will be a wholly owned subsidiary
while ownership of three other subsidiaries _ in investment
banking, asset management and risk management _ will be shared with
Sumitomo.
</P>
<P>
   With 300 billion yen in capital, the Daiwa-Sumitomo investment
bank will have the biggest cushion in Japan, Hara said. The
combination of Sumitomo's and Daiwa's asset management groups will
bring together some 3 trillion yen, or almost $21 billion, in
assets _ a drop in the bucket next to the more than $1 trillion
controlled by Merrill Lynch, but a decent-size pool for Japan.
</P>
<P>
   As a holding company, Daiwa may be better able to control costs
by more accurately assessing return on capital for each subsidiary
and using the flexibility the structure gives it to cut labor
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Hara regards Daiwa's commitment to the structure as a clear sign
of its commitment to new ideas. ``It takes a lot of courage to go
ahead and establish a holding company when no one else has done
it,'' he said. ``But we have decided to become a trend-setter. We
have to.''

DEADLINE FOR AN APPEAL IN EXPLOSIVE CASE NEARS IN ALBANY, N.Y. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Tinmes Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ September seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Circle that date on your calendar. That's Sol Greenberg's
deadline to file an appeal in the Jermaine Henderson case.
</P>
<P>
   You might have heard about all this. In October, a black college
student named Jermaine Henderson got into a flap in a bar with a
couple of white, off-duty Albany cops _ a guy named Sean McKenna
and one named William Bonanni. Henderson either did or did not
sucker-punch one of the cops. They busted him and either did or did
not beat the hell out of him later while he was in cuffs in a
police garage.
</P>
<P>
   The office of District Attorney Greenberg was to prosecute
Henderson. A special prosecutor, a lawyer named John Dorfman, was
named by a judge at Greenberg's request to prosecute the cops.
Somehow, though, both prosecutors screwed up the cases, and a judge
threw them all out.
</P>
<P>
   Now leaders of Albany's minority community are furious. They're
begging the federal government to investigate the case as a
potential civil rights violation. Mayor Jerry Jennings pledged to
pursue administrative charges against the cops. That now seems on
hold, however.
</P>
<P>
   Given the complexity of all this, it occurs to me that you might
have a few questions. Well, fire away: Q. Did Henderson really hit
the cop? Did the cops really beat him up when he was in custody?
</P>
<P>
   A. Beats me. I wasn't there. We'll probably never know unless
either or both of these cases make their way into a courtroom with
everybody testifying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did the prosecutors blow this?
</P>
<P>
   A. Each of them let their witnesses testify before separate
grand juries without first getting the witnesses to waive immunity
from prosecution for whatever they said. Under New York law, they
were golden from then on. Dorfman says he let Henderson testify
with immunity because he figured the case against the cops was
hotter stuff. It's not at all clear why Greenberg's office even
bothered with a grand jury. Henderson was charged with a
misdemeanor. The D.A. doesn't need grand jury action to prosecute
that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Would an appeals court would reinstate the charges?
</P>
<P>
   A. Who knows? Dorfman is appealing in the case against the cops.
So far, Greenberg shows no inclination to appeal in the case
against Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why not?
</P>
<P>
   A. His critics surmise _ and they're saying it openly _ that
Greenberg doesn't want anybody prosecuted, especially the cops. The
district attorney works very closely with the police department, of
course. They're charging that he doesn't want testimony in open
court that could incriminate those police officers. He also, by the
way, refuses to go to a judge to get Dorfman authority to prosecute
the cops on perjury charges for what they told the grand jury.
Without that, Dorfman probably doesn't have jurisdiction to go
after them.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why won't Greenberg do that?
</P>
<P>
   A. He claims that the existing court order gives Dorfman enough
authority to go after perjury. Legal people intimately familiar
with the case have told me that's just wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Then, just to be sure, why doesn't Greenberg ask for an
expansion of Dorfman's authority?
</P>
<P>
   A. Good question. By the way, do you smell something really
foul? I could swear that something has died around here.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will the feds get into this?
</P>
<P>
   A. They won't say. Bear in mind that the federal government is
under Democratic control, and Albany is one of the nation's great
Democratic party strongholds. Everybody we're talking about here is
a Democrat. Also, the mayor hasn't asked them to intervene. He has
howled about prosecutorial ineptitude, but that may have less to do
with concern about possible police brutality than with making sure
that neither Dorfman nor Larry Weist, Greenberg's chief deputy,
ends up as D.A. in a few years when Greenberg leaves office.
Jennings plans to back somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you ever heard of a thing like this before?
</P>
<P>
   A. Sure _ decades ago in places where politicians have names
like Billy Bob and Jimmy Joe. But in a northern city at the close
of the 20th century? Uh-uh.

MALAYSIAN PRIME MINISTER TAKES A DIFFERENT ECONOMIC TACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK Thailand _ Driving what he said was the only Asian car
to be parachuted onto the North Pole, Malaysia's prime minister led
what he called the world's longest motorcade this weekend, a convoy
of 1,988 Malaysian-made cars.
</P>
<P>
   It was cheaper than building the world's tallest building,
highest airport control tower or loftiest flagpole _ all of which
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad accomplished when Malaysia was
flush with cash during Asia's miracle years.
</P>
<P>
   But the message was the same. As one group of spectators shouted
while the six-mile-long motorcade drove through the rain on Sunday:
``Malaysia can!''
</P>
<P>
   Boosterism is getting tougher these days as the country's
economic troubles deepen into recession and embolden the political
opposition to Mahathir's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   But the 72-year-old prime minister is fighting back. In what has
been, by Malaysian standards, a lurid back-room brawl, he has
sidelined his increasingly assertive deputy prime minister, Anwar
Ibrahim, and seized control of economic policy in a gamble on the
country's future.
</P>
<P>
   Turning away from the tight fiscal policies Anwar had been
pursuing as finance minister, Mahathir this month reasserted the
expansionist approach he has always favored, lowering interest
rates and raising government spending.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar, 51, who represents a younger political generation, has
been Mahathir's heir apparent for the last six years, promising a
very different, more liberal future for the country.
</P>
<P>
   The odd but successful coupling of their two different styles
and philosophies has been strained over the last year as the
economy soured and as Mahathir rattled foreign investors with his
attacks on currency speculators, neo-colonialists and Jews, all of
whom he said were trying to ruin Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar was left to placate critics and at times to correct
Mahathir's statements, and his profile and popularity rose _
dangerously, as it turned out.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, at the annual general assembly of the ruling
party, Umno, Anwar's supporters tested their strength, mounting a
tentative challenge to Mahathir's leadership. One speech raised
accusations of corruption and nepotism _ code words drawn from the
opposition in Indonesia that successfully toppled former President
Suharto in May.
</P>
<P>
   The backlash was swift. Three editors seen to be aligned with
Anwar were forced from their jobs. The governor of the central bank
and his deputy _ also seen as close to Anwar _ stepped down in
protest against the changes in economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   And Anwar's clout was undermined by the appointment of his
predecessor as finance minister, Daim Zainuddin, as a special
economic adviser to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar got the message and has retreated from the limelight,
ostentatiously supporting Mahathir with statements like, ``Compared
to the prime minister I am just a student; I cannot fight my
teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Anwar is still alive politically, but he is severely wounded,
political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This latest episode has forced open the whole succession
question,'' said Razak Baginda, executive director of the Malaysian
Strategic Research Center. ``A year ago, I would have told you, no
question that it is going to be Anwar. Now I think almost everybody
has doubts that he'll make it to be No. 1.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But as in Indonesia and other nations suffering through Asia's
economic crisis, political maneuvering, even by a master, is no
longer enough. Economic hardships, often subject to forces beyond
national borders, can force political change, as they have already
done in Thailand, South Korea and Japan as well as in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Malaysia announced that it had fallen into its
first recession in 13 years, with its economy shrinking by close to
7 percent after a decade of growth of more than 8 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   The construction sector _ a key barometer of economic health _
was down by 22 percent in the second quarter of the year, compared
with 12 percent growth in the same period last year, the central
bank announced. Nationwide unemployment rose to 6.7 percent in a
country that until recently had to import workers to fill its
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, the currency has lost 40 percent of its
value against the dollar, and the stock market has lost 75 percent
of its total worth. More than 2,600 people are losing their jobs
every week, according to the Human Resources Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, with Daim crafting an economic policy closer to
Mahathir's heart, the government launched a stimulus package called
the National Economic Recovery Plan. It aims to hold down
unemployment and keep businesses alive by lowering interest rates,
pouring money into construction projects and financing lending by
debt-ridden banks.
</P>
<P>
   The plan goes against economic orthodoxy and the prescriptions
fostered in the region by international lenders. Daim described it
as ``a package of programs to restructure the financial and
corporate sectors without abandoning our social agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also broke with the government's insistence on rosy
pronouncements, conceding, ``We are facing reality now and saying
the good old days will not return.''
</P>
<P>
   The period of denial in Malaysia is over, said an artist who,
like many people in Malaysia, insisted that his name not be printed
for fear of political repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nerves are raw now,'' the artist said, adding that he was
speaking for his friends in Malaysia's middle class. ``We know
things are going to be very hard, going to be terrible. So people
are watching really carefully. There's no way anymore to go about
hoodwinking the public.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean you can't have a big party, maybe even the
biggest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   For its national day celebration Monday, Malaysian officials
were preparing what they call the world's biggest beach party,
along with the world's biggest outdoor buffet, honored with the
world's biggest pop-up greeting card.

easy to miss. Perhaps appropriately, one must bow one's head to see
it.
</P>
<P>
   The simple brass plaque in the pavement at the Tunnelgatan
entrance to the Hotorget subway station reads: ``On this spot
Sweden's Prime Minister Olof Palme was killed.''
</P>
<P>
   People by the scores find it daily, though, drawn to the site
where many Swedes think their country began to lose its way.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Palme was killed, we were an innocent, virgin country,''
said Nina Ersman, a Swedish diplomat, expressing the common view
that the assassination profoundly altered Sweden's view of itself
as the unassailable guardian of the world's social conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Palme, a statesman who aroused intense opinions by speaking out
forcefully against apartheid in South Africa, U.S. actions in the
Vietnam War and intolerance in general, was shot in the back by a
lone gunman on the night of Feb. 28, 1986, as he was walking home
from the movies with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 years since that convulsive event have not been kind to
Sweden's sense of itself as decent, efficient and distant from the
tensions and treacheries of the rest of the world. If a certain
fatalism took hold of the country at that moment, it has been
deepened by the hapless performance of the police, which has left
the case still unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the act itself was a national catastrophe, what has
turned out to be an enormous setback is that the authorities have
been unable to handle the case in a way that has not been open to
criticism,'' said Defense Minister Bjorn von Sydow. ``It has proved
to be too great an event for our local police.''
</P>
<P>
   Arne Ruth, an author and former editor in chief of the newspaper
Dagens Nyheter, was more blunt. ``After the assassination,'' he
said, ``the total failure of the judicial system to handle the case
was in a way an even worse disaster for Sweden.''
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry has been repeatedly sidetracked by disputes and
scandals that have forced the resignations of a justice minister, a
police chief and other officials.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, self-styled ``private investigators'' have
produced increasingly bizarre versions of who was behind the
killing, variously accusing the CIA, the Mafia, NATO, Kurdish
rebels, the renegade Italian Masonic lodge P-2, the Israeli
intelligence agency Mossad, South African defenders of apartheid,
local right-wing businessmen, Stockholm police officers angered at
wage cuts, a Finnish bodybuilder and an unnamed member of the staff
of former President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are mostly made up by sick people,'' said Marten Palme,
the late prime minister's 36-year-old son, who was with his father
the night he was killed. ``I've had some of them call and apologize
to me after they received medication and got better.''
</P>
<P>
   Marten Palme, an associate professor at the Stockholm School of
Economics, said the remaining family _ his mother, Lisbet, 67, and
brothers Joakim, 40, a sociologist, and Mattias, 30, an architect _
are largely able to ignore the continuing furor now. ``The most
important thing for our family is to know what happened that
night,'' he said, ``and we feel we do.''
</P>
<P>
   They are convinced that the killer was Christer Pettersson, 51,
a confessed drug addict and alcoholic who was convicted of the
murder and sentenced to life in prison in 1989 but then freed later
that year by an appellate court. He had spent much of the previous
20 years in jail, with a record of 63 arrests, including one for
having stabbed a drug dealer to death with a bayonet in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Swedish criminal law is heavily weighted toward defendants'
rights, and the higher court said the evidence used to convict
Pettersson was too circumstantial. He received about $40,000
compensation for wrongful jailing; he has maintained his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   An effort by prosecutors to reopen the case against him this
spring failed when a Supreme Court panel ruled on May 27 that new
witness testimony did not justify a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   The justices also faulted prosecutors for failing to establish a
motive or find the .357 Magnum that fired the bullets recovered
from the scene. For years police divers have been looking for the
pistol in the canals and waterways of Stockholm, a city built on
islands in the Baltic Sea.
</P>
<P>
   As for the motive, Swedes have wrestled with reconciling
themselves to the notion that a society they long proclaimed to be
the world's most rational may have been transformed by a senseless
act.
</P>
<P>
   Swedes have burdened the Palme assassination with being the
inspiration for a series of unrelated accidents and violent
episodes in the last dozen years. It has become a familiar if
disjointed recital here _ the sinking of a ferry in 1994 that
killed nearly 1,000 people, the machine-gun killing of seven people
by a berserk army lieutenant the same year, the attack a year later
that killed four people and wounded 20 by a young man retaliating
with an assault rifle for having been denied admittance to a
discotheque.
</P>
<P>
   The Palme case is often compared to the investigation of the
assassination of President Kennedy. ``But in the case of President
Kennedy, you had technical evidence and some suggestion of
motivation,'' said Defense Minister von Sydow. ``We're lacking
both.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The night he died, Palme had gone to the downtown Grand Cinema
with his wife, his son Marten and Marten's girlfriend. On leaving,
the Palmes said good night to the young couple and turned to walk
down Sveavagen, a broad, tree-lined central boulevard. They were
headed for the subway station three blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a remarkable thing for a Swedish prime minister to
move about unprotected, a fact that was to be recalled repeatedly
and ruefully after the killing, as permanent security guards were
assigned to the country's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   As they passed an artists' supply shop, a figure emerged from
the shadows, fired a shot that passed through Palme's back and
upper chest and a second shot that grazed Mrs. Palme. Then the
assassin ran along the dark side street and up a flight of stone
stairs at its end two blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever come forward to say he or she saw the man fire
the gun. At the 1989 trial, Mrs. Palme identified Pettersson as a
man who had glared at her with a hostile expression as her husband
lay dying. The accuracy of her recollection was challenged by
defense lawyers because three years had passed since the killing.
</P>
<P>
   In court, Pettersson greeted her claim by shouting out, ``Olof
Palme is in his heaven, and he would not like what you are saying,
but if you believe it, it is OK!''
</P>
<P>
   Pettersson testified that at the time of the shooting he had
fallen asleep on a commuter train headed for his suburban home.
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence that prosecutors presented to the Supreme Court
in December came from four witnesses, two of whom knew Pettersson
before, who said they had seen him both outside the movie theater
and running down the cross street after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Tuve Johansson, one of 15 detectives still working the case,
said his men would continue to seek the weapon and follow up leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get lots of tips,'' he said. ``They're coming in all the
time, but they are mostly ones we have seen before. It's very
important to find the weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if they were pursuing anyone besides Pettersson, he said,
``We're not investigating just him, but he is a very interesting
one.''

 &HT;    Readin', writin' and wranglin': The annual clash between parents
and educators begins
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When school reformers demand ``choice'' in public
education, they usually mean the right for parents to choose their
kids' schools, a practice that some systems allow. But there's a
subtler choice movement afoot, and it's affecting probably every
public school in the country.
</P>
<P>
   More and more parents of elementary students are demanding to
choose the teachers who will educate their kids. They write letters
during the summer requesting particular instructors. When classroom
assignments are posted, some receive their wishes, while
disappointed parents park themselves in front offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now every principal can expect to be confronted with this
during the opening of schools,'' says Crawford Lewis, DeKalb
County, Ga.'s executive director of instruction. Lewis, who was a
principal for 13 years, says, ``It's become bigger and bigger every
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The cause of this behavior is open to debate. Regardless of
whether it's because of the changing quality of teachers, or a
tendency among '90s parents to obsess over their children, the tug
of war over teacher choice gives administrators a stomachache.
</P>
<P>
   June Million, spokesman for the National Association of
Elementary School Principals, says, ``It is one of the most talked
about things when principals get together.''
</P>
<P>
   Few, if any, schools give parents free rein to choose teachers.
But many do at least consider requests. In the absence of hard and
fast rules, each principal has a different approach and policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't put gag orders on people. I don't say we won't
listen,'' says Lee Friedman, principal at Sarah Smith Elementary in
Atlanta. ``But we won't promise anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, at Oak Grove Elementary in Cherokee County, Ga.,
parents may submit requests for teachers. ``We try to give them due
consideration,'' says Principal Tommy Daniel.
</P>
<P>
   But such requests aren't considered at Haynes Bridge Middle
School in Alpharetta, Ga. ``Parents can write a letter and discuss
the type of learning environment and teaching style they want,''
says Principal Debbie Reeves. ``They cannot request a particular
teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves says this policy is a necessity because of logistics.
``Let's be realistic. What happens if you have 1,000 parents that
request one specific teacher?''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Swahn, president of the North Fulton (County, Ga.) Council
of PTAs, agrees. Accepting requests from parents creates a
``scheduling nightmare'' and makes the principal prey to too many
pressures, she says. ``I don't like to see a principal be a
pushover.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, say other parents. What if it's your child who
happens to be miserable?
</P>
<P>
   Tarin Hampton's son Jamiel had problems communicating with his
fourth-grade teacher.``She didn't really baby them,'' Hampton says.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting the teacher and reaching an impasse, Hampton tried
to get Jamiel switched to another class at his school. ``Their
response was, `We don't do it just because parents ask. We try to
rectify the problem.'''
</P>
<P>
   That solution didn't satisfy Hampton, who eventually moved
Jamiel, now an eighth-grader, to a ``theme school.''
</P>
<P>
   Other parents would rather fight than switch schools.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Dale says she requested that her younger daughter,
Naomi, not be assigned to a particular team of sixth-grade teachers
at Inman Middle School in Atlanta. She wanted to avoid a teacher
who, she says, failed to challenge her older son, Avery, leaving
him so bored he got into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help. Naomi got just the teacher she didn't want. So
Barbara Dale pitched a fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was this madwoman,'' she says, sounding abashed. ``I think
it was terribly inappropriate. But I got exactly what I went in
there for.''
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with being a squeaky wheel, says Cathy
Henson, president of the Georgia PTA, whose child attends a Cobb
County, Ga. school. With school choice a hot topic among activists,
parents should have the basic choice, ``the ability to choose your
child's teacher,'' she argues. Henson says parents know the needs
of their children as well as administrators do.
</P>
<P>
   Henson's concern, though, is that active parents who volunteer
regularly are given a de facto choice. The principal assigns their
children to A-list teachers without being asked, as a form of
reward. Other parents, who might request those teachers, are told
that the school doesn't honor requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents should have the right to request certain teachers,''
Henson says, ``and it should be extended to all parents, not just
the ones fortunate enough to be at the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Most principals will defend the quality of their teachers,
however, and deny the suggestion that they harbor incompetents. ``I
have two children here myself. I'd put them in anybody's class
because I do not have a weak teacher,'' says Friedman.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis says teacher assignments aren't made as rewards for
parents. He says classes are assembled by teachers and principals
according to other more important criteria: a diverse mix of
abilities, gender, race and background and a good match between
teaching and learning styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to stick to your guns,'' he says. ``You're not a
principal for the PTA folks, you're a principal for all the
folks.''
</P>
<P>
   If a parent is convinced that the child must switch teachers, it
can often be done. But it takes time, says Toni
Furman-Eichelberger, a school mother pursuing a doctorate in
education at Clark Atlanta University and writing a dissertation on
parental involvement in schools. Furman-Eichelberger says parents
who work within the system ``can get anything they want that is
conducive to the best educational experience for the child.''
</P>
<P>
   But trying to pick the best teachers is often problematic, says
Gary Henry, director of Georgia's Council for School Performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like trying to outguess the experts in the stock
market,'' says Henry, a professor at Georgia State University.
</P>
<P>
   Parents sometimes base their choices on personal relationships
rather than ability. ``It's a fact that it's a headache for the
principals,'' says Henry, who suggests that parents turn that
energy toward helping kids with their homework.
</P>
<P>
   Karen LeBleu, a fifth-grade teacher, says being chosen by a
parent is an ego boost, but not a reliable indicator of teacher
quality. ``Just because they don't choose a certain teacher doesn't
mean that teacher isn't well-qualified,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Parents and principals are divided as to why this generation is
more intent than the previous one on managing its offspring's
school experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have less stability in the teaching force. Parents know
fewer of the teachers from year to year,'' which leads to
insecurity and doubts, says Henry.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Dale says she thinks her parents ``were satisfied with
less,'' and that today there is more pressure to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel, a principal, points out that baby boomer parents grew up
questioning authority. ``Maybe this generation is holding public
agencies more accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps it's because parents hold themselves less
accountable, says Friedman. ``I think to a great extent we don't
take responsibility for our own actions, and (we) tend to place
blame on others,'' he says. ``If the kid's not getting along with
the teacher, then it's the teacher's fault.''

 &HT;    How to get class changed
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Toni Furman-Eichelberger, who is pursuing a doctorate
in education at Clark Atlanta University, has become something of a
parent's advocate in the DeKalb County and Atlanta school systems.
She contends that only about 2 percent of students are ill-suited
to their teachers. But if you must switch your child, this is how:
</P>
<P>
   _ Be familiar with the school. Volunteer; spend time helping in
the classroom. Observe the class.
</P>
<P>
   _ Try to work with the teacher. Keep an open mind. Document your
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never criticize the teacher in front of the child. ``If you
feed that child with negative information, he's going to be
negative in that class.''
</P>
<P>
   _ If, after three meetings with the teacher, there is still a
problem, then begin working with the principal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Base your request on educational needs. For example: ``I would
like for my child to have this particular teacher because of my
son's strong interest in science and this teacher's master's in
science.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Failing a satisfactory solution, move up the chain of command
to the school board.
</P>
<P>
   Can parents succeed in getting action? ``People do not know how
powerful parents are in the school,'' Furman-Eichelberger says.
``Believe me, if they stay calm and rational and have legitimate
reasons, they will.''

 &HT;    TV Preview: ``Nathalie Dupree Entertains''
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOCIAL CIRCLE, Ga. _ A serene Nathalie Dupree is staring at
dozens of cardboard boxes stacked waist high in an upstairs bedroom
of her recently renovated Victorian home in Social Circle and doing
something that would likely give fellow TV cook Martha Stewart
hives: celebrating an imperfection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Books,'' Dupree says calmly as her voice lifts into an
impromptu sing-song soprano. ``These are books ... more books.''
</P>
<P>
   The great wall of boxed tomes stands as a testament to Dupree's
long, long still-to-do list as she completes the move she started
more than five months ago from mega-cushy Ansley Park to this more
laid-back, historic, one-stoplight town 45 miles east of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Add to Dupree's list the equally imposing mound of boxes on the
second-story landing filled with hundreds of videotapes from her
wildly popular TV cooking shows. And the wall-to-wall sea of
glassware, knick-knacks and boxes that floods another upstairs
bedroom with enough apparent weight to cripple, if not sink, the
Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anybody who has a serene life,'' Dupree says.
``Do you? (pause) I didn't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people flee their homes during a renovation, opting for
live-in hotel chain suites to avoid the constant barrage of
painters, cabinetmakers and swirls of dust. But Dupree's built her
career by teaching the average cook to charge ahead no matter what
(``Something spills or breaks,'' she says. ``Big deal.''). So she
chose to film her 10th television cooking series at home while
renovating.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, her new Georgia Public TV-produced ``Nathalie Dupree
Entertains'' debuts on WGTV in Georgia, giving her fans their first
glimpse at the completed and elaborately decorated first-floor
rooms in her new digs. Later this fall, the series, based on her
new book, ``Nathalie Dupree's Comfortable Entertaining,'' will
begin airing on PBS stations across the country, including Los
Angeles, Chicago and Dallas. She will be in New York next Tuesday
to promote her new show and book on ``Today,'' and she has already
done or scheduled interviews for stories in USA Today, People and
House Beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Five rooms are fully finished, and those watching the 26
half-hour shows and three hour specials for ``Dupree Entertains''
will venture into most of them. There's the formal living room and
adjacent parlor, both bathed in glorious mustard-yellow walls and
furnished with a heady mixture of Dupree's personal antiques,
deep-cushioned sofas from Rooms to Go (donated for her show) and
lusciously painted artwork and collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   The dining room sports a 1920s French maple chocolate cabinet
(purchased recently at one of Social Circle's cache of antiques
shops one block away from her front door) and two large rectangular
glass tops sitting on Romanesque columns used as dining tables and
separated to make a center-of-the-room walkway. The all-white back
porch with wraparound windows is casually furnished with wicker.
It's where Dupree reads and she and husband Jack Bass eat supper.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there's the kitchen, the showplace of ``Dupree
Entertains,'' with a 4-foot-long butcher block island of Georgia
pine; tiered, dark-marble counter tops; old-color cabinets crafted
by Georgia artist Andy Inglett; and an intoxicatingly vibrant
picture window above the sink that lets in glorious natural light
while Dupree is on camera.
</P>
<P>
   Touches of Dupree's whimsy surface here and there. In the
downstairs bath, a colorful wooden female figure (the perennial
bridesmaid, Dupree says. ``She makes some men nervous.'') wears the
prestigious James Beard medal Dupree won for a cookbook. Just
outside the back door, a discarded bathtub is a container for
vibrant, sweet-smelling basil.
</P>
<P>
   Living here, Dupree says, makes her feel as though she's come
home. She had a restaurant in Social Circle in the early '70s, and
when her former mother-in-law and good friend Celeste Dupree, a
fierce preservationist, purchased the 1910 home for less than
$300,000 and offered Nathalie a deal to return, she set about
writing this new chapter in her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very happy house, a very accommodating house,'' Dupree
says, sitting on a dark tanned sofa in her immaculate parlor. ``See
the wavery glass in that window? It's the original glass. There's
something about the wavery glass that makes being here seem surreal
and another time and place. It just takes you away from time and
you don't push the same way. All of a sudden, you are just
relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   You can sense her comfort. She's attired in a formal, deep-blue
silk wrap dress and large pearl necklace for some of the
photographs to be shot this day but has placed her feet inside
everyday bone-colored satin house slippers.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when a photographer preparing to snap the living room
suggests that an umbrella container is sprouting too many
bumbershoots, Dupree momentarily halts an interview, gathers up the
offending rain gear in her arms, returns to the sofa and plops back
down. Her lap's now a resting spot for a gangly bundle of
umbrellas.
</P>
<P>
   It's another unconsciously anti-Martha Stewart moment.
</P>
<P>
   Dupree is unflappable. And her fans and friends love her for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Nathalie, there is no such thing as a faux pas,'' says
longtime pal and admirer Bob Furnad, CNN Headline News president
and Social Circle resident. Furnad and his wife, Barbara Morgan,
have already been guests in Dupree's new home, and he describes the
feeling of visiting there as ``easy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nathalie is not one who makes a dinner party something
difficult,'' he says. ``It's not something that's got her tied in
knots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to watch her show every week,'' says Dupree fan Barbara
Hall, 49, of Warner Robins. ``One thing I like about her is that
she makes mistakes every now and then and she says you'll do better
at home. Everything is not edited out. It's real.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's ``Dupree Entertains'' boldly carries on the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   There Dupree is on camera, fidgeting with three different gas
burners until she lights the right one, talking stream-of-conscious
about the lemon souffle dessert she's making until she realizes the
gelatin warming on the stove has burned black.
</P>
<P>
   It's a mixture of right-way, wrong-way demonstrations that
culminates in an attractive presentation of delectable sweets for a
grand dessert party.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to inspire average cooks. Dupree wants them to reach
toward a pleasing style of entertaining that makes guests feel
comfortable and lovingly fed in an environment that underscores
personal expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything clean and everything perfect and everything
bow-tied means you are trying to impress people rather than express
yourself,'' Dupree says. ``How boring it would be for everyone to
have the facade of perfection. Life is very boring that way. A
perfect house is boring _ where nothing has any rough spots.''
</P>
<P>
   To underscore her point, she leads a visitor to her backyard
garden. There amid the herbs and flowering plants is a beautiful
border made of chipped and broken china in various patterns. The
pieces are personal relics: remnants of plates that cracked when
washed in too-hot water, serving bowls from her old restaurant that
faltered over time and saucers that just last month broke in a
dining room accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my china garden,'' Dupree says. ``I can enjoy them out
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Laid to rest in the dirt, their imperfection is perfectly
charming.

 &HT;    On The Newsstand: Women can now go Outside
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally, there's a women's magazine that doesn't feature
articles about hair care or Demi Moore's marital woes. Making its
debut this week, Women Outside ($3.95) is aimed at a female
audience more interested in taking a road trip across the
Australian outback or dancing with the wolves of Yellowstone.
</P>
<P>
   Editors Susan Casey and Laura Hohnhold say they want to continue
the tradition that Outside magazine started 21 years ago. ``We
borrow from Outside the assumption that our readers are interested
in a wide range of topics, and that you love books and films and
the Internet as much as you love to travel, ski, hike, paddle and
climb,'' says Casey, creative director of Outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see funky outdoor clothing and a lot of very cool gear
in these pages, but you won't see the words empowerment or
self-esteem. We're a couple of decades beyond that, and we figure
you are, too. We like to think of Women Outside as simply more of a
good thing _ Outside with an estrogen chaser.''
</P>
<P>
   The premier issue is impressive: Sara Corbett describes her
journey across the Australian outback in a Subaru station wagon;
Hollywood stunt women put the latest outdoor clothing through a
strenuous workout; and a six-page section introduces some neat
gear, from a $650 mountain bike to an assortment of knives and
other sharp objects. Now the bad news: The next issue of Women
Outside won't be on newsstands until spring 1999.
</P>
<P>
   PRIDE OF THE YANKEES: The September issue of GQ ($3.50) is
fashion-heavy as usual, but there are some meaty articles if you
can wade through the clothing ads. Peter Richmond's cover story on
New York Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter reveals a young man who has a
heart as well as a sensational talent. Jeter started a foundation
for troubled kids after his first year in the majors and hired his
father to run it. And, no, there's no juicy gossip about his
relationship with Mariah Carey. Also of note: Steven Kotler's
fascinating profile of Clinton nemesis John Whitehead, the
conservative millionaire who funded Paula Jones' lawsuit. As
founder of the Rutherford Institute, Whitehead believes in God,
democracy and the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   THE NEWSWEEKLIES: It was a stormy week for news, as reflected by
Time, Newsweek and U.S. News &AMP; World Report. All offer in-depth
packages on the Russia crisis (most used headline: ``Russian
Roulette''), with takeouts on the fallout in political and global
markets. U.S. News writes about ``The cloud over Gore'' in the Reno
investigation into campaign fund-raising, and a Time story
headlined ``Stormy weather'' details how the the president is
trying ``to survive the (political) tempest.'' Meanwhile, real
hurricanes are featured in ``The Storms of August'' in Newsweek,
and Time rates the network coverage of Bonnie (CNN got 4 out of 5
umbrellas, Weather Channel only 2 1/2).
</P>
<P>
   For relief from maelstrom coverage, Time offers a life-size
replica of House Speaker Newt Gingrich's hand, explaining that
recently he tried to set a Guiness Book record as national public
figure who shook the most hands (3,609) in the shortest amount of
time (six hours). The replica is based on a fax sent to the
magazine ``by the Speaker himself,'' and readers are urged to help
Gingrich hold on to his new handshaking fame by cutting out the
hand and giving ``the Speaker a shake or two.''
</P>
<P>
   QUICK READS: Elmore Leonard wasn't always a best-selling writer.
In an inspiring essay in P.O.V. ($2.95), the author of ``Get
Shorty'' and ``Out of Sight'' describes his life as a 25-year-old
married guy writing pulp fiction for two cents a word. ... People
($2.79) looks at famous couples who have gotten entangled in the
adultery web (Gary and Lee Hart, Frank and Kathie Lee Gifford, et
al) and how their experiences can help the Clintons.

 &HT;    Commentary: `Inappropriate' doesn't come from the penitent's
heart
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the good things about growing up Catholic was that your
sins were between you and your maker, not you and the media. In the
dark of the confessional you told the priest what you'd done, how
you'd slipped up and how you were going to redouble your efforts
not to be back the next week repenting the same sin you'd been
repenting for what seemed like your whole life.
</P>
<P>
   As God's liaison the priest had authorization to wipe your slate
clean, and after a few inaudible murmurings he would tell you to go
in peace and sin no more. There's nothing like the feeling of
complete absolution. Many were the Saturday afternoons I'd leave
that church and break into a skip, grateful I hadn't been struck by
a thunderbolt since my last visit and assured that if one struck me
now I at least wasn't going to the hot place.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling didn't last long, and as I got older it sometimes
didn't even carry over till the next morning. I learned there are
commandments that I'm always going to have trouble with. But one
thing I don't recall saying in the confessional was that I'd done
something ``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   I just said guilty again, Lord, and hoped for a break.
</P>
<P>
   It takes awhile to get straight what's right, what's wrong and
what's inappropriate. If right leads to heaven and wrong to hell,
then maybe inappropriate leads to purgatory, a kind of waiting room
for those whose case has been taken under advisement by a higher
court.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, one of our children manfully agreed to write a
few paragraphs explaining some actions of his that had met with our
displeasure. They were nothing outrageous, not even something I'd
have carried to the confessional, but it would do him good to
ponder them on paper.
</P>
<P>
   We happen to believe that the best way to find out what you
really think about something is to write about it. So he wrote a
couple of paragraphs in which he told us he understood the larger
point we were trying to make and, the heat having subsided, was
sorry it happened. Reading it, I thought, ``This is pretty good.''
It was a personal accounting more than an act of contrition, and I
was proud of him.
</P>
<P>
   I was thinking this as I got to his final sentence, always the
one to take greatest care with. He could have ended matters a
sentence earlier, but some compulsion drove him to say one thing
more, to lay on a final coat of varnish for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   His actions were, he said, inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   When has a word been given such a ride as President Clinton has
given this bloodless clunker? A person can't acknowledge his
actions anymore without getting in touch with the times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't use educationese, management mumbo-jumbo or therapists'
words,'' I said. ``Those are words of indirection and evasion. If
you're sorry, say that. If you think you were wrong, say that.
Maybe you think (BEGIN ITAL) we're (END ITAL) wrong; you can say
that, too. But use real words, not this counterfeit currency you
hear on TV and read in the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the weirder consequences of President Clinton's attempts
to explain his ``relationship'' with Monica Lewinsky is that the
styles of public and private confession have merged. Turn on the
radio and within 15 minutes somebody's going to be calling
something ``inappropriate.'' The word is popping up everywhere, and
not only in reference to President Clinton. (It was a standby in
Dr. Laura's lexicon long before anyone had ever heard of l'Affaire
Lewinsky, which is ironic. For all her faults, you have to grant
her one thing: She has no patience with the namby-pamby coinages of
psychobabble.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Inappropriate'' threatens to replace ``a mistake in
judgment,'' the kind of phrase you hear from a congressman caught
in the washroom with a 13-year-old or a treasurer who's been making
himself personal loans from the company pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   The congenitally tone-deaf will ever be with us, the people who
habitually speak of impacting this and utilizing that. But there
are others who choose not to say what they mean. When silence is
not an option, there is refuge in remoteness. It's built into the
Bill of Rights, although it looks bad to take the Fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the wall separating the public and private collapsed
and lying in a heap, too many of us sound like robots and
mannequins, parroting the prefabricated words we've heard on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what they mean? Confession isn't the same as
self-exoneration, any more than absolution is the same as damage
control. The one is redemptive, the other merely deflective. The
one is good for the soul, the other bad for the public image. Once
a penitent opens his mouth these days, you know which one he values
more.

SCIENTISTS LOOK FOR NEW TREATMENTS FOR BOTULISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Grace Wheeler is meticulous about taking steps to
prevent botulism when she cans vegetables from her East Greenbush,
N.Y., garden.
</P>
<P>
   But every three months, she voluntarily gets eight shots of the
potentially lethal toxin injected into the muscles of her neck.It
sounds odd, but this toxin, tamed and distilled, is being used to
treat everything from muscle disorders to wrinkled skin.
</P>
<P>
   At Albany Medical Center, researchers are testing yet another
type of botulism in hopes of offering a more effective treatment to
people who've developed immunity to the current strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard about it, I had a lot of questions,'' said
Wheeler, 64, who suffers from involuntary muscle contractions in
her neck.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of people, she was skeptical that the botulinum
toxin, which can cause death by paralysis when consumed in its
natural state, could alleviate her embarrassing muscle spasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``My head would swing to the left whether I wanted it to or
not,'' she said. ``If you've ever had this problem, you'll say to
yourself, `I have to try something.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some 300,000 Americans suffer similar symptoms from a group of
movement disorders known as dystonias. Characterized by twisting
repetitive movements, dystonias usually affect only a small part of
the body.
</P>
<P>
   A neck contorts sideways, or a hand cramps into a claw. Some
people's eyes twist shut, rendering them briefly unable to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people get dystonias of the vocal chords and they talk
like this,'' said Albany neurologist Dr. Stewart Factor, lowering
his voice into a harsh rasp.
</P>
<P>
   There is no known cause or cure. Until recently, physicians have
been limited in their ability to treat these problems. The most
common approach was a variety of neuromuscular drugs, effective
only in a minority of patients and usually with severe side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   That was before Dr. Alan Scott, a California ophthalmologist,
began tinkering with the botulinum toxin type A more than 15 years
ago to treat a pediatric eye muscle disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The toxin itself was formally recognized in 1793 when 13 Germans
reportedly shared a contaminated sausage. All became ill and six
died. The illness was later named botulism after the Latin word for
sausage.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria to blame was Clostridium botulinum, which naturally
occurs in the soil and thrives in conditions of low oxygen. Only
temperatures above 158 degrees Fahrenheit can kill it.
</P>
<P>
   That's why people who can their own vegetables are urged to take
proper precautions by using a pressure cooker and following proper
sanitizing directions.
</P>
<P>
   In their laboratory, Scott and his associates figured out a way
to capitalize on the toxin's natural abilities to cause paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   By injecting small amounts of purified botulinum toxin into the
afffected muscles, they realized they could block transmission of
the nerve impulses that cause some muscles to uncontrollably
contract with minimal side-effects.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Food and Drug Administration approved the toxin for
therapeutic purposes in 1990, no one has contracted botulism from
the injections, primarily because the dosage is so small or about
10 times less than the amount needed for a poisoning problem.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the laboratory toxin is less virulent than what
you'd encounter in contaminated food because it includes only the
protein, not the bacteria that facilitates the reproduction of the
toxin throughout the body's systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not infectious,'' said Dr. Eric Molho, a neurologist at
Albany Medical Center. ``There is no bacteria in there at all. You
can drink it and nothing would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are now trying to improve on that initial discovery
by studying a different strain of the botulinum toxin, type B. It's
believed to have fewer side effects and provide another alternative
to people who have developed immunity problems to type A.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 18 months, some 200 people across the country,
including 33 patients at Albany Medical Center, have been getting
regular injections, usually every three months, of botulinum toxin
type B to test its effectiveness. So far, both physicians and
patients are pleased with the results. The FDA could approve toxin
type B as early as 1999.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news especially for Wheeler, who works as a bank
customer representative. Two years ago, she realized that type A
was no longer working as well, even with an increased dosage. The
last thing she wanted was a return to the kinds of problems she had
in the early 1980s, when she was first afflicted with her dystonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask questions,'' she said. ``I've had people stop me in
the street. I had a woman stop me and say, `have you been to a
chiropractor?' Some are very rude and some are just plain
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Dystonia isn't just a matter of an occasional muscle spasm.
Depending on the location of the dystonia, the condition can limit
people's ability to walk, eat and breathe. Only when the brain
relaxes does the body get relief.``It goes away only when they
sleep,'' Molho said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do the injections work for everyone. Some people have
dystonias over too wide an area or in areas impossible to reach
with a hypodermic needle.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Greenberg, 47, of Clifton Park, considers herself
fortunate that her dystonia has been confined to the muscles in her
neck since she was diagnosed with the problem in 1988. Though rare,
some dystonias run in the family. Her daughter Melissa, now 20,
developed the disorder in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``My chin would slam into my shoulder,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she has no apparent problems, though she knows when her
shot is wearing off and its time for another, usually every 3 to 4
months. ``I can usually feel pulling in the muscles in my neck,''
she said. Some plastic surgeons and dermatologists are also finding
that the toxin can work to relax some of the wrinkles around
people's eyes and foreheads.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the toxin takes off as the next cosmetic hit remains to
be seen.
</P>
<P>
   A single dosage can cost as much as $500. And while insurance
companies usually pick up the cost for dystonia patients, they
don't cover cosmetic treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Having lived 16 years with her dystonia, Wheeler isn't
interested. ``I've earned every one of these wrinkles,'' she said.

PRESIDENT OF TAIWAN SEEKS TO END ITS ISOLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Resisting pressure to forge closer ties with
mainland China, President Lee Teng-hui said Monday that he was
seeking to break out of the isolation imposed by China.
</P>
<P>
   In language that contrasted with the vision outlined by Chinese
leaders and by President Clinton during his trip to Beijing two
months ago, Lee in an interview ridiculed Beijing's concept of
``one China'' and emphasized that Taiwan's destiny must be
determined only by the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   He scoffed at suggestions that he work out some kind of deal
with the mainland over Taiwan's future.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's comments, his first to a U.S. publication since Clinton's
trip, underscored Taiwan's growing sense of identity separate from
China. Some U.S. scholars and Washington officials have been
warning that the risk of military conflict is growing, because
Taiwan and China are drifting apart and because Beijing has
increasing doubts that Taiwan will ever voluntarily return to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for more than two hours, in Mandarin, English and
Japanese by turns and occasionally in the same sentence, and always
with exuberance, Lee offered perhaps his clearest statement so far
of his aspirations for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated his official position that Taiwan wants to reunify
with the mainland once China achieves democracy, but he also
referred to reunification in ways that are sure to alarm China's
leaders. Asked if he envisioned reunification as the creation of a
single state or as something looser, like a Chinese version of the
British Commonwealth, Lee grinned and suggested that just about
anything was possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the final form will be _ a federal form, a commonwealth _
we don't know,'' Lee said during the two hour-interview. ``It's too
early to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he said Taiwan was prepared to consider reunification
if China became free and democratic, he made it clear that he
thought this would take decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think how difficult that would be,'' he said. ``It would be
like a miracle happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed on the point, Lee said it might be possible for China to
become democratic in 20 years or more.
</P>
<P>
   He repeatedly complained on Monday about Taiwan's isolation in
the world and said he had been searching for ways to break through
that isolation. He gave no hint of any particular steps he had in
mind, although he made clear that he was not thinking about
concessions to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars, including Joseph Nye, a former assistant
secretary of defense and now dean of Harvard University's Kennedy
School of Government, have proposed package deals intended to
reduce the risk of a war in the Taiwan Strait. The deals usually
include a promise by China not to use armed force, in exchange for
a pledge by Taiwan either that it will not declare independence or
that it will eventually reunify with the rest of China.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was scornful of such proposals, saying they would never
work. Asked why Taiwan is so reluctant to become engaged to the
mainland, when it claims to intend to get married, Lee said the
Taiwanese were afraid of losing their freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prefer the status quo,'' he said. ``We prefer to stay
single. Why get engaged if engagement is equivalent to becoming a
local government and making ourselves slaves?''
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign and local scholars have said the broader problem is
simply that Taiwan is a democracy now, and ordinary Taiwanese have
become increasingly alienated from the mainland, with no intention
of ever tying the knot. In the latest government-sponsored poll,
only 18 percent of people on Taiwan say they want to reunify with
the mainland, even in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of Taiwan's drift from China, a growing number
of Taiwanese say in polls that they see themselves as ``Taiwan
people'' rather than ``Chinese people.'' Asked how he saw himself,
Lee did not hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Taiwan person first and a Chinese person second,'' he
said. ``All of us came a long time ago from mainland China, and we
spend our lives here. So we love this place. But of course, we are
all Chinese as well.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Later, after aides expressed concern at how that comment might
be interpreted, Lee returned to the room and added by way of
explanation, ``I am Taiwanese, and I am Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   He repeatedly emphasized his view that Taiwan has no need to
declare independence, because it is already an independent,
sovereign country, formally known as the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans in Congress and elsewhere have criticized Clinton
for declaring a ``three no's policy'' about Taiwan during his visit
to China: no support for Taiwan independence, no support for two
Chinas or ``one China, one Taiwan,'' and no support for membership
for Taiwan in international organizations that require statehood.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee did not seem particularly bothered by the ``three
no's,'' and he said he believed assurances that U.S. policy had not
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the U.S. and Chinese assertions of ``one China''
policies, Lee and other officials offered a very different vision:
They acknowledge that there is a single China as a cultural and
historic zone, just as there is one Europe, but they say this
historic China is now divided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taiwan's destiny isn't China's to decide,'' Lee said. ``It's
for the 21 million people on Taiwan to decide their destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan and China are expected to resume a high-level dialogue,
but nobody here is optimistic about the talks achieving any kind of
breakthrough. Lee reiterated his willingness to go to Beijing on a
``mission of peace,'' but it is clear that Beijing will never
accept his conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's economy has been relatively unscathed by the economic
crisis that has ravaged Asia and now Russia. Some officials
expressed concern that China could be affected as well, risking
political as well as economic troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If peace and stability cannot be maintained on the mainland,
then that would affect the entire region, and we do not want to see
that happen,'' said C.J. Chen, the chief government spokesman.

GERMAN INDUSTRIAL GIANTS SUED OVER NAZI-ERA SLAVE LABOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Encouraged by their success in persuading
Swiss banks to repay victims of the Holocaust, lawyers in the
United States and Germany are suing Germany's biggest industrial
companies on behalf of workers forced into slave labor during
Hitler's regime.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action lawsuit, filed on Sunday in New York, could
turn out to amount to billions of dollars being paid by companies
like Daimler-Benz, Volkswagen, BMW and Siemens.
</P>
<P>
   It is the biggest attempt yet to force companies entangled in
the business of Nazi Germany to pay victims 50 years after the war.
It comes just a month after three of Switzerland's biggest banks
agreed to pay a total of $1.25 billion to settle a similar lawsuit
over assets belonging to Holocaust victims that the banks never
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies named in the suit have long admitted that they
used slave laborers from countries like Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic, though they always insisted they were forced to do
so by the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Under the threat of lawsuits and damaging publicity over the
issue, several have said they are willing to put money into a new
fund for compensating survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen, which had been threatened with a separate lawsuit,
formally announced that it would set up a victims' fund but would
not decide details until September.
</P>
<P>
   Several European insurance companies recently agreed that an
international commission could determine the details of
compensation to Holocaust victims whose insurance money was never
paid off. The Assicurazioni Generali insurance company of Italy
agreed this week to pay $100 million to compensate Holocaust
victims.
</P>
<P>
   The newest lawsuit was brought by the same lawyers who handled
the Swiss banking and insurance cases, led by Edward Fagan in New
York and Michael Witti in Munich. Even before Monday, the lawyers
had begun taking fresh aim at German companies. They have filed
suits against the country's biggest banks, Deutsche Bank and
Dresdner Bank, as well as another one against the big chemical
company Degussa.
</P>
<P>
   Though the suit does not demand a specific amount of
compensation, lawyers have said they will demand at least $75,000
for each of the surviving victims, wherever they are living. German
companies are believed to have pressed more than eight million
people into slave labor, and it is not clear how many are still
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not talking about recovering lost salaries,'' Witti
said in an interview Monday. ``We are talking about recovering the
profit that was made out of the work of these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Witti said the lawsuit has standing in an American court because
the companies named in the suit all do business in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, almost all the legal battles over compensation
for Holocaust victims have been over debts owed by Swiss banks as a
result of their wartime services for the German government. Jewish
groups, seizing on leads from recently opened archives, charged
that the Swiss banks had held onto vast sums that were deposited by
Jewish victims or plundered by the Nazi regime and deposited in
Switzerland to finance the war effort.
</P>
<P>
   The new suits focusing on German companies attempt to reopen
issues that had seemed settled long ago. The German government has
paid $60 billion or more to victims as well as compensation in the
form of help for Israel. But the lawyers argue that the slave
laborers, who were forced to work on farms as well as in factories
that made tanks, guns and poisonous gas, were never compensated for
the wealth they helped generate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The compensation so far has only covered certain kinds of
damages, like the damage to health, the loss of freedom or lost
jewelry,'' said Witti. ``It never covered slave labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen had hoped to extract itself from such a confrontation
less than two months ago, when it announced, after discussions with
advocates for Holocaust victims, that it would voluntarily set up a
fund of its own. The company continues to argue that it bears no
legal responsibility, but is willing to acknowledge its moral
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   That peace offering did nothing to keep Volkswagen out of the
new complaint.

MOST EQUITY LOANS HAVE TEXANS TRADING ONE KIND OF DEBT FOR ANOTHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM FUQUAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Eight months after Texans were finally
allowed to tap the value of their homes for extra cash, the No. 1
use of the home equity loans is not to start a business, put a
child through college or improve the homestead.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it's debt consolidation _ rolling up the outstanding
balances on credit cards, personal loans and other pricey
obligations and paying them off with one, less-expensive
home-equity loan.
</P>
<P>
   That might not be the noblest of purposes, but it certainly
makes sense. Not only do home-equity loans carry lower interest
rates, but interest paid is deductible for federal income tax
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texans carry an abnormally high debt load compared to the rest
of the country,'' said Greg Jewell, who runs Associates Capital's
home equity operation in the state. ``They have higher credit card
balances, higher personal loans, maybe because of the lack of home
equity lending.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's focus on debt consolidation hasn't surprised lenders.
They say that given the state's decades-long holdout against home
equity lending, a little home finance alchemy is bound to look
appealing.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that everything else is such a distant second has
raised some eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a big believer that in Texas, business (start-ups) was a
big part. But we're not hearing a lot of it,'' said John Gavin,
chief of Northwest Bank Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   What else do we know about Texans and home-equity lending? In
interviews, several lenders reported that:
</P>
<P>
   _The average interest rate charged is about 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _The average loan amount is about $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   _Refinancing makes up roughly one-third of all home-equity
loans, more than usually seen but not surprising given the sharp
rate declines so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the purpose, demand for home-equity loans has met or
exceeded lenders' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Home equity is the difference between a home's market value and
any loans on the property. A homeowner with a $100,000 home and a
$75,000 mortgage has $25,000 in home equity.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Texas law that went into effect Jan. 1, homeowners can
borrow up to 80 percent of their home's market value when taking
out a home equity loan. The 80 percent ceiling includes any
outstanding mortgages against the property.
</P>
<P>
   So how many billions in home-equity loans have been written?
It's too early to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to know how much business there is,'' but
nobody really knows yet, said Bob Mahalik, senior mortgage banking
analyst at the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank. He estimates at least
$10 billion in home equity loans will be written in Texas this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, it's a huge market,'' said David Flores, senior vice
president at Chase Bank Texas in Houston. ``We're very pleased with
the volume.''
</P>
<P>
   By consensus, the Associates ranks No. 1 in home equity loans.
Jewell said the consumer-finance company had closed about $750
million worth of Texas home-equity loans as of mid-August.
NationsBank also drew numerous mentions.
</P>
<P>
   According to a new survey by the Texas A&AMP;M University Real
Estate Center in College Station, all of the state's large
commercial banks and roughly 75 percent of the smaller ones report
making the tax-favored loans.
</P>
<P>
   The 25 percent not making loans cited legal concerns related to
the stringent restrictions Texas lawmakers placed on home equity
loans, said Jack Harris, the center's director.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M's survey of members of the Texas Banking Association showed
that two out of three respondents making home equity loans reported
that they had handled less than $500,000 in home equity loans.
Eight percent reported doing more than $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   That's roughly as expected, given the big banks' familiarity
with home equity lending through their operations in other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones aggressively working that market are the largest
banks, the ones over $1 billion,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Associates clearly geared up to be Texas' most active home
equity lender.
</P>
<P>
   Spread over three floors of an Arlington office building,
Associates employees field 300 to 500 phone calls a day that stream
into the offices, which handle all the company's home equity loan
business in Texas. About 150 people work in the Arlington office.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Associates can throw so many resources into the
market is that it casts its net a bit wider than most banks. Jewell
said Associates' home-equity business is roughly divided into
thirds, divided equally between borrowers with sterling ``A''
credit, less-than-shiny ``B'' credit, and tarnished ``C'' credit.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Associates reports that it also lends money at
a considerably wider range than the banks.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Borrowers with good credit records and strong relationships with
their lenders can get rates as low as 7.75 percent, with the bulk
of the business being done at about 8 percent, lenders say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had specials in the high 7s, but it's mostly 8 to 8.25
percent,'' said Danny Smith, chief of Bank One Texas' Fort Worth
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell said Associates has made so-called ``subprime''
home-equity loans for rates as high as 13.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The state imposes a ceiling of 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, lenders said that regardless of income level or credit
rating, customers' loans tend to average $40,000 to $50,000. It
wouldn't seem that lower-rated homeowners would have a lot of home
equity built up, but the subprime market is hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to one subprime lender who said he can't rent enough
space and hire enough people to handle the business,'' Mahalik
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, legislative restrictions on the loans are undoubtedly
depressing demand somewhat, he and other lenders said.
</P>
<P>
   For one, lenders quickly realized that the state's definition of
an urban homestead is limited to 1 acre. That means, for example,
that a homeowner in the Fort Worth area with a home on 1.5 acres
has a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Some banks decided that a quick fix was to conduct a survey that
defined the acre that included the home. That acre then is
designated as the collateral for the loan.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``the cost associated with that has probably reduced
the appetite of many institutions and reduced demand from those who
have more than an acre,'' Flores said. Because fees can't exceed 3
percent of the loan amount, ``it's not as attractive to us,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the interest rate to recoup expenses is unattractive to
borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find ways to work around it, but the solutions aren't
necessarily beneficial to both parties,'' Flores said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Texas' unique restrictions on home equity loans have
hampered their sale on the secondary market. Most mortgage loans
today are bundled and sold to investors who are willing to shoulder
the risk of fluctuating interest markets.
</P>
<P>
   But the largest purchaser of loans on the secondary market,
Fannie Mae, said it currently is buying only Texas home-equity
loans that are first liens. Getting a first lien home-equity loan
requires the borrower to refinance the outstanding mortgage with a
new loan whose balance includes the extra money the borrower wants.
</P>
<P>
   That's called a ``cash-out'' loan. It's called that because the
borrower takes cash out of his or her equity, replacing it with
additional debt.
</P>
<P>
   A second lien stands second-in-line behind a first lien in case
of a default. That's one reason that second liens can't command an
interest rate as low as a first lien.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't said we won't buy second liens,'' said John Bauer,
senior business manager for Fannie Mae, a quasi-government
corporation. ``There's just a lot of complexity to the
constitutional amendment that regulates Texas home-equity loans.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenders said that the lack of a uniform, secondary market for
Texas home-equity loans can lead them to demand a slightly higher
interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loans being made today are being made by people who are
willing to hold them,'' said Mark Jones of Frost Bank Mortgage. ``I
don't think there's a premium to refinance and do it as a home
equity loan, but you have to keep in mind that there's not a
traditional secondary market for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, reverse annuity mortgages, intended for use by older
homeowners who want to tap their home equity for, say, medical
expenses without giving up their homes, also has been stymied by
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday the house is sold, and there's wording that makes it
unclear when the lender could actually sell it,'' Harris said.
``For all practical purposes, they don't exist'' in Texas, he said
of reverse mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Schneider, an attorney for the Austin office of Consumers
Union, said it's clear that both the 1-acre limit and the reverse
mortgage have problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are probably pretty easy fixes for that,'' Schneider
said.
</P>
<P>
   What's already clear, he said, is that interest rates and fees
on home equity loans vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   As always, it's imperative that consumers shop around, he said.

PHANTASTIC STREAK

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In some ways, Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's ``The
Phantom of the Opera'' is perfect entertainment _ memorable music,
lavish staging and costumes, and flashy special effects.
</P>
<P>
   It's also overrated, but that doesn't stop the current
incarnation of the musical, which opened Sunday at the Pantages
Theatre, from being enjoyable. This is thanks for the most part to
the superb performance of Davis Gaines in the title role.
</P>
<P>
   Gaines has played the Phantom 1,957 times, including Sunday, and
the wit and subtlety he brings to the difficult role is remarkable,
especially considering the ease with which he does it. Add to this
a rich, expressive voice that never overreaches, never calls
attention to itself and yet can bring chills of emotion to the most
hardened theater-goer.
</P>
<P>
   If you somehow missed ``Phantom'' during its more than 10-year
run in the States (it opened October 1986 in London and January
1988 on Broadway, where it's still going), or haven't read the
original novel by Gaston Leroux or seen any of the non-musical
filmed versions, here's a brief plot summary of the musical.
</P>
<P>
   The story really begins when the Fat Lady sings _ in this case,
Carlotta (Patricia Hurd), the heavy-set diva at an opera house in
Paris in 1875. The scene is a comic dress rehearsal for a faux
opera, ``Hannibal,'' complete with nubile dancing girls and an
overweight leading man who has trouble climbing the fake elephant.
When Carlotta walks out on them, the new owners of the theater turn
to a girl from the chorus, Christine (Marie Danvers), who has been
receiving secret help from the mysterious Angel of Music, the
Phantom, who haunts the theater and has been making demands on the
previous owner.
</P>
<P>
   Christine is, of course, a sensation in her debut, and the
Phantom takes her to his hideaway to profess his love. It's there
they sing one of the showstoppers, ``The Phantom of the Opera.''
Meanwhile, an old beau and theater patron, Raoul (Lawrence
Anderson), has come back into Christine's life, and she is torn
between the light (a sunny, normal relationship with Raoul) and the
dark (the intoxicating allure of the Phantom and his music).
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by Christine's success and angered by Raoul's
attentions, the Phantom becomes more demanding, but his dictums
meet with resistance from the new owners. Their defiance is met
with violence from the Phantom, including the famous crashing
chandelier scene. Inevitably, all this lurches to a final showdown
as the authorities close in on the Phantom while Christine must
chose between Raoul and her secret mentor.
</P>
<P>
   The staging and effects that make ``Phantom'' a delight to watch
are all there in the Pantages production. And while the falling
chandelier doesn't seem quite as spectacular as it once did, the
colorful ``Masquerade'' number that opens the second act remains
exotically charming. The cast and the singing is uniformly good,
notably Anderson and Leila Martin as Madame Giry, the ballet
choreographer. Danvers' Christine is a bit hit and miss, but it's a
taxing role, which calls upon her to flit from emotion to emotion
without ever grounding her character. (Other roles can be
caricatures, but the central figure of Christine should have been
better drawn.) Danvers has quite a lovely voice when she's relaxed,
but there are a few times she tries to punch a note too hard. This
has a lot to do with the music itself. Some of Lloyd Webber's score
must come with the equivalent of the stage direction of ``overact
here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Danvers has not played the role anywhere near the number of
times that Gaines has played his character, and it's clear he has
had time to find nuances that bring the Phantom to life. Without
him, the Pantages production would be quite adequate, but Gaines'
performance alone is worth the price of admission.

GETTING THROUGH THE FEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Stock up on extra toilet paper. Lay in a month's
supply of bottled water. Oh, and don't forget to stick a ``Fire
Sale'' sign smack in the middle of the Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Davis is at it again.
</P>
<P>
   L.A.'s poet laureate of pessimism is predicting the worst. His
extended forecast: Floods, firestorms, tornadoes, earthquakes and
killer bees. Death, pestilence, ethnic conflagrations, plagues of
man-eating mountain lions and, yes, more tacky subdivisions.
</P>
<P>
   And that's only the start of the perilous prophecies put forward
in Davis' just-published ``Ecology of Fear: Los Angeles and the
Imagination of Disaster'' (Metropolitan Books), a harrowing tour de
force that's sure to provide plenty of grist for politicians,
academics and talk-radio hosts this fall.
</P>
<P>
   While generations of Tinseltown fantasists have promoted the
Southland as an endless summer of sun and fun, Davis sees something
quite different. In ``Ecology of Fear,'' he makes the case that,
practically since its inception, Los Angeles has courted
environmental catastrophe through a lethal combination of greed,
myopic land management and arrogant disregard for the region's
abundant natural hazards.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he believes, we've had the dumb good luck to escape the
decades-long droughts and cataclysmic earthquakes to which our
boom-and-bust landscape is prone. But now, Davis argues, the law of
averages is catching up. We're verging on environmental meltdown,
while the powers-that-be bury their heads in the quicksand.
</P>
<P>
   What's worse, he contends, our cavalier attitude toward Mother
Nature mirrors our callous disregard of L.A.'s poor and powerless.
We're heaping the gasoline of political discontent on the bonfire
of overdevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   Result: Apocalypse Soon _ unless, Davis warns, we adopt more
sensible environmental policies and a more egalitarian
socioeconomic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think L.A.'s distinctive in the way that it combines
environmental and social problems in such an explosive mixture,''
says Davis, a faculty member of the Southern California Institute
of Architecture since 1986. ``You take Detroit's social problems
and spatial segregation and combine it with San Francisco's seismic
exposure, you end up with something like L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait. Haven't we heard this somewhere before? Well, yeah. Sort
of.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, Davis _ a former truck driver and college
dropout turned free-lance Trotskyite scholar _ flipped L.A.'s
laid-back image upside-down with his first book, ``City of
Quartz.''
</P>
<P>
   Exhaustively researched and passionately argued, ``City of
Quartz'' offered an alarming behind-the-scenes tour of the Southern
California experience. Written in a style both slangy and
authoritative, caustic and humorous, it suggested a !ital!noir!off!
alternative reading of L.A. history, emphasizing its brutal ethnic
and class struggles and the plundering of a natural paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewers on both coasts hailed the book as a brilliantly
written piece of journalism-cum-manifesto, an underground road map
of SoCal consciousness. Overnight, the highly quotable Davis became
L.A.'s favorite naysaying leftie, a coveted guest speaker and
regular contributor to op-ed pages (he's also a contributing editor
to New Left Review).
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the accolades have kept pouring in. Two years ago,
the Getty Center named Davis one of its scholars-in-residence.
Earlier this year he was awarded a $315,000 MacArthur Fellowship (a
so-called ``genius grant'').
</P>
<P>
   It's been an odd turn of events for the renegade son of a San
Diego meat cutter, who once supported himself by driving a big rig.
But then much of what Davis feels for his hometown smacks of
paradox. Perhaps no one else so aptly personifies Angelenos'
love-hate relationship with their city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that it's obvious, whatever the faults in my writing
style or the way I organize my arguments, that I am a fiercely
passionate Southern Californian,'' says Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an anger I feel of seeing so many of the things that
made a good life potentially available to everybody being lost. ...
Which doesn't necessarily mean that I'm setting out to make
Pasadena look like Havana.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his sulfur-tinged prose, Davis in person is a
surprisingly mild-mannered baby boomer of 52. Stocky and compact,
with a thatch of gray hair framing inquisitive gray eyes, he has
the look of a Welsh pub keeper.
</P>
<P>
   A careful listener, he can riff for hours on virtually any
subject _ the racial subtext of H.G. Wells' science fiction or
various endangered species of flora and fauna. A casual question
about the planned Newhall Ranch development (``a travesty'')
prompts a seminar on the utopian communities envisioned by Jane
Addams and Samuel Gompers. This guy must dream in complete
paragraphs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a kind of part public intellectual, part
raconteur, because I think that one of his great gifts is his
storytelling ability,'' says William Cronon, the Frederick Jackson
Turner chair of history, geography and environmental studies at the
University of Wisconsin at Madison. ``Nobody knows the histories,
stories and people of the L.A. basin better than Mike Davis.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' tale-spinning talents help him straddle the line between
journalism and academia, between a popular following and a
specialized one. Though bristling with footnotes, ``City of
Quartz'' became a best seller that cut across marketing and
cultural boundaries. (Among its many local fans is Barry Munitz,
president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust.)
</P>
<P>
   Rather than an ivory-towered hermit, Davis fits the profile of a
public intellectual, able to popularize complex theoretical issues
for a wide &UR;  &LR; audience. He has advised politicians and worked with
gang members, and you're as likely to find him organizing hotel
workers in Las Vegas or leading teen hikers in the San Gabriel
Mountains as pontificating in the faculty lounge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tricky place to be, but I think he has a lot of
credibility,'' says Stephen Pyne, an environmental historian at
Arizona State University, referring to Davis' hybrid career.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Steinberg, a history professor at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland, says Davis' books manage to avoid both the
leaden jargon of left-wing academic writing and the bland
banalities of mainstream political journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``What passes for political reporting in America today is so, so
tame, so domesticated,'' says Steinberg. ``I think it's great
someone is out there yelling `Fire.' And that's what Davis is
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   As laid out in ``Ecology of Fear,'' the holocaust threatening
L.A. springs from shortsighted thinking by developers, politicians
and the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Davis argues, beginning in the booming 1920s, the
city blew a golden chance to create a lush ``medium-density''
environment dominated by townhouses and courtyard apartments,
surrounded by ample communal green space and pedestrian walkways.
He believes this ``alternative'' compressed Los Angeles would have
made rapid transit economically viable and reduced the enormous
distances that now separate home and working lives.
</P>
<P>
   In squandering its Eden, Los Angeles pushed relentlessly into
flood plains, fire zones and crumbling coastal areas, while leaving
its inner core and first-ring suburbs to deteriorate into
``postmodern slums.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same, Davis writes, there's ``a growing scientific
consensus'' that the region has built up a substantial ``earthquake
debt,'' of which the devastating 1994 Northridge temblor was merely
the first repayment.
</P>
<P>
   Though one reviewer has called the book ``Eco-terror at its
finest,'' Davis stresses he's not invoking a circle-the-wagons
mentality, but instead trying to remind L.A. of the costs of
ignoring its own past.
</P>
<P>
   Davis traces his ambivalent feelings about his hometown to his
parents, who fled West from Columbus, Ohio, after losing everything
in the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   His father was ``this innocent, sunny, naive kind of guy'' who
idolized California, while his mother had a dark, fatalistic Irish
imagination and hated her new home, a little bungalow alongside an
avocado orchard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of had in my parents this constant fight or dialogue
going on about Southern California, and I've inherited both of
their viewpoints,'' Davis says, managing a grin.
</P>
<P>
   Until his late teens, Davis was a ``right-wing,
ultra-patriotic'' kid who actually thought of informing on his
liberal father to the FBI. His adolescence passed in a
quasi-delinquent haze of ``stealing cars a bit, trying to drag
race, and getting in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Davis read John Hersey's ``Hiroshima'' and underwent a
political turnaround. At 18 _ shortly after being kicked out of
college for trysting with a coed _ he joined the radical Students
for a Democratic Society. He spent a couple years working for the
group in New York City until marriage and money problems drove him
back home.
</P>
<P>
   For a while he tried meat cutting, his father's profession. He
went through a series of blue-collar jobs until, finally, on a
generous scholarship from his father's union, he went to study
labor history at UCLA in 1974. He was almost 30. Later he went to
Northern Ireland, where he wrote his doctorate on the country's
working class. But it wasn't until ``City of Quartz'' was published
that Davis finally was able to concentrate full time on teaching
and writing.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades after his first fling with socialism, Davis
retains a certain innocent hopefulness about L.A.'s future, mixed
with a brawling, clannish protectiveness. He's like the uncle who
picks quarrels at the family reunion but will scrap with anyone who
criticizes his relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something is wrong, it offends him. He doesn't just
accept it as being one more lousy thing that's wrong with the
world,'' says regional planner David Stein, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Such an exacting worldview has made for a fractured personal
life. Married six times, Davis now lives in a Pasadena bungalow
with his current spouse, Alessandra Moctezuma, and his 16{-year-old
daughter by the first of two Irish ex-wives.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a kid who's inherited all my self-destructive qualities
of just saying what's on her mind to anybody,'' Davis says. ``She's
a natural-born rebel. She worships dead poets who have OD'd on
heroin and other figures that I sometimes have trouble coming to
grips with.''
</P>
<P>
   But getting a grip on Davis isn't always the easiest thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tends to get caught up in what he's doing at the moment and
forget everything else around him,'' says Stein. ``I think he's a
very lonely man in some ways. He's caught up in an intellectual
adventure, and while he's warm for the moment you're with him, then
he goes off and does something else, and you have to rebuild the
connection.''
</P>
<P>
   With his newfound celebrity, Davis is facing another challenge:
How to keep flogging L.A. politically when L.A. keeps begging for
more lashings.
</P>
<P>
   ``My problem is, I keep biting the hand that feeds me, and they
feed me more,'' he says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Davis fantasizes about chucking it all _ the political
crusades, the pursuit of literary fame _ and hanging out with his
son Jack in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The child was sickly when he was born, and he almost died. But
now he's a lively 5{-year-old, ``an extremely kind, sweet little
boy'' who lives with his mother on a peninsula on the north side of
Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lives near horses and castles, and every week I write him a
children's story,'' says Davis, who visits his son several times a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing him describe Jack's idyllic existence, you wonder if
Davis is hearkening back to the fertile playground of his own
California youth _ a place that is precious not because it no
longer exists, but because in some ways it never really did.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could, I'd just take the MacArthur money and just be like
Robin Williams _ I can't remember the movie he's in where his wife
leaves him because he's just totally regressed, all he does is play
with the kids all day long, and she thinks he should have a career.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could do that,'' &UR;  &LR; says Mike Davis, ``I would.''

CHICAGO SCHOOLS TO REQUIRE COMMUNITY SERVICE FOR GRADUATION  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DIRK JOHNSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ To instill a sense of civic duty in teen-agers, the
Chicago public school system has become the largest district in the
nation to require students to perform community service to receive
a high school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with this year's sophomore class, Chicago students will
need to spend at least 40 hours in public service, such as tutoring
young people or helping the elderly, during their high school
years.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the requirement, students must submit what the board
calls a ``reflection'' on their service _ an essay, a video
project, an oral report _ according to the measure passed last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want students to learn the importance of community,'' said
Bruce Marchiafava, a spokesman for the Chicago schools, the
nation's third largest system, behind New York and Los Angeles.
``They need to know that community is about giving, not just
getting.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion of mandated community service has been rejected by
Los Angeles school officials. While the idea has been raised in New
York, J.D. LaRock, a spokesman for the New York City schools
chancellor, Rudy Crew, said officials have no plan to consider such
a requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the public service requirement say it can lead to an
administrative nightmare. Schools decide what constitutes public
service, who is responsible for supervising the young people, and
whether schools would be liable for harm done to the students, or
by them.
</P>
<P>
   Education officials here say some of those issues are still
being studied, including volunteerism done for groups with
political agendas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you let students work for an anti-handgun group,''
Marchiafava said, ``do you also let them work for the NRA?''
referring to the National Rifle Association, which advocates for
gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   But Chicago school officials, who have gained nationwide
attention in recent years for cracking down on misbehavior and
imposing a more rigorous academic regimen, insist that those
problems are not insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago schools had been labeled as the worst in the nation
a decade ago by William Bennett, who was the secretary of education
under President Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing a school district rife with corruption and having
scandalously low student achievement scores, the Illinois state
Legislature in 1995 turned over control of the Chicago schools to
Mayor Richard Daley, who appointed one of his top aides, Paul
Vallas, as the district's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Vallas has earned praise and criticism for scrapping a tradition
of passing students whose marks did not merit advancement, the
so-called social promotion. Nearly one-fourth of Chicago
eighth-graders were required to attend summer school this year.
</P>
<P>
   Vallas has said urban students, especially from poor families,
were being shortchanged in a system that implicitly believed they
were incapable of achieving at higher levels.
</P>
<P>
   When Vallas began his tenure, about one-quarter of Chicago
school children were reading at or above national average. That
figure has increased to about 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago schools have an enrollment of about 430,000, with
some 559 schools and a budget of $3.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Before implementing the community service requirement, Chicago
public school officials studied two Roman Catholic high schools
here, St. Scholastica and Good Council, which require good works
for graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Vallas, a Chicago native who attended the city's public schools,
as well as Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic schools, has often
called on the public education system to study the successes of its
parochial school counterparts, and vice-versa.
</P>
<P>
   The public service program will include ``service learning
coaches'' in each high school who will receive an annual stipend of
between $1,000 and $4,000 to coordinate and supervise the students.
</P>
<P>
   Some school officials around the country, including some in New
York, question the message of forcing students to volunteer. LaRock
said the notion of mandating volunteerism seemed an oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   But Chicago school officials stressed the importance of students
coming to learn that everyone must contribute their time and
talents, or that society will suffer.
</P>
<P>
   The sorts of work being encouraged by school officials include
tutoring, cleaning homeless shelters and assisting the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing things for senior citizens is always good,'' said
Marchiafava. ``Everybody is for senior citizens.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q My manager called me into his office and told me that several
of the people I work with complained to him about me. He said they
think I am too bossy, conceited and demanding. I told him I
disagreed, and that they never said this to me. He said I should
think about what they told him and try to do something about it.
I'm very upset and not sure what to do. L.S. &QL; 
A Your manager took a real misstep on this one. His first step
should have been to suggest that your associates meet with you to
discuss their concerns and see if there is a way for all of you to
resolve this matter on your own.
</P>
<P>
   Having tripped at the first step, your manager then took a giant
leap backward by believing only their side of the story. And then,
to make matters even worse, he threw all sorts of labels at you,
rather than discussing specific behaviors or incidents.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, you should meet with your fellow employees to
discuss the situation. Let them know you are honestly puzzled by
their reaction to you, as well as by their decision to take their
concerns directly to management rather than to you in the first
place. Then be quiet and listen. It is easy to become defensive in
these discussions, and it is essential to avoid doing so.
</P>
<P>
   You can present your side of the picture, but your real
objective should be to prevent this kind of situation from
recurring in the future. Hence, you should try to work toward a
mutual commitment from all of the players to try to work
productively together and to be open and proactive in dealing with
group problems.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to let your manager know what you are doing about group
problems, as it sounds like he may be causing more than a few of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Q We brought in a training program for the managers and, in the
last session, there was a short test that well over half of them
failed. This is a highly regarded program, and we are disappointed
with the performance of so many of the managers. What do you
suggest we do? T.P. &QL; 
A When well over half the class fails a program, it can be argued
that the real failure is the program itself. This type of failure
rate typically highlights a program's inability to capture and
sustain the motivation, drive and interest of the participants. In
this regard, before you blame your employees, it is important to
review the program's presenters, content, practice, opportunities,
feedback, materials and the test itself.
</P>
<P>
   One useful step is to meet with the participants to discuss all
of this. After all, it is standard operating procedure for
participants to evaluate the training programs they attend. By the
end of this discussion, you will have a clear idea of who and what
really failed here.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to remember that a training program may be
highly regarded, but that does not automatically mean your
employees will have any regard for it at all. &QL; 
Q I do not have many personal phone calls, but the last three times
my manager stuck his head in my office, I was on one. He gave me a
strange look, but I didn't say anything to him about how few
personal calls I actually receive. Should I? A.S. &QL; 
A At this point, it's getting too late to make that call. In a
broad sense, if you are ever concerned that your manager has
obtained an inaccurate picture of your performance, you should tell
him. However, you need to do so as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   If you approach your manager even a matter of days after the
fact, the message that you are sending may not be the one that he
receives. For example, he may have forgotten about the calls, but
you will have rekindled this telephonic memory. Or perhaps he still
has them in mind, and he may have figured that they were infrequent
occurrences, but since you stewed over them for some period of time
and then approached him, perhaps he should focus more attention on
them.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, since it sounds like you are going to keep yourself
awake at night until you talk to your manager about this, you
should do so. After all, in most work environments, such calls are
not exactly rare. If your working relationship with him is
generally positive, there should be no problem in giving him a
quick update on your personal calls. And if your working
relationship is not that great, the personal calls are the least of
your problems.

VETERANS WANT GOVERNMENT AID FOR SMOKING-RELATED ILLNESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ During the Vietnam War, the U.S. government
tucked miniature packs of cigarettes into boxed meals for combat
soldiers and dropped cartons of cigarettes by helicopter to troops
on long-range reconnaissance missions in the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 years later, the government has decided those soldiers
``smoked on government time'' and has prohibited them from
receiving disability payments if they developed lung cancer,
emphysema or other diseases from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   A law banning disability pay for ailments tied to tobacco use
was added as an amendment to the 800-page Transportation Equity Act
for the 21st Century. The bill was signed by President Clinton in
June.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Veterans Affairs requested the law, which
amends federal statutes governing veterans benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The VA believes veterans' compensation benefits were designed
to assist veterans who become ill or are injured in service to
their country,'' said Ozzie Garza, a VA spokesman. ``It goes beyond
the government's responsibility to pay compensation for veterans
just because they smoked on government time.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Blecker, executive director of Swords to Plowshares, a
San Francisco veterans' rights group, says it is ironic that the
government has decided to deny smoking disability claims given its
role as a purveyor of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Blecker, who served two years in Vietnam, says the military
tucked tiny cigarette packs in every C-ration box, which contained
the canned meals soldiers ate in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the packet with the napkins there would always be a package
of four cigarettes _ Newports, Chesterfields, Lucky Strikes,
Winstons, Pall Malls or another one of the brands of the time,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Blecker says cartons of cigarettes were also dropped by
helicopter to soldiers on long-range reconnaissance missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were 18 or 19 years old, you could pick up a habit big
time,'' said Blecker, who started smoking in Vietnam and quit
several years later. ``They were free in the field, and back in the
PX they were very, very cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   The military discontinued the practice in 1975, eight years
after the U.S. surgeon general issued a report saying smoking was
the principal cause of lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, a lot of veterans have (medical) conditions as a result
of that practice,'' said VA spokesman Ken McKinnon, ``but the VA's
position is that the government cannot be held responsible for all
the sins of smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco industry documents made public in recent years have
shown that cigarette companies knew 30 years ago that nicotine was
addictive and that smoking caused numerous health problems. But the
industry hid the evidence from the public.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, a legal opinion by the VA's general counsel opened the
door to smoking claims from veterans. But the agency didn't begin
processing most of the cases until 1997, when another opinion
clarified the ground rules for granting benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 opinion, VA general counsel Mary Lou Keener said the
agency should approve the claims if three conditions were met: if
nicotine dependence was a disease; if veterans started smoking
while they were in the service; and if smoking was considered the
cause of the disability or death.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion immediately raised financial concerns at the VA,
which began lobbying Congress to change the law.
</P>
<P>
   The VA said it would be deluged with claims _ 350,00 over the
next five years _ and swamped with $17 billion in bills if the
agency followed the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The VA delivered a draft bill prohibiting such claims to House
Speaker Newt Gingrich on March 30, and within two months the ban
became part of the massive highway bill. While the House and Senate
veterans' affairs committees had held hearings to discuss the
possibility of banning claims, they did not conduct hearings on the
veterans' smoking amendment after it was attached to the highway
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., the ranking minority member on
the Committee on Veterans Affairs, tried to kill the amendment as
the highway bill made its way through Congress, but was thwarted,
said Don Marshall, a spokesman for Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Rockefeller objected to the fact that they were robbing
from veterans' programs to offset the cost of highway spending,''
Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   The VA's McKinnon says the agency is processing cases filed
before the law was enacted and reviewing rejected claims.
</P>
<P>
   By June, the VA had received 8,830 smoking claims from veterans,
or from their surviving spouses or children, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 4,977 cases the VA has decided, the agency has denied
4,618 claims and awarded payments in 359, he says.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon says the VA expects to approve most of the 8,830 claims
filed before the new ban went into effect, even those already
denied. A majority of the rejected claims were missing documents
that veterans should be able to provide when they resubmit their
claims, he says.
</P>
<P>
   However, no new claims will be accepted now that Congress has
changed the law, McKinnon says.
</P>
<P>
   David Ewing, managing attorney at Swords to Plowshares, was
stunned to hear that most of the previous claims will be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's unbelievable,'' said Ewing, who helps veterans file
claims. ``These are extremely difficult cases to win, because they
have such a difficult evidentiary burden. They're so difficult to
prove, and as an attorney, I know they're difficult for the VA to
analyze. The idea that nearly all of the claims would be awarded
benefits would be preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   If it's true, the situation would be ``staggeringly unfair'' to
veterans with smoking disorders who didn't file claims before the
statute was changed, Ewing says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like a reward for people who made a deadline and
punishment for those who didn't _ even though no one knew what the
deadline would be,'' he said. ``It's completely arbitrary.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing says the prohibition on smoking claims threatens to
undermine confidence in the VA's compensation system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If smoking claims can be denied because they're deemed too
expensive, what else can be deemed too expensive,'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The VA's monthly disability payments range from $95 (10 percent
disabled) to $1,964 (100 percent disabled), and are meant to
compensate for the loss of working ability.
</P>
<P>
   If disability claims are approved, veterans win a coveted
``service-connection'' rating, which guarantees free VA medical
care. ``That's really why they're so important,'' Ewing said.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans with smoking disorders may also obtain free VA medical
care if they fit into one of six priority groups _ for example, if
they are disabled from another injury or illness, are former
prisoners of war, or are impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, they are charged co-payments, said Dr. Josh Adler,
assistant chief of staff at the San Francisco VA Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But they will never be turned away, Adler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any veteran can always get medical treatment here,'' Adler
said. ``If they don't have a service-connected illness and do not
fit into one of the priority groups, we will still provide the
care, but we are obligated to send them a bill.''

WORLD LEADERS STILL BELIEVE IN POWER OF U.S. PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-RDP, RUSSIA-ALBRIGHT, RUSSIA-RESCUE,
RUSSIA-SUMMIT, RUSSIA-DEBATE, RUSSIA-CLINTON) 
(js) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In the eyes of many of his fellow leaders and ordinary
people around the world, President Clinton has lost stature since
investigations into his private life and his admission of an
inappropriate relationship with a White House intern. But he has
lost little of the authority and power conferred on him by the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Some, particularly in the Arab world, fear that since the
disclosure of his conduct with Monica Lewinsky, Clinton no longer
has the moral authority to use his power in ways they would like to
see.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the Middle East and Africa say they believe that he
ordered military strikes against alleged terrorist targets in Sudan
and Afghanistan in order to divert public attention and fear that
he might be tempted to respond similarly in future crises.
</P>
<P>
   But leaders everywhere say that whatever the details of
Clinton's private life, his position as leader of the world's most
powerful economy and of the only military superpower makes him
indispensable in dealing with international problems, from
terrorism to turmoil in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, he went to Moscow Monday night with the
blessings of fellow leaders of the seven largest industrial
democracies.
</P>
<P>
   According to an informal survey by New York Times correspondents
on five continents, people, regardless of their personal feelings
about Clinton, stand in awe of the power of the U.S. presidency _
if somewhat less in awe of the character of the man now occupying
the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``An emperor should behave like an emperor, and a father should
behave like a father,'' said Yan Xuetong, a foreign policy expert
at the Chinese government-sponsored Chinese Institute of
Contemporary International Relations, citing Confucius.
</P>
<P>
   Because Clinton has been taken down a notch in the last month,
leaders in some countries are quicker than usual to take issue with
U.S. policies.
</P>
<P>
   One high-ranking European official, who asked not to be
identified, criticized the president's determination to travel to
Russia this week, despite the political and economic turmoil that
has hobbled President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a completely useless meeting,'' this official said, ``but
neither Yeltsin nor Clinton could afford to be the first to say,
`Let's call it off.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Another, representing a different European ally, said, ``The
only thing worse than carrying out this meeting between two wounded
heavyweights would be canceling it.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst outcome of the Russia crisis, most European leaders
agree, would be abandonment of a commitment to democracy and to a
free-market economy. Clinton is still capable in their eyes of
conveying that the West will continue its support if Russia keeps
trying.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, who is fighting against the
odds for re-election on Sept. 27, would have perhaps the most to
lose if Russia changed course. The German government and banks have
lent billions to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   As Kohl said in a television interview a week ago, ``Bill
Clinton is the Number 1 in the world. Whatever American domestic
politics are, he has his responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans have to exercise their leadership role,'' Kohl
said. ``In contact with Russia, Indonesia, or Japan, to name only a
few problems areas, it's absolutely necessary. There is no letup,
not for the president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   So there is some built-in sympathy on this side of the Atlantic
for the president.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac of France referred to his ``personal
friendship'' with Clinton in a speech to French ambassadors from
around the world in Paris last week.
</P>
<P>
   But he also ticked off a list of differences between the United
States and France, saying that the United States had an
isolationist and unilateral streak that complicated international
issues.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, Africa, South America and Asia, there is bafflement
about a country where a president's foes can use his sex life to
attack him politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this an advanced form of democratic political conduct?''
the French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, mused the other day.
It seems more like a kind of Puritanical political persecution to
the French, he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Biehl del Rio, chief of staff to the Chilean president,
Eduardo Frei, said, ``Outside the United States, we do not give
this issue the same importance. We are all praying, or at least
crossing our fingers, that he is not hurt by this. The world faces
a recession, and the United States is holding the economy of the
world together almost alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Castaneda, a Mexican writer, said, ``There are a lot of
problems in the world that only the U.S. can fix, and there's a
sense among Mexicans that there wouldn't be this worldwide mess if
there was somebody in charge in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel that if Clinton didn't have all these sexual
problems, he'd be able to act more decisively,'' he said. ``How can
a successful president who's brought prosperity and well-being to
the U.S. be weakened, destroyed or crippled by this silly story?''
</P>
<P>
   Tumi Mahabane, deputy editor of Y, a black youth magazine in
South Africa, said, ``I don't think people should look to
presidents for moral authority. Presidents should steer countries.
Their morality is peripheral.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   But in the Arab world, the dominant view is that the U.S.
presidency has been weakened by the Lewinsky issue, as has the U.S.
ability to press Israel to negotiate with the Palestinians about a
further Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no longer possible to plan any policy with them,'' a
senior official in Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally, said after
Clinton's decision to bomb targets in Afghanistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public opinion here is already persuaded that this
administration is the most pro-Israeli, anti-Arab and anti-Muslim
in American history,'' said the official, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely believed in some Islamic countries that Monica
Lewinsky was an Israeli agent placed in the White House. Without
his troubles over Ms. Lewinsky, some Palestinian and other Arab
officials contend, Clinton might have been willing to single out
Israel for not agreeing earlier this year to a U.S. proposal for a
settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Hemi Shalev, a commentator for the Israeli newspaper Maariv,
wrote, ``The weakening of the president was a boon to the right
wing.'' He wrote, ``Quickly, they translated Bill Clinton's
troubles into local currency and reached the conclusion that a
president up against the boards is one who cannot pressure Israel
to implement the second redeployment.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction in much of the rest of the Islamic world was also
critical of the bombings, and inclined to see a connection with
Clinton's troubles over Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Sarote Phaksumlee, a leader of Ban Krua, the biggest Muslim
community in Bangkok, said, ``The timing is very strange. Nobody
has heard of Osama bin Laden before. It is obvious the attack is
staged to divert attention from Bill Clinton's sex scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If America can do what it did in Sudan and Afghanistan,
tomorrow it can bomb northern Thailand by saying we are growing
opium and manufacturing heroin and exporting it to America,'' he
said. ``America is not the world policeman and this is morally
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mansor Mohammad Noor, former leader of a fundamentalist
Islamic group in Malaysia and now a lecturer at University Science
Malaysia , said: ``Clinton has discredited himself even though he
might be right. The greatest error is that Clinton is sowing fear
among people throughout the world. He has shown the might of the
United States and it can hammer anyone anywhere in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States can bomb anyone anywhere. This is a very
dangerous precedent, the world is at the mercy of America. Clinton
has frightened the world. A frightened world is a dangerous
world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Baki Kizginkaya, the Mukhtar or chief of the Emirgan
neighborhood of Istanbul, offered a different opinion. ``Clinton is
a very valuable man,'' he said. ``He did what was necessary in
Sudan, responding to terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of his trip to Russia, Clinton can
apparently expect a warm welcome afterward in Ireland, where he
plans to visit both the north and south of the country and then
relax for a few days to play golf before he goes back to
Washington.

   &UR; CDC Warns of Flu in Alaska and Yukon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An investigation of a flu and pneumonia outbreak among travelers
to Alaska and the Yukon Territory of Canada has identified 2,199
cases, including 71 of pneumonia. In summer, 70,000 tourists may
visit the area each week, both on cruise ships and by land.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now urges
travelers 65 or older, and anyone with a chronic medical condition,
to see a doctor before going into the area. Such travelers, the
government said, are more likely to develop pneumonia if they get
flu.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation by United States and Canadian health
authorities found that the influenza-A cases were often reported in
clusters among smaller groups sharing transportation, meals and
hotels. When those infected seek medical help on board a cruise
ship, for example, the infection can spread to other passengers and
crew.
</P>
<P>
   Potential travelers are urged to ask doctors ahead of time about
carrying antiviral pills. Taken within 48 hours of the start of
symptoms, the antivirals decrease the duration of the flu. As of
Aug. 24, the strain was believed to be similar to A/Sydney/5/97
(H3N2). A report on the outbreak, document 300004, is available
from the CDC fax service: (888) 232-3299.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Upgrades on American to Get Tougher in '99 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A mile doesn't go as far as it used to.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers on American Airlines who want to redeem frequent-flier
miles for first-class or business-class seats will need more miles
starting in February.
</P>
<P>
   The mileage required for coach tickets will not change, but
passengers will need from 10,000 to 25,000 more miles to buy or
upgrade to business- and first-class seats on domestic and
international flights.
</P>
<P>
   Many other major airlines said they were studying American's
changes or had no plans to raise their requirements.
</P>
<P>
   American's increases will require, for example, 30,000 miles
rather than 20,000 to upgrade to first-class from a discounted
domestic ticket. Travelers will also have to redeem 125,000 miles
rather than 100,000 to upgrade a discount ticket to Europe to a
first-class ticket under the advance-purchase plan.
</P>
<P>
   American said the change was due to strong demand for the seats,
as well as the airline's investment of $400 million to upgrade the
front sections of its planes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New Folk Art Collection On View in Santa Fe &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1995, the Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Fe
got a huge gift _ more than 2,500 textiles, ceramics and folk-art
objects from all over the world collected by Lloyd . Cotsen, the
former chief executive of Neutrogena, and given jointly by him and
the company. The museum immediately set to building more exhibition
space. And now, for the first time, selections from the collection
are on view in the new 8,775-square-foot Neutrogena wing.
</P>
<P>
   The collection is a crazy quilt from ancient times right up to
today: rare Medieval Coptic Egyptian textiles, Greek embroideries,
Amish quilts, Hispanic folk carvings, ceramics made by the Rio
Grande Pueblo Indians, 19th-century Navajo weavings, contemporary
Hopi weavings, Kuba cloth from Congo, Japanese folk clothing,
weavings from ancient Andean cultures and contemporary harvest corn
dollies and decorations from Europe and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the new wing, the inaugural exhibition, ``The
Extraordinary in the Ordinary,'' puts just 200 of the 2,500 objects
on display. Many of the rest, however, can be seen in the wing's
open collections area, where visitors can examine some works in
``activity stations.'' Supervised by the museum's curators, these
stops allow visitors to look closely at selected objects and
conservation methods, for example. The permanent storage space will
also be visible through large glass windows, offering a look at
activities of curators. In a 280-page exhibition catalog (Harry N.
Abrams, $60 for the hard cover; $35 for paperback), organized
geographically, several scholars discuss the works.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of International Folk Art, whose permanent collection
of nearly 130,000 objects comes from 100 countries, is on Camino
Lejo off Old Santa Fe Trail. Telephone (505) 827-6463. Hours: 10
a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. Admission: $5.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Seattle Symphony Gets a New Home (and View)  &LR;  The Seattle
Symphony has a new home this year, Benaroya Hall, the city's first
space designed specifically for concert music performances. Gala
celebrations and concerts will take place Sept. 12 to 20 to
inaugurate the hall, with the regular season beginning Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, the symphony performed in the Seattle Center
Opera House, and was limited to performances on weekday nights.
When Rebecca and Jack Benaroya donated $15 million in 1993 (the
gift eventually rose to $16 million), the symphony decided to build
a concert hall.
</P>
<P>
   The $118.1 million building has a 2,500-seat main auditorium and
a 540-seat recital hall. The building sits on a whole city block in
the heart of downtown Seattle and has a circular lobby with large
windows looking over Puget Sound and the snowcapped Olympic
Mountains beyond. The Boeing Company Gallery along the Third Avenue
side of the building is an arcade housing shops and cafes, as well
as the box office.
</P>
<P>
   During construction, the architect on the project, Mark
Reddington of LMN Architects, and acoustical consultant, Cyril
Harris, overcame numerous obstacles _ including noise and
vibrations generated by Seattle's main transit tunnel _ to insure
that the building would have good acoustics. The main concert
auditorium is basically a box within a larger box separated by nine
inches of space. For the interior of the concert hall, dark, rich
makore wood from Africa was used on the walls to create an even
sound.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of Sept. 12, the acoustical logistics will be put
to the test when the symphony, conducted by Gerard Schwarz, music

LATRELL SPREWELL KEEPS COMEDY IN COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With all the dry-roasted issues of the day
currently occupying the largest part of our plates, we should still
take a little time for Latrell Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we're more interested in Mark McGwire, the home run chase
and that eye-of-newt/toenail-of-toad concoction he mainlines every
day. Of course we spend a hunk of the day wondering if the Giants
really do have one more big push left in them. Sure, we border on
obsessive when the topic turns to the 49er running game, or why the
Raiders even bother to play at home. We're even more interested in
Cal-Nebraska, if only for the reasons that homicide detectives
linger around a crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, just off the radar, with that enigmatic smile, letting us
know that he hasn't really gone away after all, is Our Guy Spree.
</P>
<P>
   The last time we saw him, you may remember, he had done the
unthinkable _ construct a lawsuit so preposterous that a judge
laughed him out of court. He was trying to make the case that ...
oh, what's the difference?
</P>
<P>
   Whether he was trying to get his suspension lifted and his fine
reduced, or pull some of that big NEA jack for his performance art
piece on P.J. Carlesimo's thorax, it got slapped back in his face.
</P>
<P>
   With one noteworthy caveat. He could re-file the suit if his
next lawyer could come up with some reasoning that didn't cause
Judge Vaughn Walker's brain to roll out his ear.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, he holds a press conference to do that very thing. The
least we can do as his neighbors is feign attention.
</P>
<P>
   The suit is being re-filed without including the Warriors as
defendants, based apparently on the legal principle that the guy
with your prints on his windpipe makes a damned unconvincing
criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he and his lawyer, J.Cheever Loophole, are targeting
the NBA alone in hopes of avoiding Judge Walker's considerable
scorn. This time, Our Guy Spree wants the NBA (a) to refund $5.4
million of the money it took from him; (b) to cap his fine at the
$1 million the Warriors took from him in the few hours they spent
actually trying to discipline him themselves; and (c) to admit that
it destroyed evidence that would have tended to support Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   What this evidence is, we presumably will have to learn in
court. Maybe a forensics expert will show that it was actually Rod
Strickland who choked Carlesimo from 2,600 miles away. Maybe they
will unearth a monstrous police conspiracy, even though the cops
were never called, not even in the 20 or so minutes it took for
Carlesimo's face to return to its original shape.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they will even haul Jane Alexander, the former director of
the National Endowment for the Arts, in to admit that yes, the
agency would fund his piece, ``Coach In Very Blue.'' At this point,
anything is possible, and we should fervently support their plunge
into the depths of the creative process.
</P>
<P>
   As we know, any old kidney pie can file a lawsuit. Indeed, until
we stumbled upon Judge Walker and his lofty ``For what reason do
you bring me this steaming tripe of a case?'' standards, we figured
that there were no standards whatsoever. If you wanted to accuse
your neighbor of breathing too loudly, your boss of having
unusually smelly feet or the government of not rigging the lottery
in your favor, some judge somewhere would listen to your complaint
for weeks at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Our Guy Spree's case as originally presented, though, amazingly
passed none of these tests. Somehow, he managed either to find the
one legal tree with no limb to stand upon, or the one lawyer who
thought a tort was stuffed with jam. So he did what any
self-respecting gent would do _ he found another lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   And for this, we should all be grateful. For one, the baseball
season will soon be over, there's only one football game a week,
the hockey season doesn't really get going until after the first of
the new year, and there doesn't seem to be any NBA season at all.
There will be Stanford and University of California hoops, and the
Bill Murray Invitational in February, and that's it.
</P>
<P>
   For two, there isn't much of anything on Court TV these days,
what with O.J. all played out and the JonBenet Ramsay case set for
the twelfth of never. Judge Walker may be strict when it comes to
having lawsuits stay within the confines of the facts, but maybe
he's enough of a sport to let cameras in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   And for three, well, Our Guy Spree is still Our Guy. He's still
a Warrior, which you would think would be sufficient stigma to send
most people off the grid entirely. He still lives in the East Bay,
and as a homeowner he feels the Raider-enriched property tax hike
the same as the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   And he has apologized for whatever it is he may or may not have
done to Our Guy P.J., and if an apology would have gotten Our Guy
Billy Jeff Clinton off the hook, the logic naturally follows that
it should work for Our Guy Spree.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same logic, of course, that persuaded him to file
the suit in the first place, and it was just his deucedly bad luck
to get the one judge in America who didn't want the kind of cheap
publicity we thrive on.
</P>
<P>
   So you go, Spree. You file, and ask for punitive damages in the
billions. Make us proud, and if you can't manage that, at least
make us laugh. We can all use a little of that kind of sugar, even
in these hectic times.

FACING NONUNION COMPETITION, US WEST SETTLES TWO-WEEK STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ With nonunion companies competing hungrily for
telephone business in booming cities of the Rockies, U S West
tentatively settled a two-week strike Monday, and workers started
back to work at the nation's sixth largest Bell company.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which gave workers minor gains and faces
ratification by the 34,000 strikers, came as the company scrambles
to deal with an explosion in fax, pager and telephone lines in
Denver. Starting Tuesday, all local calls made within the Denver
area will require 10-digit dialing. In October, greater Denver is
to get an additional area code, 720.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bell companies are preparing to face increased competition
from fairly lean, nonunion companies going after their market
share,'' said Boyd Peterson, an analyst with The Yankee Group, a
Boston-based telecommunications research company.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that U S West stock only fell 7/16ths of a point Monday
in face of a sharp market decline, he added: ``Compared to the rest
of the market, it was positively stalwart.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Bell Atlantic reached a settlement after
only a two-day strike by the same union, Communications Workers of
America. In Connecticut, workers from same union last week rejected
a contract offer made by Southern New England Telecommunications
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``CWA is probably doing better than any union in the country,''
said Gregory Tarpinian, executive director for the Labor Research
Association, a New York-based consulting company for unions. ``They
have a tremendous amount of leverage because most of the telecom
companies downsized in the mid `80s and early `90s. They are left
with pretty lean operations.''
</P>
<P>
   At U S West, the number of employees dropped to 53,000 on
Monday, from 66,000 in 1984, the year of the company's creation.
Because of downsizing, the strike found the company without a large
number of middle level managers to perform unionized tasks _
directory assistance, repair and installation. At the same time,
the region's urban customers enjoy unprecedented choices because a
host of new companies have entered markets in the deregulated
environment caused by the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The U S West strike affected service to about 25 million
customers in 13 of the company's states: Arizona, Colorado, Idaho,
Iowa, Montana, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota,
Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Unemployment in
the U S West service area is nearly one percentage point below the
national average of 4.5 percent. In August, it was hard to find
strike breakers in Nebraska, where unemployment in July was 2.1
percent, in North Dakota, where it was 2.2 percent, or in
Minnesota, where it was 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a tight labor market and an increasingly competitive
business environment, U S West agreed to wage increases of 10.9
percent over three years, slightly above inflation forecasts. In
addition, it agreed to cut in half mandatory overtime, to a maximum
of eight hours a week by January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The contract, which also allowed for a 21 percent increase in
pension benefits and a $500 ratification bonus, must now be
ratified by the company's rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Pisha, vice president of Communications Workers of America
District 7, said that on Sunday night officials of the 65 striking
locals ``overwhelmingly'' supported the new contract. She predicted
that it would win approval of 60 to 70 percent of striking workers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the most controversial issue, the company agreed to make a
pay-per-performance plan voluntary for eligible employees.
</P>
<P>
   Before the strike, the company's younger managers sought to make
this plan mandatory for all new workers as a way of improving
efficiency and making the company more ``customer friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   David Beigie, a U S West spokesman, called union acceptance of
the voluntary plan as ``a breakthrough for the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Pisha said: ``The union is not going to recommend that
our members get in that plan,''
</P>
<P>
   In a company where union workers earn an average of $37,900,
however, some may ignore union appeals and go for the extra money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line will be down the road, when we see how many
employees opt for pay for performance,'' Richard Hurd, a professor
of labor studies at Cornell University, said Monday. ``If the
company can convince people that pay for performance will mean they
can get higher pay, you will see a lot of employees going for it.''

REJECTION OF PRIME MINISTER CANDIDATE WIDENS RIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Defiant Russian lawmakers rejected President Boris
Yeltsin's choice for prime minister Monday after ignoring Kremlin
warnings that a ``no'' vote would prolong the country's profound
economic woes and could lead to mass civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
   The move came as President Bill Clinton departed for Moscow for
a summit that many Russian observers see as little more than a
misguided vote of support in an increasingly weak and isolated
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's vote dashed whatever faint hope remained that the
Kremlin and the opposition-dominated parliament might put their
considerable differences aside to address an economic crisis that
has left the stock market in collapse, the ruble sharply devalued
and teetering, the government unable to pay its foreign debts, the
country's banking system in ruins and Russian businesses across
nine time zones paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of tackling the crisis that sent world markets diving
for a third straight day amid dire visions of political upheaval in
a nuclear superpower, Russia's warring factions instead attacked
each other as the country, already perched on the edge of financial
collapse, rumbled toward the brink of a new political crisis.
</P>
<P>
   During three hours of angry debate proceeding a resounding
251-94 vote not to confirm acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, leaders of the State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, argued that the man who served as Russia's premier from
late 1992 until Yeltsin fired him this March was not the one to
solve the current crisis. Communist and liberal opposition groups,
sensing that the balance of power in Russia has shifted after five
years of near absolute rule by Yeltsin, stepped up calls for the
embattled president to resign and let the Duma choose a government
more to its liking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our president, in the condition he is in, has paralyzed the
entire political and economical situation,'' said liberal lawmaker
Grigory Yavlinsky. ``It is time for him to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, 67 and in visibly poor physical condition, has said he
will not step down, even after losing the steady ruble that had
been seen as the one sure accomplishment of seven years of painful
reforms. From the rural hunting lodge where he has been holed up
for most of this crisis, Yeltsin responded to the Duma's challenge
by resubmitting Chernomyrdin's candidacy, forcing the Duma to hold
a second vote next week. If the Duma rejects Chernomyrdin a third
time, the Russian Constitution says that Yeltsin then dismisses the
legislature and sets new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been through all this before _ most recently, when
Yeltsin fired Chernomyrdin in March and forced the Duma to approve
his young and inexperienced candidate, Sergei Kiriyenko. But both
sides say the stakes are higher this time, after Yeltsin, in a
characteristically baffling about-face, fired Kiriyenko and
re-appointed Chernomyrdin after the ruble lost over a third of its
value on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is on the verge of political and economic collapse,''
Chernomyrdin said during a speech to parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this chaos lasts for several more weeks, it may happen that
there will be neither Communists nor us,'' added Yeltsin's envoy to
the Duma, Alexander Kotenkov, urging the house to approve
Chernomyrdin. ``I mean a popular uprising, merciless and
senseless.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Communist members of parliament are reportedly looking
forward to the possibility of new elections, figuring voters will
be more likely to look left after the latest economic debacle. But
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, in urging parliament to vote
down Chernomyrdin, appeared to be also calling for a solution that
avoided elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we fail to reach an agreement here everything will spill
out to the streets,'' he said, adding an appeal to the Russian
military and police force not to take part in any crackdowns.
</P>
<P>
   For all these dire warnings, Moscow seemed peaceful enough early
Monday. There was little sign of the panic buying that swept Moscow
when the crisis hit after the ruble lost 40 percent of its worth
overnight last month and Russians hurried to try to get at least
something for their money. The Russian currency even staged a mild
recovery in street trading after a series of sharp falls, and some
stores put on sales to adjust their prices to the higher ruble
rate.
</P>
<P>
   But for businesses, banks, or anyone with money in deposit
accounts, it was another day of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's banking system has effectively closed down, with a
number of institutions ready to go under. No bank business is being
done, meaning that no bills can be paid or money transfered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the impression that the whole banking system has
collapsed,'' said Anna Frantsuzeva of Diaog Bank. ``No payments
are being made.''
</P>
<P>
   And by the end of the day, consumers took another hit as the
Central Bank lowered the ruble rate by 18 percent to 9.33 to the
dollar, undercutting consumers who had been trading their
hard-saved dollars for as little as 8 rubles earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Moscow, where few people have extra money to spend,
the situation was getting worse. The semi-official Interfax news
agency reported that prices on many staple items had risen by 50 to
80 percent in some regions as sellers tried to hedge against
newfound uncertainty in the ruble. The price hikes are likely to
add to the difficulties of millions of workers who for years have
been paid late, or not at all, by the insolvent firms they work
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we drag on with the choosing of the government, soon there
will be no stores, and no bank accounts,'' warned centrist
legislator Oleg Morozov.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin had sought to strike a compromise with the
Communist-dominated Duma by offering a return to some Soviet-style
state controls on the econonmy, such as limited price fixing and
printing money to pay workers. Chernomyrdin also offered to
transfer some of Yeltsin's vast powers to parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But after a weekend of negotiations in which it became clear
that Yeltsin himself was not ready to cede his powers, all the main
factions of parliament except for Chernomyrdin's own party refused
to sign the political pact on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Even with his deal with the Duma in tatters, Chernomyrdin still
may resort to printing rubles to solve the wages and banking
crises. In his speech Monday, also said his priorities would be
supporting industry and guaranteeing that depositors receive their
money.
</P>
<P>
   Western creditors have warned that printing money may lead to a
new round of hyperinflation that would sweep away what is left of
Russia's market economy, as well as its current leaders. Clinton
and other Western leaders have said the West will help, but only if
Moscow sticks to the austerity program prescribed by the
International Monetary Fund, which backed a $22.6 billion rescue
package for Russia in July.
</P>
<P>
   That bailout, however, failed to prevent the ruble from
devaluing or Russia from defaulting.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Russian observers see US support for Yeltsin as a
bankrupt strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin is worse than a lame duck,'' said Igor Bunin, an
analyst at the Center for Political Technologies in Moscow, was
quoted by The Associated Press as saying. ``Clinton is supporting
Yeltsin by inertia. It's no longer support of a concrete person _
it's fear of catastrophe.''

STUDY REPORTS BENEFITS OF SEED THERAPY IN PROSTATE CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Implanting tiny radioactive pellets to treat prostate cancer
gives men as good a chance of beating the disease as surgically
removing the gland _ at least in cases diagnosed early _ suggests a
10-year analysis published today.
</P>
<P>
   Men have flocked to the pellet treatment because it avoids
incontinence, impotence, and other side effects of surgery. But in
a debate reminiscent of the mastectomy-versus-lumpectomy
controversy about breast cancer treatment in the 1980s, many
surgeons have warned that men opting for the new treatment were
risking their lives without good evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, the most long-term to date, shows that nearly two
out of three men survived 10 years after having the pellet
implants, which deliver radiation from inside the prostate. These
survivors also had very low levels of prostate-specific antigen, or
PSA, which can signal regrowth of the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Only three of the 147 study subjects died of prostate cancer.
The Seattle authors claim this record puts the new treatment on a
par with radical prostatectomy and makes it superior to external
radiation.
</P>
<P>
   In other studies of early-stage patients who received
prostatectomy, the Seattle group noted, 47 percent to 73 percent
were alive and disease-free 10 years later. In studies of those
treated with conventional external radiation, disease-free survival
at 10 years ranged from 13 to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will convince a lot of the skeptics,'' said Dr.
Leroy J. Korb of Northwest Hospital in Seattle, where the implant
procedure was pioneered. ``There will be skeptics regardless of the
data, but I think this will bring a lot of patients and surgeons
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said the data at least demonstrate that brachytherapy, as
the pellet implants are called, can cure prostate cancer in some
patients _ a point that some have contested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most failures in prostate cancer occur between five and 10
years after treatment, so we're getting close to saying that
brachytherapy does cure some patients,'' said Dr. Anthony V.
D'Amico of Brigham and Women's Hospital and Dana Farber Cancer
Institute in Boston. D'Amico is author of a report, to be published
in two weeks, that compares five-year results of surgery, external
radiation, and brachytherapy in nearly 1,900 patients.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico and others cautioned, however, that a single center's
results with one type of therapy do not permit firm conclusions
about one therapy versus another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purist would say that this kind of analysis only
demonstrates that this therapy appears to be very promising,'' said
Dr. John Long, a urologist at New England Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information you really need are results from head-to-head
studies of different therapies,'' Long said. ``But we certainly
don't have that and we're not likely to get it. We've got a sea of
opinions, and strictly speaking there is no standard of care for
managing patients with a new diagnosis of prostate cancer today.''
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of such rigorous comparisons, there will be
plenty of room for debate about which therapy is best for any one
patient.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Doctors will still recommend prostatectomy for men with
cancers discovered at a later stage _ a sizable group, but one that
is dwindling due to the widespread use of a diagnostic test called
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and regular rectal exams.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Long and many surgeons argue that younger men with
early prostate cancer, those diagnosed in their 50s or early 60s,
should go the prostatectomy route, partly in the belief that it is
more likely to excise all cancer cells, and partly because
radiation can make it harder to treat a recurrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the biggest criticisms that the aggressive
surgical community will level: We don't know how to manage these
guys (who have had brachytherapy) when they fail,'' Long said.
``It's difficult to do a radical prostatectomy because of scar
tissue in the area of radiation. And you can't use radiation
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Optimal treatment of prostate cancer is a big issue. With
184,500 new diagnoses each year and 39,200 deaths, prostate cancer
is the second cancer killer among men, after lung cancer.
Americans' increasing longevity is driving the numbers continually
upward.
</P>
<P>
   Radical prostatectomy is still the most frequent treatment,
accounting for about 40 percent of all cases. About 30 percent of
patients receive external beam radiation, which often damages
normal tissue of the bladder, urethra, and intestines.
Brachytherapy, used in only about 2 percent of cases in 1995, is
now thought to account for 10 percent, with the remainder receiving
hormone therapy or only ``watchful waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   The new study involved patients whose tumors were diagnosed
relatively early, when they were still apparently confined to the
walnut-shaped gland. Still, 82 percent in the study had tumors that
doctors could palpate during rectal exams _ an indication that the
tumors were not as early as many diagnosed these days on the basis
of PSA readings and needle biopsies.
</P>
<P>
   One subgroup of Seattle patients, who were thought to be at
higher risk because their cancer cells appeared to be a more
aggressive type, received low-level external radiation in addition
to radioactive seed implants. But their survival rate was not
significantly different from the lower-risk group.
</P>
<P>
   This finding, Korb said, is leading the Seattle group to offer
low-dose external radiation in addition to brachytherapy to some
patients who are thought to be higher risk.

SILK REMAINS A MAINSTAY IN WARDROBES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRAN INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Fashion materials may come and go, but one fiber
that has remained a mainstay in well-rounded wardrobes is silk, the
oldest and strongest of all natural fibers.
</P>
<P>
   Silk fabric has been valued over the centuries for its luxurious
feeling of softness and for its exceptional ability to be evenly
dyed, giving it a richer appearance than most other dyed fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Before World War II, the hosiery industry was the biggest user
of raw silk (now most stockings are made of nylon). Today, silk is
used in everything from men's and women's fashions to upholstery
and other home decorating fabrics, from throw pillows to draperies
and paper-backed wallcoverings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like silk because it's a traditional natural fabric.
They can wear silk in any season, depending on the weight of it,''
said Jill Herskowitz, operations manager of Jean Lewis Maloy
fashions in Stuyvesant Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silk is also a very forgiving fabric, in that it can be worn
on any shaped figure. Instead of clinging to the body, it falls
very loosely. You can also pair it up with any other fabric, from
dungarees to a wool skirt or suit.'' Silk can be extremely light in
weight, making it ideal for lingerie. But it's also warmer than
cotton, linen or rayon clothing, allowing silk and silk knit
undergarments to do the job of several layers of often bulkier
thermal wear.
</P>
<P>
   It also travels well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrinkles just fall out if you hang the garment up in the
shower and let it steam for a few minutes,'' Herskowitz said.
``Because of the weight, silk is easy to pack and doesn't take up
much room in the suitcase or garment bag. Plus it's light to
carry.''
</P>
<P>
   Silk is more widely available and affordable than ever before,
said Jeffrey White, president of S. Shamash &AMP; Sons, an
international manufacturer of silk fabrics based in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big news in silks is that over the last 10 years China has
expanded the production of silk, so that it is now available and
affordable to a larger section of the population,'' said White.
``The other news is washable silks. Silk is more than 3,000 years
old and dry cleaning only 100. So people have washed silk for
centuries. But now more silks than ever before can be washed,
because of better dying techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   While washable silks can be hand- or machine-washed on a gentle
cycle, White said they should be line-dried, and never put in a
clothes dryer.
</P>
<P>
   Because silk goes with so many fabrics, it is woven in a variety
of textures from smooth to a rough. nubby finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Satin silks are the most elegant,'' said White, ``like stiffly
woven duchess satin that couturier designers like Vera Wang use for
wedding gowns. Then there are the silk satins that are used for
pajamas, sheets and fashions for dressy occasions. Crepe de chine
tends to be used mostly for blouses.''
</P>
<P>
   Other popular silks weaves are organza, chiffon and shantung.
</P>
<P>
   Fashionable men's ties are made from either printed silk twill,
which is a ribbed or ridged fabric like denim or dyed Jacquard,
where the small pattern designs are woven in, according to White.
</P>
<P>
   The retail cost of silk depends on its quality. A recent trip to
stores in the Capital Region found taffeta blouses costing anywhere
from about $50 to more than $200; a silk shell top for $68, a skirt
for $88 and a long-sleeve silk knit for $48. Prices will vary from
store to store and between designer labels.
</P>
<P>
   Home furnishing fabrics made from silk add a wealth of ambiance
to any room.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Bellinger Inc., in Cohoes has been manufacturing silk
weave fabrics for upholstery and windows in her fabric collections
for 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We add things as the times and market changes, but silk fiber
has always been a constant here,'' said Michelle Heffernan, display
coordinator for Bellinger. ``The fiber helps to not only make a
textile beautiful but durable as well.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not known when sericulture, the raising and keeping of
silkworms for the production of raw silk, actually began, but silk
has been documented as early as the 12th-century B.C. in China,
which still produces the bulk of all silk garments, followed by
Korea, India and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Silk comes from the Bombyx mori moth, which produces eggs that
evolve into caterpillars. These moths, who prefer mulberry leaves
to clothing, eat until they can't possibly chew one more mouthful _
and then begin the process of cocooning.
</P>
<P>
   They spin their cocoon around themselves by extruding liquid
silk that's covered with a tacky sealant called sericin. Once the
moth passes through its larvae stage, it burrows through the cocoon
and in the process breaks this valued filament.
</P>
<P>
   Silkworms raised on silk farms, who are fed only mulberry
leaves, are killed with heat or steam when they reach the larvae
stage, so that they don't break out of the cocoon and break the
thread, which when unraveled (and unbroken), can reach a length of
a mile long, according to White.
</P>
<P>
   ``To give you an idea of silk consumption, it takes 2,000 silk
cocoons to make a blouse,'' said White.
</P>
<P>
   Like people, silkworms have ``off'' times, too. If the climate
isn't just right, they can produce a lesser quality silk that tends
to be used in silk products that are more textured, rather than the
plush, smooth silks, satins and chiffons.

ADMINISTRATION DEFENDS CLINTON TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Clinton arrives in a Russia with an uncertain
future to launch a summit of questionable consequence amid a world
economy in chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, nervous senior aides cobbled together the
final details of Clinton's summit with President Boris N. Yeltsin
as they confronted more unsettling news. The lower chamber of the
Russian parliament, the Duma, voted overwhelmingly Monday to reject
Yeltsin's appointment of Viktor S. Chernomyrdin as prime minister,
effectively stripping Yeltsin of a government beneath him. And the
New York Stock Exchange's Dow Jones industrial average plunged a
breathtaking 512 points.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to meet with Yeltsin Tuesday in what analysts and
even some countrymen have described as an extraordinary spectacle:
a Russian president with ailing health and no actual government
negotiating with an American president whose credibility and very
tenure have been called into question by a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton defended his trip Monday by saying it is incumbent on a
world economic power like the United States to rescue Russia from a
return to a state-run economy dictated by an authoritarian regime.
The timing of the summit, according to Clinton and some of his
aides, could not be more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to do is to go there and tell them that the easy
thing to do is not the right thing to do,'' said Clinton, speaking
at a suburban Washington elementary school hours before he flew
here. ``The easy thing to do would be to try to go back to the way
they did it before, and it's not possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, again summoning the spectre of terrorists with nuclear
bombs, cited the issue of Russia's nuclear arsenal _ the world's
second largest _ as reason enough to continue working with the
Kremlin to nurse the nation back to economic health.
</P>
<P>
   ``A weakened Russia, a weakened Russian economy, would put
enormous pressure on people who have those technologies and
understandings to sell them,'' he said. ``We don't want that to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Some aides maintained a good face when discussing the summit,
which will also include a round of meetings between senior economic
advisers from the two countries and direct talks between Clinton
and opposition leaders and lower government officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is positively, absolutely the right time to do this,''
said one senior administration adviser, talking on the condition of
anonymity. ``While the two presidents are meeting, our economic
people will be helping them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were less sanguine about this gathering. Some White House
staff could not recall another event in this administration as
unscripted as this summit _ an appalling proposition to advisers
unaccustomed to such surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Many US officials are unclear about the potential benefits of
the summit and uncertain if the Russian leaders will continue
market reforms toward democracy or slip back into a world of
central planning from the old Soviet state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the preliminary stage for the next phase in
Russian history,'' said another administration official, who talked
on the condition of anonymity. ``And we don't know what is coming.
What you're seeing is the beginning of the end of Yeltsin, and we
don't know how long the transition will take.''
</P>
<P>
   Left unstated is the sharp contrast between this summit and
summits of old, especially during the height of the Cold War, when
two powerful world leaders _ Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev _
met with all of their considerable negotiating skills to address
the life-and-death issues of nuclear holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Some administration officials have been reassured in part by the
opportunity that Clinton will have to meet face to face with
Yeltsin at a time of crisis. For months, press and intelligence
reports have chronicled Yeltsin's failing health, and the two-day
meeting will provide Clinton the chance to make his own
determination.
</P>
<P>
   The summit will also give Clinton an unusual opportunity to meet
with potential successors to Yeltsin and lesser officials who might
shape the future of Russian rule. Sandwiched between a daytime
meeting and a nighttime dinner, Clinton is planning to deliver an
address to a group of young Russians at the Moscow University of
International Relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important for Clinton is to use the trip to get
directly from Yeltsin what plan he has to get out of this crisis,''
said James Goldgeier, a visiting fellow at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington think tank. ``It will be useful to see
Yeltsin and see how he is functioning and to see what his plan is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will also be useful to hear from opposition figures and
other government figures,'' said Goldgeier. ``On-the-ground
information gathering is the best use of this summit.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Monday made several oblique references to helping Russia
through its economic peril, but provided no direct plan for
economic aid. Such aid may be used by Clinton as a carrot, although
the amount is expected to be relatively modest, as he and Yeltsin
negotiate agreements over nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they will stay on the path of reform, to stabilize their
society and to strengthen their economy and to get growth back,
then I believe America and the rest of the western nations with
strong economies should help them, and indeed have an obligation to
help them, and that it's in our interest to help them,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, most aides and analysts said the summit is
continuing only because the United States would have dealt a
devastating political blow to Yeltsin's already falling fortunes if
officials had called for its cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bizarre time, but it was scheduled, and in the end he
had to go,'' said Goldgeier.

<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ With her bold public stands
undermined by irresolution in the White House and her experience
rendered less relevant by new economic crises, Madeleine Albright
has had a tough 20 months as secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Albright remains the Clinton administration's principal foreign
policy voice and the liaison with a recalcitrant Republican
Congress, and she is very popular in the country beyond Washington.
But a president averse to military risk, preoccupied by the fallout
from his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and unwilling to offend
core Democratic constituencies has not supported her on key issues
like the Middle East and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Her assiduous courtship of Congress was instrumental in winning
Senate ratification of NATO expansion and the Chemical Weapons
Convention from a Congress verging on isolationism. But Albright
has had little to do with the other Clinton successes of his second
term: a settlement in Northern Ireland and a reinvigoration of
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   And now, as Russia melts, tainting one of the relationships of
which Clinton has been proudest, this is a particularly vulnerable
period for the administration's foreign policy. Russia was part of
widening international economic crisis that has now hit Wall
Street, threatening the economic boom that has kept his popularity
afloat.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright and the State Department have not been crucial
players, White House officials say. With Clinton so distracted, it
is not immediately clear who is in charge. The evidence appears to
favor National Security Adviser Sandy Berger and Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin, though, instead of Albright.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Albright bristled at specific criticism,
but says it is only natural that the economic experts take the lead
on their issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, what's important is what people think in years
hence,'' Albright said. ``Whether I used this four-year period in a
way that ultimately accomplished what I want: to create the
underpinnings for the American role in the next century, while
taking care of what needs to be done to problem-solve.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright attended only one recent meeting of the National
Economic Council, the functional equivalent of the National
Security Council, and that was on Japan. She and her officials did
regularly urge a broader view of U.S. interests in Asia than simply
the financial, including security and the stabilization of
democratizing Asian allies, and coordinated interagency aid
packages for Thailand and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   But her call for President Suharto of Indonesia to step down
occurred only hours before he did so anyway, and in general,
Albright and her department have let the Treasury Department run
the show.
</P>
<P>
   Was this an opportunity missed, or simply, as Albright and her
aides contend, the most efficient and collegial way to coordinate a
post-Soviet world with new, nontraditional challenges?
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle East, on the other hand, Albright has been
central, trying to coax and cajole Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of Israel into a compromise that would refresh a
deterioriating peace and help restore U.S. credibility in the Arab
world. But her intensive efforts have not yet produced the clear
personal triumph that zero-sum Washington seems to require.
</P>
<P>
   In May, she gambled that public pressure and an ultimatum would
move Netanyahu, but the White House failed to support her in the
face of a lobbying firestorm stoked by the American Israel Public
Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
   She kept the administration engaged in Bosnia, where it could
not reasonably retreat. Here in Sarajevo on Sunday and again
Monday, Albright spoke passionately and effectively about the
effort required to make a multinational, democratic Bosnia come to
pass, and she was eager to make it vividly clear that U.S. aid
would only come to those who worked to carry out the Dayton
accords.
</P>
<P>
   But her advocacy of an aggressive approach _ including a
credible threat of air strikes _ toward Serbian leader Slobodan
Milosevic, over his crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in
Kosovo Province did not find wide support within NATO and was
rejected by Clinton in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Her vow in March that ``we are not going to stand by and watch
the Serbian authorities do in Kosovo what they can no longer get
away with doing in Bosnia'' has proven hollow.
</P>
<P>
   Other U.S. threats have seemed equally empty _ against Iraq to
defend U.N. weapons inspections, for example. That has called into
question the U.S. commitment to a sustained war on terrorism, a
commitment Albright and others pledged would begin with the missile
strikes against Afghanistan and Sudan.

</P>
<P>
   SOME EARLY VICTORIES FOR A NEW SECRETARY
</P>
<P>
   Albright's accession as secretary of state, which made her the
highest-ranking woman in American history, prompted enormous
popular and media interest. She attracted attention for her newly
discovered Jewish background as well as for successful efforts to
expand NATO and to her push to articulate a more forceful U.S.
position than her dry, quiet predecessor, Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
   She quickly earned respect from her French, Russian, Chinese and
Arab colleagues. Early victories in Congress were hailed, and she
has won important policy shifts on Iran and Cuba, while helping to
prevent a trade war with Europe over sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   But with domestic problems undercutting Clinton's international
credibility, U.S. foreign policy seems ever more reactive. And with
the bombing of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, followed by
missile strikes in Afghanistan and Sudan, with civil war in Kosovo,
nuclear tests by India and Pakistan, Russian economic and political
problems and the unresolved crisis in Iraq flaring again, the world
seems a more dangerous and unstable place than when Albright came
to office.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's greatest virtues _ clarity and an intelligent,
forceful voice that connects with the public and Congress _ have
not diminished, said a senior White House official who admires her.
But as the administration faces diverse and less manageable
problems, many due to Asia's economic problems, ``her virtues seem
less impressive or timely,'' the official said, ``because neither
economics nor strategy are her strengths, and her depth lies in
European issues, not Asian ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Albright's hard work with Congress _ in particular with
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. _ has not yet produced a deal to repay
Washington's debt to the United Nations or the International
Monetary Fund, both described as high priorities by her aides.
Compromises have been stymied by a fight with House Republicans
over abortion policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My predecessors had a different world to deal with in which
the parameters were fairly set,'' Albright said. ``They had the
possibility of focusing all their attention on one or two issues.''
By contrast, she said, she is trying to ``put into play a lot of
issues that I see as challenges we're facing,'' like nuclear
nonproliferation, economics and the effective use of sanctions,
issues that were at the center of a January review of priorities.
</P>
<P>
   LAND MINES AND WAR CRIMES
</P>
<P>
   Albright has failed to achieve some of the human-rights goals
she described as among the most important to her. She was an early
champion of a ban on land mines. Last year, however, in Ottawa the
United States was nearly alone in opposing a treaty.
</P>
<P>
   As a Central European whose family fled first the Nazis and then
the Communists, she has been especially concerned about crimes
against humanity. She created an ambassador for war crimes and
lobbied for a permanent international tribunal to prosecute them.
</P>
<P>
   But at a Rome conference to accomplish that goal, the United
States was part of a small minority refusing to sign a treaty to
create a permanent tribunal. In both cases, the Pentagon and
Congress successfully argued that the United States required
special exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she continues to champion her principles, but she
cannot forget America's responsibilities. ``I have to balance
enunciating the principles and leading the way with the pragmatism
of getting things done and the power of the United States,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is now a new expression in diplomatic circles _ ``to
pull an Ottawa'' _ which means to promote a new initiative and then
abandon it at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's fierce rhetorical battles with the Iraqis at the
United Nations helped catapult her into the secretary's elegant
office. And in a corridor leading off from it, she keeps a comic
shrine, a collection of cartoons, newspaper cuttings and other
mementos of her tussles with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But the Iraq problem persists. The latest crisis is an outgrowth
of last March's inconclusive standoff that did little for the
reputation of Clinton's foreign-policy team.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq continues to serve as a reminder of the limits of U.S.
power in the post-Soviet world with difficulties in orchestrating
allies and of the continuing reluctance of Clinton to use force in
risky circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   THE BIG FIASCO IN COLUMBUS
</P>
<P>
   But the televised ``town hall'' meeting in Columbus, Ohio, was
the most visible fiasco. Albright, National Security Adviser Sandy
Berger and Defense Secretary William Cohen were unable to silence
hecklers or to sound convincing about why a nearly isolated United
States might need to bomb Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio meeting, organized by the White House to use Albright's
skills and popularity, began the erosion of her reputation among
the foreign-policy elite of which she has been a member for so
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look around the world for the big challenges now,
where's the secretary of state?'' asked Robert Zoellick, former
under secretary of state for James Baker, who enjoyed a level of
influence over his president, George Bush, that seems denied to
Albright. ``To an outsider, she's MIA. People run issues case by
case, but there's a sense the show is being managed by Berger.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration manages crises but has no clear strategic
framework, Zoellick said. ``How do different problems relate to one
another? It starts with the president, but it's not her forte or
Berger's. If you don't have a sense of where you want to take the
country, you won't get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mandelbaum, who criticized Clinton's first-term foreign
policy as ``social work,'' thinks the current team is doing
decently at managing the smaller crises of the post-Cold War world,
which have less to do with national security and diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly in this second presidential term, by far the most
important figures in foreign policy'' are Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin and his deputy, Lawrence Summers, Mandelbaum said. ``For that
we should be grateful. A world with a financial crisis is far safer
than a world with a military crisis, and they've been doing pretty
well. ``But Albright doesn't seem to be a player in all this,''
said Mandelbaum.

</P>
<P>
   SUCCESS WITH CHINA: WHO GETS CREDIT?
</P>
<P>
   Richard Haass of the Brookings Institution, who was a staff
member of the National Security Council under Bush, said ``the one
significant accomplishment in the second term'' has been to renew
relations with China. ``There you can see a policy initiative and
presidential investment,'' he said. ``One senses that the engine
for that has been the president and the National Security
Council.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Albright defended her involvement and that of
her strong team in the full range of foreign policy, from Asia and
China to Iran and Cuba. On financial matters, she said, she has
been working to ensure that the diplomatic, human and security
aspects are fully grasped.
</P>
<P>
   As a former academic, she has been happy to reach down to the
regional assistant secretaries and to urge them ``to think outside
the box,'' wanting career officers to compete for ideas with
outsiders. She has encouraged Under Secretaries Thomas Pickering
and Stuart Eizenstat, and Deputy Secretary Strobe Talbott, ``to
drive policy and make things happen,'' an official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic issues we have brought right into the department,''
Albright said, ``and we have an under secretary who's strong _ Stu
Eizenstat _ really working on sanctions issues and on trying to
meld the financial with the assistance part of the Asian financial
crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   She has pushed hard, as she promised him she would, Eizenstat
said, to make the State Department a serious player again on
economic issues. Treasury gets the headlines over Asia, he said,
``but we and she have been intimately involved with the
humanitarian and political dimensions.''
</P>
<P>
   She is confident about her managing role as secretary of state,
as the prime foreign policy spokesman for the administration and as
a formulator of key policy. And she rejects the notion that
Clinton's choice of Richard Holbrooke for chief delegate to the
United Nations, who was said to have been a candidate for the job
before Albright was chosen, is a sign her own star is waning or
wanting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is what it is,'' she said, shrugging. ``People
think you're terrific, and then they think you're too terrific, so
then they let you know that you're not. You can't be in a position
of being the visible voice for the United States and not be out
there to be praised and criticized.''
</P>
<P>
   ALBRIGHT A SURVIVOR OF THE DUKAKIS DAYS
</P>
<P>
   Albright and Berger have a friendship dating back to the
presidential campaign of Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, when
Albright was the chief foreign policy adviser to a candidate who
took almost unremitting heat for not having a strong foreign policy
view. Despite moments of annoyance, usually over personnel,
presidential briefings or second-guessing about the results of
specific diplomatic missions, they are each other's closest
advisers. They hash out policy in advance and speak many times a
day _ in sharp contrast to the tension between Christopher and
Anthony Lake, or the raging warfare under Jimmy Carter between
Cyrus Vance and Zbigniew Brzezinski.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the foreign-policy president who wakes up thinking
what notes he can pen to his foreign colleagues,'' a senior
administration official said, a reference, apparently, to Bush, who
was famous for his hand-written correspondence to world leaders.
``So Berger becomes the guy who doesn't make foreign policy so much
as broker it.''
</P>
<P>
   In meetings, another senior White House official said, ``she is
pragmatic and a consensus-builder, like Berger, despite her
reputation outside as an uncompromising, six-gun shooting
moralist.'' She arrives well-briefed and armed with a collective
department view, in contrast to Cohen, whose well-armed Pentagon
often gets its way regardless. She is ``articulate on issues she
knows well, and tends to put aside the talking points and draw from
her own experience, and she's best when she does that.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright dealt movingly with the emotional and security crisis
surrounding the bombing of the two U.S. embassies and the deaths of
many of her employees, and she has handled Clinton's personal
troubles with dignity.
</P>
<P>
   TAKING IT EASY ON THE IRANIANS
</P>
<P>
   But her finest policy moment lately has been a shift in the
treatment of Iran after the election of the moderate Mohammad
Khatami as president. While maintaining demands for a halt to
terrorism and a halt to Iran's nuclear, chemical and missile
programs, she pushed Clinton to a more receptive Iran policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard and she had internal criticism, but she got it
done with Sandy and the president,'' avoiding an interagency
battle, an official said. After her recent speech laying out the
new policy _ to which Iran has not yet responded _ the president
took her aside to congratulate her, she said, ``for threading the
needle.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, she used contacts with the pope, Congress and Cuban
exiles in Miami to allow direct relief flights from the United
States to Cuba to resume and to allow relatives to send money.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is also praised for her work with Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov, which helped forge a new relationship
between NATO and Russia. At one point, aides remember, as Primakov
argued for secondary military status for new NATO members, Albright
said: ``Neither the president nor I will negotiate over the heads
of the peoples of Central Europe. That happened once before, and
it's not going to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright is also proud of using her unprecedented telephone
relationship with the Chinese foreign minister to organize the
Permanent Five to condemn nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. At
their June meeting in Geneva, she told the others that they are
``always talking about a multipolar and not a unipolar world.''
This was their chance to prove it, she said, ``so one country
doesn't take a principled stand and the others sign up the
contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   SHE WILL AWAIT HISTORY'S JUDGMENT
</P>
<P>
   With all the ``profound ideological confusion'' facing a
post-Cold War secretary of state, said Moises Naim, editor of
Foreign Policy, this is not a period for ``grand strategy.''
Albright's role, he said, is inevitably one of a goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   But secretaries of state are often defined by challenges. Baker,
for instance, had a great crisis thrust upon him, the Persian Gulf
War, and a great opportunity, the collapse of Communism.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Albright has not had such a test or made such an
opportunity of Asia or Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't operate on the basis of instant gratification on any
part of my daily work,'' she said. ``The policies that are being
put into place are longer term. It may be the next secretary of
state will reap the rewards of what I've done. Sitting in this
chair you get the sense that you are a part of history.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted her recent induction into the Women's Hall of Fame.
``When they say I'm the highest-ranking woman in the history of the
United States, that's pretty amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Kipper of the Council on Foreign Relations, while a
fierce critic of U.S. Middle East policy, praises Albright for
showing the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can be soft with her children, motherly and nice and go
shopping and be all the things a decent person can be, Ms. Kipper
said, ``but when it comes to the work, she's tough and serious.
There's no gender in the work.''

RUSSIA'S POLITICAL RIFT WIDENS ON EVE OF CLINTON-YELTSIN SUMMIT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's political crisis deepened Monday as President
Clinton, on the eve of an ill-timed summit, sought to bolster the
Kremlin's resolve to continue painful reforms even as the economy
falters.
</P>
<P>
   In another setback for Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
legislators in the Communist-led Duma rejected Viktor Chernomyrdin
as prime minister. The overwhelming vote, 253-94, came a day after
Parliament leaders opposed a pact that would have allowed Yeltsin
to form a new Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The move heightened the political confrontation roiling the
nation as its economy teeters near collapse. Both sides warned of a
possible uprising if the chaos continues.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia before leaving for Moscow, Clinton tried to urge the
Russians to stay on the path toward reform, saying the United
States and other Western nations had an obligation to help Russia
if it does.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to do is go there and tell them that the easy
thing to do is not the right thing to do. The easy thing to do
would be to try to go back to the way they did it before and that's
not possible,'' said Clinton, speaking at a meeting with educators.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if they will stay on the path of reform to stabilize their
society and strengthen their economy and to get growth back, then I
believe America and the rest of the Western nations with strong
economies should help them, and indeed have an obligation to help
them'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides noted the International Monetary Fund will soon decide
whether to make another $4.3 billion installment on its $22.6
billion bailout for Russia. The Russian government used the first
payment to prop up the ruble but that strategy failed. The
currency's value tumbled, the stock market went into a free fall
and the banking system neared failure.
</P>
<P>
   The economic turmoil prompted Yeltsin to turn to Chernomyrdin,
whom he had fired just five months earlier. An agreement between
Yeltsin and the Parliament this weekend called for an 18-month
truce if the president would surrender some of his sweeping powers.
But the Duma leaders rejected the pact, and Chernomyrdin's
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Duma leader Gennady Zyuganov blamed Chernomyrdin for Russia's
current economic situation, noting he presided over the nation as
the economy worsened.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported Zyuganov told Chernomyrdin, ``You
will fail and bring the country to ruin.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin told Duma members, ``Russia is on the verge of
political and economic collapse. We can only come out of the crisis
by uniting our efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin can submit Chernomyrdin's name two more times but
Parliament is expected to hold talks to suggest possible
alternatives. If the Duma, the lower chamber, rejects Yeltsin's
choice three times, the legislature can be dissolved and new
elections held.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we fail to reach an agreement here everything will spill
out to the streets,'' Zyuganov said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's parliamentary liaison told the AP that the crisis
could lead to dire consequences for the entire government.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this chaos lasts for several more weeks, it may happen that
there will be neither Communists nor us,'' Alexander Kotenkov
warned. ``I mean a popular uprising, merciless and senseless.''
</P>
<P>
   Russians continue to await the payoff of democratic reforms and
a turn toward a market economy.
</P>
<P>
   A stylishly dressed Aida Tairova, 28, huddled under an umbrella
with a friend and explained that she has been looking for a job for
more than a year. She cares little for Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of her friends and relatives live in poverty. They cannot
make ends meet,'' said a translator. Tairova, on one hand, wants
Russia to follow the United States' example, but then also talks
about how Russia was better under communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Russian people did not suffer and the living standards
were on the average OK. It was better under the communists,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Ivanova, 57, who runs a newsstand in an underground
shopping area, said, ``Life is not worse. Life is more difficult,''
she said, adding Russia cannot return to communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all in the past. We have come a long way since those
times. Some things are better, some things are worse. The very fact
we are moving forward is a good thing,'' Ivanova said.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides maintained the Duma's action should have
little significant impact on the summit between Clinton and
Yeltsin, a session already under question because both presidents
are embattled.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an internal Russian matter,'' said P.J. Crowley, a
national security council spokesman. ``They'll work through this.
This was something you could anticipate given the rejection of the
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will still be greeted by Chernomyrdin, who remains the
acting prime minister, as he arrives for a two-day summit.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, the president explained why it was important for
him to visit with Yeltsin at this critical time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I'm going to Russia is that we've learned the hard
way that problems that develop beyond our borders sooner or later
find their way to our doorstep unless we help our friends and our
neighbors deal with them as quickly and as promptly as possible,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian people are to be commended for embracing democracy
and getting rid of the old communist system but they are having
some troubles today making the transition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted the United States and Russia still have the
largest nuclear arsenals in the world. He said Russia's cooperation
was critical to curtailing nuclear weapons and stopping sales to
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``A weakened Russian economy would put enormous pressure on
people who have those technologies and understandings to sell them.
We don't want that to happen,'' Clinton said. He also noted
Russia's partnership was critical to halting the war in Bosnia and
will be needed to stop bloodshed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Russia will stay on the path of reform, I believe America
and the rest of the West will help them,'' Clinton said.

LOTT CALLS CLINTON'S BEHAVIOR WITH LEWINSKY `DISGUSTING' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Calling President Clinton's behavior
``disgusting,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said the
president's affair with Monica Lewinsky and his lying about it have
damaged the presidency and raised questions about his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Lott predicted that the sex scandal would interfere with
congressional action in the coming weeks, including a fight over
the federal budget that could lead to a government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   While blasting the president during a news conference marking
the Senate's return from summer recess, Lott stopped short of
calling for Clinton's impeachment or resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can he lead? Can he provide leadership without the necessary
respect and with the problems that he has?''' Lott told reporters.
``Can he provide leadership at a very critical time internationally
and domestically? Guess only time will answer that question.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott also warned foreign groups against mistaking Clinton's
troubles for a weakness in U.S. resolve to combat terrorism. ``To
those that would threaten out country, to terrorists or anyone else
who think they could take advantage of what might appear as a
weakened presidency, on these matters we will stand united,'' the
Mississippi Republican said.
</P>
<P>
   The comments from Lott came as Clinton left for a two-day
meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who is struggling to
remain in power and grappling with economic crisis. From Moscow,
Clinton later this week flies to Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Independent counsel Kenneth Starr is preparing a report for
Congress outlining evidence gathered in a seven-month investigation
of Clinton's admitted affair with Lewinsky, a former White House
intern. The report, which is expected to be delivered in late
September, will address other issues, such as possible obstruction
of justice, that could lead to impeachment hearings against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Clinton should resign over the affair and subsequent
public lies, Lott demurred. ``I think they are disgusting. I'm very
disappointed by the whole matter ... (and) the fact that apparently
these acts did occur in the White House and that he, well, lied
about it to the American people,'' the majority leader said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it will rise to levels that could justify
proceeding in the House on impeachment or anything else,'' Lott
said. ``So I am going to wait for that report and withhold judgment
or further comment until I see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott, who has steered clear of public comments about the sex
scandal since Clinton two weeks ago admitted an affair, said he is
``offended by the president's behavior and by the tragic example he
has set'' for young Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a moral dimension to the American presidency, and
today that dimension, that power, has been lost in scandal and
deception,'' Lott said. ``I am disappointed in the way the highest
office in the nation has been reduced in stature and diminished in
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other Republican leaders, Lott accused Clinton and
congressional Democrats of refusing to yield in budget negotiations
in hopes of prompting a shutdown of federal agencies similar to one
three years ago. He said the scandal has cast a shadow over
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the present circumstances it could be tough to work
together, especially if the president's congressional allies circle
the wagons and try to shut things down.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has threatened to veto half the 13 spending bills that
must be signed into law by Oct. 1 to keep most federal agencies in
operation for the coming year. The measures under veto-threat were
amended by Republicans to include various policies or programs
opposed by Clinton, such as school vouchers, abortion bans and
funding cuts for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Barry Toiv said it was ``laughable for
Senator Lott to suggest that the president or anybody else is to
blame if Congress doesn't complete its work in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said the president's
supporters in the Senate will try to amend upcoming legislation to
include health-care reform, campaign-finance revisions and the
president's school construction program.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a danger of a (government) shutdown, we all know
where it originates,'' Daschle said.

US ORDERS RECONSIDERATION OF GAS PIPELINE ROUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US government has ordered the companies laying a natural-gas
pipeline from Maine to Massachusetts to consider rerouting it
around one of the oldest inhabited sites ever discovered in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has also demanded that
pipeline project officials explain why they did not seek required
federal approval to excavate the site in Eliot, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Artifacts as old as 12,000 years are believed to have been found
at the site near the New Hampshire border. Archeological excavation
was completed in July, but at least one person who worked on the
project believes pressure was applied to meet construction
deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston Globe report on those concerns influenced federal
officials to investigate the decision to lay the pipe through the
Paleoindian site, a project official said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the pipeline's designers must either come up with a plan to
reroute the project or present a potentially risky defense of their
decision to disturb the Paleoindian site.
</P>
<P>
   Their defense might pit one historical era against another,
since officials say they routed the pipe to avoid disturbing the
historical remains of a Colonial garrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``The garrison site was more important than anyone had
recognized. ... This is a rich and layered piece of land,'' said
John Flumerfelt, spokesman for the pipeline's company.
</P>
<P>
   The company, the Portland Natural Gas Transmission System, said
one of its subcontractors erred by failing to notify federal
officials of the archeological discovery and of the plan to remove
the artifacts. Working with the State Historic Preservation Office,
however, a plan was devised to excavate the area and route the
pipeline through the site, Flumerfelt said.
</P>
<P>
   But a top federal administrator, who can order the pipeline to
be re-routed, said state notification is not enough in this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that your companies are not adhering to proper
procedures,'' Kevin P. Madden, director of FERC's Office of
Pipeline Regulation, wrote to project leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``My staff was never afforded the opportunity to review the
treatment plan, and obviously had no opportunity to determine when,
and if, avoidance (of the archeological site) was prudent and
feasible,'' Madden wrote. ``I need a detailed explanation from you
regarding the events surrounding this most serious concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Flumerfelt said pipeline supervisors are confident that the
federal government will arrive at the same conclusion _ that
routing through the Paleoindian site is the best alternative. The
Colonial garrison, dating to about 1700, is nearby and also
considered an important, complex archeological site that pipeline
officials had to consider when devising a route.
</P>
<P>
   Because the site is located on private land, the owner's
concerns could also be a factor in placing the pipeline, project
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ate some humble pie and admitted we made a mistake'' by not
notifying the federal government, Flumerfelt said. ``FERC asked us
to do some further evaluation and analyze the site and minimize any
additional impact to the site.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Flumerfelt said project officials hope to lay the pipe
within the next two weeks, Madden said that no work will be
authorized until his office has approved the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way,'' Madden said. ``It's important that
applicants follow our regulations and requirements. Absent that,
you would have essentially an applicant who would build wherever
they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   One option suggested by federal officials would be to bury the
pipe under the site. Flumerfelt, however, said that alternative may
be even more disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities have final say over the route of the
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're not satisfied,'' Flumerfelt said, ``they can push
us back for more evaluation, and unilaterally impose an alternative
on us.''
</P>
<P>
   The artifacts uncovered in Eliot include red-flint scrapers from
Munsungan Lake, 250 miles away in northern Maine. Also found were a
stone drill and burned bone, which may reveal what game was hunted
by the region's earliest inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   About two dozen Paleoindian sites have been found in New
England. The date of these artifacts comes from an era shortly
after a mile-long ice sheet had retreated northward from
present-day New England.

<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ Just next door to the display of the state's
largest squash and only a flight of stairs above the room where
assorted jams vied for glory, Kate Broderick struck a pose.
</P>
<P>
   Her exuberantly purple gown was neither the worst nor the best
of the 42 outfits worn by as many teen-agers in a fashion revue
Saturday morning at the New York State Fair, but Miss Broderick,
16, of Rensselaer County, stood out nonetheless. Unlike most of the
other 4-H Club girls and boys on the stage, she had not stitched,
dyed, beaded or brocaded what she was wearing.
</P>
<P>
   The totality of her accomplishment had been to purchase it for a
really, really good price.
</P>
<P>
   As she sidled back and forth, beaming and iridescent, an
announcer explained that Miss Broderick had sought an affordable
dress and had come across this one ``when she was almost about to
give up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was stunned to find that the price was only $29.99,'' the
announcer marveled. ``She just couldn't beat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Intrepid shopping on a par with intricate sewing? It spoke
volumes not only about the tenor of the times, but also about the
way the New York State Fair has endeavored to keep pace with them.
</P>
<P>
   For many city slickers familiar with state fairs only through
old movies or television programs, the annual, end-of-summer events
are anachronistic bastions of quaint pastoralism. To some extent,
that's accurate.
</P>
<P>
   The wonders of cultivation, from monstrous zucchini to mammoth
swine, are still celebrated. The divine arts of pickling, canning,
cookie baking and jelly making still garner intensely coveted blue
ribbons.
</P>
<P>
   But while the 152d New York State Fair includes cows trotted out
by breeders eager to show off their livestock, it also features
llamas leaping over a gradually raised bar for no purpose other
than entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   And while there are displays paying tribute to the homespun
ingenuity behind hat decorating and flower arranging, there are
also events and exhibitions honoring bicycle acrobatics, chain-saw
sculpturing and, in Miss Broderick's case, keen-eyed trips down the
aisles of Marshall's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take everybody into account when we prepare the fair,''
said Peter Cappuccilli Jr., the director of the New York State
Fair. ``We've had to make it interesting for all people.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers suggest that fair officials have succeeded. Last
year, 865,000 people attended the 12-day event, second only to
1995, when 882,000 went. Those numbers represented sharp increases
from the 1960s and 1970s, when attendance was usually about
500,000.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the fair, which began last Thursday and ends next
Monday, is on a pace to draw an all-time high of more than 900,000,
state fair officials said.
</P>
<P>
   They estimated that less than 5 percent of today's fairgoers
actually make their livelihoods from agriculture or livestock and
said that New York's fair, like scores of others across the
country, has evolved to reflect that.
</P>
<P>
   It has become a dizzying, all-purpose entertainment
extravaganza, replete this year with hard rock concerts, helicopter
rides and the tedious but awe-inspiring construction of what is
intended to be world's largest sand castle, which should top out at
about 35 feet and more than 400 tons by the time the fair closes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a kitsch-a-palooza, where people can drop by the Pan
African Village to purchase lilliputian African figurines that
function as refrigerator magnets, then amble over to the Center of
Progress for Hawaiian-style leis of flowers they select themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a helter-skelter smorgasbord of such dubiously
nutritious concoctions as snow cones, cotton candy, saltwater taffy
and, of course, golden, greasy funnel cakes. Fried dough is to
state fairs as chocolate is to Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state fair is an orgy of consumption,'' said Mark Ritson,
a marketing professor at the University of Minnesota who is
studying state fairs. As such, Ritson said, it captures the world
around it as well as it ever did.
</P>
<P>
   Americans once defined themselves by what they produced, and the
state fair's parade of newfangled tractors, plump tomatoes and
fleecy sheep paid tribute to that. Americans now define themselves
by what they purchase and consume, and the state fair exalts and
indulges their ravenous, sometimes indiscriminate appetites.
</P>
<P>
   State fairs began in the early 19th century as American
adaptations of European harvest festivals, which reveled in the
bounty of the land. They were vital to the agrarian economy,
serving as trade shows for farmers who needed to familiarize
themselves with the changing tools and methods of production or
advertise their goods to potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   But as the country industrialized and the number of small farms
and farmers dwindled, state fairs were threatened with irrelevance.
By the late 1980's, many state legislatures were cutting off tax
money for the events and insisting that fairs become economically
self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Joe LaGuardia, the marketing director for the New York State
Fair, said it stopped receiving public money for anything but major
construction work in 1990. While the fair is still its own quasi
agency within the State Department of Agriculture and Markets, it
now supports itself, in part through aggressive courtship of
corporate sponsors. Every other pavilion or event at the fair seems
to wear the tag of a company or brand name, from Coca-Cola to Pizza
Hut, Mikasa to Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   Fair officials have also devised ways to sell its most
traditional elements to a modern audience by framing the fair as a
sort of living museum, a child-friendly educational bridge to a
simpler era.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   The buildings devoted to cows and dairy products include not
only the animals themselves, but also a painted wooden effigy at
which children can mimic the task of milking, and a refrigerated
sculpture of a milk deliveryman made with 1,000 pounds of butter.
</P>
<P>
   There are tours of working barns that leave regularly from the
fairgrounds. Matt and Linda Clark and their three sons had just
returned from one when they sat down for a brief rest in the goat
and swine building on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most kids don't realize where everything comes from, and we
learned that 98 percent of a beef cow is used for different things,
not just for food,'' said Clark, a nuclear engineer from Parish,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   His wife nodded her agreement. ``A lot of people from New York
City don't know anything about this stuff,'' she said with more
than a touch of rural pride. ``They only know about the restaurants
where the beef ends up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nostalgia draws many people to the fair. Carol Koller of
Rockville Center, N.Y., came for a second year in a row and dwelled
upon a jar of award-winning pickled vegetables in the Home Art
Center on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way our grandparents lived,'' she said. ``Who has
the time today? Everybody runs around.''
</P>
<P>
   But the march of progress was evident even in the culinary
judging booth just feet away, where a panel of four women coronate
the fruitiest pies, fluffiest cakes and fudgiest brownies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more and more low-sugar categories,'' said Candy
Crider, a home economics teacher on the panel. ``Grilled vegetables
are new this year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very trendy,'' chimed in another judge, Carol Bradford.
</P>
<P>
   The judges were in a delicate mood, for it was jam and jelly
day, not among their favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so sweet and unrelenting,'' said Ms. Bradford, who
received a nutrition degree from Cornell University and studied at
the Cordon Bleu in Paris, as she steered her plastic spoon toward a
paper plate with several gelatinous smears.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the jam entries had to be eliminated at the outset.
``One of the rules is that we won't eat anything that has a foreign
object in it, like hair or debris from the kitchen,'' Ms. Bradford
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the ones we can identify,'' said Ms. Crider, who
clucked appreciatively over a blueberry-spearmint entry in the
``herb jelly or jam'' category and a cranberry-jalapeno melange in
the ``favorite jelly'' field.
</P>
<P>
   Still to come was Spam day, rewarding the contestant who uses
the processed luncheon meat in the most ingeniously delectable
fashion with a $100 prize from Hormel Foods and the chance to
compete in the company's national Spam contest. One year, the
contest was won by someone who used Spam in a chocolate cake.
</P>
<P>
   Also ahead was the macaroni and cheese bake-off, which Sharon
Potucek of Skaneateles, N.Y., a regular fairgoer who was hovering
near the judging area on Saturday morning, said she was hoping to
win. ``You can do a lot with macaroni and cheese,'' said Ms.
Potucek, an office manager for a heating fuel company. ``And I'm
not telling you what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that in a new twist for her fair-obsessed family, she
and her husband were competing against each other, and not just in
one category. Both were submitting macaroni and cheese dishes and
fruit pies. ``I think we're headed for divorce,'' Ms. Potucek said.
</P>
<P>
   But for every fairgoer who approaches the event with the utmost
seriousness, there are several who revel in its sheer goofiness.
Events like the leaping llamas, staged on Friday night to a
recording of the Pointer Sisters song ``Jump,'' cater shamelessly
to that crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have to do is pick out your favorite llama and cheer
'em on to victory,'' explained Valerie Podet, a graduate student in
geology at the State University of New York at Buffalo. Ms. Podet
had a special interest in the outcome; her department chairman,
Michael Sheridan, owned one of the llamas in the contest.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the serene beasts of burden, several of them shorn
and groomed to look like gargantuan poodles, were led on leashes
toward a horizontal wooden pole. Some simply planted their feet and
refused to budge. Some blithely barged into the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan's llama did fine at 30 and 32 inches, but failed at 34.
By 36 inches, the field of about a dozen llamas had been narrowed
to two, and ``Jump'' was on its third or fourth replay. The winning
height was 40 inches, nearly as high as the triumphant llama's
back.
</P>
<P>
   There were peals of laughter, hoots of delight and robust
applause. Then the 200 spectators scattered into the night. Candied
apples, laser tag games, a live shark exhibit and a show by the
Wallflowers, part of the Molson Concert Series, awaited them.

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
It has come down to this. The Comets vs. the Mercury yet again,
this time for all the marbles.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The WNBA championship every team coveted when the 1998 season
began _ and that the Comets fought so gallantly on Saturday to
retain _ is at hand.
</P>
<P>
   But forget about the Comets' rally from a 12-point deficit late
in the second half to beat Phoenix 74-69 in overtime and even the
best-of-three series at a game apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about that series-opening duel in the desert five days
ago, when the Comets shot terribly, scored a season-low 51 points
and fell into an 0-1 hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure's back on both teams. Period,'' Phoenix coach
Cheryl Miller said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Comets point guard Kim Perrot said all that will matter tonight
at 7 at Compaq Center is ``who wants it the most, who executes the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's no longer pressure, in one sense,'' Perrot
said. ``Going into the first game, everybody said (we had)
home-court advantage, when you really don't. When you have to play
in front of 16,000 or 17,000 screaming fans in Phoenix, that's not
home-court advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pressured at that point. We were pressured to come
back Saturday night. We knew we had to win to bring it into another
game. So we were pressured then.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now, it's a whole new ballgame. It's 0-0, and it's whoever
is going to want it most. I don't think that the Comets are being
pressured. I just think that we have some kinks to straighten out
so that we can be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is an advantage entering the rubber game of the series,
an argument can be made that it rests with the Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   It took a 71-60 Phoenix victory over Cleveland in the third game
of their semifinal series _ played in front of a partisan Rockers
crowd at Gund Arena _ just for the Mercury to get to this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to it,'' Miller said. ``This team knows how to play
under pressure. Had to do it all season. So we're very
well-prepared for this game. We know what's at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Mercury didn't have the luxury of a record-breaking
season and 27-3 overall record upon which to hang its hat. Phoenix
came closer to setting a league record for consecutive losses than
to matching the Comets' WNBA-record 15-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   And despite seven wins in its last nine games, the Mercury saw
its entire season and playoff future come down to the final day. A
loss by New York at Detroit coupled with Phoenix's win over
Sacramento ensured the Mercury would be alive for the second
season.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been no cakewalk to the final dance for the Comets,
either. They wrapped up a playoff berth and clinched the league's
best record (and thus the home-court advantage) two weeks before
the season ended. Consequently, with nothing to play for, the
Comets slipped away from the team style that had carried them to
the top. Lacking intensity and motivation at New York on Aug. 15,
they suffered their worst loss of the season, 70-54 to the Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets regrouped to start the playoffs, with the offense and
defense working well in back-to-back semifinal wins over Charlotte.
But at Phoenix in Game 1 of the WNBA Championship Series, they
lapsed into a spotty performance that carried over to the first
half Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just experienced some pressure up until today,'' coach
Van Chancellor said Monday. ``We've been playing like the weight of
the world's been on our shoulders. We've just got to come out and
play basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-time WNBA Most Valuable Player Cynthia Cooper said it's
imperative for the Comets to jump on the Mercury early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of playing catch-up,'' she said. ``I want them to
play catch-up. I want them to have to worry about stopping us.
We've been playing catch-up since we've been in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for us to step up and play our game right from the
beginning. Every possession is very important, and we've got to
look at it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comets, said Chancellor, played some of the best defensive
basketball he has ever witnessed in throttling the Mercury over the
final 12{ minutes in Game 2. Janeth Arcain came off the bench to
spell Perrot, who is playing on two sprained ankles, and shut down
Michele Timms, a scoring machine for the Mercury until then.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper and Sheryl Swoopes combined for 20 of the Comets' final
22 points, and Swoopes became a terror on the backboards as she
recorded a finals-record 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said that what occurred over the final 12{ minutes
Saturday ``could be a momentum-shifter for this series.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout this series, Phoenix has had the momentum,'' she
said. ``They've gone back and forth, playing at their place at
first and then coming in here with the feeling that they had two
chances to win one game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had absolutely no pressure on them. Now, for the first
time, they have as much pressure as we have.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing for all the marbles,'' Cooper said. ``This is
the position we wanted to be in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in this position last year. And hopefully, the
comeback (Saturday) will bring us momentum going into this last
game.''

COMMENTARY: WEIGHING THE PRICE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With its special power and responsibility in the world, the
United States has to be free to act unilaterally in urgent
circumstances. We cannot wait for international approval before
responding to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan was right to attack Colonel Gadhafi's
headquarters after an apparent act of Libyan terrorism. And
President Clinton was right to strike at the Afghan operations of
Osama bin Laden, reported mastermind of the bombing of U.S.
Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   But in deciding whether to act alone, a president and his
advisers have to factor in the price of doing so. It is not likely
to be cost-free.
</P>
<P>
   The very menace of international terrorism lies in its elusive
nature. No single strike can stamp out a terrorist enterprise like
bin Laden's. Fighting it requires international cooperation over
the long term.
</P>
<P>
   It is essential, for example, to deny terrorists safe haven _
and the United States obviously cannot do that alone. We need the
agreement of others to keep terrorists out, and to shun any
countries that accept them. So when we consider acting alone, we
have to keep in mind the need for future diplomacy to that end.
</P>
<P>
   Cooperation is necessary for other reasons. The 1986 Reagan raid
on Libya required the agreement of the British government for U.S.
planes to take off from British bases. Planes or cruise missiles
striking at terrorist targets will almost certainly overfly other
countries, with the possibility of political repercussions there.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider the current imbroglio over Saddam Hussein's barring
of U.N. weapons inspectors. President Clinton has been severely
criticized for not responding forcefully. There is an
understandable sense of frustration at Saddam's brazen violation of
Security Council resolutions _ and of his own promises to comply.
</P>
<P>
   But the Security Council is plainly not willing to authorize
punitive measures against Iraq. If the United States acted alone
and struck at Iraqi targets, would that solve the problem? Would
Saddam stop his blocking of inspections?
</P>
<P>
   And what about the consequences elsewhere in the Arab world? The
Clinton administration's unwillingness to challenge Prime Minister
Netanyahu of Israel on his undermining of the Oslo peace accord has
already turned public opinion in even moderate Arab states more
anti-American.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush launched the Persian Gulf war only after working
over many months to secure the support of Arab countries, most
crucially Saudi Arabia. Now the Saudi government, fearful of
dissenting domestic forces, would surely distance itself from a
raid on Iraq over the inspection issue. Would we want to risk
upsetting the political balance there?
</P>
<P>
   None of that proves that we should not act, in Iraq or anywhere
else that poses an urgent security threat. It merely shows that a
decision to use force is not simple.
</P>
<P>
   We have to consider the opinions of others even when acting
alone. That point applies in a particular way to the other raid
ordered by Clinton last week, on what U.S. officials described as a
chemical weapons plant in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since the raid some of the American intelligence
statements have proved wrong. The plant was not in a guarded site.
If it made poisonous chemicals, it also made medicines for Sudan.
Osama bin Laden seems not to have financed it.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has resisted the call by the Sudan for
international inquiry. But why should we? A proper inquiry would
clear the air. And we should offer to pay compensation if we were
wrong. That course would preserve the credibility that the United
States must have for the cooperation of other countries in the
fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   There is a cult of toughness in this country nowadays: armchair
strategists who think the automatic answer to problems is military
strikes. Reality is more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   In my last column, I wrote that Kenneth Starr ``continues to
earn millions for himself in private practice.'' The sentence
should have been in the past tense. After four years as independent
counsel, Starr announced July 31 that he was taking a leave from
his private law firm.

AVERAGE RUSSIANS TAKE LITTLE NOTICE OF PLANS FOR CLINTON-YELTSIN
MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: RUSSIA-RDP, RUSSIA-ALBRIGHT, CLINTON-WORLD-IMAGE,

(js) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's top network news program, ``Vremya,'' led
Monday night with parliament's rejection of Viktor Chernomyrdin as
prime minister, the ruble's continued wobbliness and the
anniversary of Diana's death. Then it flagged plans by Muslim
extremists for several villages in rural Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   And oh, yes _ the president of the United States arrives Tuesday
morning for a summit meeting with the president of Russia, Boris
Yeltsin. That item was relegated to the second half of the
newscast.
</P>
<P>
   Such meetings used to be called summit meetings for a reason.
One can harken to Reykjavik, where Ronald Reagan and Mikhail
Gorbachev nearly disarmed, or Vienna, where Nikita Khrushchev took
John F. Kennedy to the woodshed, or even Washington, where Yeltsin
ascended to the world stage on the arm of George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   It would hardly be fair to call the latest meeting a nadir.
There still are important issues to chew on. But in Russia, at
least, it is close to a non-event.
</P>
<P>
   Four newspapers published Monday editions here (most newspapers
take the day off), including two serious journals, Sevodnya and
Komsomolskaya Pravda. None mentioned the next day's meeting _ not
merely on page 1, but anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no enthusiasm,'' said Sergei Karaganov, a foreign
policy specialist and sometime adviser to Russia's foreign
minister, Yevgeny Primakov. ``It's not an issue for the simple
reason that there are more important issues on the agenda. Most
people, even in the political class, do not even suspect or
remember that there is a meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the most spirited comment on the summit meeting came
Monday from Russia's wildest-eyed ultranationalist, Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, who said people with Russians' high moral standards
have no business meeting ``with a man who cannot settle his
relations with a secretary.'' ``According to the traditions of
Russian society, in this case, divorce the wife and marry the
secretary,'' Zhirinovsky said. ``Turn this disgraceful page over.''
</P>
<P>
   To an extent, Russians can be excused for their indifference. In
the judgment of most experts, the country is in its worst political
crisis since 1993, when Yeltsin's tanks shelled the parliament
building to put down a rebellion, and perhaps since the Soviet
Union dissolved in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The great national issues these days, discussed everywhere, are
the number of rubles a dollar will buy and the odds of a civil war
or putsch. Clinton's arrival seems trivial in comparison,
especially since he has little but moral support to lend Russia's
democrats after their calamitous seven-year experiment with
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's three-day visit will cover the usual weighty
summit-meeting bases, from international terrorism to nuclear
proliferation to disarmament. To average Russians _ indeed, to
Russia's parliament and much of its executive branch _ none of them
holds a candle right now to the 40 percent rise in the cost of
cooking oil at local markets or depositors' almost-complete
inability to tap savings accounts at the neighborhood bank.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Clinton, this visit is also a comedown. His advisers first
held out the meeting as a glittering prize for Russia should it
finally ratify the Start II nuclear weapons treaty. Unfortunately,
the get-togethers are not so prized anymore, and the
communist-controlled parliament was more than happy to let the
treaty languish if that would keep Clinton out of town. And so the
president's trip has been recast primarily as an economic pep talk
for Yeltsin and his troops, urging them to stay the agonizing
course to free-market prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to do is to go there and tell them that the easy
thing to do is not the right thing to do,'' Clinton said Monday in
Virginia, in an apparent reference to alternatives to capitalism.
``The easy thing to do would be to go back to the way they did it
before, and it's not possible.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a problem with this message, it is that Russians
have heard it several times from virtually every western leader,
and with the ruble's drop of close to 40 percent this month alone,
it may be starting to ring a bit false.
</P>
<P>
   The West may have had the best of intentions, Karaganov, the
policy specialist, said Monday, but its advice and Yeltsin's
Western-trained advisers ``have brought about the total collapse of
the economy and effectively bankrupted most of the Russian
bourgeoisie in the last few days.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the little summit news that is playing in Moscow this
week, on talk radio and even in some newspapers, is more often the
refrain sung Monday afternoon by Kazbek Tzikou, a communist
legislator from the depressed southern region of Kuban.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin stands over everyone like a cobra and forces them to
do what his friend Bill wants,'' Tzikou told the lower hose of
parliament, the Duma, on Monday. ``Tell Clinton not to come. People
would tear him to pieces if they could. Let him go to the moon with
his advice and his dollars.'' But he added, ``Tell the American
people that we wish peace and accord with them.''

 &HT;    CNN sues over use of trademark on Internet

<P>
   ATLANTA _ A New York Internet company is abusing Cable News
Network's trademark by using a Web address similar to CNN's to sell
pornography, CNN says in a federal lawsuit filed in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   CNN accuses The Net Inc., of Hewlitt, N.Y., of diluting its
trademark and tarnishing its name and seeks damages, attorney's
fees and a court order prohibiting The Net from continuing to use
its name.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN Interactive Web site is advertised as providing 24-hour,
up-to-the-minute news information and is viewed more than 30
million times a week by computer users. The Web site's ``domain
name'' is registered at the address of CNN.com. The Net's
pornographic site changes the ``.com'' portion of the address, but
maintains the ``CNN'' portion, the lawsuit says.
</P>
<P>
   The Net ``is a classic domain name pirate'' because it registers
names similar or identical to well-known trademarks, according to
the suit, which was filed Friday. The Net then ``holds the domain
names hostage until the trademark owners meet extortionist demands
for the transfer of the domain names,'' the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   The Net has registered sites with domain names similar to
acronyms for numerous federal agencies and private companies: NASA,
NASDAQ, MCI and WNBC, the lawsuit said. The New York Web company is
operating for-profit pornographic Web sites using acronyms such as
DOJ and USDA, the lawsuit said, adding that some of the Web sites
include online casino services.
</P>
<P>
   The Net registered a pornographic Web site with an address
similar to CNN's. After finding out about it, CNN tried to resolve
the matter with The Net. The Net offered to take down its CNN Web
site, but only if CNN paid $2,500 to the New York company, the
lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at The Net could not be reached for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great things about the Internet is that it
radically expands the number of people who can reach the world,''
Harvard law professor William W. Fisher III, a trademark
specialist, said. ``But it also means that opportunities to the
world at-large to make fun of, erode or tarnish trademarks are
increasing enormously.''

TALK GROWS OF FED INTEREST-RATE CUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: MARKET, MARKET-ASSESS, HONGKONG-MARKET MARKET-COMPARE,
MARKET-VOICES, MARKET-CYBERSPACE, MARKET-BROKERS) 
(JT)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As foreign and domestic investors fled to the safe
harbor of the U.S. Treasury market Monday, talk was growing of a
market-calming interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in Treasury buying came in the afternoon, as the stock
market lost its footing and the Dow Jones industrial plunged to its
second worst one-day point decline ever. The yield on the 30-year
bond dropped to 5.25 percent, the lowest for long-term rates in 30
years and a level that many or most of those who work on Wall
Street have not experienced in their working lifetimes. The yield
on the 10-year note fell to 4.96 percent, the first time it has
been below 5 percent since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   As the growing global economic crisis seems daily to impinge
more on the still healthy American economy, several analysts
predicted that the 12 percent decline in the Dow in the last week,
would help force the Federal Reserve to lower its benchmark
short-term interest rate soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't ignore the message of the market,'' said John
Lipsky, the chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, referring to
the fact that long-term interest rates are now well below the Fed's
5.5 percent target for short-term interest rates. ``And the message
of the market is that the risks are heavily weighted on the side of
a slowdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig &AMP; Co., said the stock
market fall also should prompt action by the Fed. ``This now
constitutes a breathtaking decline that central banks are supposed
to pay attention to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The recent rapid decline in interest rates should provide some
offset to the drag from Asia, as lower rates spur the housing
industry. The plunge in the 10-year note, which is a benchmark for
mortgage rates, should mean that already low mortgage rates drop
further.
</P>
<P>
   But Lipsky argued that the economy has too much drag. At the
present time, he said, the Fed's 5.5 percent target for the Federal
Funds rate _ the rate on overnight loans between banks _ is higher
after adjustment for inflation than at the end of 1994. That was
when the Mexican peso was devalued, setting off a market selloff
that was serious but paled by comparison to the plunge in both
developed and emerging markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the 19-percent plunge in the Dow since July 17
is sure to make consumers more cautious, cutting into the strong
consumer spending that has kept the economy _ even though it slowed
in the second quarter _ stronger than many forecasters had
expected.
</P>
<P>
   This slowdown by the consumer, plus the already painful drop in
American exports because of the evaporation of buying from Asia,
should slow the economy to no growth in the second half of the
year, he said, a reason for the Fed to ease.
</P>
<P>
   Barbera argued that the Fed has to lower its interest rate to
ease the pressure on the troubled emerging markets, most of which
have large debts denominated in dollars that have to be rolled over
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve policy makers are next scheduled to meet on Sept
29. At their Aug. 18 meeting they decided, as expected, to leave
their short-term interest rate target unchanged. In the minutes of
the July meeting Fed officials showed no inclination to cutting
interest rates, in part because the economy was still strong and
there were signs of inflationary wage pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Fed policy makers can act, however, at any time between
meetings. As the Asian economic crisis has spread to engulf Russia
and to threaten Latin America all talk of a Fed rate increase has
disappeared. But there is still a debate among economists over if
and when the Fed would decide to lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that Fed officials could ease some concerns with
just a hint, in a speech or comment, that the Fed is watching and
ready to take action if necessary. The Fed did announce Monday that
its chairman, Alan Greenspan, was monitoring the markets while on
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the Fed is unlikely to act immediately
because that might be interpreted as a sign of panic. But the Fed
has taken such an action in the past with the interest rate cut
after the stock market crash in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   With Monday's decline in Treasury interest rates, the 30-year
bond yield of 5.25 percent, the 10-year note yield of 4.96 percent,
the five-year note yield of 4.78 percent and the two-year note
yield of 4.76 percent are all below the 5.5 percent Fed target for
the Fed funds rate.
</P>
<P>
   This is known as an inverted yield curve and has, in the past,
signaled a slowdown for the economy or even a recession. That has
been because the Fed funds rate moved higher than longer-term rates
as the Fed raised its target to slow economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the inversion has been produced by a drop in
longer-term rates as the Fed left its target rate unchanged. But
while this appears to be less negative, it seems to be signaling a
slowdown anyway.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the high level of short-term interest rates,
after adjustment for inflation, is a drag on the economy. Another
is that the flight to a safe harbor is a signal of weakening
economic prospects abroad, which, in turn, are bad for the American
outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that both the flight to a safe harbor and the
realization that the U.S. economy is slowing should push interest
rates even lower. But if some calm returns to both foreign and
American markets, there could be a selloff that could force
interest rates higher temporarily.

   MARKET-BROKERS (New York) _ Wall Street is starting to count the
cost of the recent turmoil in financial markets. Salomon Smith
Barney, one of the country's biggest investment banks, said on
Monday that in the last two months alone, it lost an estimated $360
million after taxes, in its arbitrage and Russian-related credits
businesses. After allowing for profits from its private client and
funds management business, Salomon said that it expected its
overall after-tax loss for the last two months to be about $150
million. Such losses may spell the end of a long run of bountiful
profits for Wall Street, a time when stocks, financial markets and
the fortunes of financiers have risen inexorably. By Peter Truell.

 By EDWARD WYATT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Waves of selling by investors large and small
engulfed the stock market Monday.
</P>
<P>
   They erased all the market's gains this year and sent stock
prices down more than 19 percent from their peak just six weeks
ago, the sharpest decline in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzied selling offered little solace to investors who had
hoped that the stock market's recent slump, which began with
worries over unsettled economic conditions in Asia and accelerated
as financial troubles in Russia came to light, might be stayed by
the fundamental strength of the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 512.61 points, or 6.4
percent, to 7539.07, leaving the bellwether index 4.7 percent below
where it started the year. The decline was the index's
second-largest in point terms, behind the 554-point drop on Oct.
27, but did not rank in the top 20 when measured in percent. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, a broader measure of the market's
overall health, fell more than 69 points, or nearly 7 percent, to
958.53, down 1.3 percent since the beginning of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While there were few signs of panic among individual investors
Monday, market participants said that heavy selling by mutual fund
companies, responding to withdrawals by individual investors from
equity mutual funds over the weekend and Monday, played a
significant role in Monday's decline, including the selling frenzy
that sent the Dow average falling by 250 points in the last half
hour of trading.
</P>
<P>
   The selloff in stocks also prompted a big rally in the bond
market, where investors from around the world have sought shelter
in securities that are backed by the American government. The price
of 30-year Treasury bonds rose 1 8/32, to 103 22/32, while their
yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to a record low
of 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and financial analysts said Monday's stock-market
decline is almost certain to bring intense pressure to bear on the
Federal Reserve to lower short-term interest rates. For more than a
week, some short-term interest rates have been higher than
long-term rates, a situation that is a classic precursor to a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   But Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Monday that the economy
remains sound, although he acknowledged that ``the world is
currently working its way through a difficult period.'' Rubin and
Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, who is on vacation but who
was in touch with Rubin Monday, are scheduled to meet on Friday
with Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa in California.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause of the financial difficulties that have
plagued Asia and Russia over the past year, economists say, the
stock market's recent activity indicates that those troubles have
begun to wash up on America's shores.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in a long time where the future of the
American economy hinges so much on what happens to American stock
prices,'' said Henry Kaufman, a New York economist. ``We are having
a global financial problem, and it is a problem that cannot go away
quickly. If there are further declines in the equity market, there
should be an orchestrated reduction in interest rates by the major
industrial countries,'' including the United States, Germany,
England, France, Italy and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the current problem facing the economy and the
financial markets seems to have permeated the consciousness of
individual investors, who have been the stalwart supporters of the
bull market in stocks for the last several years. Mutual fund
companies, including Fidelity Investments, the country's largest
fund company, said they continued to see withdrawals from stock
funds over the weekend and Monday, with most of those investors
moving cash out of stock funds and into money-market or bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   Bearing the brunt of Monday's selloff were many of the
technology stocks that have been the most popular with individual
investors and the mutual funds in which they invest. The Nasdaq
composite index, the major market index most heavily populated with
technology issues, fell 140 points, or 8.6 percent, to 1499.25 _
its worst single-day decline when measured in points and the
fourth-worth in terms of percent. The Nasdaq index is now 4.5
percent below the level where it started the year.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange measured 914.7 million
shares, the third-heaviest ever on the Bog Board, and the number of
stocks that declined exceed those that advanced by a ratio of more
than seven to one. Exceptionally heavy volume on the Chicago Board
Options Exchange caused a systems problem near the end of trading.
But despite that glitch, Rubin said that the financial market's
mechanisms worked ``effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow industrial average has declined nearly 1,799 points, or
19.2 percent, from its highest-ever closing price of 9337.97 on
July 17. That is slightly less, in percentage terms, than the 21.2
percent loss in the index's value in the bear market of 1990, which
lasted from mid-June through early October.
</P>
<P>
   To some traders and stock-market analysts, Monday's decline took
on some of the characteristics of a selling frenzy, the type of
relentless liquidation of investors' portfolios that comes only at
the point of maximum pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only good thing I see is that they are finally going after
the sacred cows, the drugs and the retail stocks and the technology
sector,'' said Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell
&AMP; Reed, an Overland Park, Kan. mutual fund company. Until Monday,
those stocks had provided investors with a sort of refuge from the
storm of the market's recent decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they are pounding the stocks that wouldn't go down, that
tells me that the sentiment is really negative,'' Herrmann said.
``And when the sentiment gets that negative, you can get a reversal
pretty quick.''

TECHNOLOGY STOCKS TAKE A POUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Technology stocks, the engine behind the stock market's
incredible run-up during the 1990s, collapsed Monday amid a huge
selloff by skittish investors worried about the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index fell more than all
other major stock indexes, tumbling a record 140.43 points or 8.6
percent, to 1499.25. By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average _ an index of 30 large industrial companies _ tumbled
512.61 points Monday, or 6.37 percent, to 7539.07.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-growing technology companies have always been ripe for
speculation among investors, making them more volatile than most
shares. But even the ``safe'' technology stocks _ companies that
are leaders in their market segments _ were hammered Monday,
analysts noted. That shows how concerned investors have become that
worldwide economic woes, particularly in Asia, will lead to a
possible slowdown in sales of computers and related equipment and
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fairly indiscriminate. Everybody got hit,'' said Ullas
Naik, a Boston-based Internet and electronic commerce analyst for
First Albany Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Dell Computer Corp., the super-efficient direct seller
of personal computers, plunged 18 3/4 to 100, wiping out $13
billion of the company's market value. It was the most active stock
in U.S. markets, with 48.6 million shares trading hands.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems Inc., the No. 1 computer-networking company, fell
12 13/16 to 81 7/8, erasing $14 billion of market value. Intel
Corp., the No. 1 computer-chip maker, tumbled 5 13/16 to 71 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp., the world's largest software company, fell 9
5/16 to 95 15/16, its lowest level since June. International
Business Machines Corp., the No. 1 computer company, tumbled 9
15/16 to 112 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   EMC Corp., the leading provider of computer storage equipment
and software, tumbled 13.6 percent. Its shares plunged 7 to 44 1/2
Monday. Since peaking at 59 7/16 on Aug. 19, EMC shares have
skidded 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as these are vulnerable in a slumping stock
market because their shares had &UR;  &LR;  become so expensive in recent
months. In many cases, their price-to-earnings ratios had been
driven to unrealistic highs and now investors are worried about
paying too much.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened earlier this summer when Internet stocks
went through the roof, and then came tumbling down after investors
realized the prices were too high.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Internet stocks tumbled even further.
</P>
<P>
   Internet search company Lycos Inc. of Framingham, Mass. was
among the hardest hit Massachusetts companies. Its shares plunged
38 percent, or 8 3/16, to 21 11/16. In July, it was trading at
nearly $50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   CMG Information Services Inc. of Andover, Mass., which owns a
chunk of Lycos and a range of other Internet-related companies, was
also hammered. Its stock fell 24 percent, or 11 7/8, to close at 38
1/8. Less than a month ago, it was trading at more than 87.
</P>
<P>
   Other big losers locally were: Polaroid Corp. and Avid
Technology Inc., both of which fell about 18 percent; GeoTel
Communications Inc., which plunged 15 percent, and Keane Inc.,
which fell more than 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But technology analysts such as William Becklean &UR;  &LR; , managing
director of Tucker Anthony Inc. in Boston, said the big selloff in
technology stocks doesn't reflect individual concerns about those
companies. Rather, it's a result of investors seeking to get out of
the stock market quickly and shift their money to safer havens.
</P>
<P>
   But Naik, of First Albany, said many investors are doing their
homework to identify the best-positioned companies, so that when
the market finally hits bottom, they'll be in a position to buy
again.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that make computers and the equipment to link them
were buoyed in the past four months as the rest of the market fell.
Until today, the Nasdaq 100 Index of the largest non-financial
companies was up 28 percent for the year. Now, it's up 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the selling may be coming from mutual fund managers who
need to sell stocks to pay investors who are redeeming fund shares,
or hedge fund managers who face big losses in other investments.
Many managers already have cut their holdings in other industries,
and may now be turning to computer-related stocks, because many
have relatively large holdings in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The largest technology stocks are also easy to trade, enabling
investors to dump them quickly if they want cash.

RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT DEBATE HIGHLIGHTS LACK OF TRUST ON ALL SIDES

<P>
   MOSCOW _ For a country that hasn't had a government for a week _
a week in which its currency plummeted and its banking system
veered towards collapse, there was a striking lack of urgency to
the debate Monday in the Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the vote against confirmation of Viktor Chernomyrdin as
prime minister was a foregone conclusion, after the Communist
opposition pulled back from a power-sharing agreement on Sunday
that would have salvaged his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   But as political leaders took their turns at the podium, the
debate veered away from the country's future to a fusillade of
political attacks and counter-attacks about its recent past,
zooming off at one point to a recommendation for President Clinton
_ due here on Tuesday _ to put his personal scandal behind him by
divorcing his wife, and marrying his ``secretary.''
</P>
<P>
   As political theater, the stormy language, the grand-standing
and the finger-pointing was impressive, but it did nothing to break
Russia's political deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a theme running through the debate, both in the
hall and in the corridors outside, it was the complete collapse of
trust between Russia's warring political forces. Communists Monday
attacked the proposed power-sharing agreement as worth no more than
the paper it was written on, while politicians of all stripes
derided Chernomyrdin _ who served five years as prime minister
until his ouster last March _ as a man who doesn't deserve a second
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any kid in Russia can tell you the main problem of the Russian
government,'' said Grigory Yavlinsky, whose party, Yabloko, has
always been critical of Chernomyrdin's rule. ``It's that there are
thieves in it. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   In this all-too-familiar confrontation between President Boris
Yeltsin and the parliamentary opposition, both sides are
forecasting an apocalyptic conclusion, with street riots that lead
to the worst Russian nightmare of all, civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Given Russia's bloody history and the truly precarious state of
its economy, such dire predictions would be frightening _ if it
weren't for the fact that they have been usurped by politicians,
and inserted in a strangely hollow political debate.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what would happen if Yeltsin insisted on Chernomyrdin's
nomination through a third, and final, ballot, then dissolved the
lower house of parliament, Konstantin Savelyev, a Communist deputy
from the region outside Moscow, calmly went down a list of possible
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be a state of emergency, a dictatorship, and
lawlessness,'' he said. `There could be a civil war and then
everyone would be wiped out, Reds, Whites, Greens _ everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The same thoughts were echoed Monday by Yeltsin's parliamentary
envoy, and on Sunday night on television by Boris Berezovsky, the
multibillionaire and political intriguer, who played a key role in
bringing Chernomyrdin back to government.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his office in the cultural affairs committee of the
lower house, or Duma, Nikoali Gubenko, a Communist deputy known
best to Russian audiences as an actor and theater director, was no
more sanguine about the outcome of the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a third vote on Mr. Chernomyrdin, he will be
rejected, the Duma will be dissolved, and we will have a
dictatorship by a sick man,'' said Gubenko. He predicted that
opposition leaders will come forward this week with other names to
head a new government, but Yeltsin is certain to reject them. ``I
don't think it will work out,'' he said. ``He will insist on
Chernomyrdin, again and again.''
</P>
<P>
   Gubenko also rejected reports that the Communists were now ready
for serious horse-trading over jobs in a Chernomyrdin Cabinet. ``As
long as Yeltsin is in power, the Communists won't be in government
unless it is headed by someone from the center-left opposition,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other deputies were not sure that the Communists, in playing out
their hand, are not upping their bid for strong representation in a
Chernomyrdin government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the bargaining begins,'' said a deputy for Chernomyrdin's
own party, Our Home is Russia, as he rushed into the chamber to
cast his vote.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Ilyukhin, deputy leader of the Communists' parliamentary
group, said the Communists have sought 10 posts in a Chernomyrdin
cabinet, including the interior ministry. The other posts should
also be significant, he said, noting that anything less would be
``senseless.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Grachev, a deputy from Yavlinsky's party, said Chernomyrdin
still may have a chance to put together a coalition cabinet, made
up of opposition figures and leaders from Russia's increasingly
powerful regions, that would satisfy parliament. But, he said, even
such a team will be incapable of governing the country, and putting
the economy back on its feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no hope that a Chernomyrdin government will be
effective,'' he said. ``He has shown us over five years that he can
move only through inertia. Power in Russia is not stable, the
position of Yeltsin is not stable, the Duma is not popular, and the
worsening of living standards makes the situation worse. The
possibility of a nonconstitutional outcome is likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin began the debate Monday with an attempt to focus
parliament's attention on the crisis at hand. ``Time is running
out,'' he said. But by the end of the day, he too was ready to join
in the fray, attacking his critics in disparaging terms, and
putting most of the blame on ex-Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko's
four-month government, and the radical anti-crisis program it put
into place on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot throw stones at anybody,'' he said, ``but what
happened on the 17th, should not have been done, and Chernomyrdin
would have never done it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to Communist Party leaders, attempts over the weekend
to patch together a political compromise were torpedoed by the
refusal of the president's negotiators to even consider some of the
leftist opposition demands _ which included a quick deadline for
legal amendments to the Russian Constitution, and mandatory
parliamentary approval for appointments to the defense, foreign
affairs and internal affairs ministries.
</P>
<P>
   Gubenko said that on Sunday morning, the Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov understood that these positions had been rejected.
When the party's leadership met later that day, it unanimously
rejected the agreement, he said. ``They refused to sign such an
emasculated agreement, once it was clear the president's side was
doing it just to get Chernomyrdin through.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you sign an agreement when you don't see the makeup of
the government?'' asked Ilyukhin. ``Who are you signing with? The
fact is we don't trust Chernomyrdin, and the people don't trust
him.''

WALL STREET FACES END OF LONG RUN OF BIG PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: MARKET, MARKET-ASSESS, CREDIT, HONGKONG-MARKET,
MARKET-COMPARE, MARKET-VOICES, MARKET-CYBERSPACE) 
(lb) 
 By PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wall Street is starting to count the cost of the
recent turmoil in financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney, one of the United States' biggest
investment banks, said Monday that in the last two months alone it
lost an estimated $360 million after taxes, in its arbitrage and
Russian-related credits businesses. After allowing for profits from
its private client and funds management business, Salomon said that
it expected its overall after-tax loss for the last two months to
be about $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   Such losses may spell the end of a long run of bountiful profits
for Wall Street _ a time when stocks, financial markets and the
fortunes of financiers have risen inexorably. Another Wall Street
firm, Credit Suisse First Boston said last week that its first-half
profits would be down $250 million because of losses on its Russian
and Russian-related businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street is having to adjust to the possibility of a sea
change in the financial markets. The recent gloom over the markets
has already spread to such areas as giving advice on big mergers
and acquisitions, and initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   And there already is speculation _ denied by the principals on
Monday _ that such high-profile planned transactions as Citibank's
$70 billion merger with Travelers Group Inc. _ the parent company
of Salomon Smith Barney _ may be postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Arda Nazarian, a spokeswoman for Salomon, the investment-bank
subsidiary of Travelers Group Inc., said the merger, which would
create a company called Citigroup, was on track.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Howe, a Citicorp spokesman, said: ``We remain confident
that the Fed will grant to Citigroup bank holding-company status in
the third quarter. But only the Fed knows the exact timing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many on Wall Street expect Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. to postpone its
planned multibillion dollar sale of a slice of its shares. A
spokesman for the firm said Monday that it would not comment on
such rumors, and that Goldman's plans remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the financial markets continue to deteriorate, there
may be profounder changes on Wall Street. Firms could start to
consider cutting back on expenses, and particularly on jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street typically takes such measures when it falls on
leaner times, as it did after the October 1987 stock-market crash,
during the bear market of 1990 and after the bond-market rout of
1994.
</P>
<P>
   If there are similar rounds of sweeping job cuts, that in turn
would have a significant effect on the economy of New York City,
which has come to rely heavily on its brokerage firms, banks and
insurance companies for tax revenues and well-paid jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement about its recent losses in arbitrage and
Russian-related credits, Salomon said Monday that they resulted
from the recent ``extreme volatility in the global fixed-income and
equity capital markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The brokerage firm estimated that for July and August it would
have $60 million of Russian-related credit losses, $120 million of
losses on its U.S. bond arbitrage portfolio and $180 million of
losses on its international arbitrage business.
</P>
<P>
   Profits from more successful areas, such as the firm's
private-client and fund-management businesses, have so far helped
to offset losses from arbitrage and Russia-related credits. Such
profits would have to total as much as $210 million in the last two
months to cut the overall loss in the period to $150 million.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the moment, several of Salomon's big competitors are keeping
mum. ``As a matter of policy we do not comment intra-quarter on
results,'' said Tim Gillis, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. Jon
Diat, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said his firm
would have no comment on its results for July and August, or on
what effect recent falling financial markets may have had on its
performance.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday afternoon, Jamie Dimon and Deryck
Maughan, the co-chairmen of Salomon Smith Barney, were guarded
about measures they may take to try to improve profitability, and
would not say whether their firm plans to cut back its staff,
always one of the biggest expenses on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is: You don't cut people because of losses,'' said
Dimon. ``We have been probably reducing risk around the company for
a while. You pray for the best and you plan for the worst. You have
to know your risks and exposures.''
</P>
<P>
   Dimon was also quick to stress that ``the rest of Travelers is
doing great,'' and that Salomon's business with Main Street
Americans has ``not seen a dramatic decrease in retail volume.''
</P>
<P>
   But both Maughan and Dimon sounded cautious. ``You'd be foolish
not to worry,'' said Dimon. ``Beware the ides of August,'' said
Maughan, adding that in recent years August had stopped following
the financial folklore that it was a quiet month for the markets.
Dimon should know; he cut short his family vacation in the eastern
Mediterranean to return home to discuss the recent losses.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Waves of selling by investors large and small
engulfed the stock market Monday.
</P>
<P>
   They erased all the market's gains this year and sent stock
prices down more than 19 percent from their peak just six weeks
ago, the sharpest decline in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzied selling offered little solace to investors who had
hoped that the stock market's recent slump, which began with
worries over unsettled economic conditions in Asia and accelerated
as financial troubles in Russia came to light, might be stayed by
the fundamental strength of the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 512.61 points, or 6.4
percent, to 7539.07, leaving the bellwether index 4.7 percent below
where it started the year. The decline was the index's
second-largest in point terms, behind the 554-point drop on Oct.
27, but did not rank in the top 20 when measured in percent. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, a broader measure of the market's
overall health, fell more than 69 points, or nearly 7 percent, to
958.53, down 1.3 percent since the beginning of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While there were few signs of panic among individual investors
Monday, market participants said that heavy selling by mutual fund
companies, responding to withdrawals by individual investors from
equity mutual funds over the weekend and Monday, played a
significant role in Monday's decline, including the selling frenzy
that sent the Dow average falling by 250 points in the last half
hour of trading.
</P>
<P>
   The selloff in stocks also prompted a big rally in the bond
market, where investors from around the world have sought shelter
in securities that are backed by the American government. The price
of 30-year Treasury bonds rose 1 8/32, to 103 22/32, while their
yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to a record low
of 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and financial analysts said Monday's stock-market
decline is almost certain to bring intense pressure to bear on the
Federal Reserve to lower short-term interest rates. For more than a
week, some short-term interest rates have been higher than
long-term rates, a situation that is a classic precursor to a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   But Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Monday that the economy
remains sound, although he acknowledged that ``the world is
currently working its way through a difficult period.'' Rubin and
Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, who is on vacation but who
was in touch with Rubin Monday, are scheduled to meet on Friday
with Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa in California.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause of the financial difficulties that have
plagued Asia and Russia over the past year, economists say, the
stock market's recent activity indicates that those troubles have
begun to wash up on America's shores.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in a long time where the future of the
American economy hinges so much on what happens to American stock
prices,'' said Henry Kaufman, a New York economist. ``We are having
a global financial problem, and it is a problem that cannot go away
quickly. If there are further declines in the equity market, there
should be an orchestrated reduction in interest rates by the major
industrial countries,'' including the United States, Germany,
England, France, Italy and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the current problem facing the economy and the
financial markets seems to have permeated the consciousness of
individual investors, who have been the stalwart supporters of the
bull market in stocks for the last several years. Mutual fund
companies, including Fidelity Investments, the country's largest
fund company, said they continued to see withdrawals from stock
funds over the weekend and Monday, with most of those investors
moving cash out of stock funds and into money-market or bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   Bearing the brunt of Monday's selloff were many of the
technology stocks that have been the most popular with individual
investors and the mutual funds in which they invest. The Nasdaq
composite index, the major market index most heavily populated with
technology issues, fell 140 points, or 8.6 percent, to 1499.25 _
its worst single-day decline when measured in points and the
fourth-worth in terms of percent. The Nasdaq index is now 4.5
percent below the level where it started the year.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange measured 914.7 million
shares, the third-heaviest ever on the Bog Board, and the number of
stocks that declined exceed those that advanced by a ratio of more
than seven to one. Exceptionally heavy volume on the Chicago Board
Options Exchange caused a systems problem near the end of trading.
But despite that glitch, Rubin said that the financial market's
mechanisms worked ``effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow industrial average has declined nearly 1,799 points, or
19.2 percent, from its highest-ever closing price of 9337.97 on
July 17. That is slightly less, in percentage terms, than the 21.2
percent loss in the index's value in the bear market of 1990, which
lasted from mid-June through early October.
</P>
<P>
   To some traders and stock-market analysts, Monday's decline took
on some of the characteristics of a selling frenzy, the type of
relentless liquidation of investors' portfolios that comes only at
the point of maximum pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only good thing I see is that they are finally going after
the sacred cows, the drugs and the retail stocks and the technology
sector,'' said Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell
&AMP; Reed, an Overland Park, Kan. mutual fund company. Until Monday,
those stocks had provided investors with a sort of refuge from the
storm of the market's recent decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they are pounding the stocks that wouldn't go down, that
tells me that the sentiment is really negative,'' Herrmann said.
``And when the sentiment gets that negative, you can get a reversal
pretty quick.''

TROUBLES FROM ABROAD RATTLE LATIN AMERICAN MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The demons of financial crisis are haunting Latin
America again, unleashed by tumult in Russia, Japan and now the
United States. Markets and currencies across the continent are
sinking as panicky investors retreat to the safe haven of U.S.
treasury bonds and dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the major Latin economies are far better fortified to
withstand the external battering than they were four years ago,
when a disastrous devaluation in Mexico engulfed several Latin
American economies into what economists, investors and politicians
called the tequila effect. Since then Mexico and Brazil have taken
sober measures to build foreign reserves and control inflation
while Argentina and Chile persevered in tough programs already in
place.
</P>
<P>
   Among the big players, only Venezuela failed to buckle down to
austerity and now is paying the price in a full-blown emergency,
with reserves dropping, short-term bank interest rates soaring to
120 percent and the stock market off 37 percent this month.
</P>
<P>
   Since most of the underlying economies are solid, the market
turmoil might have a milder effect in Latin America than alarming
appearances at the moment augur, economists and analysts said. But
they cautioned that if markets outside the region continue to dive
for long, or if investors flee the emerging markets en masse
without regard to the strengths of individual countries, the
outcome could be devastating.
</P>
<P>
   And if the U.S. market slide results in a sluggish U.S. economy,
the damage will be even greater in Latin America, which sends most
of its exports to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove the point, on a day when the Dow Jones Industrial
Average plummeted 512.61 points, or 6.37 percent, the Mexican stock
market was down 5.14 percent. Mexico canceled a regular Monday
auction of government treasury bills, known as CETEs, saying that
``the offers received were not consistent with the macroeconomic
situation of the country.'' It was the first time the auction was
canceled since the grim days in the wake of the 1994 devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   The leading index of Brazilian stocks was off by 4.06 percent.
Even the stock market in stolid Chile was off 3.01 per cent.
Venezuela, surprisingly, was not hit, with its stock market in a
modest rally of .18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latin America is the good neighbor in a bad neighborhood,''
said Riordan Roett, director of the Western Hemisphere program at
Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C. The region's countries
``should not be affected, but they will be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Hernandez, a top economist at the Instituto
Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico, said, ``Nobody has any really
perfect defenses. This is the challenge of the smaller economies in
a globalized world.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the region's problems were largely self-inflicted, and
the United States, then growing robustly, and the International
Monetary Fund were ready to step in with loans to help. Now Latin
America is paying for mistakes made in Moscow and Tokyo, which
rattled the markets and also sent prices for many key Latin
commodities, like wheat and oil, to their lowest real rates in
decades. And neither the United States nor the cash-strapped IMF
can do much to rescue any country here.

 MEXICO CITY: any country here.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mexico has done the most to clean up since 1994. Although the
peso has slipped (it recovered slightly Monday to 10.02 cents, up
.4 percent), most analysts believe it is fairly valued. Oil
revenues make up 37 percent of the government's income, and
President Ernesto Zedillo responded quickly to the drop in
petroleum prices by slashing the federal budget three times,
maintaining a modest deficit of about 1.25 per cent of the gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Growth, which boomed in the first half of the year, is expected
to slow through next year but remain healthy. The government is
still promising growth of more than 5 per cent this year, but
economists have revised their estimates down to 4 percent to a low
of 2.3 percent, by Bursametrica Management in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates climbed Monday to 38 percent for the overnight
Cete. But after the drubbing that Mexican banks and indebted
citizens took in 1994, far fewer loans are out there now. Foreign
reserves have remained at record highs, with the influx of
long-term investment in factories and infrastructure, which now
accounts for about 70 percent of all foreign investment, helping to
keep them there.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's big weak spot is its ailing banking system. The
national Congress, which will open a new session next week, remains
angrily divided about how to pay for an expensive bank bailout. On
Sunday, 3 million Mexicans turned out to vote against the
government's proposal in a symbolic referendum organized by an
opposition party, the Party of the Democratic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very far from classifying as a crisis,'' said Jonathan
Heath, an economist with LatinSource Mexico. ``There is a lot of
noise, a psychological crisis. But while the financial markets are
reflecting what is happening in the rest of the world, the real
economy continues to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, political factors are central. At the outset of the
Asian financial crisis last October, Brazil President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso marshaled through a package of reforms that
doubled interest rates and imposed steep tax increases and spending
cuts. But the fiscal deficit remains at nearly 7 percent of the
economy. The Brazilian currency, called the real, is traded within
a fixed band and is said by analysts to be overvalued by at least
10 percent. The Central Bank said that $7.7 billion left the
country in the four weeks before Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   But Cardoso appears to determined to forestall any devaluation
and even cut interest rates, at least until after the Oct. 4
elections. Polls show that he is likely to win a second four-year
term easily in the first round. Brazil has huge foreign reserves of
about $72 billion, and several valuable government properties to
sell in a crunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to face this crisis, as always, calmly without
any new package, without any scares,'' Cardoso told reporters in a
brief appearance Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela faces the most severe problems, analysts say,
primarily because neither of the two most prominent candidates in
presidential elections in December hold much promise of bringing
tough solutions to a wayward economy. The front-runner, Hugo
Chavez, 44, is running on a populist platform of broadside
repudiation of the country's political elite for years of economic
instability.
</P>
<P>
   Another contender is a former Miss Universe, Irene Saez, who is
36 and has no experience in economics.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela has done little to reduce its dependence on petroleum,
which accounts for three-quarters of all exports.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, economists are worried that investors'
confidence will be so shattered by a new round of losses in the
emerging markets that Latin countries will have trouble returning
to the international markets for help to pay their debts next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a long time before investors can differentiate and
say that Brazil is different from Russia. We could be in for a
period when nobody is willing to touch the emerging markets,'' said
Sylvia Maxfield, an emerging markets strategist at Lehman Brothers.

ABL STAR STALEY JUMPS TO WNBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dawn Staley, one of the core group of players who helped
organize the American Basketball League, says she is jumping to the
rival WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very difficult decision, considering I was a founding
member of the ABL,'' said Staley, the scrappy 5-foot-6-inch guard
who got to play in her hometown last season when the Richmond Rage
moved to Philadelphia. ``At the same time, I had to look at women's
basketball as a business, like everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   According to WNBA president Val Ackerman, Staley's contract is
for three years, but no decision has been reached on which team she
will join.
</P>
<P>
   Staley was a member of the 1996 gold-medal US Olympic team, and
her desire to play on the 2000 team apparently was a factor in her
decision; she feels the WNBA's shorter season _ 30 games to the
ABL's 44 _ will be easier on her troublesome knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it basically came down to is longevity,'' said the
28-year-old graduate of the University of Virginia. ``I want to
play basketball as long as I can. It didn't come down to any
financial reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Staley, an All-Star in both of her ABL seasons, denied that her
decision reflected a lack of confidence in the survival of the ABL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the ABL will be around for as long as there will be
players,'' she said Monday. ``I think they're doing a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   With Venus Lacy's recent decision to re-sign with the ABL, the
lone ABL marquee player yet to state her intentions is New England
Blizzard guard Jennifer Rizzotti. A decision by the former
University of Connecticut star is expected as early as today.

 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's parliament emphatically rejected President
Boris Yeltsin's choice for prime minister on Monday, leaving the
nation virtually rudderless in the midst of its deepening economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Chernomyrdin implored lawmakers to approve his
appointment as prime minister on Monday, saying that he urgently
needed to start forming a new government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia today is, in essence, on the verge of economic and
political breakdown,'' Chernomyrdin declared. ``Russia should not
be without a government.''
</P>
<P>
   But the appeal drew jeers from the Communists-led opposition,
which turned back his nomination by a vote of 253 to 94.
Chernomyrdin needed 226 votes in the 450-seat parliament to be
approved.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists' strategy seemed to be discredit the Yeltsin
government in the hope that the embattled president would finally
be driven to resign or at least agree to a more generous
power-sharing arrangement. The lopsided rejection also seemed aimed
at torpedoing Chernomyrdin's claim that only he could unify the
splintered nation and serve as Yeltsin's heir.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, however, demonstrated on Monday night that he was also
ready to engage in political brinksmanship by renominating
Chernomyrdin as prime minister..
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Yeltsin's advisers warned that the parliament would
be dissolved if it refused to yield, setting the stage for a new
round of horse-trading over government posts and policies in the
days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Boris Yeltsin wants Viktor Chernomyrdin to become
the prime minister, and I do not recall a case such as this where
he has changed his mind,'' said Boris Berezovksy, the tycoon who
has sought to orchestrate Chernomyrdin's return to power.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the eve of the summit meeting between Yeltsin and
President Clinton, the angry standoff left the United States
wondering if Clinton would be meeting with a determined, if
embattled Russian leadership or a government that was about to
implode.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's acrimony marked an abrupt end to days of lofty talk of
compromise and coalition government designed to secure a bloodless
confirmation of Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got all the consent,'' Chernomyrdin complained to reporters
after Monday's debate. ``And all of sudden everything is
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Communist lawmakers said on Monday that the negotiations broke
down over a deadline for enacting amendments to the constitution
that would shift some power from the executive branch to the
legislature, among other power-sharing arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Shokhin, the leader of Chernomyrdin's parliamentary
faction, suggested that the acting prime minister might still be
able to mollify the Communist opposition and salvage his
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Shokhin suggested that Chernomyrdin might identify his cabinet
choices and spell out his economic policy before the next vote on
his nomination. The idea would be to reassure wary lawmakers that
the new prime minister would honor his promises to left-wing
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Market reformers warned that there was a danger that
Chernomyrdin might now go too far in trying to placate the
Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Anatoly Chubais, who was fired from his post as the Yeltsin
government's negotiator with the International Monetary Fund,
warned that the Kremlin would be making a grave mistake if it gave
away the Finance and Economics ministries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know a single economist from the left side of the
spectrum who is capable of proposing anything reasonable to resolve
the crisis,'' Chubais said.
</P>
<P>
   As Russia's leading politicians traded insults during Monday's
debate, it was sometimes hard to recall that the nation was
grasping for ways to stem the decline of its currency, fight
inflation and save its banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Zhirninovky, the strident nationalist, mocked Clinton
for his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Sergei Dubinin, the head
of the Central Bank, defended a loan he received to build a country
home.
</P>
<P>
   Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist leader, complained that
Chernomyrdin's approval rating stood at a meager 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin derided his predecessor, the 36-year-old Sergei
Kiriyenko for leading a ``kid's government'' and blamed him for the
nation's economic ills, even though most economists say Kiriyenko
was struggling to correct policies that were adopted during
Chernomyrdin's first term as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   When Chernomyrdin addressed the financial crisis, his economic
prescriptions were vague, halting and, at times, nearly incoherent.
</P>
<P>
   The acting prime minister said that the government should use
credits to boost Russia's stricken industrial sector but conceded
in the same breath that the government had no money.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Yeltsin government's decision to devalue the
ruble was a mistake, but gave no hint of how he planned to prop up
the nation's sagging currency.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would not allow the banking system to collapse, but
gave no details about how he could prevent the bankruptcy of some
of the nation's leading banks.
</P>
<P>
   His dominant policy goal since being selected as prime minister
last week, he said, was simply to avoid a total financial collapse
before he formed a new government and tried to figure out what to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing was to hold until the end of August,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The circus-like atmosphere of Monday's debate came against the
background of grim economic news. Russia's stock market was so
depressed that there were only three transactions during its first
two hours.

IRA DENIES  2 LINK TO BOMBING IN NORTHERN IRELAND
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ The Irish Republican Army, which has observed
a cease-fire for 13 months, made a rare public statement Monday,
denying any connection to a bombing that killed 28 people two weeks
ago in Omagh, Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA also rejected demands that it disarm soon and declare an
end to its war against British sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The statements, made in an interview with an unidentified IRA
leader, appeared to be an attempt to improve the group's image and
to help its political wing, Sinn Fein, in the new Northern Ireland
Assembly. The Assembly reconvenes in two weeks to try to enact
provisions of the Northern Ireland peace settlement approved last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   The statements also seemed timed to improve the image of the IRA
and Sinn Fein before President Clinton arrives in Ireland later
this week. Clinton helped further the Northern Ireland peace effort
by supporting Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials and analysts noted that the interview was
released four days before it would normally be published in An
Phoblacht, a Republican weekly with IRA contacts that is based in
Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Paisley Jr., son of the hard-line Protestant leader and a
member of the Assembly, said the statements were ``designed to
perpetuate the myth that there are good and bad terrorists, that
the good terrorists are telling off the bad ones so we can all
sleep easily. It is a meaningless statement driven by a need to be
seen to be doing something hours before President Clinton touches
down in Northern Ireland.'
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein and its president, Gerry Adams, have been under
increasing pressure to persuade the IRA to state categorically that
the war is over.
</P>
<P>
   Most, but not all, of the pressure has come from Protestant
Unionist leaders who insist that Adams not be given a minister's
post in the Assembly unless the IRA declares its cease-fire to be
permanent. The interview statements were also an attempt by the IRA
to clear itself of charges that it helped a splinter group, called
the Real IRA, commit the bombing in Omagh.
</P>
<P>
   Such speculation led Unionists to insist that because the IRA
might have been involved in the Omagh attack, Adams, by
association, should be ejected from the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   If that happened, the IRA would be expected to resume its
violence and the five-year-old peace effort could collapse in a new
round of killing by Catholics, who want more power in the North and
closer ties with the Irish Republic, and Protestants, who want to
remain part of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The statements also included an IRA promise to disclose the
burial places of members it had executed in disciplinary actions.
The statement admitted that it had executed and buried ``a small
number of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview called for disbanding of the Real IRA, describing
it as a small group of renegades that had broken away from the main
IRA after it called a cease-fire. The cease-fire led to the peace
agreement that produced the new Assembly, which includes members
representing Sinn Fein, who are widely recognized as the IRA's
representatives.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The splinter group received no materials for military
operations, the statement said. Rather, the dissent was a failed
effort to destabilize the IRA leadership, it added.
</P>
<P>
   On the demands that it state that the war is over, and that
disarmament should begin, the IRA leader said the organization
considered the peace agreement a ``significant development.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That remains our view. We made our position absolutely clear
on this in April,'' the leader said.
</P>
<P>
   The April statement said, ``Let us make it clear that there will
be no decommissioning by the IRA.''
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's interview the leader said people should be using
their energy to make the peace effort work and not ``wasting time
on word games around whether or not someone is prepared to say the
war is over.''

EAST TEXAS GRANNY DIES AT AGE 110 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trim) 
(Attn: Ark., N.M.) 
 
By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ She was born when the Indian Wars were still going on,
when the Texas Revolution was more recent than World War II is
today. She plowed with oxen when cotton, not oil, was king in East
Texas. She lived during exactly half of the United States'
presidential administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Now Aley Ivy Cheairs LaRue _ called Granny, Other Momma and Big
Granny by her very large family _ has died at 110. She passed away
quietly early Monday at her small home near the communities of Ash
and Austonio in Houston County.
</P>
<P>
   Austonio is about 100 miles north of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard that lady say a single bad thing about any other
person. She never smoked, chewed, drank or swore,'' said her
daughter-in-law Arlene LaRue.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the hardest worker I ever saw. She was working right
up to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Although blind and almost totally deaf and bedridden for the
past couple of years, Granny LaRue was apparently working in her
mind, for she continued to shout out orders to her children and to
give directions for the plowing and other farm work that needed to
be done.
</P>
<P>
   It was work she knew only too well.
</P>
<P>
   She was born March 23, 1888, on a large farm operated by her
parents, John and Elizabeth Cheairs. Her grandparents had come to
Texas in 1832, when it was still part of Mexico. Her father grew
cotton on the rich land of the Trinity River bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The eldest of eight children, she attended a one-room school
through the third grade. Then, when she was only 11, her mother
died and she started helping raise her five sisters and two
brothers.
</P>

   ``I worked on the farm since I was 10 years old,'' LaRue told an
interviewer when she was a spry 98.
</P>
<P>
   She helped educate her younger siblings, too. Until a couple of
years ago, she'd still proudly illustrate how well she knew her
lessons by reciting the alphabet _ backward.
</P>
<P>
   She met Tom LaRue from Lovelady shortly before World War I. They
rode a horse-drawn buggy to nearby Porter Springs to get married.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't even get out of the buggy,'' Arlene LaRue said.
``The man who performed the marriage came out to the buggy and
married them right there.''
</P>
<P>
   They raised seven children. Virgil LaRue, the oldest, is 83 now.
He and Carl, Thomas Jr. and William LaRue live in the Ash and
Austonio area. Annie Scogin lives in Silver City, N.M. Jay LaRue
lives in Santa Fe, N.M. The youngest, John LaRue died three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Granny LaRue is also survived by 23 grandchildren, 38 great
grandchildren and at least 17 great-great grandchildren, Arlene
LaRue said.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband traveled widely and moved to western Texas
in the 1930s and then to New Mexico and then to Arkansas, where he
died in 1958. After he died, she decided to move back to Houston
County to be near her family.
</P>
<P>
   Proud of her roses, she also always raised a large garden and
kept a flock of chickens. Even blindness in recent years didn't
keep her from her garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gardened by feel,'' Arlene LaRue said. ``She could tell a
weed from a plant by touch and she never pulled up a plant by
mistake and never missed a weed.''

<P>
   Fond of eating fresh tomatoes, cucumbers and green onions from
the garden with good corn bread, she didn't let having no teeth
slow her down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been part of this family for 50 years and I never did
know her to have any teeth,'' Arlene LaRue said. She didn't bother
to put in store-bought teeth, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She was also not one to seek medical attention for trivial
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had some terrible falls, but it never seemed to hurt her
much,'' said Arlene LaRue. ``She came out of field of corn
nine-feet-high once and fell flat as a fritter, but she didn't
break any bones. She did break her arm once, but she wouldn't go to
the doctor for it.''

   Warned that eating fatty foods was bad for her, she went on
eating the fatty pork she so loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't have a gall bladder operation until she was 88
years old,'' her daughter-in-law said.
</P>
<P>
   A woman of strong religious beliefs, she attended the Ash Church
of Christ even after dwindling hearing made it impossible for her
to hear the sermons. She often told her descendants that just going
to church wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``That building won't save you,'' she'd say. ``You've got to be
a good person.''
</P>
<P>
   After she was confined to a wheelchair and then to bed, she
refused to go to a nursing home. Her son Carl sometimes relieved by
other siblings, would spend the nights with her. A sitter was there
in the daytime.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, her sons made sure there was a garden for her to
watch out of the window and to eat from. This year it had mustard
greens.
</P>
<P>
   Her birthday was always a major family event. Three years ago,
when the clad last gathered to celebrate it with her, 83 relatives
showed up for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Her funeral is scheduled Thursday at Callaway-Allee Funeral Home
in Crockett.

   TOKYO _ In a move that immediately raised tensions in the
region, North Korea fired a ballistic missile into the Sea of Japan
at around noon on Monday. The launch may have been a test, but
North Korea offered no explanation.
</P>
<P>
   By some accounts, part of the missile flew over northeast Japan
and landed in the Pacific Ocean. If that is confirmed, it will add
to the apprehension by underscoring the range of North Korea's new
class of missiles.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of damage, although fishing boats ply the
Sea and aircraft fly over the area on a regular basis, and it was
not clear whether the firing was part of a series or just a single
launch. The Japanese Defense Agency, which said it received its
information from the U.S. Forces in Japan, said that the ballistic
missile was fired from the eastern coast of North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts said it was possible that the launch was a
nationalistic display of force linked to the upcoming 50th
anniversary on Sept. 9 of the secretive, renegade Stalinist state.
Other North Korea specialists said that it could be a statement of
political defiance, as negotiations take place in New York between
representatives of North Korea and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean Defense Ministry said on Monday that it
believed the missile was probably a test firing of the Taepo
Dong-1, a newly developed missile system with an intermediate range
of 937 miles to as much as 1,875 miles. Other estimates pinpointed
the range at 1,250 miles.
</P>
<P>
   If the missile was a Taepo Dong-1, it is not clear whether the
firing was a success, for the missile did not travel its full
range.
</P>
<P>
   Other military experts say the missile could have been the
shorter range Nodong-1, a medium-range ballistic missile. Still, if
the test is considered successful, North Korea may have developed
the capability to target American military bases on Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real reason for the North Korean missile is its target,
which is Japan,'' said Toshiyuki Shikata, professor at Teikyo
University and a retired general in the Japanese Self Defense
Forces. And the reason for Japan, he added, is that the American
military bases are located here.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea already has tested its Nodong class of missiles.
They are believed to be able to reach a broad swath of Japan, but
not the Tokyo area or the many American bases in Okinawa.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The missile landed on Monday at 12:12 p.m., smack in the middle
of Sea of Japan, by some accounts into the Russian exclusive
economic zone, directly south of the Russian city of Vladivostok.
It hit the water about 240 miles from Noto Peninsula, the nearest
coast of Japan, or 430 miles northwest of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a very political meaning,'' said Masao Okonogi, a
politics professor and expert on the Korean peninsula at Keio
University. ``They are now demonstrating their military capability
in political terms.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's missile program has attracted special concern
because the country is also believed to have some nuclear weapons.
It is not clear, however, whether North Korea has the ability to
construct a nuclear weapon small enough so that it can be delivered
on one of its missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, North Korea is believed to have tons of chemical
weapons, which would be much easier to deliver with missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka called the test
``deplorable,'' and said the firing was an ``extremely dangerous
act.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadaaki Numata, spokesman for Japan's Foreign Ministry said:
``We are seriously concerned about this because the deployment of
missiles by North Korea does affect Japanese security and it also
affects peace and stability in Northeast Asia. It also is of
serious global concern, in terms of the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some analysts argue that Monday's missile firing could
be a flashy commercial, an advertisement to the Middle East and
other countries looking to buy cheap weapons. North Korea has
always been highly secretive about its weapons program, and
analysts say it would have been loathe to reveal its military
capabilities to the world, which is precisely what such a test
does.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean officials have said that North Korea's weapon sales
have been declining in recent years, bringing in only $300 million
between 1990 and 1995, compared to $2.5 billion during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ballistic missiles are the only North Korean product which can
get foreign currency,'' said Kensuke Ebata, military analyst in
Tokyo for Jane's Defense Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Ebata said that North Korea would be taking a domestic risk in
testing the Taepo Dong-1 so close to Sept. 9, when North Korean
leader Kim Jong Il is expected to officially assume the presidency
of that country. Because the missile travelled a distance far
smaller than it was designed to reach, the test could be perceived
by some at home to have failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it succeeded, it would be very good propaganda, raising
national solidarity,'' said Ebata. ``But if it failed, it could be
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Billy Birdwell, a spokesman for the U.S. Forces in
Japan, confirmed the firing and said that the Department of Defense
regarded the action as a ``serious development.'' He would not
comment, however, on what kind of missile was fired, on the flight
of the missile, or on whether there were any signs that there would
be more missiles fired.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea previously conducted missile test firing in May
1993, when it fired four missiles into the Sea of Japan. Those
launchings sent Japan into a panic and prompted the government to
consider cooperation on a regional Theater Missile Defense System.
Such a system is still years away, at best.
</P>
<P>
   That 1993 test firing is believed to have been a Rodong-1, a
shorter range ballistic missile system, which is based on a Scud
missile engine.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government was alerted about two weeks ago to North
Korea's missile launch preparations, according to a report a week
ago in the Sankei Shimbun, a major Japanese daily. The report said
that both Japanese and American forces stepped up surveillance of
the Sea of Japan and that the U.S. military had dispatched a
ballistic-missile surveillance aircraft to its Misawa base in
northern Japan.

NORTH KOREA TEST RAISES FEARS OF SPREAD OF BALLISTIC MISSILES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related NKOREA-MISSILE) 
(HLW) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ North Korea's test of a medium-range missile
capable of reaching targets in Japan and beyond represents a
technological breakthrough that has raised new fears of the spread
of ballistic missiles, administration officials and arms control
experts said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With North Korea's record of exporting missiles and related
technology to countries like Iran, Pakistan and Syria, the
officials and experts said, they worry that more advanced,
longer-range missiles are now within the reach of less developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is serious stuff,'' a Pentagon official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's test was the first of a two-stage missile the United
States calls the Taepo Dong-1. It can carry conventional or nuclear
warheads, and the Pentagon estimates its range as more than 900
miles, while the Central Intelligence Agency puts its range at
1,200 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, North Korea had only succeeded in testing a
single-stage missile, the Nodong. That missile has a range of 600
miles, but is considered a relatively unsophisticated version of
the Scud missile.
</P>
<P>
   The officials and arms experts said the test also suggested that
North Korea had made real progress in its effort to build a
longer-range missile, the Taepo Dong-2, which is reportedly capable
of traveling 2,400 to 3,600 miles. That would give North Korea the
ability to strike targets throughout Asia and as far away as
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Henry D. Sokolski, the executive director of the
Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, in Washington, said the
ability to build rockets in stages opened the door to
intercontinental missiles that at least in theory would have
virtually unlimited range.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can no longer be dismissed as some crude welding of Scud
technology,'' he said. ``We're entering a new era.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear
Arms Control, another research organization in Washington, said the
missile test was ``a clear sign'' of North Korea's intent to
develop nuclear weapons, despite its 1994 agreement with the United
States to stop in exchange for Western assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Milhollin said a two-stage missile was too costly to construct
simply for delivering conventional weapons. ``It means they plan to
put a nuclear warhead on it or export it to somebody who will,'' he
said. ``The missile makes no sense otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon confirmed that North Korea sent the missile
streaking over Japan, firing it from a military base on its
northeastern coast. The first stage of the missile fell into the
Sea of Japan, while the second stage splashed down in the Pacific
Ocean after crossing over Japan.
</P>
<P>
   A report the Pentagon released last year warned that testing of
the Taepo Dong-1 ``could begin at any time.'' And the Central
Intelligence Agency had been monitoring preparations for Monday's
launch for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But if there was little surprise, there was considerable
confusion about North Korea's motives.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's test came as North Korea's diplomats met once again
with administration officials in New York. In meetings over the
past two weeks, the American delegation, led by Charles Kartman, a
deputy assistant secretary of state, has raised American concerns
about North Korea's missiles and missile exports. The test was
discussed on Monday, but American officials declined to say what
explanation, if any, the North Koreans gave.
</P>
<P>
   The test came only weeks after American intelligence agents
detected work on a secret underground facility that they suspect is
part of North Korea's effort to revive its nuclear weapons program.
Republicans in Congress, citing those reports, renewed their
objections to the administration's policy of providing aid to North
Korea in exchange for a halt in its nuclear ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican majority leader, Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi,
used Monday's test to criticize the administration's policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been told that, `Don't worry. Now that we're helping
them, the North Koreans have frozen their weapons, their nuclear
activities,''' he said. ``And then we find out that they perhaps
are doing this underground nuclear facility. Now they fire a
missile across Japan territory. This is not good at all. It's very
dangerous.''

LOW BIDS FOR KIA REFLECT EXCESS CAPACITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (lb) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The auction of two South Korean automakers has become
a difficult process because none of the initial bids met the
sellers' minimum price, a sign of the obstacles that lie ahead as
the global auto industry continues to consolidate, auto executives
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite robust auto sales in North America and Europe, most of
the world's 33 mass-production automakers are losing money. There
are enough surplus auto factories around the globe to supply the
entire U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   But as the setbacks in the auction of Kia Motors Corp. and its
affiliate, Asia Motors Co. Ltd., show, merging the remaining
automakers remains a difficult task. Asian automakers currently
have the greatest excess capacity, but their enormous debts have
made American and European automakers reluctant to acquire them,
combine operations and close unneeded factories.
</P>
<P>
   Kia and Asia Motors were put up for sale together this summer by
their creditor banks after becoming unable to make payments on
their many debts, which total an estimated $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But bids by Ford Motor Co., Daewoo, Hyundai and Samsung have
drawn little enthusiasm from the banks. All of the bids would have
required the banks to write off some of their loans, auto industry
officials who insisted on anonymity said Monday. Ford and Hyundai
also bid less per share for Asia Motors than the banks' minimum
price, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the auction is to be announced Tuesday morning in
Seoul, South Korea. Some industry officials predicted Monday that
because the bids were so low, the auction would be canceled and
another would be held in October.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent failure of the auction lessens the likelihood that
Kia or Asia Motors will close any factories soon, so the global car
market is likely to remain glutted, depressing prices and profits.
The difficulties with the auction also represent a setback for
South Korea's efforts to streamline its industrial sector, which
suffers from heavy debts and excessive staffs in many industries.
</P>
<P>
   Auto-industry deals actually taking place now are unlikely to
reduce global overcapacity. Chrysler Corp. is preparing to merge
later this year with Daimler-Benz AG, for example, but the two
automakers have almost completely different lineups of vehicles and
no plans to close factories.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Eaton, Chrysler's chairman and chief executive, said in
an interview Monday that the recent plunge in stock markets around
the globe is very unlikely to affect the planned merger, in which
shareholders of both companies will turn in their stock for shares
in the combined company, DaimlerChrysler AG.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler shares had tumbled 13.5 percent last Thursday and have
fared poorly since then along with the rest of the stock market.
The stock fell Thursday on speculation that the Daimler merger
might not take place, because Russia's economic and political
troubles had caused the German stock market to plummet, dragging
down the value of Daimler shares.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. market has also been battered since then. Eaton
said Monday morning that there had been no discussion of
renegotiating the merger terms. The merger would be in trouble only
if the performance of the German and American stock markets
diverged dramatically and the share prices of Daimler and Chrysler
also diverged, he said, adding that he believed this was very
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the markets move relatively the same, I don't see
any impact,'' Eaton said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another recently announced auto-industry transaction also
appears unlikely to relieve the industry's excess capacity. Toyota
Motor Corp. announced on Friday that it would spend $262 million to
raise its stake in Daihatsu Motor Co. Ltd. to 51.2 percent. But
Toyota's previous stake of 34.5 percent had already given it
control of Daihatsu, which is strongest in the manufacture of very
small cars, one of Toyota's few weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Kia sale has attracted international attention because
American, European and Japanese automakers have worried that if a
buyer accepts the company with all of its debts, the purchaser
could be forced to dump large numbers of low-priced Kia cars on
international markets in an attempt, which might be futile, to keep
up with interest payments.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler did not bid on Kia, partly because it is still busy
with the Daimler merger and partly because Chrysler executives were
dubious about the profitability of East Asian markets even before
the region's financial crisis began. ``The only way Kia would be
attractive to anybody would be if you restructured or reduced the
debt,'' Eaton said Monday.

 &HT;    Galarraga to make case for appeal
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson and Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Judge Mills Lane, he's not. While Leonard Coleman is
officially the president of the National League, he'll assume his
periodic judicial role today, when baseball's reigning Hit Man,
Andres Galarraga, gets his day in court.
</P>
<P>
   In town for the Braves' series with Houston, Coleman will hear
Galarraga's appeal of the three-game suspension and $1,000 fine.
The penalty was imposed after the Braves first baseman charged the
mound on Aug. 22, when the Dodgers' Darren Dreifort hit him for the
second time in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga, who was ejected after just missing Dreifort with a
wild left hook before wrestling him to the ground, insists that he
deserves, ``no suspension'' and that Dreifort was throwing at him
purposely . He said that 23 HBPs _ the latest was Saturday in St.
Louis _ is ``too many (times) to be too nice, too patient.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't they hit me when I strike out four times?'' asked
Galarraga, who leads the majors in being hit by pitches. ``They
only hit me when I hit a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, of course, draw a different composite sketch of the
culprit: a right-handed power hitter with an open stance who
strides in toward home plate, only exacerbating the way pitchers
must work him to survive. By pitching him inside, they prevent
Galarraga from extending his arms and hitting another homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andres Galarraga is a guy with an open stance who dives at the
ball,'' Bob Gibson, the Cardinals' Hall of Fame pitcher and
arguably the premier practitioner of pitching inside, told an ESPN
national TV audience Sunday night. ``If you're going to pitch
inside, you'd better have some giddy-up.''
</P>
<P>
   And how would Gibson work Galarraga if he was still playing
today? ``I'd pitch him inside,'' he said. ``I wouldn't worry about
throwing strikes; I'd just pitch him hard inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Orel Hershiser still does. Hard, yet carefully. ``When he's
struggling, he's diving into the strike zone,'' the Giants' pitcher
told the San Diego Union-Tribune. ``When his swing is on, he's
transferring weight.''
</P>
<P>
   And having a splendid season. Galarraga's two home runs Sunday
in St. Louis give him 42 homers and 112 RBIs. All of that despite
the bruises up and down his left arm and hand that cause him to
wear protective padding and would make other men flinch. ``I don't
know how he does it, getting hit all the time,'' said Braves backup
catcher Eddie Perez, a fellow Venezuelan who lockers next to
Galarraga and is perhaps his closest friend on the club. ``If it
was me, I'd be thinking about it (getting hit) every time I'm up.
But he keeps doing it. I know he has to be thinking about it, but
he doesn't say very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 23 times Galarraga has been hit this year, 20 have come
by right-handed pitchers throwing inside. Only two have hit him
twice: Dreifort and Masato Yoshii of the Mets. Three lefties have
hit Galarraga: Phillies starter Matt Beech and relievers Jeff
Tabaka of Pittsburgh and Gabe White of Tampa Bay, the first of
three Devil Rays pitchers to hit Galarraga on successive days.
</P>
<P>
   After being hit four times in April, Galarraga had an HBP-free
May. But once Boston's Derek Lowe drilled him on June 8, the hits
just kept on coming. Six in June. Seven in July, including three in
a four-day period. August's carnage: Six HBPs, HPBs, entering
Monday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga's has been hit four times this season in games in
which he's homered. Only twice has he been hit after homering in a
game: On June 30, White hit him in the seventh inning after
Galarraga had twice homered; on June 15, Yoshii hit Galarraga in
the third inning after he'd hit a two-run homer in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga is most likely to be hit by a right-handed starter in
the first or third innings (four times each this season) or by a
reliever in the seventh (five).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's two ways to look at this thing,'' said Dick Balderson,
a Braves major-league scout who was in Colorado's front office
during Galarraga's five years with the Rockies. ``You've got to
pitch big guys in; you can't let him extend the bat. But today, you
have a lot of pitchers who have the idea to pitch inside but can't.
You've got a lot out there who have no clue, and they hit him. I
think that's the frustration you see with Galarraga. I think he's
very frustrated with getting hit all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez recalled that when Galarraga was with the Rockies, ``We
would go in on him, because that way he can't extend his arms. But
you have to be careful when you go in there, because when he's
looking for a pitch inside, he can hit that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga can't get out of the way of an inside fastball,
especially when striding in toward the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That definitely fits in,'' said Balderson said. ``If you're
standing on the mound, and Galarraga's standing at the plate, you
see a huge area to throw to. As you start to throw, he steps in and
there's not a lot of room to throw to. That area becomes cluttered
with Andres Galarraga body parts. In some areas, it (the suddenly
shrunken zone to pitch inside to) is four, five inches, not a foot
like it looks like. And if you're a young pitcher and you leave a
fastball up to him outside or over the plate, it's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   So you throw inside. Way inside. Even if you're not particularly
adept at doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a lot of guys who didn't pitch inside in high
school, college, in the minor leagues,'' Balderson said. ``I was a
minor-league pitcher. It takes some (guts) to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, pitchers know it's a must.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got pitching coaches, advance scouts, scouting reports
that all say you've got to pitch him up and in,'' Balderson said.
``If you don't, you're not going to be in the league long.''
</P>
<P>
   If Coleman denies Galarraga's appeal, he'll begin serving his
suspension immediately, missing the last two games of the Houston
series and Friday's game in New York against the Mets. Whatever
today's outcome, one HBP truth is indisputable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who gets hit, it hurts,'' said Balderson. ``It's as
simple as that.''

 &HT;    Braves on deck: Houston Astros
 &HT;    By I. J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ When: 7:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   _ TV: Fox Sports South.
</P>
<P>
   _ Probable starting pitchers: LHP Denny Neagle (13-11, 3.62,
4-4, 4.42 ERA lifetime vs. Astros) vs. RHP Sean Bergman (11-7,
3.56; 1-3, 7.03 ERA lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   _ Notes: Neagle appears to be getting back on track, winning his
last two starts after dropping four of his previous five. He faced
Houston on May 15 and picked up a victory, going 7 1/3 innings and
allowing one run on six hits. While Neagle is 7-3 at home, his ERA
(4.47) is high. His problems continue to come between pitches
76-90, when opponents are hitting .383. The Astros are hitting .276
against Neagle. Derek Bell is 8-for-25; Craig Biggio is 5-for-26.
Bergman has seen his ERA go from 3.18 to 3.56 in the last month,
but he's been very effective for a pitcher at the end of the club's
rotation. He did get knocked around by the Braves in a start last
week in Houston, going 5 1/3 innings and allowing five runs, four
of them earned. He defeated the Braves on May 17, pitching eight
innings and allowing one run. Andres Galarraga is 9-for-16 against
Bergman, and Ryan Klesko is 6-for-11 with three home runs. The
Braves are hitting .337 against Bergman.

 &HT;    The 'Big Easy' Saints likely to have a tough time in '98
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Amusement-park owners post prominent warnings that
caution patrons with heart-related problems not to ride some
rollercoasters. Given the condition of the New Orleans Saints,
owner Tom Benson might consider printing a similar notice on game
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Having done little to improve the NFL's worst offense of a year
ago and with significant defections from an aggressive defense that
led the league in sacks, New Orleans could spend the 1998 season in
a free-fall. And as the Saints plummet, blood pressures in The Big
Easy, most notably that of volatile coach Mike Ditka, could
skyrocket right through the Superdome roof.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hopeful forecasts from Ditka, this remains a team
that must be avoided by the faint-hearted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way we're going back to last year,'' said Ditka,
referring to the Saints' 6-10 record and fourth-place finish in the
NFC West. ``We're better than that, I promise you.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was little indication during the preseason that New
Orleans is poised to make even modest improvement. Since the 1970
merger, the Saints have 10 last-place finishes, the second-most in
the league. They should battle the equally beleaguered St. Louis
Rams this year for the cellar spot in the division. By mid-season,
Ditka's promise of better times ahead could ring hollow.
</P>
<P>
   If 1997 was the Year of the Sack, with New Orleans sacking the
quarterback 59 times, this probably will be a season fans come to
the Superdome with the traditional brown paper bags over their
heads. Not even the scheming of underrated defensive coordinator
Zaven Yaralian, whose blitzes catapulted a modestly talented unit
to a No. 4 ranking in the league, can camouflage the shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Gone from that defense are ascending middle linebacker Winfred
Tubbs (free agent), cornerback Eric Allen (traded), strongside
linebacker Richard Harvey (released) and tackle Darren Mickell
(retired). End Joe Johnson could end his holdout this week but
probably won't be ready for extended playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Free-agent linebacker Andre Royal, slated to replace Harvey, was
traded to Indianapolis on Sunday, in part because of his role in an
ugly hazing scandal at training camp. That incident, now under
investigation by NFL security officials, apparently has some racial
overtones and could be a season-long disruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still getting comfortable with the new guys who are
starting . . . so, no, we can't be as solid yet as we were last
season,'' defensive tackle Wayne Martin said last week. ``There's
some work to be done and not much time left to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger problem, however, is offense. Ditka likes the
toughness of quarterback Billy Joe Hobert, but the sixth-year
veteran might not be able to start for any other team in the NFL.
There is no deep threat among the receivers, and tailback Lamar
Smith, the man expected to be the workhorse in an offense designed
to cut down on last year's 55 turnovers, has averaged only 71
carries in his career.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line includes three first-rounders, and perennial
Pro Bowl tackle William Roaf seems to have rededicated himself
after a subpar '97.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints' sinners
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans Saints led the NFL with 55 turnovers in '97, the
eighth-most in league history. These seven players accounted for 50
turnovers:
</P>
<P>
   Player _ Int. _ Fum.
</P>
<P>
   QB Heath Shuler _ 14 _ 5
</P>
<P>

BACK FROM VACATION, GORE TRIES TO CONDUCT BUSINESS AS USUAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ohio)  (js) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Back on the campaign trail in Illinois and Ohio after
his two-week holiday in Hawaii, Vice President Al Gore turned to
his companions Monday morning on Air Force Two: ``Anything happen
while I was gone?''
</P>
<P>
   This was about as close as Gore came publicly to alluding to the
difficulties that are roiling the Clinton-Gore White House: Two
weeks ago, there was the president's admission that he had an
improper relationship with Monica Lewinsky and misled the American
people about it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last week, Attorney General Janet Reno ordered a 90-day
preliminary inquiry into whether Gore lied to investigators last
year when he was interviewed about his telephone fund-raising
solicitations from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   And Monday, as Clinton headed for Russia, Gore could not take
solace in embattled President Boris Yeltsin's choice of his friend
Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister. Chernomyrdin's nomination is
in grave trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But in his first interview since Clinton's disclosure about Ms.
Lewinsky, Gore made clear that his strategy would be to say as
little as possible about the tribulations that threaten to dog him
until the November election and beyond, to his own planned run for
the Democratic nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Clinton had assured him he did not have a
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, Gore told reporters aboard Air
Force Two: ``I've never talked about my private conversations with
the president _ and I'm not going to start now.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said he did not agree with Democrats who say
they fear the Lewinsky matter will be a major liability in the
elections this year. Asked if he felt beleaguered, he said, ``Not
at all. Not at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's calculation seems to be to stand by his close friend, the
president, but not too close. For example, he acknowledged in the
interview that he did not join Clinton in recent days in calling
leading Democrats on Capitol Hill to reassure them that they would
endure the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore insisted that he was not distancing himself from the
president, and said White House aides ``didn't ask me to make a
bunch of calls'' because he was tied up making calls on
international issues such as Russia and the U.S. cruise missile
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Only when the interview turned from ethical questions to Russia
did Gore appear comfortable, answering questions and displaying his
expertise on foreign policy. Though he did not call Democratic
leaders, he said he had a ``lengthy conversation'' with
Chernomyrdin while on vacation in Hawaii.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As if to defy those who say the administration is in trouble,
Gore set off on a full round of campaign events. He started the day
talking to school children at a town meeting in Dayton, Ohio, then
attended a fund-raising event for Mary Boyle, the Democratic Senate
nominee from Ohio. In Chicago, Gore was the headline speaker at a
convention of the Communication Workers of America, then he
dedicated an AIDS prevention and care center, and ended the day at
a fund-raising reception for the re-election of Sen. Carol
Moseley-Braun.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gore said nothing about the developments that have
buffeted the administration, they were clearly on the minds of
those in the audience. At the event for Ms. Boyle in Dayton, the
vice president drew perhaps his most sustained applause of the day
when he showed his allegiance to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me say this loudly and clearly: I am proud that Bill
Clinton's policies have made this country a better place,'' he
said. ``I'm proud to serve with President Bill Clinton in helping
to improve the lot of working families in America.''
</P>
<P>
   As if he were oblivious to his own party's problems, Gore turned
his fury on the Republicans, asserting, ``The Republican Party is
in such disarray that the right hand doesn't know what the far
right hand is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But some in the audience said they feared that Clinton's ethical
woes and the fund-raising questions threatened Gore's political
future. ``I feel for him both on the personal level and on the
political level,'' said Jan Rudd, a veteran community worker and
Democratic organizer in Dayton. ``Already, you can see that
Republicans across the country are using the Lewinsky issue against
Democrats. Are they going to use it against Gore? Yes. Big time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Jackson, a teacher who attended the Boyle event, said Gore
may not be safe from the taint of the Lewinsky matter because
``there's always the term, `guilt by association,' but I'm more
concerned that Reno says there should be an investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gore was reciting the Clinton administration's
accomplishments in education and the economy, Jackson jabbed his
thumb toward the vice president in the distance and said, ``Any
time you're in politics you're going to be remembered more for the
problems than the good. That's why he's harping on the good
today.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Ruvolo, a former chairman of the state's Democratic
Party, said the Lewinsky matter should be the least of Gore's
worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's running mate is the economy,'' he said, speaking of
2000, ``not Bill Clinton.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As they surveyed their outsized stock market gains
over the past three years, some investors may have thought to
wonder, on occasion, just what a bear market feels like.
</P>
<P>
   Now they know.
</P>
<P>
   In Wall Street's second biggest one-day point decline, stocks of
all kinds disintegrated Monday. As a demise, it was orderly. But it
was also indiscriminate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was really different,'' said Douglas Cliggott, U.S.
equity strategist at J.P. Morgan in New York. ``Very high quality
companies with no visible sign of earnings weakness were taken down
brutally.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the selling hammered stocks both in and out of favor
with investors, both cyclical and noncyclical businesses, and both
recognizable and obscure companies.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was different in another way, however. It marked the
first time in years that the three most popular market indexes _
the Dow Jones industrial average, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 and the
Nasdaq Composite _ showed losses. Until now, the declines in the
indexes, unpleasant though they were, had still left investors
ahead of the game.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. Investors, playing with the house's money all year,
are now faced with the prospect of giving up some of their own.
Those who own index funds are now eating into last year's gains.
</P>
<P>
   There was no stopping the selling. No circuit breakers to kick
in on the New York Stock Exchange to give investors time to regain
their reason before they resumed the furious unloading of shares.
Under the new rules instituted by the Exchange last October, it
would take a fall of 900 points for trading to be halted.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects a decline of that magnitude to happen. Indeed,
many strategists anticipate a rebound in stocks Tuesday. Investors
who had been moving their money into cash or money market funds,
could easily decide that stocks at these levels look attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Monday's action was a harrowing reminder to investors of
how the law of gravity works in the stock market. Shares of the
same highfliers that had propelled the market to its triumphant
heights led the decline. Dell Computer closed down 15.2 percent,
Yahoo! ended the day 16.9 percent lower, America Online lost 14.8
percent of its value. Those are breathtaking moves, one-day
declines that might have taken months in other, less frothy
markets.
</P>
<P>
   What fueled the decline? Monday's economic news wasn't great,
but it wasn't awful either. A report from Chicago's National
Association of Purchasing Management showed that increasing numbers
of domestic manufacturers said their businesses were deteriorating.
And sales of new homes fell 1.6 percent in July, a signal that the
housing market may be slowing. Both reports contributed to the view
that the U.S. economy is weakening.
</P>
<P>
   Inasmuch as a weaker economy translates into diminished
earnings, these figures were not welcome news to stock market
investors. Still, they were not triggers likely to cause the
all-out collapse seen Monday.
</P>
<P>
   What appeared to be happening Monday was the unwind of two
significant investor behavioral patterns. One was the shift from
investors being able to shrug off all bad news, what Wall Street
calls climbing the wall of worry, to investors showing increasing
concern. Maybe the economic problems in Asia, Russia and Latin
America, combined with the strong dollar, will indeed have a
deleterious effect on already weakening U.S. company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're looking at here is a rolling realization that there
are a lot of problems in the world,'' said Alan Kral, portfolio
manager at Trevor, Stewart, Burton and Jacobsen, an investment
management firm in New York. ``The sum total of a number of small
problems has become a major problem for us. You can't take away
growth opportunities in half the world's economies and blithely
conclude that American stocks at 25 times earnings are cheap.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But an even greater contributor to Monday's carnage, strategists
say, was the reverse effect of what has come to be known as
momentum investing. This strategy, characterized by investors
chasing stocks simply because they are rising in price, with little
regard for sensible valuations, pushed shares of the favored
companies to levels unseen before in even in the hottest of
markets. Now, with these stocks no longer rising and momentum
shifting in the other direction, momentum investors sell. And this
selling feeds on itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're buying something at a very high price/earnings
ratio,'' said Peter Tanous, investment consultant at Lynx Asset
Management in Washington D.C. ``You've always got your finger on
the trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   In choosing to pull that trigger, Monday, investors seemed to
see several things on the horizon they didn't like. First were the
whiffs of third quarter earnings disappointments, anecdotal only at
this point, but a worry nonetheless. Companies have learned to warn
investors when prospects look grim; the warning period for the
third quarter begins in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Neither have lower interest rates helped the market. This is a
turnabout for investors who have come to expect that when rates
fall, stock prices rise.
</P>
<P>
   An increasingly bearish sentiment among investment newsletter
writers also may have contributed to Monday's selling. According to
Mark Hulbert, editor of the Hulbert Financial Digest in Alexandria,
Va., at the end of July, newletter writers recommended on average
that their readers maintain an exposure in stocks of 63 percent of
their portfolio. On Monday the recommended level had dropped to
around 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hulbert said that we are not yet seeing people really
throwing in the towel. ``Even though there has been a big drop, I
thought we'd have seen even more,'' he said ``We may not have quite
the capitulation among advisers that a contrarian needs to see
before calling a bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, technology stocks, which led the market up, look
particularly vulnerable to further declines. That's because now
that Windows '98 is out in the stores, there are no new drivers to
make investors want to got out and buy a new computer. At the same
time that there is a glut of product out there, consumer interest
is down.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has been largely a confidence game of late,
said Fred Hickey, editor of High Tech Strategist. ``Since investors
have been so certain about their stocks for so long, there's a
shock factor. People have leveraged themselves, taken risks they
shouldn't have taken because these stocks seem so invincible.
You're seeing a reversal of these excesses.''

<P>
   Heavy Internet traffic slowed many online investment sites
Monday as panicked investors mobbed cyberspace, checking their
stock prices and then sticking around to commiserate.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the bears are patting themselves on their backs now,
saying `We told you so!' But they don't really care, do they?''
said one investor on a Yahoo discussion forum called Follow the
Yellow Brick Road. ``I'm back to where I was sometime in the middle
of January. I'll go slit my wrists now.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense of calm expressed amid market chaos by many of middle
America's typical mutual-fund investors was nowhere in evidence in
Internet forums and chat rooms, where participants tend to be
active investors and where emotion is never quite as tempered as it
is in other environments.
</P>
<P>
   On America Online, where chat-room convention dictates a cheery
demeanor, the tone Monday afternoon had turned decidedly somber.
Investors kept one another up to date on what was happening on
CNBC. (``Shoot the jerks on CNBC,'' one suggested. ``Nothing but
bears, one after another.'')
</P>
<P>
   A typical exchange went like this:
</P>
<P>
   ROWNAROWNA: ``Hiya Cohen _ how are you doing?''
</P>
<P>
   CohenInvGr: ``Not good. Bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   ROWNAROWNA: ``We all are.''
</P>
<P>
   Fozziebare, another regular in the America Online investor
forums, complained, ``Can no longer afford my AOL subscription.''
</P>
<P>
   David Gardner, co-founder of The Motley Fool, one of the oldest
investment sites in cyberspace, said that among the most popular
discussion groups on the online investment Web site Monday was one
titled ``Living Below Your Means.'' Another was ``Communion of
Bears.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, what characterized that conversation is they had
to team up together because they were so marginalized,'' Gardner
said of regulars in the bear forum. ``Now they're just calling for
blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, sympathy for the market losers did not run deep on
several popular message boards on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have told you people for some time now Dell is going to the
dogs!'' FantomBoy wrote in a discussion group about Dell Computer.
``Dell lost all its recent gains, and you folks call Dell bullett
proof! BAWHAHAHAHAH.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell's stock, which had held out until Monday, suffered a 16
percent decline Monday. The rout for technology stocks was
particularly hard felt by online investors who had remained
optimistic among the warning signs in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this isn't a free fall for the markets, and Dell, then I
don't know what a free fall is,'' wrote Stock Bull, a previously
bullish investor. ``Wish I had a parachute on.''
</P>
<P>
   David Zgodzinski, who writes a biweekly column for the
SiliconInvestor Web site that is based on conversations in the
discussion groups said online investors had been harder hit because
they typically owned stocks in individual companies rather than in
mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, the reaction is shock,'' Zgodzinski said. ``These
people are more enthusiastic and more tuned in, and they're feeling
the loss more personally. The man on the street hasn't had the
perception of how bad the drop has already been.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One participant in a SiliconInvestor forum called ``The Big
Kahuna'' drew on the immortal words of Star Trek's Dr. McCoy to
convey his feelings: ``They're dead Jim, they're all dead. Japan,
Russia, and now China and Hong Kong. ANY BUYERS OUT THERE??''
</P>
<P>
   A relatively new investor on a Yahoo discussion group wrote:
``Gotta love this investment language. I figured I'd need to learn
about Fibonacci sequences and 10-Ks. Instead, I end up with
catching falling knives and dead cat bounces.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was an occasional clearing of the cybergloom on
Monday as investors reassured one another that this was in fact a
buying opportunity, and that they were in it for the long haul. The
Motley Fool's ``post of the day'' was an impassioned exhortation
from a Dell investor to look on the bright side:
</P>
<P>
   ``Subject: Self Fulfilling Prophecy
</P>
<P>
   ``Author: rj610w
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respects to those on this board who are so far
above me that I can't see the light of the sun coming over their
heads, let me sound a note of concern. I am concerned that the
bottom doesn't have to fall out from under us less we beat
ourselves into believing it's coming and stampede in fear. Once the
panic starts, we will have no one to blame but ourselves. I think a
lot of our future is in our own hands and how it turns out is up to
us. A little more encouragement and a little less scare talk may
serve everyone better.''

OWNER REFOCUSING CAMERA-MAKER PANAVISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Billionaire financier Ronald Perelman, in his
first move since taking over movie-camera specialist Panavision
Inc. in June, has announced that he will become the chairman at the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   William C. Scott, Panavision's chairman and chief executive
officer since 1988, agreed to retire Dec. 31. Perelman, who has a
fortune estimated at $6. billion, promoted longtime Panavision
executive John Farrand, the 53-year-old president and chief
operating officer, to the CEO slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a strong team in place to lead Panavision,'' Perelman
said Monday in a statement announcing the changes. ``I have every
confidence in John's ability to lead this company.''
</P>
<P>
   The news helped Panavision become one of the few issues to post
a gain on the New York Stock Exchange, rising 3/8 to $17 9/16 with
5,900 shares traded. The stock had fallen 36 percent since hitting
an all-time high of $27.50 in early May, and it recently warned
that third-quarter results would be soft due to fewer big-budget
films and lower commercial production.
</P>
<P>
   In the three months since the takeover, Panavision's employee
base has remained fairly stable with 313 employees at its Los
Angeles-area headquarters and 1,200 worldwide. Perelman, who owns
72 percent of Panavision through Mafco Holdings, has pledged last
year to increase sales and to maintain the company's status as the
leading supplier of cameras for film and TV production.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman said Monday's announcements reflect that
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   According to the shareholder proxy statement for approval of the
takeover, Scott's employment contract called for an annual salary
of $800,000 and provided he be paid that amount if he left
voluntarily before next June. The pact also included a provision
that Scott, 64, agree not to compete for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement said Scott will remain on the board and
act as a consultant. Additionally, Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey
Marcketta will leave at the end of September to pursue other
interests and his duties will be assumed by longtime Perelman
associate Joseph P. Page, who was given the posts of vice chairman
and chief administrative officer.
</P>
<P>
   Panavision reported two weeks ago that it had taken a $58.6
million charge for costs associated with the takeover as part of a
$56.6 million second-quarter loss. Revenues was up 22 percent to
$46 million.

SELLOFF DAMPENS AIR OF PROSPERITY, PUTS PRESSURE ON FED TO CUT
RATES 
</HEADLINE>

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The sharp stock market selloff is likely to ripple
through policy and politics, putting more pressure on the Federal
Reserve to cut interest rates and threatening the air of prosperity
that has been the foundation of President Clinton's political
support, analysts and government officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the stock market crash in October 1987, the financial
system handled Monday's downturn without any major problems, and
the Clinton administration rushed Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
out with soothing words about the continued soundness of the
American economy.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, who was back in Washington after two weeks of vacation,
said he had spoken during the day with Clinton, who was flying to
Russia during the afternoon as the market dropped precipitously,
and to Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who was on
vacation in California.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Federal Reserve, Lynn Fox, said the
central bank had no comment on the market's decline. But economists
said that every sharp drop in the market helped build a more
compelling case that the economy could slow substantially in coming
months and that a cut in interest rates would not only help avert a
deeper downturn at home but help restore confidence and calm in
badly battered markets and economies around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not be able to control the global wildfire, but by
cutting rates we might be able to contain it,'' said Sung Won Sohn,
an economist at the Norwest Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has until the last few weeks regarded inflation as the
main threat to the continuation of the nation's long economic
expansion, which has driven unemployment down to 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts still think the Fed will not cut rates unless
there is more compelling evidence that the domestic economy is
sinking or the market slide accelerates so much that it endangers
the stability of financial system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987 Greenspan _ faced with a more sudden market meltdown _
pressed lenders to make sure they made credit available within the
financial system and then cut rates to keep the economy from
stalling.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly 11 years later the banking and financial systems are
much stronger than they were then, interest rates are already low
by many standards, securities exchanges are better able to handle
floods of orders, and government officials and analysts said they
saw no need for any immediate action to keep the markets
functioning smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   The market is different in another critical way, as well.
Compared with 1987, the stock market today is more broadly based,
with many more households having invested in retirement programs
and mutual funds. Compensation for many corporate executives is
directly or indirectly tied to stock market performance through
options, employee share-purchase programs and other means.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Sinai, an economist at Primark Decision Economics, said
that the proportion of household wealth coming from the stock
market was nearly 30 percent last month when the market was near
its peak, up from 18.3 percent at the end of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, economists said, many consumers who have felt
affluent and confident over the past few years as the market has
surged and therefore spent more money than they would have
otherwise might now rein themselves in.
</P>
<P>
   For the economy, that could mean slower growth. And any slowdown
from dampened consumer outlays would only compound the effects of a
downturn in exports caused by the turmoil that has already sent
much of Asia into recession and is now threatening to roll over
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   While relatively few economists are predicting a recession in
this country, even a sustained slowdown in growth could push
unemployment higher, call into question the optimistic projections
of big Federal budget surpluses in coming years and leave Clinton
without the bulwark of a rock-solid economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political implications are clearly related to how much
consumers tighten their wallets,'' said Robert Litan, the director
of economic studies at the Brookings Institution. ``If they do, and
GDP growth slows and unemployment grows, then the bloom has come
off the rose and that would affect his standing.''
</P>
<P>
   With most of the administration's economic team en route to
Russia and many of Clinton's political advisers traveling or on
vacation, there was almost no public reaction from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin, who made a fortune navigating Wall Street's ups and
downs as a partner at Goldman, Sachs before coming to Washington in
1993, restated Monday what has long been the administration's
approach to the markets: that in the long run they will reflect an
economy's underlying strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamentals of the United States economy are strong, due
in part to the sound policies we have been following, and the
prospects for growth with low inflation and low unemployment
continue to be strong,'' Rubin said. ``The key is to continue on
the right policy path, and particularly to maintain our fiscal
discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin urged other countries caught up the crisis, especially
Japan, to take the difficult steps needed to restore their
strength. And he again urged Congress to provide an additional $18
billion for the International Monetary Fund, which is running short
of money just as the crisis threatens to spread to Latin America
and other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is particularly important that Japan, the second largest
economy in the world, move ahead with actions to put its economy
back on track so it can be a source of strength in Asia and around
the world,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin is scheduled to meet on Friday in San Francisco with his
Japanese counterpart, Kiichi Miyazawa. Finance ministers from nine
Latin American countries will meet with IMF and U.S. officials in
Washington on Thursday and Friday to discuss what they can do to
avoid the economic fate that has befallen Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said officials from the Treasury and the Federal Reserve
were in contact throughout the day with their counterparts in the
other big industrial countries, as well as financial market
regulators in the United States including the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is currently working its way through a difficult
period,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our consultations indicate that the payment and settlement
systems and other market mechanisms are working effectively,''
Rubin said. He said the only problem had been at the Chicago Board
Options Exchange, and that it had been taken care of. He provided
no details.

 &HT;    Experts to retirement-planners: Keep your money where it is _
for now
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wrenching plunges in the stock market give individual investors
the heebie-jeebies, especially Americans who are putting a portion
of their current income into 401(k)s and other retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   They get the news about how much value their stocks or mutual
funds lost in just one day. A lot of people then wonder whether
it's time to get out _ accepting today's pain in hopes of avoiding
even more pain tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Not a good idea, professional money managers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're telling clients that they have a strategy, and that this
(their stock holdings) is long-term money,'' said Michael J. Smith,
a certified financial planner in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless their situation has changed, there's no reason to
change that strategy. Sit tight. Just continue to put your
contributions into your 401(k),'' Smith added. ``Ultimately, the
market will come back. It always has.''
</P>
<P>
   The 401(k) has been a hugely popular investment vehicle. One
reason is that income taxes are deferred on the money that workers
divert into a 401(k). Another is that more people have realized
they must take increasing personal responsibility for paying for a
prosperous retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the value of 401(k) assets leaped by $125 billion,
according to Cerulli Associates, a Boston-based research firm. A
portion of that growth resulted from rising share prices, but much
of it was from new contributions.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, the plans now hold $1 trillion worth of
retirement hopes. Cerulli estimates that number will continue to
grow by 13 percent to 15 percent each year.
</P>
<P>
   But will individuals flee after Monday's market fall? Recent
performance suggests only a small percentage will run.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dow plunged 554 points on Oct. 27, 1997, transfers
among 401(k) assets _ mainly away from stocks and into fixed-income
investments _ were four times the normal level. But even then, less
than 1 percent of investors actually moved money. The numbers were
provided by Hewitt Associates, a management consulting company that
is developing a daily index of 401(k) switching.
</P>
<P>
   In the current plunge, stockbrokers have reported business as
usual. ``Our clients are concerned, but they're not nervous,'' Lee
Jenkins, a stock broker with Raymond James, said. ``We've had such
phenomenal returns for the last few years that we've been preparing
our clients, telling them that things will return to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a certified financial planner with Financial Vision
Associates, said he heard from only a small percentage of his
clients Monday. ``Mostly they're concerned,'' he reported. ``We
reassure them, and they say, 'That's what I needed to hear.' ``
</P>
<P>
   None pulled money out of stocks, Smith added. He pointed to a
silver lining for those who continue putting retirement money into
the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's buying more shares now, because prices have come down
considerably,'' Smith said.

CLINTON BOASTS ABOUT ECONOMIC INDICATORS, REFRAINS FROM COMMENTING
ON MARKET

 By JAMES BENNET    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He had good reasons to go to Russia, President
Clinton told a friendly audience in an elementary school gymnasium
in Virginia shortly before noon Monday. ``We have learned the hard
way,'' he said, ``that problems that develop beyond our borders
sooner or later find their way to our doorstep.''
</P>
<P>
   Sooner, it turned out, rather than later. Less than three hours
after he left the gymnasium, the president was out of the country,
high over the Atlantic, when he received word from the White House
that his staunch political ally, the stock market, had gone south.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are living in a smaller and smaller world,'' Clinton had
said in Virginia, sounding a cherished theme about the economy that
might apply as well to how the political walls seem suddenly to be
closing in on him.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the market's drop was forwarded to the president. Later,
Clinton spoke by telephone with the treasury secretary, Robert
Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   It has long been an inside joke at the White House that the
famously overstating president has been forbidden by his
understated treasury secretary to boast about the astonishing
performance of the stock market in recent years. Every now and then
_ as he did in meeting with a workers in Palo Alto on May 1 __ he
has let slip the observation that ``the stock market has gone from
3,200 to 9,000 since I've been president and there's no precedent
for that in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday in Virginia, as he usually does, Clinton confined himself
to boasting about other economic indicators. ``We've benefited a
lot from this global economy of ours,'' he said. ``We have over 16
million new jobs in the last six years, and we're about to have our
first balanced budget surplus in 29 years.''
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton and many of his senior economic advisers up in the
air, it fell to Rubin Monday to provide the administration's calm
reaction to the steep drop, after consulting with the president.
``The world is currently working its way through a difficult
period,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, said he saw no such direct
connection between stock market conditions and presidential
popularity. ``Historically, there is very little relationship
between stock market gyrations on the one hand and people's
evaluations of the economy on the other,'' he said. They pay more
attention, he said, to matters like unemployment, inflation and
incomes, all of which are still reassuring.''
</P>
<P>
   But Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, said: ``The weakness of
the stock market will soon be tied into attitudes toward him. He
will shoulder some of the blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Luntz said that, in a survey he conducted last week, 54 percent
of likely voters this November said that they owned stocks or
mutual funds of some kind. He said that the poll had a margin of
error of plus of minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Cook, an independent political analyst who is a close
observer of Congress, said he could not predict what effect the
drop in the market would have. But he said that, combined with the
possibility of more damaging information emerging from the inquiry
into Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, the stock market
performance did not bode well for the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was absolutely certain a week ago that Clinton was going to
survive this thing, and that the impact on the elections wasn't
going to be that great,'' he said. ``And now I'm like totally
shaken.''

   WASHINGTON _ With only five weeks left on the legislative
calendar, Capitol Hill is girding for a chaotic if unproductive
end-of-session dominated by Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has until Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year, to
pass 13 spending bills to keep the government running. Some of the
major issues that Congress must resolve with President Clinton
include: whether to replenish the reserves of the International
Monetary Fund, how to count citizens for the census in 2000 and how
to find money in a balanced budget to pay for emergencies, like
better security at U.S. embassies in light of the recent bombings
in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators started trickling back into Washington on Monday,
while the House reconvenes after Labor Day. Clinton left for Russia
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A report on the president's conduct from Whitewater independent
counsel Kenneth Starr is expected to arrive on Capitol Hill
sometime in September _ and then engulf the Congress. This is
expected to make the task of legislating, already difficult for
this half of the 105th Congress, even more unlikely. Given up for
dead some time ago were big-ticket items concerning health care,
tobacco and campaign financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Congress will be known as the Monica Lewinsky scandal
Congress,'' said Thomas Mann, an expert on Congress at the
Brookings Institution, referring to the White House intern with
whom Clinton has admitted an inappropriate relationship. ``The
prospects were never bright anyway for anything but the must-pass
money bills. Now, I don't see anything else emerging.''
</P>
<P>
   Just Monday, at his opening news conference for the final
legislative lap, Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader,
delivered a stinging rebuke of the president, saying Clinton had
behaved in a ``disgusting'' manner, set a ``tragic example'' for
young people and forfeited his credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a husband and a father,'' Lott said, ``I am offended by the
president's behavior. There is a moral dimension to the American
presidency, and today that dimension, that power, has been lost in
scandal and in deception.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he was volunteering his views on the president's
situation because it was making voters nervous and drowning out
discussion of matters that Congress must resolve before it
adjourns.
</P>
<P>
   As lawmakers approach the homestretch, both parties appear to be
on a pragmatic course. The Republicans, brimming with optimism,
want to wrap up the spending bills to keep the spotlight on the
president's woes. The Democrats, who generally support the
president's posture on the spending bills, are afraid of being
pulled down by the president's personal problems and for that
reason want to wrap up the session quickly and go home.
</P>
<P>
   Mann predicted that Clinton would stick to his veto threats,
exercising his institutional authority even if he lacked personal
authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll have to veto those bills where the Democrats are united
behind him, and the Republicans understand that,'' Mann said. ``The
politics of this argues for the Republicans to make the closing
weeks as legislatively uneventful as possible to keep the public
focused on the Starr report.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Republicans are preparing to take advantage of the
president's apparently weakened condition to push through some of
their pet projects. Lott plans to bring up a bill this week to
limit the ability of consumers to file for bankruptcy. The measure
is favored by the credit-card industry and banks. He also plans to
bring up a bill to build a Star Wars missile-defense system
immediately, a measure favored by conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the balance is a tax cut eagerly sought by Republicans.
House conservatives, who are perceived by all sides as the biggest
hurdle to an amicable resolution of the spending bills, are sending
signals that if the leaders in both houses and the White House
agree to a tax cut of more than $100 billion over five years, the
conservatives could compromise more easily on other matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people say we'll have a tax cut,'' said Rep. David
McIntosh, R-Ind., leader of a band of conservative House members,
``you'll see us be much more cooperative on other issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives have attached a number of social issues to various
spending bills, promoting their views against abortion, homosexual
rights, family planning and environmental controls. But these are
unlikely to pass the Senate and are not expected to snag te final
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican aide said, ``We're not standing on the Capitol
dome with a bloody shirt saying, `Shut down the government!'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   So far, the two houses have not sent a single appropriations
bill to the White House, although on Tuesday the Senate is set to
finalize and send to the president a military construction bill
that has not been contentious. Shortly thereafter the Senate
expects to take up the foreign operations bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has already threatened to veto seven
of the 13 bills, although such threats are routine at this stage of
the typically drawn-out negotiation process that consumes Congress
every year over spending. The president himself has vowed to veto
only one bill, the one financing the departments of Labor,
Education and Health and Human Services. He objects to the
Republicans' proposed cuts in money for home heating fuel for
low-income families, summer jobs for disadvantaged youths and
various education initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the administration is seeking to portray itself as fully
engaged on the spending bills, the president's previously announced
agenda _ on child care, new school construction and hiring 100,000
new teachers _ lies dormant. The president's proposed budget relied
on revenue from a tobacco bill that never materialized, and he has
not proposed other ways to pay for his initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials insist that the continuing disclosures
about the president's personal life have not altered their stance
on the spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've put a very clear set of concerns out there, and we're
sticking to them,'' said Jack Lew, director of the Office of
Management and Budget, which tracks the spending bills for the
president. ``From conversations I've had with Democrats and
Republicans, the expectation is that we'll all get back

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gloom, fear, pain and queasiness. Across the nation,
the anxieties ran high on Monday as investors big and small watched
the jagged lines fall and much of the year's profits evaporate in a
breathtaking 512-point plunge on Wall Street. Many called it scary,
but almost no one seemed ready to panic.
</P>
<P>
   The day's paper losses were heavy. But conditioned by years of
bull-market bravado and still confident in the fundamental
soundness of America's economy, most investors interviewed in New
York, Atlanta, Boston, Denver, Los Angeles, Miami, Seattle and
elsewhere voiced expectations that the market would bounce back and
said they had no intention of getting out, not yet anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thrilled,'' Germaine Meilach, 61, a Manhattan
investor, said, as she sipped a drink at a sidewalk cafe after the
market's cascading close. ``But I still feel things are good. I
don't see a reason to panic. You can't have 28 percent earnings all
the time. I think people would be foolish to get out. We have to be
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, Peter Hurley, a city planner, agreed, though he lost
10 percent of his net worth on Monday. ``It's disturbing, to put it
mildly,'' he said. ``But I'm taking the long view of it. The
fundamentals are no different from a few weeks ago, but obviously
the psychology is very different. We tend to think we're so damn
logical, but we're still driven by fear and desire.''
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Burdie Henry, who has stocks and mutual funds,
sounded like a Wall Street pro. ``I'm going to ride it out,'' she
said. ``I'm concerned, but I understand that if you're going to
invest in the stock market you can't panic at certain things. I
think you have to have a certain temperament, and if you panic with
every change you probably shouldn't be in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Stamford, Conn., Josephine C. McArthur, 52, the president
of an after-school enrichment center for children, said she plans
to hang tough in a market that has been good to her in recent
years. ``It's like childbirth,'' she said. ``It's not easy when
you're going through it, but after the pains your whole life is
better. The party's not over for me.''
</P>
<P>
   No one seemed oracular. There were brokerage-house jokes about
looking for tall buildings or jumping out first-floor windows. One
investor called himself a cautious bull. Many spoke of Monday's
plunge _ the second-highest point drop in market history _ as a
correction that had long been expected.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe some investors were whistling past the graveyard, but many
said they had sound reasons for staying in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at just the fundamental of the market place,
nothing has changed,'' Kelly Keydel, an independent financial
planner in Seattle, said. ``There's low inflation, low interest
rates, a very strong economy and unemployment is low. Nothing has
changed. People are nervous, but they need to stay the course.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug MacLennan, 28, a Merril Lynch employee, echoed the opinion
of many, saying he was in for the long haul and would only lose
money if he sold out now. ``It's terrible, but I'm a long term
investor and I'm going to wait it out. I try not to look at the
daily highs and lows. It's too depressing. But I don't want to get
out of the market because I'll realize all my losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Others justified what happened on Monday by noting that the
market was overheated and due for an adjustment anyway, and that
they were way ahead over the years and could afford to take some
losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't surprising,'' Brian Sheaer-Kearney, a 41-year-old
Nebraska man who was passing through the Minneapolis airport, said
of the market plunge. ``I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner. The
stock market had no reason to be doing as well as it was. Most of
the country is pretty strong.'' As for the market, he added:
``Eventually it will turn around.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the investors said the market's fall necessarily
foreshadowed a recession, or even a deeper plunge. And a few said
that they would soon be looking for buying opportunities in the
depressed market.

UNION PACIFIC TO LIMIT TRAFFIC ON TRACKS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALLEN R. MYERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Union Pacific Corp., still recovering from some of
the worst congestion in the industry's history, announced a plan on
Monday to improve and, in some cases, ration its service.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the railroad makes extensive investments for expansion,
executives acknowledged that the company would not be able to
reliably, or profitably, accommodate all who want to use its
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Richard K. Davidson, the railroad's chairman, stressed his
primary goal was to recover the 10 percent of its traffic lost in
the last year _ not chase customers away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rationing the business really isn't the main underpinning of
what we're getting at here,'' he said in an interview. ``It's how
can we best satisfy our customers and maximize the potential for
revenue growth.''
</P>
<P>
   But Union Pacific is beginning to study what sorts of traffic
might be dispensable, or whether to charge more for shipments
through crowded corridors at peak seasons, just as airlines would
charge the most for a last-minute seat before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad plans to organize a new department to make sure its
eager marketers do not sign up business and make commitments train
operators cannot reliably fulfill. ``It's a more educated approach
than we've ever taken before,'' Davidson said. ``In the old days,
when the marketing guys brought business in, whichever wheel
squeaked the loudest would get attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The tie-ups were chiefly a result of Union Pacific's
difficulties in absorbing the Southern Pacific Transportation
Corp., which it bought for $5.4 billion in 1996 to form the
nation's largest railroad. Having then tried to centralize its vast
system at an Omaha command center, the railroad recently reversed
itself and began farming some operations back out to the regions,
appointing three regional vice presidents.
</P>
<P>
   As Union Pacific heads into its own busiest season, with fall
grain harvests and Christmas merchandise shipments, the congestion
is only gradually easing. Improvements in Texas and elsewhere have
raised average speeds throughout the 36,000-mile system to 15 miles
an hour, from less than 12 in December, the company reported on
Monday. But continued delays with shipments of chemicals, lumber,
agricultural feed and other products in California are keeping
speeds below the railroad's 18 or 19 mile-per-hour standard.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of cutbacks in the industry, Union Pacific is bent
on expanding along with the economy as the amount of cargo grows.
The company is adding about 550 locomotives over two years to a
fleet now at 7,200, and building additional lines through crowded
corridors in states like Nebraska. It has agreed to buy back a line
in Kansas it sold and maintain a mountainous route in Colorado it
was planning to abandon.
</P>
<P>
   But, as railroad executives like to say, you cannot build the
church for Easter. ``We've certainly learned the hard way that the
days of seemingly unlimited capacity are behind us, and before we
sign a contract we'd better be careful,'' said John Bromley, a
company spokesman. ``That's a sea change in our thinking. We can't
be all things to all people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Rastatter, a policy director for the National Industrial
Transportation League, said some well-planned rationing might be
preferable to the unplanned rationing that resulted from the
railroad's congestion. Noting that he had not seen the Union
Pacific announcement, he expressed doubts about whether all
customers would benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seems like a way of leaving out the little guy to make
sure the big guy gets better service,'' he said. Davidson, however,
said his railroad planned to carry additional smaller shipments as
well, adding that chemical companies would continue to be major
elements of his company's business.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Speight, the Chemical Manufacturers Association
distribution manager, said that Union Pacific had already unsnarled
its traffic around Houston, an industry hub. But with tie-ups
elsewhere on the rail system, he said: ``It's like squeezing a
water balloon. The danger is that it's going to flood back to the
original problem area.''
</P>
<P>
   The Surface Transportation Board, criticized by many shippers
for approving the Southern Pacific acquisition, lifted an emergency
order in July that had required Union Pacific to share its Texas
tracks with competitors. A board spokesman said on Monday that
nobody there would have a comment on the company's latest plans.

TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY ASKS TO MEET WITH NORTHWEST AND STRIKING
PILOTS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ At the request of President Clinton,
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater on Monday asked officials of
Northwest Airlines and its striking pilots union to meet with him
in Washington on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has the power to order the pilots back to work for a
60-day cooling-off period, but the chief federal mediator, who is
responsible for recommending such action, said she did not think
such an order would be a good idea now.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Northwest canceled all its flights on Wednesday and
some international flights on Thursday as the strike by its 6,173
pilots went into its third day with no movement by either side.
</P>
<P>
   No negotiations were scheduled, as both sides stuck to their
final stances before the walkout.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called on both sides to ``redouble their efforts to
resolve their differences,'' but said, ``it is up to the
negotiating parties to reach an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Northwest said its chief executive, John Dasburg, planned to
meet with Slater. A spokesman for the union, the Air Line Pilots
Association, said the union's president, J. Randolph Babbitt, also
would attend.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department emphasized that the meeting was
not a resumption of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary has called Babbitt and Dasburg to meet with him
to explain why the negotiations are not going on right now when
both sides have said they want to talk,'' said an official who
insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Slater, who met on Monday with Erskine Bowles, the White House
chief of staff, is being careful not to press the two sides too
hard to return to the table because Magdalena Jacobsen, the federal
mediator who has been supervising the talks, believes that further
negotiations when neither side is willing to compromise would be
counterproductive, and might even prolong a strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the point of pulling people together if there is
nothing to talk about?'' Ms. Jacobsen, who is chairwoman of the
National Mediation Board, a federal agency that oversees labor
matters in the airline and rail industries, said in an interview on
Monday. A meeting now could relieve some of the pressure on both
sides without advancing the negotiations, she said, and it could
also anger workers at the airline by raising false hopes of a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, criticized
Clinton on Monday for not intervening, saying that the strike had
already caused serious economic damage. The president has the power
to order the pilots back to work while an emergency board tries to
resolve the strike. Clinton used that power last year, when pilots
walked out at American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Jacobsen, who is responsible for making the
recommendation of intervention to the White House, said she did not
think it was a good idea now because the pilots could simply reject
the emergency board's proposal and walk out again in two months, on
the eve of the Thanksgiving holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are interested in is a resolution that translates into
a contract,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest said on Monday that as the strike continues it would
cancel flights 48 hours in advance. The carrier is still hoping
that the White House will order the pilots back to work before the
busy Labor Day weekend, so it does not want to cancel flights too
far ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   Disruption from the strike, which was anticipated for more than
a month before the pilots walked out early Saturday, was lighter
than expected over the weekend, but it became more serious on
Monday as business travelers faced their first day without the
airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are facing a much bigger challenge rebooking our
passengers,'' a Northwest spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The airline, which is the country's fourth largest carrier,
reiterated its negotiating stance in a teleconference with Wall
Street analysts on Monday. It said that it was willing to pay its
pilots as much as their counterparts at Northwest's three larger
competitors _ United Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Airlines
_ but that the pilots' demand for an ``industry-leading'' contract
would cost too much and would compel Northwest to give equally
generous increases to five other unions that are negotiating
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest is offering a 9 percent raise over four years, a lump
sum of $57 million, the reduction of a two-tier pay scale to three
years from five years, and profit-sharing.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots say the package will still pay them less than what
pilots receive at the other airlines. They want a 15.5 percent pay
increase over three years, a lump sum of $86 million, elimination
of the two-tier wage structure and greater job security
</P>
<P>
   The pilots say the difference between the two sides amounts to
$70 million a year, but the airline told analysts that it believed
the number was closer to $170 million

LEADER'S LOSS IN PANAMA CLOUDS FUTURE OF CANAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ Politics here have been thrown into a
free-for-all after Panamanians crushed President Ernesto Perez
Balladares' hopes for a second term by a resounding margin of
nearly 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Voters defeated a proposal that would have amended the
constitution to allow him to serve five more years and thereby
control the Panama Canal when the United States relinquishes the
waterway at the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   According to complete unofficial results tabulated early on
Monday, 64 percent of the 1.1 million voters on Sunday rejected the
change. The defeat was larger than any poll had predicted. Perez
Balladares, once a member of the inner circle of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, said he regretted the results and promised ``a
pure and honest election'' on May 2.
</P>
<P>
   With the incumbent out of the picture, a scramble for nomination
of the ruling party is certain, and a larger number of opposition
leaders may also be tempted to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new scenario and and new political reality,'' said Jose
Blandon, a former confidant of Noriega who is a political
commentator on television. ``That will require a change of
strategy'' for the ruling Democratic Revolutionary Party and the
eight main opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   Noriega, the former dictator who was convicted in 1992 on eight
counts of drug trafficking, racketeering and money laundering, is
serving a 40-year federal sentence in the United States. He is
appealing the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The election in May is important to Washington because the new
government is to take possession of the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Perez Balladares has already appointed most of the board that
will run the waterway. But important decisions remain to be made on
expanding the canal and using real estate, worth more than $3.5
billion, that the United States is handing over.
</P>
<P>
   In the ruling party most of the alternatives to Perez Balladares
are from the American point of view unappetizing.
</P>
<P>
   The party president and the majority leader in the legislature,
Gerardo Gonzalez, is virulently anti-American. His son was
acquitted last year on charges of murdering an American soldier
here after a trial that the U.S. Embassy characterized as unfair,
in part because of the father's interference.
</P>
<P>
   Two other possibilities mentioned frequently on Monday are
Housing Minister Francisco Sanchez Cardenas and Labor Minister
Mitchell Doens. But the United States has recently barred both men
from receiving visas, American officials said, because of their
activities under the Noriega dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, however, appears just as divided as it was in
1994, when their failure to unite behind a single candidate allowed
Perez Balladares to squeak through to victory with barely one-third
of the vote. Despite pleas for unity on Monday by Mireya Moscoso de
Gruber, leader of the Partido Arnulfista and apparently the
front-runner for the opposition, six other possible candidacies
were discussed on radio and television.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian political analysts said Perez Balladares' crushing
defeat would make it more difficult for the United States and
Panama to reach an agreement permitting American troops to remain
here after the canal transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Over the objections of many in his party, the president
announced an accord nine months ago that would have allowed 2,000
American soldiers to stay on as part of a regional antinarcotics
center.
</P>
<P>
   But he almost immediately reversed himself.
</P>
<P>
   American officials were furious at what they saw as a breach of
promise, and negotiations have stagnated, in part because of
uncertainty about the political outlook. The Americans retain some
interest in the troop proposal, but Perez Balladares may be
hampered by his status as a lame duck.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the marked diminution of influence that comes with this
resounding defeat, it is going to be extremely difficult for him to
resuscitate the drug-center proposal,'' Ricardo Arias Calderon, a
leader of the opposition Christian Democratic Party and a former
vice president, said. ``If he had won he would have tried. But not
in this environment.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Start spreading the news: Pete Sampras is feeling
historic, Martina Hingis is feeling acquisitive and Goran
Ivanisevic is feeling like the turbo-charged hardcourts at the U.S.
Open are delivering his aces almost faster than he can send them
across the net.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to the U.S. Open, which cranked itself up to full speed
Monday at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, Queens,
to cut through the late summer haze and cut right to the chase. The
top-ranked Sampras, now just six victories from a record-tying 12th
Grand Slam title, and the top-ranked Hingis both zipped through
their opening-day assignments in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
   And Ivanisevic was feeling invincible, at least for a New York
moment, in the same city where he had been paralyzed by first-round
ineptitude in three of his last four visits.
</P>
<P>
   Those who could handle the pace advanced; those who let jitters,
or the invisible flu bug that has been circulating through the
men's and women's locker rooms, undermine their energy level fell
by the wayside early. Justin Gimelstob of New Jersey and Andrew
Ilie of Australia, who are both subject to temper tantrums, were
downed by tempestuous cramps and defaulted. So was German qualifier
Alex Radulescu, who pointed miserably to his stomach as he went to
the net to concede prematurely to 575th-ranked Taylor Dent, the
17-year-old wild card who is the youngest man in the event.
</P>
<P>
   After getting through his first match unscathed, Sampras, who
gained his 11th Grand Slam title by downing Ivanisevic in the
Wimbledon final in July, could afford to be sympathetic to those
who did not handle the Open's opening day pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understand that this Slam, compared to all the rest, I think,
is the most hectic,'' said Sampras, a four-time Open champion,
after his untaxing 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 victory over Marc-Kevin Goellner
kept him on the road to tying Roy Emerson's record of 12 Grand Slam
singles titles. ``You walk out at Wimbledon, you feel kind of the
charm of the place. Here at Flushing, you just kind of feel a
certain electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of hoopla when you play here in New York, and this
one certainly is difficult to win, but I've been playing here
enough to kind of figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, whose precocity is unquestioned, figured the place out
at the age of 17, when she won the third of her 1997 Grand Slam
crowns by outwitting Venus Williams in the final at the brand-new
Arthur Ashe Stadium. On Monday, Hingis, who is making a title
defense here a priority after stalling in the semifinals at the
French Open and Wimbledon, was back inside the stadium, and back to
her old supremely confident self after trampling Aleksandra Olsza
of Poland, 6-2, 6-0, in just under an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely not as confident as I was last year, but this
year wasn't as bad as sometimes I hear on TV, that Martina Hingis
was so beatable,'' protested Hingis, whose last title was at the
Italian Open in May. ``Well, not by everybody, I wouldn't lose
against a nobody. Once you keep losing, one day you get sick of it,
so I am kind of moving up again. So far I haven't lost against
anybody who wasn't top 10, so it's OK.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hingis, who will face unseeded Iva Majoli, the 1997 French Open
champion, in the second round, denied that she had lost her
appetite for winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the Grand Slams, I won the first one, and this
one is still open,'' Hingis said. ``It's the last one of the year,
so you're going to put all your energy into this tournament. I'm
very positive, and I'm in a good mood now.'' She described herself
as the ``black horse'' last year, who sneaked up on the rest of the
field and ``won almost everything I played.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic, who won almost nothing he played this year until he
rediscovered his serving prowess at Wimbledon, left that tournament
a broken man after failing, for the second time in his career, to
get the better of Sampras in a Wimbledon final. He said he felt
like killing himself, but instead he took a boating vacation,
showed up in the United States on schedule for his summer campaign
and reached the final at New Haven, Conn., before his serving arm
went haywire again. But the arm and the man were back in form
Monday. With 23 aces, the Croatian Ivanisevic found safe mooring in
the second round after an acrimonious 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 defeat of
32-year-old Mark Woodforde of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Miffed that Woodforde, who had previously characterized the
14th-seeded Ivanisevic as a one trick pony with a big serve and
little else, failed to apologize after smacking him with a ball,
Ivanisevic later praised his own serve and denigrated his
opponent's entire game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my serve is there, then anything else I want to hit is
going in,'' he said. ``The way his game is, man, I think it's time
for him to retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to emulate the example her older sister Venus set here
last year, 20th-ranked Serena Williams made a successful Open debut
despite being hobbled by a sore right hamstring midway through her
6-3, 3-6, 6-4 defeat of 94th-ranked Nicole Pratt of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old Williams squandered a pair of match points with
a wildly careering volley and a net-bound backhand before breaking
Pratt for her first Open victory. She later called it ``a case of
classic nerves.'' Made aware that her father and coach, Richard,
who was attending his first Grand Slam event with his daughters,
had attracted attention by exiting the Louis Armstrong Stadium in
the second set, Serena Williams played down the effect.

   ``Well, my dad always said negative attention is better than no
attention, so long as the truth lives inside of us,'' she said.
``If I was in the crowd and saw someone playing the way I was
playing, I would have left, too; I don't think I played that
well.''

   MATCH POINTS:
</P>
<P>
   The day session proved disastrous for just one seeded player,
15th-seeded Alberto Berasategui of Spain, who ran out of resilience
after the first set's tie breaker against Thomas Muster of Austria
and wound up wilting, 7-6 (7-1), 6-2, 6-3. ``I cannot really say
I'm afraid going out against anyone,'' said the 30-year-old,
30th-ranked Muster, who terrorized all comers back in 1995 when he
won the French Open but has never passed the U.S. Open's
quarterfinal round. ... Justin Gimelstob, who said he had been
diagnosed with anemia, was leading his match with Wayne Black 6-3,
5-7, 3-2 when he was overcome by cramps and had to default. ``I
just started locking up everywhere,'' he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The recent volatility in stock prices is likely to
slow this year's flurry of mergers and acquisitions, analysts said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers say that many executives have put plans for deals on
hold until they understand what long-term impact the correction
will have on their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``In situations where companies are considering deals, they now
have a wait-and-see attitude,'' said Scott Lindsay, co-head of
mergers and acquisitions at Credit Suisse First Boston. ``But I
don't see where anyone is slitting their wrists.''
</P>
<P>
   Most executives today, unlike those during the crash of October
1987, are not troubled by the economy here at home. ``There is not
the same doom and gloom,'' said Gregg Polle, co-head of mergers and
acquisitions at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Instead companies with exposure to Asia and Russia _ like
financial institutions _ or those that are heavily dependent on
exports for earnings, are perceived to be at the most risk in the
near future and a risky partner for a potential merger.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, merger activity among high-technology companies
could fall off sharply as a direct result of the market decline.
Internet stock prices, in particular, were in a free fall on
Monday, making it difficult for bankers and executives alike to
figure out what price an acquired company should command.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a chilling effect,'' said Gene Sykes, co-head
of the high-technology group at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``Some deals
won't get done for two weeks, maybe a month. No one really knows.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Wall Street watchers are cautious about the future,
there is little concern that deals already struck this year will
unravel. A market downturn itself is not enough to halt a
transaction, especially in stock-for-stock deals where the prices
of both company's stock have fallen in tandem.
</P>
<P>
   The real deal-killers will be companies that either miss
earnings or run into trouble abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the market has been rife the last two weeks with rumors
about what deal will be the next to be scrapped or renegotiated,
like the recent renegotiation of the merger between Tellabs and
Ciena. Early last week, for instance, rumors cropped up that the
Travelers Group and Citicorp merger was being renegotiated,
something company executives said was untrue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no truth to the rumors of any renegotiation of the
terms of the Travelers Group and Citicorp merger,'' said John
Morris, a spokesman for Citicorp. ``The only thing we are waiting
on is Federal Reserve approval.''
</P>
<P>
   And several companies have publicly reaffirmed their commitment
to a merger despite the tumultuous market. For example, executives
of the General Re Corp. said on Monday that they expected their
merger with Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to proceed. &QL;

   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ George McBay never saw it coming. The
51-year-old industrial roofer said he was six-stories high, helping
lower a large metal pipe down to a worker on the ground below when
he heard a large, ``explosion-like'' boom and felt ``like I had
just been through a B-52 bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like everything in my body just blew out the top of my
head,'' said McBay, a Vietnam veteran. ``When I came to I was in
the fetal position 15 feet away from where I had been standing.''
</P>
<P>
   McBay of Gulfport was struck by lightning, as far-fetched a
phenomenon as winning the lottery for most but a real risk in
Florida, which leads the nation in deaths and injuries from
lightning strikes. Situated between two warm bodies of water, the
Florida peninsula has high humidity and better conditions for
thunderstorms than other parts of the country, weather experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning is so common in the rainy months between May and
October that it routinely delays sports events, sets wildfires and
has prompted cities, schools and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration to invest in lightning detection systems that can
warn of approaching strikes to protect both life and space shuttle
launchings. Still, the National Weather Service said, at least
eight people died last year and 55 others were injured in Florida
from lightning, a conservative number that does not reflect
unreported incidents and that represents about 10 percent of
casualties nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Victims are caught mostly outdoors _ playing golf, having
picnics, boating _ but also indoors talking on the telephone, using
the computer, even sitting on the toilet, National Weather Service
officials say, because an electric charge can travel through
telephone wires, electrical connections and metal pipes. Some are
knocked unconscious, others have vivid recollections of the moment
they were struck.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-year-old visitor from Georgia who was struck at a Fourth of
July outing at Lake Okeechobee two years ago told reporters it felt
``like a bunch of ants running around inside my body, biting me.''
</P>
<P>
   Patty Schmitt, 42, of Rockledge, was struck while working on the
computer in a windowless room. ``I felt it move up my arm,'' she
remembered. ``To me, it felt like adrenaline, but stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   When a lightning bolt hit near a fire truck in St. Petersburg
last June, Lt. Steve Hay, 37, who had just finished putting out a
bedroom fire unscathed, got third-degree burns on both big toes,
his right arm and back. He said the bolt had hit a tree, bounced
off to him and then to his fire engine. The bolt melted the metal
portable radio he carried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt an incredible pulsing, a burning sensation from head to
toe,'' he said, adding he also lost his sight for about 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, many survivors say they are never the same.
Although seemingly fine at first, within months many say they have
discovered all kinds of physical and emotional afflictions, like
seizures, forgetfulness, chronic pain, headaches and sexual
dysfunction, that often cause the loss of jobs and relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred survivors have banded together for support in a
group called Lightning Strike and Electric Shock Survivors
International, based in North Carolina. Some, like McBay, travel
long distances to get treatment from the few doctors who see enough
lightning strike patients to be familiar with their conditions. One
such physician is Dr. Hooshang Hooshmand of Neurological
Associates, a clinic in this small city on Florida's east coast
south of Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best day that I've had since the accident isn't as good as
the worst day I had before the accident,'' said McBay, who was
struck in 1993. ``You get lost. Blackouts. Seizures. A good day is
lying on the couch.''
</P>
<P>
   But other lightning victims have reported no permanent or
identifiable damage, and some say they feel like they received a
new lease on life. Betty Galvano, 63, of Fort Myers, was standing
in her son's kitchen cutting up broccoli with a window open when
lightning struck her right foot and knocked her down. She said the
electric current traveled up the leg to a steel bar doctors had
implanted a year earlier after she broke her right hip in a fall.
In a more surprising event than the bolt that had just hit her, she
said, she groggily stood up and realized the bad leg she dragged
``like a sandbag'' had completely healed.
</P>
<P>
   She said her doctors ``all laughed and didn't know what to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lightning was a spiritual experience for me,'' she said. ``It
energized me, it made me feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say people struck by lightning get a jolt of many
millions of volts, far worse than the electric chair, but only for
a fraction of a second. The extent of injury depends on variables
like degree of exposure (whether they are struck directly or from a
flash off the first object that absorbed the bolt, for instance)
the point of contact and how the current passes through the body,
they say.
</P>
<P>
   Those who die usually suffer cardiac arrest.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason they die, usually, is because the electrical
current goes through the heart and the heart stops beating,'' said
Dr. Russell Vega, associate medical examiner for Hillsborough
County in Tampa, one of the most active lightning areas in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Most lightning victims survive. Dr. Andrew Alexander, an
emergency room doctor at Tampa General Hospital who says the
facility treats about two lightning victims a month, says the
patients can have burns at the point of entry and exit, damaged
eardrums, numbness and tingling in legs, and sometimes trauma like
broken bones from being thrown feet away. Most of his patients
however, walk away without a hospital stay but ``probably with a
new approach in life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hooshmand, a neurologist who specializes in electrical
injuries and sees about 300 patients a year, said that for many
people struck by lightning, the worst could come many months later.
</P>
<P>
   At his clinic here he says he treats conditions that range from
loss of memory and judgment to stomach bleeding and diarrhea that
come from brain injury and other organ damage caused by an electric
current. Some patients can recover completely, he said, but many of
his lightning patients struggle day to day, taking
anti-convulsants, anti-depressants and heart and blood-pressure
medicine, to restore some normalcy to their lives. Some have
stopped working and even driving.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, many people do not seem to fear lightning as a killer or
danger that causes more deaths each year than most weather-related
hazards or seem to know what to do to protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   While lightning hits at random, tall objects on open areas are
more vulnerable to strikes. Yet, the first thing many do is run to
trees for cover. Experts advise to seek shelter indoors or inside a
car with windows closed, avoid contact with metal, water and
surfaces that conduct electricity. That means getting out of boats,
avoiding corded telephones and electrical appliances and staying
away from the shower, toilet and kitchen sink.
</P>
<P>
   If unable to find cover, the experts say, crouch, making only
minimal contact with the ground, and choose a location away from
the highest object in the area.
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove conventional wisdom wrong, the survivors' support
organization in North Carolina points out that some of its members
have been struck by lightning twice. Andy Upshaw, a landscaper and
nurseryman in North Carolina, claims to have been hit three times
by lightning flashes: while he was getting out of a swimming pool,
on a porch and while spraying water with a garden hose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like shock treatment,'' Upshaw said. ``It makes you
appreciate life.''
</P>
<P>
   While many survivors say they have become more cautious, Upshaw
said that in his line of work he must spend a lot of time outside.
When there is a storm, he said, it is his wife who usually stands
on alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife,'' he said, ``reminds me of my luck and tells me to
get into the house.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the stock market, the sky is falling _ again.
</P>
<P>
   Share prices are plunging, gurus are opining, and rattled
investors are biting their nails. Just as they did after similar
Mondays in October 1997, July 1996 and, yes, October 1987, the day
that Wall Street still calls Black Monday.
</P>
<P>
   When the bottom finally fell out of the stock market on Oct. 19,
1987, though, more than one fifth of the market's value was wiped
out in a single day. This year, by contrast, most of the major
market indexes _ including the Dow Jones industrial average of 30
blue-chip stocks _ have not yet lost that much from their peaks in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, investors can only hope that this Monday is another
case of deja vu _ because that would mean the worst is over. After
all of those historic blue Mondays, the stock market recovered, in
some cases very quickly. In 1996 and 1997, stocks regained their
previous peaks within a matter of months.
</P>
<P>
   It took almost two years for investors to recover their losses
from the Crash of 1987, but recover they did _ and then some. Hard
as it may be to remember, back then the Dow Jones industrial
average fell to 1,738; even after Monday's carnage, the Dow still
stood at 7,539 _ a 333 percent gain from the bottom nearly 11 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Okay, that is over a period of more than a decade, which is far
longer than a lot of Americans have been investing. At the end of
1986, for example, fewer than 30 million shareholders had
mutual-fund accounts; today, there are more than 135 million mutual
fund accounts, according to the fund industry's trade group, the
Investment Company Institute.
</P>
<P>
   For those who missed the ugliness at the end of the 1980s, here
are some of the similarities _ and the differences _ between those
bad old days and today.
</P>
<P>
   SIZE: Monday's decline, though bigger than 1987's one-day drop
in terms of points on the Dow, pales on a percentage basis. Back
then, a 508 point drop was a sickening 22.6 percent plunge; the
recent 513 point fall amounts to only 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   SPEED: Though many investors remember only the awful excitement
of that October Monday now more than a decade in the past, in fact
the market had started to fall apart long before the final plunge.
Back in 1987, the market peaked in August, and took two months to
fall 36 percent. This year, the market peaked in July, and took six
weeks to fall 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   BREADTH: This is Wall Street jargon for how strong the market
is, based on the number of stocks that are rising versus the number
that are falling.
</P>
<P>
   When breadth is good, the generals and the troops are all
marching in the same direction, said James B. Stack of Investech, a
newsletter and research firm in Whitefish, Mont. When breadth is
bad, the generals are still marching forward, but the troops are in
retreat.

   A New York Times News Service article sent on Sunday, August 30,

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Waves of selling by investors large and small
engulfed the stock market Monday.
</P>
<P>
   They erased the last of the market's gains this year and sent
stock prices down more than 19 percent from their peak just six
weeks ago, the sharpest decline in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzied selling dashed the hopes of investors who had
expected the stock market's recent slump, which began with worries
over economic conditions in Asia and accelerated as financial
troubles ensnared Russia, to be stayed by the fundamental strength
of the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 512.61 points, or 6.4
percent, to 7539.07, leaving the bellwether index 4.7 percent below
where it started the year. The decline was the second largest in
the index's history in point terms, trailing the 554-point drop on
Oct. 27, but did not rank in the top 20 when measured in percent.
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, a broader measure of the market,
fell more than 69 points, or nearly 7 percent, to 958.53, down 1.3
percent since the beginning of 1998. The declines were the greatest
among technology stocks, which until recently have been the market
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The cumulative effect of the last few weeks is nearly as great
as the one-day market plunge in October 1987, when stock prices
fell 22.6 percent. But a market rebound soon followed and the
national economy did not stray into recession.
</P>
<P>
   While there were few signs Monday of panic among individual
investors, market participants said that heavy selling by mutual
fund companies, responding to withdrawals by individual investors
that began over the weekend, played a significant role in Monday's
decline, including the stampede that sent the Dow average down 250
points in the last half hour of trading alone.
</P>
<P>
   The selloff in stocks accompanied a big rally in the bond
market, where everyone seemed to be seeking shelter in securities
that are backed by the American government. As its price rose with
demand, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to a record low
of 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and financial analysts said the market rout is almost
certain to put intense pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower
short-term interest rates. For more than a week, the rates on some
short-term securities have been higher than on some long-term
bonds, a situation that is a classic precursor to a recession.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Monday that
the economy remains sound, although he acknowledged that ``the
world is currently working its way through a difficult period.''
Rubin and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who is on
vacation in California but who was in touch with Rubin Monday, are
scheduled to meet on Friday with Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa in California.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause of the financial difficulties that have
plagued Asia and Russia over the last year, economists say, the
stock market's recent activity indicates that those troubles have
begun to wash up on America's shores.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in a long time where the future of the
American economy hinges so much on what happens to American stock
prices,'' said Henry Kaufman, a New York economist. ``Consumers
have much more than usual invested in stocks, and it has influenced
their spending. That has benefited businesses enormously.'' With
the decline in stock prices, he said, ``we could begin to see the
reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested the situation calls for a government response. ``We
are having a global financial problem,'' Kaufman added, ``and it is
a problem that cannot go away quickly. If there are further
declines in the equity market, there should be an orchestrated
reduction in interest rates by the major industrial countries,''
including the United States, Germany, England, France, Italy and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the market decline and the lurking economic threats
seem to have sunk in with individual investors, who have been the
stalwart supporters of the bull market in stocks for the last few
years. Mutual fund companies, including Fidelity Investments, the
country's largest fund company, reported withdrawals from stock
funds over the weekend and Monday, with most of those investors
moving into money market or bond funds.

 &HT;    Stock market turns brutal; no end in sight
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock market got its biggest bear hug in eight years Monday.
The selling frenzy that sent market averages to some of their worst
losses ever.
</P>
<P>
   Some strategists believe there's a 50-50 chance the market could
post a modest rally today as traders hunt for bargain-priced
stocks. But nobody is ready to say the sell-off that started in
July has run its course.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark Dow Jones average of 30 blue-chip stocks plunged
512.61 points, or 6.4 percent, to 7,539.07, second only to the
stock market crash of Oct. 19, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's loss, estimated at more than $364 billion worth, more
than wiped out all of the Dow's gains in 1998, leaving it down 4.7
percent for the year and just over 19 percent from its all-time
high reached July 17. The drop from the record is only a fraction
shy of the loss that's normally defined as a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's biggest point loss occurred on Oct. 27, 1997, when it
fell 554 points as Asia's economic crisis reverberated around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The bloodbath in technology and smaller stocks was even worse on
Monday. The Nasdaq composite index fell 140.43 points, or 8.6
percent, that index' worst one-day point loss ever, exceeding the
loss of 115 points, also on Oct. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts blame a growing confluence of problems in Asia, Russia
and Latin America for triggering the sell-off and creating fear and
even panic among traders and investors.
</P>
<P>
   The affect on investors of those problems was compounded by
President Clinton's domestic embarrassments, and by the more recent
use of U.S. military force against suspected terrorist groups in
Afganistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, North Korea added to the global uncertainty by
firing a missile that traveled over Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But most strategists say the foreign problems merely ignited a
sell-off that was long overdue. By July 17, the Dow in fact had
risen more than 6,900 points, or 288 percent, in the last eight
years without major interruption.
</P>
<P>
   That bull market, described by some as a ``stock market
bubble,'' saw stock prices rise far above what some analysts
thought they were really worth based on corporate profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   When Asia's year-old problems finally put a dent in U.S.
corporate profits in the second quarter, traders were already
looking for an excuse to sell and the foreign events provided it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally, the market got way ahead of itself with
inflated earnings,'' said Fred Allvine, director of Georgia Tech's
Stock Market Project, referring to the historically high
price-to-earnings ratios of stock market averages such as the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are knocking those (P/Es) down to a more realistic level,
but it could take a long time,'' Allvine said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the evidence indicates that small investors have stood
their ground, based on analyses of trading of big blocks of stocks,
normally by institutions like pension funds and mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   The big concern is that, at some point, small investors will
join the panic and send the market even lower. That's why the most
frequent advice small investors are still getting is to stick to a
long-term, buy and hold philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an individual and I haven't sold a thing,'' said E.T.
Laird, manager of the Atlanta office of Jeffries &AMP; Co., a New York
investment banker noted for its trading expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason is that it is hard for people who have gotten out
of the market to get back in,'' said Laird.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Allen, president and chief executive of Globalt, said the
sell-off has not changed the firm's investment strategy focusing on
blue chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to stay with quality large-cap, liquid stocks. We
have the highest confidence in the earnings we can find in these
stocks,'' said Allen.
</P>
<P>
   At Robinson-Humphrey, strategist Robert S. Robbins said the
sell-off has not changed the positive fundamentals of the economy,
such as continued growth, minimal inflation and falling interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, what's good for the economy is good for the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no change in my market stance,'' said Robbins, who
calls this a normal correction in ``super bull market'' that
started in 1982 and is still going on.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts blamed the intensity of Monday's selling on
computer-directed programs, especially in the final hour of
trading.
</P>
<P>
   According to Laird, program trading may have accounted for as
much as 88 percent of the Dow's loss.
</P>
<P>
   Program trading was blamed for exacerbating the market's decline
on Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow fell 22.6 percent in its worst crash
ever.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, this is the first bear market on Wall Street
since the summer of 1990, when another foreign crisis _ Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait _ accelerated an already declining market.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts generally thing the sell-off still has a way to go, but
they disagree on how much lower the market will go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forecasting this market is like trying to predict mob
psychology,'' said Interstate/Johnson Lane technical analyst Ricky
T. Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public may decide en masse to sell, or something else may
happen and you'll see a market rebound. A drop of 20 percent is a
point from which you could get a very good rally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for policy makers in Washington, analysts believe the key is
not so much what happens overseas as what happens at the Federal
Reserve. Some analysts are already calling for the Fed to cut
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``What needs to kick in is that the Fed recognizes they must
keep the economy going,'' said Globalt's Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, investors can look forward to a vigorous
up-and-down market for months to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get a lot of volatility on the upside or the downside,''
said Harrington, meaning that market averages will contionue to
post daily gains or losses of more than 1 percent.

 NEW YORK: bond funds.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bearing the brunt of Monday's selloff were many of the
technology stocks that have been the most popular with individual
investors and the mutual funds in which they invest. The Nasdaq
composite index, the major market index most heavily populated with
technology issues, fell 140 points, or 8.6 percent, to 1499.25 _
its second worst daily decline in points and the fourth-worst in
percentage terms. The Nasdaq index is now 4.5 percent below the
level it started the year.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange measured 914.7 million
shares, the third busiest day ever on the Big Board, and the number
of stocks that declined exceeded those that advanced by a ratio of
more than seven to one. Exceptionally heavy volume on the Chicago
Board Options Exchange caused a computer problem near the end of
trading. But despite that glitch, Rubin said that the financial
market's mechanisms worked ``effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow industrial average has declined nearly 1,799 points, or
19.2 percent, from its highest-ever closing price of 9337.97 on
July 17. That is slightly less, in percentage terms, than the 21.2
percent loss in the index's value in the bear market of 1990, which
lasted from mid-June through early October.
</P>
<P>
   Most other stock markets around the world posted losses Monday,
partly in response to last week's decline in the American stock
market. Germany's leading market index fell 2.3 percent Monday,
while stock prices in Great Britain fell 2.2 percent. In Hong Kong,
the stock market plummeted, falling more than 7 percent after the
government, which intervened to help prop up share prices last
week, failed to do so again. Virtually alone among the world's
major equity markets, Japanese share prices rose 1.4 percent on
Monday, bouncing off its lowest level in more than a decade last
week.
</P>
<P>
   To some traders and stock-market analysts, the decline on Wall
Street Monday took on some of the characteristics of a selling
frenzy, the type of relentless liquidation of investors' portfolios
that comes only at the point of maximum pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only good thing I see is that they are finally going after
the sacred cows, the drugs and the retail stocks and the technology
sector,'' said Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell
&AMP; Reed, an Overland Park, Kan., mutual fund company. Until Monday,
those stocks had proved a sort of refuge from the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they are pounding the stocks that wouldn't go down, that
tells me that the sentiment is really negative,'' Herrmann said.
``And when the sentiment gets that negative, you can get a reversal
pretty quick.''
</P>
<P>
   While Herrmann suggested a stock bounce might be in order,
Monday's rout, and the round of relentless selling at the end of
trading, leaves open the possibility that further declines will
follow Tuesday. Relatively few market participants seem to believe
that the downturn in stock prices is finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that we are reaching a temporary climax,'' said
Richard McCabe, an analyst at Merrill Lynch who tracks the market's
technical indicators. But he said that the market was just as
likely to stumble further, at least as low as 7,400, which was the
market's lowest point in January and 2 percent below its current
level. Last October, on the day that Dow industrials fell 554
points, the Dow index fell as low as 6971.
</P>
<P>
   McCabe noted that both Monday and Friday, the market started the
day with a sharp upward move _ a sign that some investors were
hunting for bargains among fallen stocks _ before plunging. That
usually is a sign of further market declines, he said. A sign that
the maximum level of pessimism had been reached, he said, would be
for the market to fall sharply in the opening hour after a day when
it finishes at its lowest point of the day. The market will get an
opportunity to do just that Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Market analysts and participants cited several sources for the
heavy selling that came at the end of Monday's trading. Laszlo
Birinyi, a market analyst who tracks program trading, the
computer-driven trading strategies often employed by professional
trading firms, said that much of the late-day volume appeared to
come from institutions that had placed sell orders earlier in the
day and needed them completed before trading ended.
</P>
<P>
   Birinyi concluded that the heavy selling came from mutual fund
companies responding to orders placed over the weekend and during
the trading day.
</P>
<P>
   Thre was some concern among traders that heavy selling was
coming from index mutual funds, one of the few categories of stock
funds that have continued to take in cash during the market's
recent decline. But George U. Sauter, a managing director at the
Vanguard Group who oversees the company's index funds, said in an
interview that Vanguard's two big funds that track the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index did not participate in the market Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large we've had positive cash flow into the funds,
although certainly not to the extent we had earlier in the year,''
Sauter said. One of the big Vanguard index funds had a slight
outflow but that was balanced out by an inflow into the other,
Sauter said, meaning the impact on the S&AMP;P 500 was canceled out.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the day, according to two traders, heavy selling
of stock-index futures by hedge funds prompted some institutions to
activate what are known as index arbitrage trades. In these cases,
the trades involved selling the stocks in the S&AMP;P 500 index and
buying the associated futures, in an attempt to lock in as profit
the difference between the futures contract and the higher-priced
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Also lending a negative tone to the day's events was an
announcement late in the day by Salomon Smith Barney, which manages
one of Wall Street's biggest trading operations, that it had
suffered trading losses of approximately $360 million after taxes
over the last two months. The total included $60 million from
Russia-related credits, $120 million in the company's bond
arbitrage portfolio and $180 million in other arbitrage businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In such an environment, few stocks were able to maintain gains;
only 27 of the stocks in the S&AMP;P 500 rose Monday. Among the winners
were utility companies, a traditional haven in tough times because
of their high dividends, and shares of companies that sell food,
beverages and other staples that consumers are expected to buy in
good times and bad.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's stock plunge knocked about $700 billion off the market
value of companies in the Wilshire 5000 index. Since mid-July, the
market capitalization of the index, which is made up of about 7,600
U.S. companies and is often used as a proxy for the entire stock
market, has shrunk by nearly $2.5 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The rout has taken big swipes out of some long-time investor
favorites. Coca-Cola, for example, lost $18.8 billion of market
value Monday, and since mid-July, the company has lost nearly $59
billion of its value, or 26 percent.

CONTRACT UNCERTAINTIES HAVEN'T DISTRACTED WILLIAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All but one of the cubicles in the Yankees' clubhouse
are identical: about 4 feet deep; a bar across the top from which
to hang jerseys and workout gear and street clothes; several other
drawers and shelves for gloves and shoes and personal items, and a
chair in front.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams occupies the only aberrant cubicle. Built into a
corner, it is large enough for Williams, the Yankees' center
fielder, to draw his chair inside completely, and he often does
this, turning his back to the world as he plays his guitar
peacefully, in baseball pants, sleeveless royal blue T-shirt and
oval sunglasses with neon blue lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' whole season has been self-contained. He said in
spring training that he did not want to discuss his impending free
agency during the year, and he has not. He insisted he would not
negotiate while he played, and he has not. He has been adamant that
the possibility of his departure should not become a distraction
from the team's goal of winning the World Series, and it has not.
</P>
<P>
   He is just playing, and playing well. The Yankees have the best
record in the major leagues at 98-37, and Williams leads the
American League in batting average (.340) and on-base percentage
(.425) and ranks ninth in slugging percentage. He is also well on
his way to 100 runs batted in, driving in 81 so far, despite
missing more than a month with a sprained knee. Like the Mets' Mike
Piazza, Williams can sign with any team after this season, and
several clubs are expected to pursue him, including Arizona, Texas
and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Piazza, Williams chose not to engage in contract
discussions after spring training began. Piazza rejected an $84
million offer from the Los Angeles Dodgers early in the season, was
traded twice and has been the subject of many whispers. There has
been rampant speculation about where he may go, whether he is happy
with the New York Mets, whether his teammates like him. Piazza did
finally stop discussing his future, but by then fans were treating
him like an ungrateful mercenary.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bronx, Williams plays his guitar and plays baseball. His
handling of his impending free agency, Yankees General Manager
Brian Cashman said Sunday, should be ``a case study.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been terrific,'' Cashman said. ``He's handled this the
way he handles everything _ with class. He hasn't let this become a
distraction to his teammates, to his club, to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months from now, Cashman and other Yankees officials will
determine what they believe Williams is worth. There exists a
strong possibility that the Yankees will not be willing to pay what
other teams might offer _ a six- or seven-year contract worth more
than $10 million a year. Cashman may call Williams' agent with word
that the Yankees' relationship with Williams is over.
</P>
<P>
   But those discussions will not take place until after the
season; Williams made that clear to Cashman in a February meeting.
``Bernie's concentrated solely on baseball,'' Cashman said, ``and
he's helped put this team in a position to win. This was the best
possible way to handle a delicate situation, and you've really got
to tip your hat to Bernie.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Postponing contract discussions, Williams said, ``has worked out
pretty well, because with the type of year we've been having, it
wouldn't make sense to talk about my contract.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the season starts, it's time to play baseball,'' he said.
``You've got to try to take care of things off the field in the
off-season, and if they aren't taken care of, then you try to play
through the season and put yourself in a good bargaining position
at the end of the next season. I strongly believe the season is not
the time to talk about your contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams believes that negotiating and talking about his
contract during the season would have bothered him. ``It just puts
unnecessary pressure on the things I'm trying to do,'' he said.
``If I'm trying to play to prove I'm worth whatever we're
negotiating for, that just takes the fun out of playing. It takes
the enjoyment out of it, and it's not a good situation. Nothing
would ever be good enough. You're always trying to drive in runs,
but it would be for the wrong reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has grown accustomed to the reality that baseball teams
operate as businesses. Players come and players go. But Williams
wants stability, for himself and his family. ``It's driving my
family crazy, not knowing where they're going to be,'' he said.
``It's been going on for six years. I've been fortunate enough to
play consistently enough to stay here. But year to year, we don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Yankees never leave, like Don Mattingly. ``He was a
guy who played here for like 13 or 14 years,'' said Williams,
before referring to his teammates Tino Martinez, Paul O'Neill and
Derek Jeter. ``Maybe Tino will have that, O'Neill will have that,
maybe Jeter, if they're smart enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I realize that unless something extraordinary happens _
and it wouldn't happen until after the year is over _ then
everybody's going to be forced to make some decisions. I wish it
could've worked out some other way, earlier on. That's part of the
game, though, and you have to live with that and try to make the
best of it. I'm looking forward to getting it over with.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, musing about the way in which Williams has carried
himself this year, said, ``He just hasn't let his situation become
a distraction, in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez paused, before offering a sentiment that pervades the
thinking of many in pinstripes. ``Of course we want him back,'' he
said. ``Maybe the best way to make sure that happens is to win the
World Series.''

ADVERTISING: VIAGRA APPEARS IN ADS FOR OTHER PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Madison Avenue is answering in the affirmative when
asked ``Am I blue?'' _ not a reference to Wall Street but to a
certain little pill.
</P>
<P>
   That pill is of course Viagra, the hugely popular drug from
Pfizer Inc. that treats male impotence. On the market only since
April, Viagra has already made a place for itself in the national
vocabulary faster than you can say ``Kinsey Report,'' ``Rubik's
cube,'' ``macarena'' or ``Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Viagra's ability to quickly become such a looming presence on
the cultural landscape has intrigued marketers and agencies, which
are always seeking ways to garner attention for what might
otherwise be prosaic advertisements. And because the upper echelons
of Madison Avenue are so dominated by older men, it's not
surprising that Viagra would be a subject near to their, er,
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Viagra is starting to play a cameo role _ usually
humorous _ in campaigns for goods and services that have nothing to
do with its intended purpose, despite some difficulties that
threaten to limit the scope and effectiveness of such efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first job is to get the advertising noticed,'' said Paul
Cappelli, president at the Ad Store, a creative agency in New York.
``So topical matters are something we as advertising people should
jump on.''
</P>
<P>
   Viagramania _ the ability to see green where others see blue _
has been fueled in no small part by the intrinsic link between the
drug and what Joel McCrea in ``The Palm Beach Story'' labels
``Topic A.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidency became associated with sex in January, and
Viagra came after that,'' said Lawrence Brown, president at
Lawrence Brown Inc. in Bridgehampton, who invoked the drug in a
recent newspaper ad promoting his agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interest in Viagra has been so intense because it reminds
people sex is important,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's ad, which carried the headline ``Announcing Viagra for
Business'' and promised ``no nasty side effects,'' is among several
in a growing category of variegated pitches inspired by Viagra.
Some use or allude to the drug's name; others show a blue pill, a
white pill bottle or similar imagery.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a newspaper ad for the Swatch Metrica watch sold
by Swatch Group, with a watchband that doubles as a ruler, showed
the product next to a blue pill and the words ``Size does matter.''
(In also borrowing the theme of the film ``Godzilla,'' the Swatch
ad represents a pop-culture ``twofer.'')
</P>
<P>
   American Quantum Motorcycles ran an ad depicting one of its
products above the headline ``For the 65 million men who don't need
Viagra.''
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes to sell its motorbikes primarily to ``people
between 40 and 60,'' said Michael Jeary, president and chief
operating officer at the American Quantum agency Della Femina/Jeary
&AMP; Partners in New York, which is owned by top executives and
Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was tapping into what's happening in the marketplace with
a twist to make it more salient, more relevant,'' he added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And two magazines are ``co-branding'' with Viagra in ads that
are part of new trade campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Wired, owned by the Conde Nast Publications unit of Advance
Publications, is running a series of two-page ads comparing itself
with traditional business publications. One ad in the campaign, by
Black Rocket in San Francisco, shows on the left-hand page, perched
atop a pile of Forbes and Fortune magazines, four Viagra pills and
a shot glass filled with Scotch on the rocks. The headline: ``Old
CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   On the right-hand page, atop a pile of Wired magazines, is a
handful of M&AMP;Ms and a glass of amber beer. The headline: ``New
CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   The jab is meant to be playful, said Dana Lyon, Wired publisher
in San Francisco, who called the ad ``a way to look at the lighter
side of a competitive advantage Wired has'' in terms of ``a younger
median age'' for its readers.
</P>
<P>
   And Playboy magazine, owned by Playboy Enterprises, is featuring
Viagra in one of several ads by Kovel Kresser &AMP; Partners in Venice,
Calif., which carry the theme ``Life, liberty and the pursuit of
dreams.'' In the ad, the words ``The revolution isn't over, it's
just begun'' are superimposed over a photograph of a pill bottle,
the letters ``Viag'' visible, tucked inside the back pocket of a
pair of blue jeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viagra has opened the door for sexual conversations among
many, many people,'' said Richard Kinsler, executive vice president
and publisher in New York. ``And not to brag, but people look at
Playboy as an authority on sex.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem that may halt or reverse the trend is taste _ or
specifically the lack thereof in many Viagra ads, which make
salacious, smutty or licentious assertions. For example, a trade ad
for FHM, a British magazine for younger men published by Emap
Metro, shows a Viagra bottle while bragging that when it comes to
circulation gains, ``Getting bigger has never been our problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Some agency executives did not agree that Viagra-themed ads
might be vulgar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The taste issue went out the window with the last election,''
declared Cappelli of the Ad Store.
</P>
<P>
   A much tougher obstacle is the increasing zeal with which Pfizer
is fighting ads that use the Viagra name or image without
permission. After Brown ran his ad, he received a letter from White
&AMP; Case, a Pfizer law firm in New York, insisting that he cease and
desist from his ``unauthorized'' use of the trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he complied, adding, ``I guess this rules out my
plans for a Viagra bed-and-breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   To Mariann Caprino, a spokeswoman for Pfizer in New York, such
japes are no laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've written a number of complaint letters to a number of
companies because we're committed to enforcing our intellectual
property,'' she said, adding: ``Viagra is serious medicine for a
serious medical condition. There's nothing funny about erectile
dysfunction.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to policing ads about Viagra, Ms. Caprino said,
Pfizer is battling companies that are ``selling products with names
confusingly similar'' like Vaegra and Viagro.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer is running its own campaign for Viagra, which is aimed at
convincing men to ask their doctors about the drug. Ads by Cline,
Davis &AMP; Mann, an Omnicom agency, show a 50-something couple
dancing.

   Q My manager called me into his office and told me that several
of the people I work with complained to him about me. He said they
think I am too bossy, conceited and demanding. I told him I
disagreed, and that they never said this to me. He said I should
think about what they told him and try to do something about it.
I'm very upset and not sure what to do. L.S. &QL; 
A Your manager took a real misstep on this one. His first step
should have been to suggest that your associates meet with you to
discuss their concerns and see if there is a way for all of you to
resolve this matter on your own.
</P>
<P>
   Having tripped at the first step, your manager then took a giant
leap backward by believing only their side of the story. And then,
to make matters even worse, he threw all sorts of labels at you,
rather than discussing specific behaviors or incidents.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, you should meet with your fellow employees to
discuss the situation. Let them know you are honestly puzzled by
their reaction to you, as well as by their decision to take their
concerns directly to management rather than to you in the first
place. Then be quiet and listen. It is easy to become defensive in
these discussions, and it is essential to avoid doing so.
</P>
<P>
   You can present your side of the picture, but your real
objective should be to prevent this kind of situation from
recurring in the future. Hence, you should try to work toward a
mutual commitment from all of the players to try to work
productively together and to be open and proactive in dealing with
group problems.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to let your manager know what you are doing about group
problems, as it sounds like he may be causing more than a few of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Q We brought in a training program for the managers and, in the
last session, there was a short test that well over half of them
failed. This is a highly regarded program, and we are disappointed
with the performance of so many of the managers. What do you
suggest we do? T.P. &QL; 
A When well over half the class fails a program, it can be argued
that the real failure is the program itself. This type of failure
rate typically highlights a program's inability to capture and
sustain the motivation, drive and interest of the participants. In
this regard, before you blame your employees, it is important to
review the program's presenters, content, practice, opportunities,
feedback, materials and the test itself.
</P>
<P>
   One useful step is to meet with the participants to discuss all
of this. After all, it is standard operating procedure for
participants to evaluate the training programs they attend. By the
end of this discussion, you will have a clear idea of who and what
really failed here.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to remember that a training program may be
highly regarded, but that does not automatically mean your
employees will have any regard for it at all. &QL; 
Q I do not have many personal phone calls, but the last three times
my manager stuck his head in my office, I was on one. He gave me a
strange look, but I didn't say anything to him about how few
personal calls I actually receive. Should I? A.S. &QL; 
A At this point, it's getting too late to make that call. In a
broad sense, if you are ever concerned that your manager has
obtained an inaccurate picture of your performance, you should tell
him. However, you need to do so as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   If you approach your manager even a matter of days after the
fact, the message that you are sending may not be the one that he
receives. For example, he may have forgotten about the calls, but
you will have rekindled this telephonic memory. Or perhaps he still
has them in mind, and he may have figured that they were infrequent
occurrences, but since you stewed over them for some period of time
and then approached him, perhaps he should focus more attention on
them.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, since it sounds like you are going to keep yourself
awake at night until you talk to your manager about this, you
should do so. After all, in most work environments, such calls are
not exactly rare. If your working relationship with him is
generally positive, there should be no problem in giving him a
quick update on your personal calls. And if your working
relationship is not that great, the personal calls are the least of
your problems.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As they surveyed their outsized stock market gains
over the past three years, some investors may have thought to
wonder, on occasion, just what a bear market feels like.
</P>
<P>
   Now they know.
</P>
<P>
   In Wall Street's second biggest one-day point decline, stocks of
all kinds disintegrated Monday. As a demise, it was orderly. But it
was also indiscriminate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was really different,'' said Douglas Cliggott, U.S.
equity strategist at J.P. Morgan in New York. ``Very high quality
companies with no visible sign of earnings weakness were taken down
brutally.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the selling hammered stocks both in and out of favor
with investors, both cyclical and noncyclical businesses, and both
recognizable and obscure companies.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was different in another way, however. It marked the
first time in years that the three most popular market indexes _
the Dow Jones industrial average, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 and the
Nasdaq Composite _ showed losses. Until now, the declines in the
indexes, unpleasant though they were, had still left investors
ahead of the game.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. Investors, playing with the house's money all year,
are now faced with the prospect of giving up some of their own.
Even those who own index funds, which had registered gains until
Monday, are now eating into last year's gains.
</P>
<P>
   There was no stopping the selling. No circuit breakers to kick
in on the New York Stock Exchange to give investors time to regain
their reason before they resumed the furious unloading of shares.
Under the new rules instituted by the Exchange last October, it
would take a fall of 900 points for trading to be halted.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects a decline of that magnitude to happen. Indeed,
many strategists anticipate a rebound in stocks Tuesday. Investors
who had been moving their money into cash or money market funds,
could easily decide that stocks at these levels look attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Monday's action was a harrowing reminder to investors of
how the law of gravity works in the stock market. Shares of the
same highfliers that had propelled the market to its triumphant
heights led the decline. Dell Computer closed down 15.8 percent,
Yahoo! ended the day 16.9 percent lower, America Online lost 14.8
percent of its value. Those are breathtaking moves, one-day
declines that might have taken months in other, less frothy
markets.
</P>
<P>
   What fueled the decline? Monday's economic news wasn't great,
but it wasn't awful either. A report from Chicago's National
Association of Purchasing Management showed that increasing numbers
of domestic manufacturers said their businesses were deteriorating.
And sales of new homes fell 1.6 percent in July, a signal that the
housing market may be slowing. Both reports contributed to the view
that the U.S. economy is weakening.
</P>
<P>
   Inasmuch as a weaker economy translates into diminished
earnings, these figures were not welcome news to stock market
investors. Still, they were not triggers likely to cause the
all-out collapse seen Monday.
</P>
<P>
   What appeared to be happening Monday was the unwind of two
significant investor behavioral patterns. One was the shift from
investors being able to shrug off all bad news, what Wall Street
calls climbing the wall of worry, to investors showing increasing
concern. Maybe the economic problems in Asia, Russia and Latin
America, combined with the strong dollar, will indeed have a
deleterious effect on already weakening U.S. company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're looking at here is a rolling realization that there
are a lot of problems in the world,'' said Alan Kral, portfolio
manager at Trevor, Stewart, Burton and Jacobsen, an investment
management firm in New York. ``The sum total of a number of small
problems has become a major problem for us. You can't take away
growth opportunities in half the world's economies and blithely
conclude that American stocks at 25 times earnings are cheap.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But an even greater contributor to Monday's carnage, strategists
say, was the reverse effect of what has come to be known as
momentum investing. This strategy, characterized by investors
chasing stocks simply because they are rising in price, with little
regard for sensible valuations, pushed shares of the favored
companies to levels unseen before in even in the hottest of
markets. Now, with these stocks no longer rising and momentum
shifting in the other direction, momentum investors sell. And this
selling feeds on itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're buying something at a very high price/earnings
ratio,'' said Peter Tanous, investment consultant at Lynx Asset
Management in Washington D.C. ``You've always got your finger on
the trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   In choosing to pull that trigger, Monday, investors seemed to
see several things on the horizon they didn't like. First were the
whiffs of third quarter earnings disappointments, anecdotal only at
this point, but a worry nonetheless. Companies have learned to warn
investors when prospects look grim; the warning period for the
third quarter begins in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Neither have lower interest rates helped the market. This is a
turnabout for investors who have come to expect that when rates
fall, stock prices rise.
</P>
<P>
   An increasingly bearish sentiment among investment newsletter
writers also may have contributed to Monday's selling. According to
Mark Hulbert, editor of the Hulbert Financial Digest in Alexandria,
Va., at the end of July, newletter writers recommended on average
that their readers maintain an exposure in stocks of 63 percent of
their portfolio. On Monday the recommended level had dropped to
around 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hulbert said that we are not yet seeing people really
throwing in the towel. ``Even though there has been a big drop, I
thought we'd have seen even more,'' he said ``We may not have quite
the capitulation among advisers that a contrarian needs to see
before calling a bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, technology stocks, which led the market up, look
particularly vulnerable to further declines. That's because now
that Windows '98 is out in the stores, there are no new drivers to
make investors want to got out and buy a new computer. At the same
time that there is a glut of product out there, consumer interest
is down.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has been largely a confidence game of late,
said Fred Hickey, editor of High Tech Strategist. ``Since investors
have been so certain about their stocks for so long, there's a
shock factor. People have leveraged themselves, taken risks they
shouldn't have taken because these stocks seem so invincible.
You're seeing a reversal of these excesses.''

ACCOUNTING FIRMS FACING MORE PRESSURE FROM SEC 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Concerned about the millions of dollars' worth of consulting
that the Big Five accounting firms now do at some of the companies
they audit, the Securities and Exchange Commission wants auditors
to meet annually with company directors to explain why the
consulting services have not harmed the accountants' independence.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Turner, the SEC's chief accountant, made the proposal at a
meeting on Monday of the Independence Standards Board. The SEC
formed the eight-member board last year to address concerns about
the growing number of ties between auditors and the companies they
audit and to create a set of independence rules.
</P>
<P>
   But after 15 months, the eight-member standards board has done
little more than propose that auditors send a short form letter to
directors each year stating that they are independent.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said Monday that a letter was not enough. He wants the
auditors to detail their consulting services and other ties to the
company in a discussion with the company's audit committee. As part
of that meeting, Turner said, the auditors would say, ``Here's the
consulting services we've provided, here's the cost of those
services and here's why those services did not impair our
independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner called the discussion and letter a start to addressing
the SEC's concerns about auditor independence. The SEC has also
suggested that auditors be prevented from immediately accepting a
job from a company they audit.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors must be independent from their audit clients because
their job is to protect investors by reviewing the financial
statements prepared by the company's management.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, about a dozen companies _ including Cendant,
Sunbeam and Livent _ announced that they had discovered accounting
irregularities in financial statements that had been audited and
that results would have to be restated.
</P>
<P>
   Since he began the chief accountant's job in July, Turner has
been discussing some of those accounting problems with accountants
and business executives to determine whether there might be a wider
flaw in the way public companies report financial information to
shareholders and the way that information is audited.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the Big Five accounting firms have become
increasingly dependent on consulting, which is more profitable than
auditing a company's books. Now about 30 percent to 40 percent of
the accounting firms' revenues come from consulting.
</P>
<P>
   One concern is that an auditor who finds an accounting problem
may not force management to correct it if the accounting firm also
has a lucrative consulting job with the company. The auditor might
fear that raising concerns about the accounting could anger
management, who could then dismiss the firm's consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said he was also worried about the corporations that were
acquiring accounting firms. He said the SEC was reviewing American
Express Co.'s recent acquisition of Goldstein Golub Kessler &AMP; Co.,
a New York accounting firm, which audits the books of 15 public
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said that any accounting firm considering selling its
practice to a corporation should consult with regulators before the
sale takes place.

   DAYTON, Ohio _ Two Al Gores visited Dayton on Monday _ an
intellectual policy wonk who chatted about educational reform at a
Dayton public school and a partisan pulpit pounder who preached to
the Democratic choir.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke at Dayton's Carlson Elementary School to rev up
support for a new Clinton administration proposal to provide $140
million nationwide to mentor at-risk students to stay in school and
go to college.
</P>
<P>
   Touring with Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Mary Boyle, Gore
told hundreds of students, teachers and local officials he wanted
to have a ``conversation about what it's like to go back to
school.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked to Carlson students about being safe in school and
using modern technology to prepare for the jobs of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of jobs that used to emphasize muscle power now
emphasize brain power,'' Gore told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   From there his limousine caravan headed to a Boyle fund-raiser
at the Dayton Convention Center, where a stream of Democratic
candidates and officeholders had addressed a crowd of 240 people.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Coleman, candidate for lieutenant governor, said Ohioans
are feeling disenfranchised under the Republican administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio gubernatorial race between Democrat Fisher and
Republican Bob Taft ``is about who is going to stand on the side of
working families,'' Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Cordray, who would like to replace Betty Montgomery as
Ohio attorney general, accused his opponent of defending an
indefensible school funding system, overseeing a $4 million
settlement to Lucasville prisoners and failing to vigorously
enforce discrimination and environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   With a mixture of jokes and challenges, Gore:
</P>
<P>
   Called on local Democrats to stop ceding the political call-in
radio shows to their zealous opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Blasted the Republican party as a group where ``the right hand
doesn't know what the far-right hand is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Abruptly diverged mid-speech to praise his boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud to serve with President Bill Clinton,'' he said.
``This country is a better place because of Bill Clinton's
policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyle used both events to drive home a message that her
opponent, Gov. George Voinovich, has done little while Ohio's
schools fell into disrepair. She said she would work on federal
programs to support local schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Voinovich did not deliver on his promise to be the
education governor, and he failed the 1.8 million public school
children in Ohio who counted on him,'' she said. ``Let's rate him
an 'F' for not fulfilling his promises.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Voinovich, she said, the percentage of state support for
education declined, the drop-out rate rose and Ohio got poor marks
for the condition of its school buildings, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She called for hiring 100,000 additional teachers, reducing
class size and creating more vocational and college opportunities
for students.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich's campaign Monday rejected the criticism by Boyle, a
Cuyahoga County commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing new with Mary Boyle,'' said Voinovich campaign
spokeswoman Caryn Candisky. ``She continues to attack the governor,
she has little to say on education and no record to speak of.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boyle fundraiser brought in about $20,000 for her campaign,
according to campaign officials.
</P>
<P>
   Gore urged Democrats to support Boyle vigorously and to work as
hard as Republicans in being heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question falls to us: Are we willing to match their
intensity with some of our own?'' Gore said.

 &HT;    Heart disease cited in lawmaker's death
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ State Rep. Dan Kubiak, who was found dead at his
Rockdale home on Sunday, was a victim of coronary disease, a Milam
County justice of the peace said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Twila Harris of Rockdale said preliminary results of an
autopsy performed by the Dallas County medical examiner's office
showed Kubiak, D-Rockdale, suffered heart failure as a result of
hardening of the arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Kubiak, 60, died while napping Sunday evening. The 11-term
lawmaker was seeking re-election in November.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Romo, Kubiak's legislative aide, said funeral arrangements
were being worked out late Monday. Kubiak had requested burial in
the state cemetery, according to Romo.
</P>
<P>
   Kubiak served in the House from 1969 through 1982, when he left
to seek the Democratic nomination for state land commissioner. He
lost, and supported eventual winner Garry Mauro _ now the
Democrats' gubernatorial nominee _ in his successful runoff race
against Pete Snelson of Midland.
</P>
<P>
   L.B. Kubiak, Dan's brother, ran and held the House seat through
1989. Dan Kubiak was re-elected in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Praise for Dan Kubiak came Monday from leaders and lawmakers who
worked with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all shocked and saddened by the sudden death of our
friend and colleague,'' said House Speaker Pete Laney, D-Hale
Center. ``We have lost a good friend, and the people of Texas have
lost an outstanding legislator who worked tirelessly on behalf of
his constituents to improve public education and to ensure that
state tax dollars were spent wisely and efficiently.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. George W. Bush called Kubiak ``a good friend and
a capable legislator.''
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Kubiak, a former University of Texas football
player, threw his energy into the state's efforts to get ahead of
the year 2000 computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in expressing frustration during a committee hearing,
Kubiak urged the Texas attorney general's office and Andersen
Consulting to stop arguing and work out a way to fix the computer
glitch in the state's child-support enforcement system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to negotiate for the next 51 years because
some of us may not be here,'' Kubiak said.

IMPOUNDED GORDON TIRES PASS INITIAL TEST
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid persistent rumors that Jeff Gordon's Hendrick Motorsports
team has been cheating to improve tire performance in the latter
stages of races _ including Sunday's Farm Aid on CMT 300, which he
won at New Hampshire International Speedway in Loudon _ NASCAR
officials confirmed Monday that an initial postrace inspection
revealed no irregularites with the two tires Gordon had mounted
during a critical pit stop in his latest triumph.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be further analysis of the chemical compound
structure of Gordon's impounded tires ``to squash any perception
that there is any doctoring going on,'' said NASCAR spokesman Tim
Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   That has been a growing perception ever since Gordon, the
Winston Cup points leader and winner of nine races this season, won
the Pepsi 400 at Michigan International Speedway, marking his
fourth consecutive triumph.
</P>
<P>
   At NHIS Sunday, Gordon started on the pole but fell as far back
as 17th place. After climbing back into the top 10, he made a
critical two-tire pit stop on Lap 233 and emerged with the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The win sparked even more rumors of cheating on Gordon's team,
headed by crew chief Ray Evernham.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't going to beat them guys on four (tires),'' Evernham
said. ``Our car wasn't good enough. We needed track position, and
the car was tight. The only way to free it up was to put just two
right sides on it. We did adjust the air pressure, and I know
there's a car owner fuming out there, saying we put something in
the tire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we did put something in the tire,'' he added. ``We put
in air.''
</P>
<P>
   Car owner Jack Roush, whose driver, Mark Martin, led three times
for 193 laps but finished runner-up to remain 67 points behind
Gordon, complained loudest and demanded that NASCAR launch an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out to appease anybody,'' said Sullivan. ``We just
want to put an end to all these rumors and speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR officials impounded not only Gordon's tires but also four
belonging to Martin. Both sets passed initial on-site inspection
but were sent to Charlotte, N.C., for further evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last three or four weeks, the perception had been
building that something was going on with (Gordon's) tires,'' said
Sullivan. ``We looked at them (Sunday) night and didn't discover
anything out of the ordinary. We found nothing that would cause us
to raise a red flag.''
</P>
<P>
   But inspectors were unable to conduct tests on the chemical
structure of the tires at the track, so officials forwarded them to
a laboratory in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's chemicals out there that will cause the compound
structure of the tire to break down,'' said Sullivan, ``and that's
what we're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said the use of ``tire softeners'' was a common
practice among short-track racers, who use them to make tires more
pliable, enhancing their adhesion to the track.
</P>
<P>
   Most tire softeners, ranging in price from $25 to $159, can be
obtained at high-performance auto parts stores.
</P>
<P>
   Roush accused Gordon's teams of treating their tires with such a
substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception is that possibly they've been adding it to
their air,'' said Sullivan. ``And when they add air to the tire, it
coats the inside of the tire. That's been the talk out there. But
these guys police themselves and they do a very good job of it.
When you get 43 cars side by side in a garage, it's hard to do
anything to a car without anyone noticing.''
</P>
<P>
   After Gordon won the Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono, Pa., Roush and
fellow car owner Robert Yates ``stood by and watched us tear down
the 24 car to nothing but nuts and bolts,'' Sullivan said. ``Ray
was not a happy camper when they had to take that car home in
buckets.''
</P>
<P>
   Evernham bristled again Sunday when confronted by Roush's
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to criticize, that's fine,'' Evernham said. ``But
when it's all said and done and they don't find anything, are the
same people that criticize going to stand up and admit that they
just got beat _ again?''

FACING NONUNION COMPETITION, U S WEST SETTLES TWO-WEEK STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: CORRECTS that strike affected customers in 14 states, sted
13; recasts lede, minor changes elsewhere.) (nk) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ With nonunion companies competing hungrily for
telephone business in booming cities of the Rockies, U S West
tentatively settled a two-week strike Monday, and workers started
back to work at the region's Bell company.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which faces a ratification vote by the 34,000
striking members of Communications Workers of America, gives
workers gains in pay and pension benefits, among other things, and
allows for a voluntary pay-for-performance program.
</P>
<P>
   The deal settlement came as U S West is scrambling to keep
control of an exploding market in fax, pager and telephone lines in
Denver. Starting Tuesday, all local calls made within the Denver
area will require 10-digit dialing. In October, greater Denver is
to get an additional area code, 720.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bell companies are preparing to face increased competition
from fairly lean, nonunion companies going after their market
share,'' said Boyd Peterson, an analyst with The Yankee Group, a
telecommunications research company based in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said that although U S West remained strong _ its stock
fell only 7/16ths of a point Monday in the face of a sharp market
decline _ it could not afford a protracted fight with an equally
strong union.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Bell Atlantic reached a settlement after
only a two-day strike by the same union, Communications Workers of
America. In Connecticut, workers from same union last week rejected
a contract offer made by Southern New England Telecommunications
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``CWA is probably doing better than any union in the country,''
said Gregory Tarpinian, executive director for the Labor Research
Association, a New York consulting company for unions. ``They have
a tremendous amount of leverage because most of the telecom
companies downsized in the mid-80s and early `90s. They are left
with pretty lean operations.''
</P>
<P>
   At U S West, the number of employees dropped to 53,000 on
Monday, from 66,000 in 1984, the year of the company's creation.
Because of downsizing, the strike found the company without a large
number of middle level managers to perform unionized tasks _
directory assistance, repair and installation. At the same time,
the region's urban customers enjoy unprecedented choices because a
host of new companies have entered markets in the deregulated
environment caused by the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a tight labor market and an increasingly competitive
business environment, U S West agreed to wage increases of 10.9
percent over three years, slightly above inflation forecasts. In
addition, it agreed to cut in half mandatory overtime, to a maximum
of eight hours a week by January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year contract, which also allowed for a 21 percent
increase in pension benefits and a $500 ratification bonus, must
now be ratified by the company's rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Pisha, vice president of Communications Workers of America
District 7, said that on Sunday night officials of the 65 striking
locals ``overwhelmingly'' supported the new contract. She predicted
that it would win approval of 60 percent to 70 percent of striking
workers. All strikers are expected back to work by midweek.
</P>
<P>
   The strike affected service to about 25 million customers in 14
of the company's states: Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Montana,
Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South
Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Because of automation, phone
service was largely uninterrupted, though customers did encounter
problems in trying to get directory assistance, new service and
repairs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the most controversial issue, the company agreed to make a
pay-per-performance plan voluntary for eligible employees.
</P>
<P>
   Before the strike, the company's younger managers sought to make
this plan mandatory for all new workers as a way of improving
efficiency and making the company more ``customer friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   The union considered the company's final position on the
pay-for-performance issue as a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pay for performance is totally voluntary; no one will be
forced in,'' said Ms. Pisha. ``The union is not going to recommend
that our members get in that plan.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Beigie, a U S West spokesman, called the union's
acceptance of even a voluntary plan as ``a breakthrough for the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In a company where union workers on average earn $37,900,
however, some may go for the extra money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line will be down the road, when we see how many
employees opt for pay for performance,'' Richard Hurd, a professor
of labor studies at Cornell University, said Monday. ``If the
company can convince people that pay for performance will mean they
can get higher pay, you will see a lot of employees going for it.''

THE SEASON OF THE HOME RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is September now, but still summer ... still the Summer of
the Home Run.
</P>
<P>
   Home runs dominate the headlines. Home runs make the nightly
network news. In the absence of legitimate pennant races, home runs
have become more important than the games.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey came to Boston Monday and there was no way he was
going to visit Fenway without a discussion of home runs. That is
the way it goes in the Summer of the Home Run.
</P>
<P>
   Junior has sort of become the George Harrison of this Home Run
Derby. While Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa (Lennon and McCartney)
march in step toward the magical, mystical 61, Griff has dropped
back a bit and was leading the American League with ``only'' 47
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Only 47. Imagine having to say you're sorry for hitting 47
homers before the first of September?
</P>
<P>
   Junior doesn't like to talk too much about the homers. He likes
to talk about playing baseball for fun, and for victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same as when you are 10 years old,'' Griffey said
before Monday night's Mariners-Sox joust. ``You go 0 for 4 and you
win and you still go for ice cream and you're happy. You get a
couple of hits and you lose and you sit in back seat and ride home
with your parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The Home Run Chase is over for Junior. He ripped five in eight
games before coming to Boston. The Mariners have 26 games remaining
and Griffey needs 15 homers to beat Maris. Junior's a streak
hitter, but he's never hit more than 15 in a month (May 1994).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even worry about it,'' he said. ``My thing is I want
to be in the World Series. My dad played in one here a few years
ago. I want to get the flags over the mantel, like he has.''
</P>
<P>
   He's patient about the home run questions but not particularly
candid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you got some people going for history, people are
going to watch,'' he said. ``I just don't even worry about it. Once
the ball leaves my bat, I got no contol where it goes. If you find
yourself trying to catch one of them (Sosa or McGwire), you fall
further behind and that's not what I'm about.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's manger, Lou Piniella, said, ``The home run race has
been great for baseball. I equate it with boxing's heavyweight
championship. Nobody can tell you who the middleweight champ is,
but everyone knows the heavyweight champ. There's been a lot of
great performances in baseball this year, but they've all taken a
back seat to this. I'm as curious and as interested as anybody
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junior hits 'em in bunches. But it's asking a lot for him to
do it now. He's got 47 and I don't see that as a disappointment.
It's quite an accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   While downplaying the chase, Griffey said he is watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, you check out `SportsCenter,''' he said. ``But I don't
stand there and say, `Don't hit one.' I just want to help my team
as much as possible. I never thought I'd hit more than 20 anyway.
My dad wasn't a power hitter and I always wanted to hit like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey got roughed up by the New York media over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were dogging me,'' he said. ``One time when they talked
to me I had just woken up. I just didn't have much to say.''
</P>
<P>
   When we stopped asking about homers, he started talking. About
everything.
</P>
<P>
   He said he'd rather prevent an opposing homer than hit one _
unless hitting one would win a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you bring one back, you can smile,'' he said. ``When I
hit a home run, I don't smile. I don't want to get hit the next
time up. You can only smile if it's a game-winning homer. You don't
embarrass other players.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he didn't see the ESPN segment that compared the home
run poses of McGwire, Sosa, and himself. Griffey's pose (Junior
calls it ``the dismount'') was rated tops.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because I'm the only lefty hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   He advised all his young admirers to ``just be yourself and have
fun. You're not me. Be a kid. There's only a certain amount of
players that get to play this game professionally. So enjoy it. If
you enjoy it, you work harder at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is not a job. This is fun. A job is when you are
supposed to start work at 9 a.m. and you get there at 9 a.m. That's
a job. This is baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   And in baseball, this is the Summer of the Home Run.

 SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina: and Sudan.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOME EARLY VICTORIES FOR A NEW SECRETARY
</P>
<P>
   Albright's accession as secretary of state, which made her the
highest-ranking woman in American history, prompted enormous
popular and media interest. She attracted attention for her newly
discovered Jewish background as well as for successful efforts to
expand NATO and to her push to articulate a more forceful U.S.
position than her dry, quiet predecessor, Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
   She quickly earned respect from her French, Russian, Chinese and
Arab colleagues. Early victories in Congress were hailed, and she
has won important policy shifts on Iran and Cuba, while helping to
prevent a trade war with Europe over sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   But with domestic problems undercutting Clinton's international
credibility, U.S. foreign policy seems ever more reactive. And with
the bombing of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, followed by
missile strikes in Afghanistan and Sudan, with civil war in Kosovo,
nuclear tests by India and Pakistan, Russian economic and political
problems and the unresolved crisis in Iraq flaring again, the world
seems a more dangerous and unstable place than when Albright came
to office.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's greatest virtues _ clarity and an intelligent,
forceful voice that connects with the public and Congress _ have
not diminished, said a senior White House official who admires her.
But as the administration faces diverse and less manageable
problems, many due to Asia's economic problems, ``her virtues seem
less impressive or timely,'' the official said, ``because neither
economics nor strategy are her strengths, and her depth lies in
European issues, not Asian ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Albright's hard work with Congress _ in particular with
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. _ has not yet produced a deal to repay
Washington's debt to the United Nations or the International
Monetary Fund, both described as high priorities by her aides.
Compromises have been stymied by a fight with House Republicans
over abortion policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My predecessors had a different world to deal with in which
the parameters were fairly set,'' Albright said. ``They had the
possibility of focusing all their attention on one or two issues.''
By contrast, she said, she is trying to ``put into play a lot of
issues that I see as challenges we're facing,'' like nuclear
nonproliferation, economics and the effective use of sanctions,
issues that were at the center of a January review of priorities.
</P>
<P>
   LAND MINES AND WAR CRIMES
</P>
<P>
   Albright has failed to achieve some of the human-rights goals
she described as among the most important to her. She was an early
champion of a ban on land mines. Last year, however, in Ottawa the
United States was nearly alone in opposing a treaty.
</P>
<P>
   As a Central European whose family fled first the Nazis and then
the Communists, she has been especially concerned about crimes
against humanity. She created an ambassador for war crimes and
lobbied for a permanent international tribunal to prosecute them.
</P>
<P>
   But at a Rome conference to accomplish that goal, the United
States was part of a small minority refusing to sign a treaty to
create a permanent tribunal. In both cases, the Pentagon and
Congress successfully argued that the United States required
special exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she continues to champion her principles, but she
cannot forget America's responsibilities. ``I have to balance
enunciating the principles and leading the way with the pragmatism
of getting things done and the power of the United States,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is now a new expression in diplomatic circles _ ``to
pull an Ottawa'' _ which means to promote a new initiative and then
abandon it at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's fierce rhetorical battles with the Iraqis at the
United Nations helped catapult her into the secretary's elegant
office. And in a corridor leading off from it, she keeps a comic
shrine, a collection of cartoons, newspaper cuttings and other
mementos of her tussles with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But the Iraq problem persists. The latest crisis is an outgrowth
of last March's inconclusive standoff that did little for the
reputation of Clinton's foreign-policy team.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq continues to serve as a reminder of the limits of U.S.
power in the post-Soviet world with difficulties in orchestrating
allies and of the continuing reluctance of Clinton to use force in
risky circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   THE BIG FIASCO IN COLUMBUS
</P>
<P>
   But the televised ``town hall'' meeting in Columbus, Ohio, was
the most visible fiasco. Albright, National Security Adviser Sandy
Berger and Defense Secretary William Cohen were unable to silence
hecklers or to sound convincing about why a nearly isolated United
States might need to bomb Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio meeting, organized by the White House to use Albright's
skills and popularity, began the erosion of her reputation among
the foreign-policy elite of which she has been a member for so
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look around the world for the big challenges now,
where's the secretary of state?'' asked Robert Zoellick, former
under secretary of state for James Baker, who enjoyed a level of
influence over his president, George Bush, that seems denied to
Albright. ``To an outsider, she's MIA. People run issues case by
case, but there's a sense the show is being managed by Berger.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration manages crises but has no clear strategic
framework, Zoellick said. ``How do different problems relate to one
another? It starts with the president, but it's not her forte or
Berger's. If you don't have a sense of where you want to take the
country, you won't get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mandelbaum, who criticized Clinton's first-term foreign
policy as ``social work,'' thinks the current team is doing
decently at managing the smaller crises of the post-Cold War world,
which have less to do with national security and diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly in this second presidential term, by far the most
important figures in foreign policy'' are Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin and his deputy, Lawrence Summers, Mandelbaum said. ``For that
we should be grateful. A world with a financial crisis is far safer
than a world with a military crisis, and they've been doing pretty
well. ``But Albright doesn't seem to be a player in all this,''
said Mandelbaum.

<P>
   SUCCESS WITH CHINA: WHO GETS CREDIT?
</P>
<P>
   Richard Haass of the Brookings Institution, who was a staff
member of the National Security Council under Bush, said ``the one
significant accomplishment in the second term'' has been to renew
relations with China. ``There you can see a policy initiative and
presidential investment,'' he said. ``One senses that the engine
for that has been the president and the National Security
Council.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Albright defended her involvement and that of
her strong team in the full range of foreign policy, from Asia and
China to Iran and Cuba. On financial matters, she said, she has
been working to ensure that the diplomatic, human and security
aspects are fully grasped.
</P>
<P>
   As a former academic, she has been happy to reach down to the
regional assistant secretaries and to urge them ``to think outside
the box,'' wanting career officers to compete for ideas with
outsiders. She has encouraged Under Secretaries Thomas Pickering
and Stuart Eizenstat, and Deputy Secretary Strobe Talbott, ``to
drive policy and make things happen,'' an official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic issues we have brought right into the department,''
Albright said, ``and we have an under secretary who's strong _ Stu
Eizenstat _ really working on sanctions issues and on trying to
meld the financial with the assistance part of the Asian financial
crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   She has pushed hard, as she promised him she would, Eizenstat
said, to make the State Department a serious player again on
economic issues. Treasury gets the headlines over Asia, he said,
``but we and she have been intimately involved with the
humanitarian and political dimensions.''
</P>
<P>
   She is confident about her managing role as secretary of state,
as the prime foreign policy spokesman for the administration and as
a formulator of key policy. And she rejects the notion that
Clinton's choice of Richard Holbrooke for chief delegate to the
United Nations, who was said to have been a candidate for the job
before Albright was chosen, is a sign her own star is waning or
wanting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is what it is,'' she said, shrugging. ``People
think you're terrific, and then they think you're too terrific, so
then they let you know that you're not. You can't be in a position
of being the visible voice for the United States and not be out
there to be praised and criticized.''
</P>
<P>
   ALBRIGHT A SURVIVOR OF THE DUKAKIS DAYS
</P>
<P>
   Albright and Berger have a friendship dating back to the
presidential campaign of Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, when
Albright was the chief foreign policy adviser to a candidate who
took almost unremitting heat for not having a strong foreign policy
view. Despite moments of annoyance, usually over personnel,
presidential briefings or second-guessing about the results of
specific diplomatic missions, they are each other's closest
advisers. They hash out policy in advance and speak many times a
day _ in sharp contrast to the tension between Christopher and
Anthony Lake, or the raging warfare under Jimmy Carter between
Cyrus Vance and Zbigniew Brzezinski.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the foreign-policy president who wakes up thinking
what notes he can pen to his foreign colleagues,'' a senior
administration official said, a reference, apparently, to Bush, who
was famous for his hand-written correspondence to world leaders.
``So Berger becomes the guy who doesn't make foreign policy so much
as broker it.''
</P>
<P>
   In meetings, another senior White House official said, ``she is
pragmatic and a consensus-builder, like Berger, despite her
reputation outside as an uncompromising, six-gun shooting
moralist.'' She arrives well-briefed and armed with a collective
department view, in contrast to Cohen, whose well-armed Pentagon
often gets its way regardless. She is ``articulate on issues she
knows well, and tends to put aside the talking points and draw from
her own experience, and she's best when she does that.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright dealt movingly with the emotional and security crisis
surrounding the bombing of the two U.S. embassies and the deaths of
many of her employees, and she has handled Clinton's personal
troubles with dignity.
</P>
<P>
   TAKING IT EASY ON THE IRANIANS
</P>
<P>
   But her finest policy moment lately has been a shift in the
treatment of Iran after the election of the moderate Mohammad
Khatami as president. While maintaining demands for a halt to
terrorism and a halt to Iran's nuclear, chemical and missile
programs, she pushed Clinton to a more receptive Iran policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard and she had internal criticism, but she got it
done with Sandy and the president,'' avoiding an interagency
battle, an official said. After her recent speech laying out the
new policy _ to which Iran has not yet responded _ the president
took her aside to congratulate her, she said, ``for threading the
needle.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, she used contacts with the pope, Congress and Cuban
exiles in Miami to allow direct relief flights from the United
States to Cuba to resume and to allow relatives to send money.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is also praised for her work with Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov, which helped forge a new relationship
between NATO and Russia. At one point, aides remember, as Primakov
argued for secondary military status for new NATO members, Albright
said: ``Neither the president nor I will negotiate over the heads
of the peoples of Central Europe. That happened once before, and
it's not going to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov was silent, then diverted the conversation, and never
pressed the issue so hard again, the aides say.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian policy is generally run by Talbott and is dominated
by the economic and political crisis, making Primakov _ and
Albright _ less important.
</P>
<P>
   Albright also pushed the Pentagon to act more decisively in
support of political goals in Bosnia and to keep troops there
without a deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Her conversations with Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic
were crucial in encouraging her to challenge Radovan Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
   On Kosovo, she argues that _ unlike in Bosnia _ Washington and
NATO were involved early and got Europe to act. A resolution is not
yet clear, she says, but the ground is prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is also proud of using her unprecedented telephone
relationship with the Chinese foreign minister to organize the
Permanent Five to condemn nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. At
their June meeting in Geneva, she told the others that they are
``always talking about a multipolar and not a unipolar world.''
This was their chance to prove it, she said, ``so one country
doesn't take a principled stand and the others sign up the
contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   SHE WILL AWAIT HISTORY'S JUDGMENT
</P>
<P>
   With all the ``profound ideological confusion'' facing a
post-Cold War secretary of state, said Moises Naim, editor of
Foreign Policy, this is not a period for ``grand strategy.''
Albright's role, he said, is inevitably one of a goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   But secretaries of state are often defined by challenges. Baker,
for instance, had a great crisis thrust upon him, the Persian Gulf
War, and a great opportunity, the collapse of Communism.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Albright has not had such a test or made such an
opportunity of Asia or Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't operate on the basis of instant gratification on any
part of my daily work,'' she said. ``The policies that are being
put into place are longer term. It may be the next secretary of
state will reap the rewards of what I've done. Sitting in this
chair you get the sense that you are a part of history.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted her recent induction into the Women's Hall of Fame.
``When they say I'm the highest-ranking woman in the history of the
United States, that's pretty amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Kipper of the Council on Foreign Relations, while a
fierce critic of U.S. Middle East policy, praises Albright for
showing the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can be soft with her children, motherly and nice and go
shopping and be all the things a decent person can be, Ms. Kipper
said, ``but when it comes to the work, she's tough and serious.
There's no gender in the work.''

   MEXICO CITY _ The demons of financial crisis are haunting Latin
America again, unleashed by tumult in Russia, Japan and now the
United States. Markets and currencies across the continent are
sinking as panicky investors retreat to the safe haven of U.S.
treasury bonds and dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the major Latin economies are far better fortified to
withstand the external battering than they were four years ago,
when a disastrous devaluation in Mexico engulfed several Latin
American economies into what economists, investors and politicians
called the tequila effect. Since then Mexico and Brazil have taken
sober measures to build foreign reserves and control inflation
while Argentina and Chile persevered in tough programs already in
place.
</P>
<P>
   Among the big players, only Venezuela failed to buckle down to
austerity and now is paying the price in a full-blown emergency,
with reserves dropping, short-term bank interest rates soaring to
120 percent and the stock market off 37 percent this month.
</P>
<P>
   Since most of the underlying economies are solid, the market
turmoil might have a milder effect in Latin America than alarming
appearances at the moment augur, economists and analysts said. But
they cautioned that if markets outside the region continue to dive
for long, or if investors flee the emerging markets en masse
without regard to the strengths of individual countries, the
outcome could be devastating.
</P>
<P>
   And if the U.S. market slide results in a sluggish U.S. economy,
the damage will be even greater in Latin America, which sends most
of its exports to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove the point, on a day when the Dow Jones Industrial
Average plummeted 512.61 points, or 6.37 percent, the Mexican stock
market was down 5.14 percent. Mexico canceled a regular Monday
auction of government treasury bills, known as CETEs, saying that
``the offers received were not consistent with the macroeconomic
situation of the country.'' It was the first time the auction was
canceled since the grim days in the wake of the 1994 devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   The leading index of Brazilian stocks was off by 4.06 percent.
Even the stock market in stolid Chile was off 3.01 per cent.
Venezuela, surprisingly, was not hit, with its stock market in a
modest rally of .18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latin America is the good neighbor in a bad neighborhood,''
said Riordan Roett, director of the Western Hemisphere program at
Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C. The region's countries
``should not be affected, but they will be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Hernandez, a top economist at the Instituto
Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico, said, ``Nobody has any really
perfect defenses. This is the challenge of the smaller economies in
a globalized world.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the region's problems were largely self-inflicted, and
the United States, then growing robustly, and the International
Monetary Fund were ready to step in with loans to help. Now Latin
America is paying for mistakes made in Moscow and Tokyo, which
rattled the markets and also sent prices for many key Latin
commodities, like wheat and oil, to their lowest real rates in
decades. And neither the United States nor the cash-strapped IMF
can do much to rescue any country here.

 MEXICO CITY: any country here.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mexico has done the most to clean up since 1994. Although the
peso has slipped (it recovered slightly Monday to 10.02 cents, up
.4 percent), most analysts believe it is fairly valued. Oil
revenues make up 37 percent of the government's income, and
President Ernesto Zedillo responded quickly to the drop in
petroleum prices by slashing the federal budget three times,
maintaining a modest deficit of about 1.25 per cent of the gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Growth, which boomed in the first half of the year, is expected
to slow through next year but remain healthy. The government is
still promising growth of more than 5 per cent this year, but
economists have revised their estimates down to 4 percent to a low
of 2.3 percent, by Bursametrica Management in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates climbed Monday to 38 percent for the overnight
Cete. But after the drubbing that Mexican banks and indebted
citizens took in 1994, far fewer loans are out there now. Foreign
reserves have remained at record highs, with the influx of
long-term investment in factories and infrastructure, which now
accounts for about 70 percent of all foreign investment, helping to
keep them there.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's big weak spot is its ailing banking system. The
national Congress, which will open a new session next week, remains
angrily divided about how to pay for an multibillion dollar bank
bailout. On Sunday, 3 million Mexicans turned out to vote against
the government's proposal in a symbolic referendum organized by an
opposition party, the Party of the Democratic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very far from classifying as a crisis,'' said Jonathan
Heath, an economist with LatinSource Mexico. ``There is a lot of
noise, a psychological crisis. But while the financial markets are
reflecting what is happening in the rest of the world, the real
economy continues to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, political factors are central. At the outset of the
Asian financial crisis last October, Brazil President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso marshaled through a package of reforms that
doubled interest rates and imposed steep tax increases and spending
cuts. But the fiscal deficit remains at nearly 7 percent of the
economy. The Brazilian currency, called the real, is traded within
a fixed band and is said by analysts to be overvalued by at least
10 percent. The Central Bank said that $7.7 billion left the
country in the four weeks before Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   But Cardoso appears to determined to forestall any devaluation
and even cut interest rates, at least until after the Oct. 4
elections. Polls show that he is likely to win a second four-year
term easily in the first round. Brazil has huge foreign reserves of
about $72 billion, and several valuable government properties to
sell in a crunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to face this crisis, as always, calmly without
any new package, without any scares,'' Cardoso told reporters in a
brief appearance Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela faces the most severe problems, analysts say,
primarily because neither of the two most prominent candidates in
presidential elections in December hold much promise of bringing
tough solutions to a wayward economy. The front-runner, Hugo
Chavez, 44, is running on a populist platform of broadside
repudiation of the country's political elite for years of economic
instability.
</P>
<P>
   Another contender is a former Miss Universe, Irene Saez, who is
36 and has no experience in economics.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela has done little to reduce its dependence on petroleum,
which accounts for three-quarters of all exports.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, economists are worried that investors'
confidence will be so shattered by a new round of losses in the
emerging markets that Latin countries will have trouble returning
to the international markets for help to pay their debts next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a long time before investors can differentiate and
say that Brazil is different from Russia. We could be in for a
period when nobody is willing to touch the emerging markets,'' said
Sylvia Maxfield, an emerging markets strategist at Lehman Brothers.

COMMENTARY: HATRED COMES IN ALL COLORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Note language in 8th and 9th grafs.) 
(lb) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Raising hypothetical ``what ifs'' is an often
pointless exercise, but every once in a while it is necessary, even
unavoidable. So here goes.
</P>
<P>
   What if leaders of the Aryan Nation, those rocket scientists
convinced that blacks are an inferior race, were to announce that
they were storming into New York City to lead hordes of young
whites on a march affirming their self-esteem and calling attention
to issues of concern to Caucasians? What if they went out of their
way to invite neo-Nazi skinheads, who, besides not being brain
surgeons themselves, might arrive armed to the proverbial teeth?
</P>
<P>
   What is your best bet about what would then happen?
</P>
<P>
   Would most public figures in this normally liberal city _
whether black, white, Hispanic, Asian or whatever _ raise high the
shield of the First Amendment and harrumph about the need to
separate an important message from the objectionable messenger?
</P>
<P>
   Or would they agree with the late Justice Robert Jackson of the
U.S. Supreme Court that the Constitution is not a suicide pact?
Would they vigorously denounce any event brought to this ethnically
fragile city by hatemongers, and ask the mayor to make sure it
takes place under conditions that protect public safety?
</P>
<P>
   The betting here is that if it were the Klan coming to town, you
would not gather enough First Amendment purists to fill a subway
car. Why should it be any different with a march organized by
certified hatemongers who happen to be black?
</P>
<P>
   That is why the betting here, too, is that many New Yorkers side
with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani when it comes to the so-called Million
Youth March for blacks being arranged for Saturday in Harlem _ with
a special invitation extended to armed black gangs from around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The lead marcher, Khalid Abdul Muhammad, has a record of vicious
bigotry that is nothing short of breathtaking. Correction: make
that stomach-turning. This is a man who publicly calls the pope a
``cracker'' and homosexuals ``faggots,'' who talks about the
``peckerwood Jesus'' and advocates the massacre of South African
whites.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing compares with his hatred of Jews, whether he refers to
``the Jew-nited Nations in Jew York City'' or to the ``hook-nosed,
bagel-eating, lox-eating, perpetrating-a-fraud so-called Jew.'' And
Muhammad is just clearing his throat.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, for one, refuses to separate message from messenger,
and he has not shrunk from attacking the ``hate march'' or
lambasting political leaders who get wishy-washy about Muhammad and
what he stands for. ``The problem is when good people do nothing
about hatred, and equivocate about it,'' he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday should be an important day in this affair. Federal
appellate judges will hear arguments from the Giuliani
administration, which prefers Randalls Island to Harlem as a site
for the march and wants the date switched to Sept. 19 instead of
the Labor Day weekend, which is crowded with events that may
overtax the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a U.S. District Court judge ruled against the mayor,
saying that First Amendment imperatives called for the event to be
held this Saturday and in Harlem, where Muhammad and Company can
more easily ``get their message across.'' Fair enough, some
disinterested New Yorkers would say. Giuliani has a habit of
interpreting free-speech rights far more generously when he agrees
with the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor never said the march could not take place, just
that it should be on a date and in a place where the police feel
reasonably confident about preserving public safety. Given the
possible presence of gun-toting gang members, his concern is not
out of left field.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Randalls Island and Sept. 19 did not come to Giuliani in a
dream. The organizers themselves had suggested that time and place
as a possibility when they first asked for a city permit, months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Questions have been raised about whether the mayor was
tactically wise to go after Muhammad as he did, thus giving him
publicity that he could not have hoped to buy. But Michael Meyers,
executive director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition and a man
who has tangled with Giuliani at times, says the mayor was right
when he decided that one element of leadership is labeling a
pernicious bigot for what he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leadership is required,'' Meyers said, ``to tell young people
that this is a racial hustle.''

 &HT;    Gore stumps in Ohio for Democratic proposals
 &HT;    (EDS: Corrects with headline.)

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Two Al Gores visited Dayton on Monday _ an
intellectual policy wonk who chatted about educational reform at a
Dayton public school and a partisan pulpit pounder who preached to
the Democratic choir.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke at Dayton's Carlson Elementary School to rev up
support for a new Clinton administration proposal to provide $140
million nationwide to mentor at-risk students to stay in school and
go to college.
</P>
<P>
   Touring with Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Mary Boyle, Gore
told hundreds of students, teachers and local officials he wanted
to have a ``conversation about what it's like to go back to
school.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked to Carlson students about being safe in school and
using modern technology to prepare for the jobs of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of jobs that used to emphasize muscle power now
emphasize brain power,'' Gore told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   From there his limousine caravan headed to a Boyle fund-raiser
at the Dayton Convention Center, where a stream of Democratic
candidates and officeholders had addressed a crowd of 240 people.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Coleman, candidate for lieutenant governor, said Ohioans
are feeling disenfranchised under the Republican administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio gubernatorial race between Democrat Fisher and
Republican Bob Taft ``is about who is going to stand on the side of
working families,'' Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Cordray, who would like to replace Betty Montgomery as
Ohio attorney general, accused his opponent of defending an
indefensible school funding system, overseeing a $4 million
settlement to Lucasville prisoners and failing to vigorously
enforce discrimination and environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   With a mixture of jokes and challenges, Gore:
</P>
<P>
   Called on local Democrats to stop ceding the political call-in
radio shows to their zealous opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Blasted the Republican party as a group where ``the right hand
doesn't know what the far-right hand is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Abruptly diverged mid-speech to praise his boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud to serve with President Bill Clinton,'' he said.
``This country is a better place because of Bill Clinton's
policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyle used both events to drive home a message that her
opponent, Gov. George Voinovich, has done little while Ohio's
schools fell into disrepair. She said she would work on federal
programs to support local schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Voinovich did not deliver on his promise to be the
education governor, and he failed the 1.8 million public school
children in Ohio who counted on him,'' she said. ``Let's rate him
an 'F' for not fulfilling his promises.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Voinovich, she said, the percentage of state support for
education declined, the drop-out rate rose and Ohio got poor marks
for the condition of its school buildings, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She called for hiring 100,000 additional teachers, reducing
class size and creating more vocational and college opportunities
for students.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich's campaign Monday rejected the criticism by Boyle, a
Cuyahoga County commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing new with Mary Boyle,'' said Voinovich campaign
spokeswoman Caryn Candisky. ``She continues to attack the governor,
she has little to say on education and no record to speak of.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boyle fundraiser brought in about $20,000 for her campaign,
according to campaign officials.
</P>
<P>
   Gore urged Democrats to support Boyle vigorously and to work as
hard as Republicans in being heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question falls to us: Are we willing to match their
intensity with some of our own?'' Gore said.

INSTITUTIONAL TRADING POUNDS BLUE-CHIPS, SMALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Institutional investors unloaded big blocks of stock at
virtually any price, pounding both blue-chip and small-company
stocks and driving the market down 6.4 percent Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In panic selling that accelerated late in the day, institutional
investors of all stripes _ mutual funds, high-risk hedge funds, and
Wall Street investment banks _ created a market exodus that
heightened fears that a bear market in US stocks may be in the
works.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's steep decline of 512 points brought the four-day
decline in the Dow Jones industrial average to more than 1,000
points. But Monday was distinguished by the large volume of block
trades by billion-dollar institutional investors, market watchers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors ``were executing (sell) orders indiscriminate of the
price,'' said James Weiss, deputy head of equities for State Street
Research &AMP; Management, a Boston investment company with $52 billion
in assets of institutions and wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Institutions are banging the blue chips. Whether it's `Get me
out' because redemptions are coming or `Get me out' because I'm
protecting my performance _ I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, blue-chip stocks were hammered. Houston-based Dell
Computer Co., a darling of institutions, fell a whopping 18 3/4,
closing at 100. Retailer Dayton Hudson Corp. dropped 7 3/16,
closing at 36 3/4. Even drug companies, whose record profits had
protected them from the market declines, were in the selloff:
Warner-Lambert Co.'s stock fell 9 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Only long-term investors of pension funds or university
endowments seemed to sit on the sidelines. Their calm in managing
mega-billion dollar portfolios may have been the biggest factor in
keeping the market in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're long-term investors,'' said Scott Henderson, executive
director of the Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment Mangement
Board. Nearly half of the $24 billion fund is in stocks. ``We're
sticking to the plan,'' Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   But even individual investors who have stoically watched the
stock market decline from its July 17 high have become increasingly
nervous about their stock mutual funds. When mutual fund investors,
en masse, order their portfolio managers to sell their stake in the
fund, managers are forced to sell stock in big blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual fund
investment company, said volume at its high-tech phone centers was
so high that the Boston company was forced to recruit executives to
help telephone operators take calls.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity is among numerous fund companies that have reported
outflows in August, as investors shift their money from fund
companies' stock funds to more conservative bond or money-market
funds. That trend continued Monday. Although Fidelity would not
disclose the size of outflows from stock funds, ``it's very modest
relative to our size,'' said spokeswoman Jessica Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of blocks of stock by index funds in the last half-hour of
trading were also blamed for a precipitous 300-point drop during
that period short period before the market closes. Index funds
typically buy or sell securities at the end of the trading day to
adjust portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's selling may triggered by portfolio managers' need
to meet redemptions by individual investors _ or anticipated
redemptions.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's second-biggest mutual fund, managed by the Vanguard
Group, saw outflow of cash for the first time in years, said Gus
Sauter, who oversees the Valley Forge, Pa., company's group of
equity index funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Vanguard Index Trust, a $60 billion fund designed to track
the performance of the S&AMP;P 500 stock index, had ``very minor
outflows today. That's the first time'' since 1994, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the downward pressure, block sales by index funds
``kicked off'' arbitraging by sophisticated investors seeking quick
profits, said Michael Roth, chief executive of USAA Investment
Management Co. in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Investors such as New York investment banks arbitrage by buying
futures contracts and selling the actual indexes to make profits on
the differences in their prices. ``The spreads are so narrow they
leap on it so fast and they wrench a few bucks out of the market,''
Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds that had big bets in emerging markets from Singapore
to Russia have also been forced to sell their stock at firesale
prices to cover losses in overseas markets, investment managers
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're highly leveraged,'' said one investor who spoke on
condition his name be withheld. When the emerging markets ``break
down and they're highly leveraged, they go through their equity
position and have to unwind.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is no longer simply the high-risk investors who are
moving the market. Trades executed by individual investors through
brokerage houses also have increased.
</P>
<P>
   The brokerage division of USAA Investment hit record levels in
apparent selling by individual investors. The volume of trades hit
3,500 _ nearly double the average daily volume, said Roth.
</P>
<P>
   Roth declined to comment on the nature of the
transactions. &UR;  &LR; ``We'll have to see how the dust clears to see where
we really are.''

 By CONSTANCE C.R. WHITE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Several years ago, about the worst epithet a fashion
insider could fling at Ralph Lauren in the face of his undeniable
success was to describe him as a stylist. To call a designer a
stylist _ the implication being that one's talent is not in
creating clothes, but in presenting them _ is no longer a barb. The
wall between the two is crumbling, as more stylists become the
creative forces behind collections and more successful collections
resemble the work of a good stylist.
</P>
<P>
   A stylist's responsibility is not well understood. The job
ranges from suggesting how a designer might combine a jacket and
skirt for a runway show, to choosing the clothes a rap star will
wear in a video or to the MTV Music Awards, to selecting clothes
for magazine advertisements and editorial fashion features. Many
combine all the roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stylists help designers complete ideas, and they're very good
at helping you with things you don't always have time to think
about,'' said Hussein Chalayan, a designer who works with a
stylist, Jane Howe. ``They also see a lot of clothes. And they
become like a sounding board.''
</P>
<P>
   As design houses go global, seeking to sell a look with
widespread appeal through provocative but easily translatable
images, the idea of a person who can set the mood for a collection,
or suggest just the right shoes to finish off an outfit, has
ballooned in importance. This development pleases many, but it is
also setting off alarm bells.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become very strong in the last three years,'' said Franca
Sozzani, editor in chief of Italian Vogue. ``Years ago, I don't
remember so many designers calling and asking me who are the best
stylists, and so many designers calling me after shows to complain
about stylists.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not just designers who are fueling the demand for
stylists, who can earn from $1,000 to $10,000 a day. Now, they are
sometimes even attracting investors willing to back them in design
businesses. In the last six months, three stylists have become the
creative heads of companies: Josh Patner is co-designer for his
company, Tuleh; Tony Melillo does the same for Nova, and Alexandra
White is creative director for Tocca.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Bartlett, who with Ms. White, Ms. Ward and Joe McKenna
is among the top stylists today, has put together a deal with
Nigoria of Japan to create her own lingerie line to be sold in
shops bearing her name, for which she will also select other
merchandise. The opening of the shops, originally scheduled for
November, is on hold because of the Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Patner, who styled for Donna Karan, Byblos, Nicole Miller and
L'Uomo Vogue before crossing over to become a designer, said that
the rising status of stylists reflects the accelerated pace of
fashion. ``The media demands on fashion have generated a need for
more change than fashion inherently has,'' Patner said. ``The
designers need stylists to push them farther than they might go.''
</P>
<P>
   Many designers have stopped designing and become product
managers, he added. Stylists help them shape an international
style. Quite simply, good style travels better than good design.
The advent of global businesses has meant that designers need
someone who can bring the advantage of wide travel and the
knowledge of what's going on in other design rooms. Not that all
designers necessarily want to copy, but they need to know what the
pulse at that moment is.
</P>
<P>
   No designer with global ambitions ever simply says, ``I'm
selling a design.'' They're selling a life style, and stylists
understand best how to capture a look, particularly from the
streets, at a time when street influence is important.
</P>
<P>
   Some of today's most successful designers are natural stylists
and blur the line between design and styling on the runway. Tom
Ford of Gucci, Marc Jacobs and Narciso Rodriguez play as much with
mood and how separate pieces are put together as they do with the
cut of an armhole. The 1990s may well be remembered as the age of
the stylist in fashion. The previous decade was an era of designers
whose clothes spoke definitively by themselves: the color and drape
of an Armani suit, the fringe of a Chanel outfit by Karl Lagerfeld,
the pouf of a Christian Lacroix skirt, the shirring of an Emmanuel
Ungaro dress.
</P>
<P>
   But it was stylists, at the beginning of the '90s, who were at
the heart of the minimalist movement, which displaced many of these
big guns. Spreading their point of view from design room to design
room, stylists played an important role in banning accessories from
the runway and from magazine spreads.
</P>
<P>
   Once it was thought that as minimalism receded, so too would
stylists' influence. But that has not been the case, and in part it
is thanks to the rise of the Hollywood celebrity and the pop music
star in fashion. Stylists have proved to be fashion's most direct
link to celebrities, exerting an influence on how they dress and
serving as de facto gatekeepers to the stars. Designers often get
their clothes on celebrities by going through stylists, whom
celebrities trust more in matters of dress than they do agents or
publicity people. Stylists like Derek Khan, who does most of his
work for singers like Monica and Lauryn Hill, and Melanie Ward and
Ms. Bartlett, who have dressed stars for music videos and public
appearances, offer designers an inside track. In turn, their clout
is enhanced.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Khan confirmed that designers court him because of his
connections to stars. Charles Klein, a lawyer specializing in
fashion at the firm Davidoff &AMP; Malito, who is Khan's business
manager, said potential business backers are interested in his
client for the same reason. ``If you look at the people who are
growing in today's market, they have that mix of music or sports or
one or the other,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   The stylists' rise has not so much eclipsed designers _ who have
never been known to give up a minute in the spotlight _ but design
itself. Some fashion insiders noted that several designers now seem
to be listening to the same stylists, blurring the differences
between their collections, or they approach their collections the
way stylists do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take out the labels and you don't know the difference,''
said Ms. Sozzani, who expressed chagrin with the widespread use and
influence of stylists. ``Some stylists are great, and I understand
you want to compare your opinion with other people _ the stylist is
very important in this way. But the risk is everything becomes the
same. It's making a lot of confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bartlett, who has worked as a stylist for both Miuccia Prada
and Donatella Versace, agreed that sometimes designers lean too
heavily on stylists. She even praised Ms. Prada's recent decision
to banish stylists this past season.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ward was unhappily at the center of a petite drama in
styling two years ago when, working for both Helmut Lang and Calvin
Klein, she was accused by some of making Klein's collection look
startlingly derivative of Lang's. There were similarities of color,
of cut, and the use of T-shirts instead of shirts. ``I never
consciously styled them the same,'' Ms. Ward said. ``I remember I
raised it with Helmut, and he was very supportive and I appreciate
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lang, unlike some designers, is candid about Ms. Ward's
contribution to his collections, which she now works on exclusively
when not occupied as a fashion editor at Harper's Bazaar. In an
article about her own wardrobe in this month's Harper's Bazaar, she
is called a stylist and design consultant, two job descriptions she
believes are interchangeable these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some designers have made a distinct point of not using
stylists,'' Ms. Ward said. ``For me, a stylist is a major part of
the support system for a designer. But a sign of professionalism is
to know when to stop. It's a question of integrity. You respect
them and their style.''

 &HT;    Wired kids alert mayor of city's missing money

<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ When you're running a city, you can use all
the help you can get.
</P>
<P>
   So Mayor Carol Hanson was plenty pleased when she got a letter
from a constituent pointing out that the city was owed $700 in
unclaimed money. Even if the letter did begin, ``Dear Mr. Mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My name is Richie Behlog,'' the letter read. ``I am 12 years
old. I live in Boca Raton, Fla. I was on the Internet and found
this unclaimed money that belongs to you. My mom said I should send
it to you. So I am. I hope I am the first person to tell you about
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Richie was the first person to bring the money to the
mayor's attention, although the city had been investigating any
unclaimed cash it was owed, city revenue accountant Nicole Gasparri
said. Richie and his 11-year-old brother, Anthony, were the first
to notice money owed to the Boca Raton Chamber of Commerce and West
Boca Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would just sit there all day,'' Anthony said. ``It was
exciting. We got to find all kinds of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Richie and Anthony have been avid Internet explorers for several
years, and have not yet tired of finding other people's money for
the sheer fun of it. They began their fiduciary quest in August,
when a friend of the Behlogs from New York said he had found the
family's name on a list of people owed unclaimed cash.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Richie and Anthony were spending their last days before
school searching the www.findcash.com Web site. Besides the $700
belonging to Boca, the brothers turned up $130 belonging to Boca
Raton High and about $600 belonging to the Boca Pops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unclaimed cash'' can come from a variety of sources, according
to a Florida Department of Banking and Finance spokeswoman: ``It
could be anything _ old bank accounts, insurance policies, payroll
checks.''
</P>
<P>
   Since school started, Richie and Anthony have been spending less
time on-line and more time in the classroom. But their late-summer,
on-line exploits have already gained the attention of some
prominent adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, am I ever impressed,'' Hanson wrote in her letter to
Richie. ``You are a wonderful citizen to take the time and trouble
and have the interest to help out our city.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's parliament emphatically rejected President
Boris Yeltsin's choice for prime minister after a rancorous debate
on Monday, leaving the nation virtually rudderless in the midst of
its deepening economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Chernomyrdin implored lawmakers to approve his
appointment as prime minister, saying that he urgently needed to
start forming a new government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia today is, in essence, on the verge of economic and
political breakdown,'' he declared on a day in which Russia was
still struggling to halt the slide of its currency and prevent the
collapse of its banking and financial system. ``Russia should not
be without a government.''
</P>
<P>
   But the appeal drew jeers from the Communist-led opposition,
which controls the lower house of Parliament. In the first of as
many as three votes on his nomination, they rejected Chernomyrdin
by a vote of 253 to 94 with the help of the other left-wing
parties, the nationalists and the liberal opposition. Chernomyrdin
needed 226 votes in the 450-seat Parliament to be approved but got
only the support of his own party and an assortment of
independents.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists' strategy seemed to be discredit the Yeltsin
government in the hope that the embattled president would finally
be driven to resign or at least agree to a more generous
power-sharing arrangement. The lopsided rejection also seemed aimed
at torpedoing Chernomyrdin's claim that only he could unify the
splintered nation and serve as Yeltsin's heir.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin demonstrated on Monday night that he was also ready
to engage in political brinksmanship, as he has so many times in
the past. The president immediately renominated Chernomyrdin and
his advisers warned that the parliament would be dissolved if it
refused to yield, a worrisome prospect for many deputies who have
grown comfortable with the free apartments and other perquisites of
their office and might fear a national election.
</P>
<P>
   That set the stage for a new round of horse-trading over
government posts and policies in the days ahead. If parliament
rejects Yeltsin's choice for prime minister three times, it would
enable the president to dissolve the body and call for new
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Boris Yeltsin wants Viktor Chernomyrdin to become
the prime minister, and I do not recall a case such as this where
he has changed his mind,'' said Boris Berezovsky, the tycoon who
has sought to orchestrate Chernomyrdin's return to power.
Berezovsky should know: It was his opposition that Yeltsin defied
just four months ago through three confirmation battles in the
parliament to put Sergei Kiriyenko into the prime minister's job
from which he was dismissed last week.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of a Russian-American summit, the angry standoff left
the United States facing a meeting with a determined but embattled
Russian leadership with no real government in place and the
prospect of political, as well as economic, implosion growing by
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's acrimony marked an abrupt end to days of lofty talk of
compromise and coalition government designed to secure a bloodless
confirmation for Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got all the consent,'' Chernomyrdin complained to reporters
after Monday's debate. ``And all of sudden everything is
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Communist lawmakers said on Monday that the negotiations broke
down over a deadline for enacting amendments to the constitution
that shift some power from the executive branch to the legislature,
among other power-sharing arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Shokhin, the leader of Chernomyrdin's parliamentary
faction, suggested that the acting prime minister might still be
able to mollify the Communist opposition and salvage his
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Shokhin suggested that Chernomyrdin might identify his cabinet
choices and spell out his economic policy before the next vote on
his nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The idea would be to reassure wary lawmakers that if he became
prime minister, he would honor his promises to left-wing
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Market reformers warned that there was a danger that
Chernomyrdin might now go too far in trying to placate the
Communists.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Anatoly Chubais, who was dismissed from his post as the Yeltsin
government's negotiator with the International Monetary Fund,
warned that the Kremlin would be making a grave mistake if it gave
away the Finance and Economics ministries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know a single economist from the left side of the
spectrum who is capable of proposing anything reasonable to resolve
the crisis,'' Chubais said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN START HERE)
</P>
<P>
   As Russia's politicians traded insults during Monday's debate,
it was sometimes hard to tell that the nation was grasping for ways
to stem the decline of its currency, fight inflation and save its
banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Zhirninovsky, the strident nationalist, mocked
President Clinton for his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Sergei
Dubinin, the head of the Central Bank, defended a loan he received
to build a country home.
</P>
<P>
   Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist leader, complained that
Chernomyrdin's approval rating stood at a meager 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin derided his predecessor, Sergei Kiriyenko, 36, for
leading a ``kid's government'' and blamed him for the nation's
economic ills, even though most economists say Kiriyenko was
struggling to correct policies that were adopted during
Chernomyrdin's first term as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   When Chernomyrdin addressed the financial crisis, his economic
prescriptions were vague, halting and at times nearly incoherent.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the government should use credits to boost Russia's
stricken industrial sector but conceded in the same breath that the
government had no money.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Yeltsin government decision to devalue the
ruble was a mistake, but gave no hint of how he planned to prop up
the nation's sagging currency.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would not allow the banking system to collapse, but
gave no details about how he could prevent the bankruptcy of some
of the nation's leading banks.
</P>
<P>
   His dominant policy goal since being selected as prime minister
last week, he said, was simply to avoid a total financial collapse
before he formed a new government and tried to figure out what to
do. ``The important thing was to hold on until the end of August,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN END HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Before departing for the summit meeting in Russia, Clinton said
on Monday that the West should help Russia as long as it continues
to embrace capitalism, and he warned that any return to a
centralized economy would backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to do is to go there and tell them that the easy
thing to do is not the right thing to do,'' Clinton said, in an
appearance in an elementary school gymnasium in Herndon, Va., to
promote his education proposals. ``The easy thing to do would be to
try to go back the way they did it before, and it's not possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``If they will stay on the path of reform to
stabilize their society and to strengthen their economy and to get
growth back, then I believe America and the rest of the Western
nations with strong economies should help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that it was in America's interest to help the
Russians for two reasons: Because a strong Russia can play a role
in resolving regional conflicts, such as the one in Kosovo; and
because of Russia's nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want terrorists to get a hold of weapons of mass
destruction,'' he said. ``A weakened Russia, a weakened Russian
economy would put enormous pressure on people who have those
technologies and understandings to sell them. We don't want that to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Declaring that ``we are living in a smaller and smaller world,''
Clinton said that he had decided to go forward with his trip
``because we have learned the hard way that problems that develop
beyond our borders sooner or later find their way to our doorstep
unless we help our friends and our neighbors to deal with them as
quickly and promptly as possible.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Catterton Group, which took over Halston this
year amid a large scale-back in the label followed by the stormy
departure of the designer Randolph Duke, seems unsure about what to
do with the storied brand.
</P>
<P>
   After Duke left in July, the company hired Kevan Hall to replace
him. Now, it is in talks with Vera Wang to join the staff. Her
minimal evening wear is a favorite of actresses like Sharon Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Talks with Catterton began about a month or two ago, Ms. Wang
said, after Bonnie Pressman brought the sides together when Ms.
Pressman was still an executive at Barneys New York. It is not
clear how or whether Ms. Wang and Hall would work together if she
came aboard. Discussions with Ms. Wang have centered on her
designing evening and day wear, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who was the design director for Halston under Duke, said
Monday that he was not aware of talks with Ms. Wang. ``I'm taken
aback,'' he said. But he added that he would continue to work on
designs for spring 1999. ``I'm going forward with the collection,''
he said, ``and I'm staying focused on what I was brought here to
do, which is to expand the collection and fine-tune and focus it,
and return it to its original style and glamour that was Halston.''
</P>
<P>
   Designing for Halston would help Ms. Wang expand her customer
base. ``It was a big honor to be considered by them,'' she said.
``We haven't made a decision yet. We haven't said no.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Schnabel, the vice president of Catterton, declined to
comment. Melissa Krantz, a spokeswoman for the company, said, ``We
have been exploring a number of exciting opportunities, which could
include Vera Wang coming on board to Halston.'' She would not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Bergdorf Replaces Prada
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As if to prove that no one or nothing is
irreplaceable, Bergdorf Goodman has opened a Lambertson Truex
boutique on its first floor, where the Prada accessories shop used
to be. Prada, which will open a store on Sept. 12 at 724 Fifth Ave.
(56th Street), giving the label three stand-alone sites in
Manhattan, is no longer sold in Bergdorf.
</P>
<P>
   The last Prada merchandise at Bergdorf is being sold out from
the spring collection. Bergdorf and Prada decided to part ways when
the fashion house stated its intention to open down the street from
Bergdorf.
</P>
<P>
   Lambertson Truex's designs, for men and women, satisfy the need
for sleek city bags. Totes include pull-out organizers. A flat
oblong bag opens into a roomy pouch.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lambertson, who was a senior vice president for Bergdorf
and oversaw the Gucci accessories line under Dawn Mello, Bergdorf's
president, designs the collection with his partner, John Truex.
</P>
<P>
   The Lure of Orchard Street
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's one thing when low rents attract small
independent designers to the fashion frontier of Orchard Street.
But it's quite another when a successful establishment company like
Tahari takes a collection there.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Tahari, the owner of the company, plans to open a store for
Theory, his pared-down, stretch sportswear, which is one of the
hottest labels in department stores like Bloomingdale's. The store,
to open by Christmas at 175 Orchard St. (Houston Street), will
carry men's and women's wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the hippest, coolest, sexiest neighborhood in the city,''
said Tahari, whose partner in Theory is Andrew Rosen. ``Theory
caters to that young hip Wallpaper magazine crowd who hang around
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The street's legendary ambiance _ rolls of fabric are piled in
doorways, and every shopkeeper is ready to make a deal on a leather
jacket _ makes the neighborhood only more attractive. ``It will be
a great contrast: the old and the new,'' Tahari said. ``You have a
lot of religious rabbis walking around there and women in wigs and
long skirts.'' In other words, the height of fashion.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE SLUGGER BEHIND THE SERVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just when men's tennis finds itself a qualitative
also-ran to the more charismatic and poignant women's game, who
should show up, fittingly enough, to kick off the U.S. Open on
Monday in Arthur Ashe Stadium than Goran Ivanisevic, the
power-serving human sleeping pill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't see what the attraction is,'' said Mark
Woodforde, the unfortunate opponent, who succumbed like a fly to a
swatter, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4. ``He doesn't do anything except serve. If I
was paying money to come to the U.S. Open, I wouldn't go and sit by
his court.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic responded, with a rare return winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is time for him to retire,'' he said of the
32-year-old Australian. ``Pretty old, can't move, with that
backhand. You can't beat anybody. If I have son, just show
Woodforde picture, you can't play tennis like him.''
</P>
<P>
   And on that promotional note, we go to Miami, for an update on
Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Poor men's tennis, all bulked up with no place to go, with no
way out of the women's shadow for the next two weeks. Steffi,
Martina, Venus and Monica may have surrendered their Sunday network
championship slot to the National Football League but, make no
mistake, they are this Open's main event.
</P>
<P>
   If only the men could simply muscle their way back to past
levels of prominence, the way baseball has behind McGwire, Sultan
of Supplements. If only a weapon like Ivanisevic's _ which even
Woodforde had to admit is ``a beautiful serve to watch'' _ didn't
in the long run create the numbing effect of watching jets depart
from La Guardia Airport next door.
</P>
<P>
   If only tennis had long ago legislated against hormonal
experimentation with racquets, the result of which has turned the
men's game into a freak show of blurry fuzz.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was serving around 120 miles an hour, and I had no idea
where it was going,'' Woodforde said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he really thinks out there too much. I can't
believe that the game is going that way and the fans want to see
tennis like that. You just sort of walk back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   When the 6-foot-4-inch Ivanisevic's southpaw serve is on, forget
it; even Pete Sampras said he's not hitting it back. And this got
me to thinking about last week's howls of protest from the baseball
apologists, who were so offended by mere debate on McGwire's
nutritional supplement of choice, androstenedione, and had to
remind skeptics and heretics alike that hitting a baseball is and
has always been the toughest single act in sports.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, then how do they explain the fact that every
slugger worth his carton of creatine will weigh in this season with
40 or more home runs?
</P>
<P>
   All pro sports require dramatic combinations of physical talent
and acquired skill. It is ridiculous to claim one exceeds the
other, and ignorant to deny that their applications are tinkered
with from time to time for the purpose of personal and collective
enhancement.
</P>
<P>
   To suspect that McGwire's home run record chase has benefited
from his little bottled helpers is not to say he isn't a great home
run hitter. Woodforde, for the record, said Ivanisevic's serving
would be formidable even if he were still playing with wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, it is a terrifically relaxed action, very natural, and
he is able to get a lot of disguise on it,'' Woodforde said. ``I
don't know whether the wooden racquets would slow him down, but I'd
like to maybe try that possibility. Suggest it to him when he comes
in here.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ivanisevic arrived in the interview room, he was fed up
with being cast as poster boy for the men's tennis blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Sampras' game, how many points he wins with his
serve,'' he said. ``Serve, serve, serve. But nobody talks about
him, only about me.''
</P>
<P>
   That is because Sampras has more than a serve, beginning with a
strategy, which explains his 11 Grand Slam titles to Ivanisevic's
none. Sampras, after eliminating Marc-Kevin Goellner in straight
sets, defended Ivanisevic, whom he beat in the Wimbledon final
earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most devastating serve I've ever seen or had to play
against,'' Sampras said. ``I actually like watching him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras also said he is closely following McGwire and Sammy
Sosa. His own game enhanced by technology, he is clearly into
power, though his sport is hardly better off for it. Men's tennis
was much better before it got tough. Serve. Serve. Serve. If
baseball were all home runs, we would sit there wishing for a
snappy 6-4-3.

 &HT;    Alligator hunting season opens amid controversy
 &HT;    By Joe Brogan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ At a half-hour before sunset today, some
of the 680 men and women with permits for this year's state
alligator hunt will set out with harpoons and bang sticks to bag as
many as five gators apiece.
</P>
<P>
   It's illegal to use rifles or pistols to hunt the reptiles, so
many hunters use hooked baits, harpoons or arrows with lines
attached to bring the gators to the boat, said state biologist
Lindsey Hord.
</P>
<P>
   Once the animals are captured, hunters usually use a bang stick
to kill them, Hord said.
</P>
<P>
   Bang sticks, commonly used to kill aggressive sharks, contain a
bullet or shotgun shell that fires when the stick is pressed
against the back of a gator's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend time at seminars telling them how to humanely kill
(alligators),'' Hord said. ``The bang stick destroys the brain and
after that the spinal cord is severed.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Animal Rights Foundation of Florida doesn't see it that
way. Members will demonstrate against the hunt at 6:30 p.m. at the
public boat ramp at the Belle Glade Marina and Campground on Torry
Island, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunters are killing these magnificent animals for no other
reason than pleasure from the kill, and shamefully, the state is an
accomplice in these despicable acts,'' said foundation spokesman
Nicolas Atwood.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt will be done in two, 15-day phases at 23 lakes and
rivers statewide until it ends Sept. 30, Hord said.
</P>
<P>
   After a 26-year ban, the state allowed the first open season on
gators in 1988 to help preserve Florida's population of American
alligators, which number about 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Florida residents paid $250 for a permit and non-residents
$1,000, if they were lucky enough to be picked at random from about
10,000 applications, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hunters is Daniel Fountain, a financial adviser from
West Palm Beach, who got six gators two years ago and is slated to
hunt Sept. 15 in Lake Okeechobee.
</P>
<P>
   Fountain uses a boat and trolling motor to sneak up on gators,
which become very wary during the hunt, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a totally different hunt from being in a tree stand or
out in the woods,'' Fountain said. ``You're out there at night
hunting something most people are afraid of.

THE MAN LINKED TO MARIS ISN'T RETURNING CALLS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Tracy Stallard had called Monday, we could have wished him a
happy 61st birthday. And asked him about Roger Maris' 61st home
run.
</P>
<P>
   But Stallard's birthday passed without that opportunity, and at
the rate at which Stallard is not calling back, Maris' record may
pass, too, without the former pitcher telling today's major league
pitchers what it was like giving up the shot that broke Babe Ruth's
legendary record.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, may be the very reason Stallard, who pitched
for the Red Sox in 1961, has not responded to multiple requests for
a telephone conversation. He never seemed comfortable with his
place in history, apparently viewing it as a negative mark on his
record, his career and his soul, and he may not feel differently
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has talked to me about it, but I don't want to quote
anything he has said,'' his wife said last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   She was speaking from their home in Virginia. Her husband wasn't
there; he was working a construction job in another state. ``He
calls me every night,'' she said. She did not say what they talk
about when he calls, but chances are Roger Maris is not a nightly
topic of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Stallard said she gave her husband the telephone number.
She had been given the number by Stallard's sister and the
communications director of the Major League Baseball Players Alumni
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not allowed to talk about anything,'' Stallard's sister
had said when she answered the telephone at her mother's house. ``I
haven't seen him or talked to him since this all came up.'
</P>
<P>
   Robert Stirewalt of the alumni association said he had received
calls from ``30 or 40 people'' seeking Stallard. All he could do
was forward the message.
</P>
<P>
   Stallard has not been heard from. In a year in which home runs
are the highest profile element of any sport, Stallard has
maintained a low profile. Thirty-seven years after the pitch, he
should understand it carries no shame. Let him ask Ralph Branca
about that.
</P>
<P>
   It took Branca time, but he got over the pitch he threw to Bobby
Thomson for his legendary home run that allowed the Giants to beat
the Dodgers in the 1951 playoffs. Branca now has made a mini-career
out of making joint public appearances with Thomson. Stallard need
not go that far, but he also need not continue to punish himself
for throwing that famous pitch on Oct. 1, 1961. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How would today's pitchers feel if they were on the opposite end
of No. 62? Someone is sure to find out soon, and chances are it
will be someone who pitches for Cincinnati, Houston, Pittsburgh,
Milwaukee or San Diego. He could even pitch for the teams Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa play for because St. Louis and Chicago have
a two-game series next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't like it,'' said Kent Bottenfield, one of the
Cardinals' starting pitchers. ``It may be a special thing for the
guy hitting it, but I don't think it will be a special thing for
the guy giving it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield gave up Sosa's 48th home run on Aug. 19. What if he
were to face Sosa next week with the record on the line?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't change my game plan,'' he said. ``That shows you're
pitching scared, and I don't agree with it. I like to go after guys
and challenge them.''
</P>
<P>
   Joey Hamilton of San Diego expressed a point of view that
obviously is alien to Stallard.
</P>
<P>
   Saying it would not bother him to give up No. 62, Hamilton
explained: ``It would be an interesting trivia question down the
road. You might as well be remembered for something. As far as
being mad about it, no. It would be pretty neat. It would be kind
of a dubious honor, I guess, but nobody would ever forget your
name.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr., even with his impressive weekend display at
Yankee Stadium, appears to be too far away to challenge the record
this season, so American League pitchers should be safe. But when
Rick Helling of Texas recently talked about the possibility, he
offered a unique perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it came down to it, I'd do everything in my power not to
give it up,'' he said. ``It has nothing to do with my ego or being
the guy in the record books to give it up, but I wouldn't want it
to be broken being I'm from Fargo and that's where Roger Maris is
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Fargo, N.D., indeed is where Maris grew up, called home and
never forgot. Fargo has never forgot him, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that I guess means more to me than probably
anybody else in the big leagues,'' Helling said. ``It's kind of
personal. He was the last player before me to get to the big
leagues. It doesn't happen very often, people coming to the big
leagues from Fargo.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling, 27 years old, has met members of Maris' family but
never met Maris. His father once met the local hero, though, and
got his autograph for young Rick. He still has it, stored away at
home in Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a hero there, an icon, somebody you've heard about since
you were a kid,'' Helling said. ``If you played baseball in Fargo,
you knew who Roger Maris is, what he did, what he accomplished. I
went to the same high school, played on the same American Legion
team. As far as I'm concerned, hopefully that record never gets
broken. I'm sure it will someday. Maybe it's this year. But I hope
he keeps it as long as he can.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Stallard most likely harbors the opposite hope. But if he
doesn't call, how will we ever know? Happy birthday anyway, Tracy.

 &HT;    Braves Notebook: DL glut leaves roster flexible
 &HT;    By I. J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The postseason roster deadline was expected to pass
Monday with the Braves again remaining quiet.
</P>
<P>
   They will head into October with their present roster and the
ability to pluck anyone from their minor league organization for
help.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have a lot of flexibility because they have six
players on their disabled list and now have 31 players to chose
from for their 25-man playoff roster. And those six players _ Danny
Bautista, Rafael Belliard, Pedro Borbon, Mike Cather, Damian Moss
and Mark Wohlers _ on the DL can be replaced by anyone in the
organization as long as it is a pitcher for pitcher and position
player for a position player. For instance, Wohlers could be
replaced by prospect left-hander Odalis Perez, one of the minor
leaguers that will be given a chance to win a postseason spot this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Braves did make an internal roster move Monday,
promoting outfielder Curtis Pride from Class AAA Richmond and
optioning third baseman Wesley Helms to Class A Eugene. But this
was just a paper move to get Pride to Atlanta, as Helms will remain
with the team with the rosters expanding today. Helms was initially
brought up because the Braves felt they needed a third baseman when
Chipper Jones went down last week with a rib cage injury that
turned out to be nothing serious.
</P>
<P>
   Pride began the season with the Braves, hitting .275 with three
homers and seven RBIs in 59 games, but went down to make room for
Greg Colbrunn, who was acquired from the Rockies July 30.
</P>
<P>
   Struggles for Wohlers
</P>
<P>
   Class AAA Richmond has another week of games and Wohlers is
showing no signs whatsoever of improving. Wohlers has appeared in
15 games in Richmond and has an ERA of 18.97. He has thrown 17 wild
pitches and walked 33 in 12 1/3 innings. Wohlers, who last pitched
Saturday and allowed two runs and walked three in two-thirds of an
inning, was upset recently at a photograph that appeared in the
Richmond Times-Dispatch which showed a shorts-clad Wohlers smoking
a cigarette and talking on a cellular telephone after a bad
performance.
</P>
<P>
   This and that
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Rudy Seanez was not at Monday's game, instead flying to
San Diego where his wife Dianna was to give birth to their second
child. Seanez is expected to be back for tonight's game. . . . The
rosters expanding today, the Braves will promote a few players over
the next few days, including prospects Perez, Bruce Chen, and
George Lombard. . . . Chen and Perez will be coming from Richmond,
while Lombard is at Class AA Greenville. . . . Scott McGregor, one
of the two official scorers at Turners Field, is recoving from
pancreatic surgery at Dunwoody Medical Center. He will be released
later this week and should be back on the job for the team's next
homestand, which starts Sept. 11. . . . Javier Lopez hit his 31st
homer Monday night, the most for a Braves catcher since Joe Torre
had 36 in 1966. Torre hit 31 that year as a catcher.

GERMAN INDUSTRIAL GIANTS SUED OVER NAZI-ERA SLAVE LABOR 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Encouraged by their success in persuading
Swiss banks to repay victims of the Holocaust, lawyers in the
United States and Germany are suing Germany's biggest industrial
companies on behalf of workers forced into slave labor during
Hitler's regime.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action lawsuit, filed on Sunday in New York, could
turn out to amount to billions of dollars being paid by companies
like Daimler-Benz, Volkswagen, BMW and Siemens.
</P>
<P>
   It is the biggest attempt yet to force companies entangled in
the business of Nazi Germany to pay victims 50 years after the war.
It comes just a month after three of Switzerland's biggest banks
agreed to pay a total of $1.25 billion to settle a similar lawsuit
over assets belonging to Holocaust victims that the banks never
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies cited in the suit have long admitted that they
used slave laborers from countries like Poland and Hungary, though
they insisted that they were forced to do so by the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Under the threat of lawsuits and damaging publicity over the
issue, several have said they are willing to put money into a new
fund for compensating survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen, which had been threatened with a separate lawsuit,
formally announced that it would set up a victims' fund but would
not decide details until September.
</P>
<P>
   Several European insurance companies recently agreed that an
international commission could determine the details of
compensation to Holocaust victims whose insurance money was never
paid off. The Assicurazioni Generali insurance company of Italy
agreed this week to pay $100 million to compensate Holocaust
victims.
</P>
<P>
   The newest lawsuit was brought by the same lawyers who handled
the Swiss banking and insurance cases, led by Edward Fagan in New
York and Michael Witti in Munich. Even before Monday, the lawyers
had begun taking fresh aim at German companies. They have filed
suits against the country's biggest banks, Deutsche Bank and
Dresdner Bank, as well as another one against the big chemical
company Degussa.
</P>
<P>
   Though the suit does not demand a specific amount of
compensation, lawyers have said they will demand at least $75,000
for each of the surviving victims, wherever they are living. German
companies are believed to have pressed more than eight million
people into slave labor, and it is not clear how many are still
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not talking about recovering lost salaries,'' Witti
said in an interview Monday. ``We are talking about recovering the
profit that was made out of the work of these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Witti said the lawsuit has standing in an American court because
the companies cited in the suit all do business in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, almost all the legal battles over compensation
for Holocaust victims have been over debts owed by Swiss banks as a
result of their wartime services for the German government. Jewish
groups, seizing on leads from recently opened archives, charged
that the Swiss banks had held onto vast sums that were deposited by
Jewish victims or plundered by the Nazi regime and deposited in
Switzerland to finance the war effort.
</P>
<P>
   The new suits attempt to reopen issues that had seemed settled
long ago. The German government has paid $60 billion or more to
victims as well as compensation in the form of help for Israel. The
lawyers argue that the slave laborers, who worked on farms as well
as in factories, were never compensated for the wealth they helped
generate.

DOW SHEDS 512 POINTS AS SHAKY INVESTORS WEIGH WORLD NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market erased its gains for the entire year
Monday as investors frightened by turmoil in Russia and elsewhere
dumped shares accumulated over an eight-year boom. The Dow Jones
industrial average fell more than 512 points, and has now lost
almost 20 percent of its value from its July highs.
</P>
<P>
   Such titans of the long bull market as Microsoft and IBM
suffered the most as shareholders dumped their winning stocks in
hopes of the best price. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite
Index lost almost nine percent of its value _ much of it in the
final, frantic minutes of trading _ to post its worst decline since
the October 1987 stock crash.
</P>
<P>
   For the Dow, the 512.61-point decline was the second largest
one-day point loss ever, trailing the record 554.26-point plunge
last Oct.27 but ahead of the 508-point drop of October 1987. In
percentage terms, which is the more important measure, the Dow fell
6.4 percent, modest compared to 1987's 22.61 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, the market not only had lost all of its gains for
the year but slipped into negative terriority. Volume on the New
York Stock Exchange was a near-record, with 916 million shares
changing hands.
</P>
<P>
   Much now depends on who was selling Monday. If, as some analysts
argue, it was professional traders caught short by overseas events
and in need of quick cash, the market should stabilize quickly. But
if, as many worry, the sell-off was fueled mainly by individuals
shocked to see their new-found wealth shrinking after expanding for
so many years, the results could spill quickly into the economy and
set off a damaging, downward spiral.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unnerving thing about the stock market is that it can
create its own reality,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief economist with
Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in New York. ``If US consumers get spooked
by this, we have a very serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund executives said that call volume at their telephone
service centers was up substantially during the day, but that few
customers were pulling the plug on their investments. Those at
Boston-based Putnam Investments, which manages $260 billion in
assets, said customer calls were running 20 percent above normal
and those from brokers about 10 percent. ``Most callers were
inquiring about their balances, although there was some exchanging
out of equity funds and into bonds or money markets,' said Putnam
spokesman Matthew Keenan. Keenan said he had no figures on the
amount of switching, but characterized it as ``very limited.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, US Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin sought to
reassure investors, saying that the American economy remains sound
despite Monday's selloff. ``The fundamentals of the United States
economy are strong due in part to the sound policies we've been
following,'' he told reporters. ``The prospects for growth, low
unemployment, low inflation continue to be strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most analysts support Rubin's view, many caution that
it is becoming ever harder to predict the economy's course because
of two factors on prominent display in Monday's selloff: American
companies' growing dependence on overseas operations, and American
families' growing investment in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have become increasingly worried that economic
disarray overseas is damaging the prospects for US firms to produce
the higher profits needed to justify stratospheric stock prices.
Analysts are becoming fearful that sudden stock price drops like
Monday's will make families feel poorer and therefore less willing
to buy, compounding companies' profit problems and thus pulling
stocks still lower further.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Monday's plunge together with last week's
abrupt drop demonstrate that the combination of these factors is
making the nation uncharacteristically vulnerable to far &UR;  &LR; off
events like Russia's economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we've ever had an inter-related set of
world events cause a financial crunch'' here, said Allen Sinai,
chief global economist with Primark Decision Economics. ``We're in
an area that policymakers have no experience with.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``For 10 years, we saw all the positives of the global
economy; now we're seeing some of the negatives,'' said H. Vernon
Winters, chief investment officer with Mellon Private Asset
Management. ``We've all gotten tied together in the same system,
which means we end up moving more in sync.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into Monday, investors knew that the US market would be
shaky; most markets in Asia and Europe had already tumbled on word
that a political deal to appoint a new Russian prime minister and
stabilize that country's economy was coming unhinged.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble here started in a sector where shareholders had made
some of the biggest gains of the bull market _ in computer and
technology stocks. Dell Computer Corp., which only last week posted
a 62 percent boost in quarterly profits, saw its shares fall 18 3/4
to 100. Microsoft shares dropped a similarly stunning 9 5/16 to 95
15/16. Intel fell 5 13/16 to 71 3/16, IBM lost 9 15/16 to 112 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   But the most frightening problems didn't emerge until the last
30 minutes of trading when stocks of all description came in for a
pounding, sending the Dow into a final 230-point plunge.
</P>
<P>
   The slide in computer stocks pushed the Nasdaq index down 140.43
or 8.6 percent to close at 1499.25, its worst one-day point loss
ever. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index tumbled 69.61, or 6.8
percent, to 957.53. The Dow and the S&AMP;P suffered their worst
declines since last October. All three indexes are now down for the
year. In the case of the Dow, the index has lost 4.7 of its value
since the opening bell on January 2.
</P>
<P>
   In what some analysts interpreted as a sign that investors think
the stock market's troubles will spread to the economy, retail
stocks also took a pummeling. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. fell 6 3/8 to
59. Home Depot Inc. lost 4 5/16 to 38 1/8. Retail stocks had been
rallying until recently because investors thought the
consumer-fueled US economy would keep growing even as economies
elsewhere sank.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's selloff was especially troubling for financial
optimists because it pushed stocks to within a hair's breadth of
the technical definition of a ``bear market,'' a 20-percent drop
from a market high. The Dow closed down 19.2 percent from its July
17th high, a mere 69.47 points away the 20-percent level. Until
recently, most analysts had characterized the market's gyrations as
a mere ``correction,'' or 10-percent decline.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over who was selling and what that means for
Tuesday's market was already under way before the closing bell
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   William J. Landes, Putnam's chief investment officer, said the
sellers were almost entirely professional traders who had borrowed
money to bet on the Russian and Asian markets, were caught short
and forced to sell quality stocks to pay their debts. He asserted
that individual investors were not selling, a trend that, if true,
cold help the market catch its balance.
</P>
<P>
   But Nancy Kimelman, chief economist at Technical Data in Boston,
said that she believes individual investors have already begun
selling off their stocks or will do so shortly. ``I think we've got
a crisis on our hands,'' she said
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, you'll find Mom and Pop are going to jump right
out of the boat. They don't want to be in a boat headed in the
wrong direction.''

IN RUSSIA'S PARLIAMENT: NAME-CALLING, PLEADING, URGENCY, BUT NO
PREMIER 
</HEADLINE>
  (With RUSSIA-RDP) 
 Eds: Following are excerpts from statements made Monday by Russian
political leaders in the debate over the nomination of Viktor
Chernomyrdin as prime minister, as translated by The New York
Times.  
(js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Viktor Chernomyrdin, Acting Prime Minister
</P>
<P>
   You know that I have always been open to constructive dialogue.
And I do not shirk dialogue today. But time is running out.
</P>
<P>
   Seven days ago the President again asked me to head the
Government. It was a difficult choice for me _ not only because the
country finds itself in such a serious situation. During the last
six months I have been able to see more clearly many things and
many people whom I have dealt with during my many years of work.
</P>
<P>
   I saw the mistakes made, the miscalculations in the work. I see
some of my own blame. But I have already said _ and I will repeat
again, because I know the depth of the problems that have
confronted us _ I accepted the invitation in order to do everything
to solve these problems.
</P>
<P>
   I must say frankly that we did not make the best use of these
few days. Unfortunately a lot of time was misspent. Let me stress
again that we do not have as much as an hour left for discussions.
During the past week we have prevented a collapse, but the
situation today remains critical. In the present-day conditions our
main task is to minimize our common losses in this crisis.
</P>
<P>
   I am not trying to escape responsibility for the mistakes in
economic policy made by the Government that I headed. But I did not
make any announcements of devaluation or a moratorium on the
payment of Government debts. That was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Today it is not yet too late. Today we can still formulate a
reasonable policy of the exchange rate. Together with you, esteemed
deputies, we can still create a reliable mechanism of guarantees of
deposits in banks, we can still save the banking system from
disintegration, we can still help the banks overcome the present
critical situation.
</P>
<P>
   That critical mass of decisions will suffice to pull us back
from the brink. But to do that we need a working Government.
</P>
<P>
   This process cannot be dragged out; Russia should not be without
a Government. Esteemed deputies of the lower house, the present
conditions are anything but simple. All Russian people want an
early end to the crisis. I am sure that all the responsible
political forces and leaders are aware of it. And they do not just
understand it, they seek a solution. Life in Russia is incredible
difficult as it is and we have no right to make it still more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   We have no time; we have used up the margin of error, and this
makes our tasks all that much more important and serious. ...
</P>
<P>
   One should not confuse appointment of the Prime Minister or
cooperation with the Prime Minister with presidential campaigns.
You're in too much in a hurry. Don't rush. The Government has to be
formed. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I do not know what the President will do. I have to present the
proposals today on the Government formation, that unique thing to
which we have been moving for so long.
</P>
<P>
   In all respects, in constitutional amendments, in everything, we
came very close, and at the last stage we stumbled. Irrespective of
the decision on Chernomyrdin, it is impossible to take more time.
Russians should not have this lawlessness as well.
</P>
<P>
   Gennadi Zyuganov, Leader of the Communist Party
</P>
<P>
   I was going to make a short speech, but having listened to
Viktor Stepanovich, who as usual has said nothing, I have to make a
longer speech.
</P>
<P>
   It is time to think not only about the country but also about
the possibility of preserving the country. If in 1992-93 we had a
reserve of strength that we inherited from the Soviet power, that
was a strategic resource that has been used up and stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Today the state has nothing of the kind. But even what they have
been creating during the last seven years under the guise of
democratic reforms is in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   The entire financial credit system has been ruined; it does not
even get taxes from barely working enterprises. Those who have
created it have found themselves bankrupt. If today people block
the railroads, tomorrow they may not have enough money for bread
and water. And they will be standing near the administration
offices across the country demanding their meager wages.
</P>
<P>
   The causes are obvious: a lack of basic educated managers and
complete irresponsibility by the executive powers before the
people, the country and the legislators.
</P>
<P>
   The result of your appointment will be that you will not be able
to cope. Yesterday NTV, which has always supported your course,
reported that confidence in you is at 7 percent. To cope, one
should have 67 percent today. Even good proposals cannot be
implemented if neither legislators nor the people of the Russian
Federation have confidence. You cannot cope, and a vast collapse
will begin, even more than has already occurred. And then the
criminal oligarchy in the country will be bloody and the
dictatorship can be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Ryzhkov, Leader of People's Power faction
</P>
<P>
   A crisis, seen and unseen, has been raging in our country for
several months now. It became visible on Aug. 17, but the invisible
crisis appeared much earlier. Life has for all practical purposes
drawn its conclusions regarding those seven years of economic
activity by the Government of so-called monetarist economic policy,
of so-called shock therapy.
</P>
<P>
   And what has happened in this month _ there's nothing unusual
here. This was bound to happen. Whoever had been in the Government
in these days _ Chernomyrdin, Kiriyenko or someone else _ sooner or
later the actions would have an impact, and they have had an
impact.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis was unavoidable because the foundation for it was
laid six, seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And all these years, we spoke out _ the opposition, just
reasonable people _ and said: ``Please change course. It is
impossible to go along this course; this course is not acceptable
for our country. It will end badly.'' They did not listen; they
said, ``We are going along the right path, ladies and gentlemen,
comrades _ whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is where we have come to along the right path. Look at what
is happening in the country. The country is for all practical
purposes defeated, robbed, degraded.
</P>
<P>
   Who is responsible for this? Who is responsible for the fact
that we have in essence lost the national security of our state, in
the military sphere and in the food sector, goods and so forth? Who
is responsible for the fact that science, culture and education are
dying? And many such examples can be given.
</P>
<P>
   I think that those people who were the leaders during these
years, they must bear responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone says that what is happening in the country is the
result of a crisis that was born somewhere in the Pacific Ocean, in
Southeast Asia, and has reached us.
</P>
<P>
   It was not conceived there. Maybe it was born there, but it is
raging here. We have a completely different situation. Our crisis
is connected first of all with the fact that such policies were
carried out.

 MOSCOW: carried out.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grigory Yavlinsky, Leader of the Yabloko faction
</P>
<P>
   The Yabloko faction has made a unified decision on the
impossibility of supporting Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin for the
post of Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for making such a decision are, first, that under
Chernomyrdin, during the six years he was the Prime Minister, an
extremely inefficient economic system was created. It was under him
that the use of barter and money surrogates reached 85 percent, 75
percent of the economic turnover. It was under him that payment of
wages, pensions and social subsidies stopped and huge unemployment
emerged. It was under him that all these processes gained huge
force.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, it was during those six years, five and a half years,
that a semi-criminal economic system was created in Russia. A
semi-criminal economic system means, for example, that even
according to our official statistics, up to 40 percent of our
turnover is in that shadow economy, which does not pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
   It means that the main sources of revenues are in the criminal
sector.
</P>
<P>
   And it is during the period of that Government that Russia
became a leading country in terms of the level of corruption. Any
child in Russia can tell you the main problem of the Russian
Government: that there are thieves there.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. These are the main three reasons why we cannot
support this candidate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Zhirinovsky, Leader of the ultra-nationalist Liberal
Democratic Party
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Stepanovich, if you had a powerful political structure,
they would have prepared for you the speech that I am going to
deliver on your behalf. ...
</P>
<P>
   I feel that the situation in the country is tense, and the visit
of President Clinton today is not a timely one, the more so because
his recent moral scandals, for us, people with high spiritual
qualities, do not allow us to meet with a man who cannot settle his
relations with a secretary.
</P>
<P>
   According to the traditions of Russian society, in this case he
should divorce his wife and marry the secretary, to turn this
disgraceful page over. ...
</P>
<P>
   We have other, more important issues to discuss. And moreover, I
recommended that President Clinton not hold private meetings with
the leaders of the political parties because it is a state visit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aleksandr Shokhin, Leader of Our Home Is Russia, Mr.
Chernomyrdin's faction
</P>
<P>
   I would like to propose the following plan to form a
``last-chance Government.'' It can be done if Viktor Stepanovich
Chernomyrdin, together with the President, comes up with a program
for Government action, promises to form an efficient Cabinet and
makes the program public.
</P>
<P>
   With these programs, which are highly important, and after
consultations during a recess, we could vote not only for the Prime
Minister but also for the nucleus of the Government team.
</P>
<P>
   And then each faction will make its judgment, not only on the
basis of oral and written documents presented by the candidate, but
also with trust in its representatives in this Government _ if, of
course, this scheme will work.
</P>
<P>
   And finally the approved Prime Minister _ no matter who wins
this approval _ will have to implement a new economic course, and
our faction wishes him, God willing, to become a Russian Roosevelt.

RED SOX CONTROL MARINERS, 5-1 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Maybe this is what happens when the Red Sox can see the
finish line to a playoff spot: Even Mo Vaughn starts to sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's daring on the basepaths dovetailed nicely with Bret
Saberhagen's four-hit pitching and Nomar Garciaparra's three RBIs
(on a two-run home run and sacrifice fly) in a 5-1 win over the
Seattle Mariners before a crowd of 28,553 in Fenway Park Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The running Red Sox, who also executed a double steal and scored
a run on a wild pitch, maintained their eight-game lead over the
Texas Rangers in the wild-card race, with just September left to be
played.
</P>
<P>
   Two of their runs were scored by Vaughn, who twice took an extra
base, once at the expense of Ken Griffey, and also scored ahead of
Garciaparra's 29th home run.
</P>
<P>
   With his next home run, Garciaparra will join Rudy York of the
Tigers, Ron Kittle of the White Sox, and Jose Canseco and Mark
McGwire, both with the A's at the time, as the only players to hit
30 or more home runs in each of their first two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, who had come away with no-decisions in seven of his
previous nine starts, won for just the second time since July 1. He
raised his record to 12-6 by limiting the Mariners to four hits in
6 2/3 innings. A nice turn by Dennis Eckersley, who recorded the
final out of the seventh with two Mariners on base, then worked a
1-2-3 eighth, assured Saberhagen of reentering the win column.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen's talk of taking early retirement has been replaced
by serious negotiations to spend the next three seasons in a Red
Sox uniform, now that he has resolved his alimony dispute with his
ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen is closing in on an incentive-laden deal that would
pay him no less than $8 million and perhaps as much as $12 million,
remarkable figures for a guy who signed a make-good deal with the
Sox after radical shoulder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the 34-year-old righthander made it look like a
sound investment in the future, limiting the Mariners to Griffey's
double through six innings. Griffey, who had hit five home runs in
his previous eight games, began his night by bringing the Mariners'
lineup card to home plate, then lined his double off the wall in
left-center with two out in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen walked the leadoff man in the second, David Segui,
then set down the next 15 Mariners, at one point striking out Russ
Davis, Joe Oliver, and David Bell in order.
</P>
<P>
   That man Griffey broke the spell, lining a single to center to
open the seventh. Saberhagen retired the next two batters, Edgar
Martinez and Segui on fly balls, but Jay Buhner followed by lining
a single to left, which brought Red Sox manager Jimy Williams out
of the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   His message was clear: One way or another, Oliver would be
Saberhagen's last batter. Oliver grounded the first pitch he saw
into right field for a single, scoring Griffey to make it 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Out popped Williams, signaling to the bullpen on his first step
out of the dugout. Saberhagen left to a rousing standing ovation
and was greeted by Pedro Martinez on the first step of the dugout.
Eckersley entered and retired pinch hitter Rudy Ibanez on a roller
to second, ending the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners starter Jeff Fassero set down the first nine Red Sox
until Darren Lewis beat out an infield hit off shortstop Alex
Rodriguez's glove. John Valentin followed with a ground ball down
the line that bounced under the glove of third baseman Davis and
off the box-seat railing for a double, Lewis stopping at third.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero walked Vaughn to load the bases, and Garciaparra hit a
ball that drove Griffey back to the track in center, deep enough
not only to score Lewis but to allow Vaughn to hustle to second,
just beating Griffey's throw with a thunderous head-first slide.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero, perhaps still feeling the earth move after Vaughn's
vault, fell behind Mike Stanley, 3-and-0, then conceded the base to
the Red Sox DH by throwing the next one wide on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   He did not intend to throw the next pitch past catcher Oliver,
but that's what he did, allowing Valentin to score despite
tiptoeing into the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn singled with one out in the sixth in advance of
Garciaparra's 431-foot drive into the center-field bleachers, the
shortstop's second home run in two games and seventh of August.

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Vice President Al Gore, an important voice in the
administration's dealings with Russia, said Monday that reforms
there were still possible despite the emergence of hard-line
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Communists in Russia today are not the same as Communists
of 50 years ago,'' Gore said told reporters on his plane traveling
here. ``And the idea that their participation in some coalition
would represent a return to Leninism or Stalinism is just as almost
certainly wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   He said ``labels alone are not any longer the best guide to what
these people are advocating.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore continued: ``I don't want to put too bright a face on it.
The fact is, we don't know what's going to happen there. But a lot
of the changes in Russia that have taken place are irreversible.
And the damage done by 70 years of Communism are, naturally,
difficult to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how weak President Boris Yeltsin had become, Gore said:
``Well, I don't want to create a diplomatic incident here. He's
still president of Russia. But obviously there are negotiations
under way that include consideration of how much authority he will
designate to his choice as prime minister. And that in turn could
trigger negotiations about how much power might be reshuffled from
the executive branch to the legislative branch .''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The president's trip will be very important in
buttressing the confidence that the Russian people ought to feel
that the U.S.-Russian relationship is a strong one and that we are
going to stand by our support for reform and democracy.''

 &HT;    PAX-TV makes its debut
 &HT;    By Marguerite M. Plunkett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Following a champagne toast by Lowell
``Bud'' Paxson, PAX TV, the nation's seventh commercial network,
was born at noon Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The launch was without glitches or surprises, according to
Paxson Communications Chief Executive Jeff Sagansky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I don't have a better story,'' Sagansky said.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson, chairman of West Palm Beach-based Paxson Communications,
PAX TV's parent, toasted the hard work of his employees and said he
is confident the family-friendly network will succeed, Sagansky
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reruns of Touched by an Angel and others, including Dr. Quinn,
Medicine Woman and Diagnosis Murder, are the foundation of the new
network, announced in November. The programming is broadcast by 95
stations owned, operated, or affiliated with Paxson, reaching 76
million households with television sets. Paxson also has cut deals
with cable TV companies to air PAX TV where the company doesn't
have stations.
</P>
<P>
   PAX TV's local station is Paxson-owned WPXP-Channel 67.
</P>
<P>
   The first advertisement to run on the network's first show _ the
Paxson-produced Great Day America _ was for AvMed health plan,
followed by Isis Prepaid Cellular. The second commercial break
included a promotion for PAX TV shows and and an ad for a Time-Life
classic music collection. Other ads in the first hour were for
South Florida Ford dealers, The Complete Runners Guide and Palm
Beach Atlantic College in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Schulman, a Boca Raton media buyer, said it's too early to
size up the network's advertising without knowing the rates that
are being paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very early,'' Schulman said.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson's stock (AMEX: PAX) was off $1.06 a share Monday to close
at $9.13 _ on a day when the Dow Jones average closed down more
than 500 points.
</P>
<P>
   Sagansky suggested PAX TV could provide some comfort to market
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a day like today,'' he said, ``they're going to need
Touched by an Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   Headquarters: West Palm Beach
</P>
<P>
   Network: 95 stations owned, operated or affiliated with Paxson
</P>
<P>
   Reach: 76 million households
</P>
<P>
   First commercial: AvMed

TV SPORTS: POTENTIALLY, THE HOME RUN CALL OF THE CENTURY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mark McGwire crushed his 53rd home run last week in
Pittsburgh, Joe Buck cringed. The St. Louis Cardinals' announcer _
who is also the lead baseball voice for Fox Sports _ was at home in
St. Louis, watching with his wife, Ann.
</P>
<P>
   `My wife said to me, `Don't you wish you were there?''' he said.
``It was killing me.''
</P>
<P>
   Paring his Cardinals radio-TV schedule to 100 games was designed
to let him spend more time with Ann and their 2-year-old daughter,
Natalie, before a postseason regimen for Fox that will rarely let
him escape the road.
</P>
<P>
   Buck has missed seven or eight steps in McGwire's march toward
Roger Maris' single-season record of 61 home runs. Jack Buck, his
father and one of his radio and television partners, has also
missed a few chapters, but has added some road games to his
itinerary to ensure that he misses no others.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad thinks McGwire will do it, and he's focusing on Sept.
24,'' Buck said. ``He figures one homer a series. I said: `That's
ridiculous. You can't predict it.' Now he thinks he'll do it
earlier than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Shannon, who has called Cardinal games since 1972, has
witnessed each of McGwire's 55 blasts this season. ``It's been
interesting, to say the least,'' he said Monday from Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. ``It feels like it's been evolving since opening
day. Mark's made up his mind he can do it. In 162 games as a
Cardinal, he's hit 71. He knows what he's capable of.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Cardinal, Shannon played against Maris in the 1964 World
Series, then with him in 1967 and 1968, after St. Louis acquired
him from the New York Yankees. Shannon shifted to third base to
make room for Maris in right field. Quickly, they became best
friends and hunting companions. Maris was six years past slugging
61 home runs, and a wrist injury had cut down on his power.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still had an aura of power,'' Shannon said. ``He still had
the record. It took such a powerful person to do it, so you have
respect for it. Even in his last season, when he hit just a few
home runs, he was walked 22 or 23 times intentionally to face
Orlando Cepeda, who was having an MVP-type season.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in a subpar season, Shannon said, ``Roger never made a
mistake in the field, he never made a mistake on the bases.''
</P>
<P>
   Shannon said Maris discussed the 61-homer season; not the
day-to-day grind specifically, but his feeling that the Yankees
``didn't protect him or coordinate the press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He never really had a chance to enjoy it, but he was proud of
having broken the record,'' Shannon said.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon said Maris would not have minded seeing his record
imperiled. ``He'd be so tickled that everyone is pulling for
Mark,'' Shannon said. ``Mark is so much like Roger was _ friendly,
compassionate and intelligent.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now that McGwire has reached 55, how creative can a home run
call be? ``I don't plan them,'' Shannon said. ``They're
spontaneous. I just report what happens. And it's just so enjoyable
to watch the fan reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to say, `Track, wall, gone,' is ridiculous. With
McGwire, it's, `Bleacher, upper deck.' When it leaves the bat, it's
gone. He hit one 509 feet the other day. There's no suspense. Once
it's in the air, you think, `He's hit 54, and the magic number is
eight.' Instead of saying the score, you make it more personal to
McGwire and say where it landed.''
</P>
<P>
   Chip Caray is not lying awake scripting memorable histrionics to
describe the Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa's home runs on WGN-TV. He has
also resisted imitating the stylings of his grandfather, Harry, who
died last February.
</P>

   ``Am I thinking of saying, `That's a 61 salsa swat for Sammy'?
No,'' Caray said. ``I just hope I'm behind the mike, that I
describe it right, get the balls and strikes right and get out of
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't given much thought to what I'd say if Sammy hits 61
or 62. Whatever comes out will come out.'' But for Sosa's 482-foot
54th on Sunday, he remembered saying: ``There it goes! How far is
this baby going to go? Wow.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Phil Rizzuto, who called Maris' 61st, said he would prefer to
have thought about what he would say that day. ``If I did, I might
have thought of something else to say besides, `Holy cow.' Instead,
I yelled and screamed so much I had a headache for a week, like the
one I got after I got my first hole-in-one.''
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Rizzuto is having a grand time, discovering a rich
life after broadcasting, with his bride. ``Cora and I went to Paris
for two weeks for our 55th anniversary,'' he said. ``Boy, they know
how to live over there.''

MARINE PILOTS FACE NEW CHARGES IN ITALIAN ALPS ACCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Marine Corps said Monday that the pilot and the
navigator of a plane that struck a ski lift cable in the Italian
alps, killing 20 people, were being charged with obstruction of
justice for allegedly hiding or destroying a videotape, apparently
made during the flight.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Capt. Richard J. Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif.,
and the navigator, Capt. Joseph P. Schweitzer, 30, of Westbury,
N.Y., were originally charged with manslaughter and other offenses.
They are now accused of two new counts, removing the tape from the
cockpit, and ``endeavoring to impede an investigation by the
secreting and/or destruction of evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the two men were not immediately available by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines did not say what part of the flight they believed
was captured on the tape. The videotape in question is separate
from a tape discussed at pretrial proceedings in June. That tape
was found in the cockpit by Italian investigators and was black, as
if the camera had been run with the lens cap on, to tape over what
was originally there.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony from the June hearing indicated that Prowler crews
routinely brought hand-held video cameras into the cockpits with
them, in part because they serve an intelligence purpose when
flying over enemy territory. But people familiar with Prowler
operations also say that the videos are sometimes used by flight
crews to impress friends and family with evidence of low-altitude
derring-do.
</P>
<P>
   A similar videotape got another Marine officer into trouble
earlier this year. After the ski lift accident, on Feb. 3, the
Marines began an investigation of operations at all Prowler
squadrons, and the commander of a squadron, based in Cherry Point,
N.C., was found to have told his men to hide any such videotapes.
He was relieved of command.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement of the charges faxed Monday afternoon, the
Marines hinted that a third crew member was cooperating with
prosecutors in making a case against Ashby and Schweitzer. The
statement said the two men had ``solicited the support of Capt.
Chandler P. Seagraves,'' who was seated in the rear cockpit of the
plane, in a conspiracy to hide the tape.
</P>
<P>
   Seagraves, 28, of Nineveh, Ohio, was initially charged, along
with another crewman who was in the back seat, but a hearing
officer who heard testimony on the charges later recommended
against prosecuting the two men, who had no flight controls,
limited instrumentation and no view out of the front of the plane,
an EA-6B Prowler. The plane was on a training mission, and was
based at the NATO airbase in Aviano for duty over Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony and evidence show that the plane was flying lower and
faster than rules allow. Court-martials are scheduled for Ashby in
December and for Schweitzer in January. But the hearing officer,
after eight days of hearings, said that the outcome of such
courts-martial would be ``in substantial doubt'' because the Marine
Corps, the Air Force and a Pentagon map-making agency had made
systematic errors that contributed to the crash. Among other
problems with the case, the crew was given inaccurate information
with which to plan the flight.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps, in a low-profile announcement on a Saturday
evening earlier this month, said it would limit punishment of the
other officers involved. The squadron commander was relieved of his
command and a second officer was given a letter of reprimand; two
others were not punished.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors thus face the possibility that the crash, which is
an irritant to American-Italian relations, could result in no
successful criminal prosecutions.

   STOCKS ERASE GAINS IN 1998 AS THE DOW TUMBLES 6.37 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   Investors sold stocks, erasing this year's gains in the market
and sending stock prices down more than 19 percent from their peak
six weeks ago, the sharpest decline in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 512.61 points, or 6.37
percent, to 7,539.07, leaving the bellwether index 4.7 percent
below where it started the year. The decline was the index's
second-largest in point terms, behind the 554-point drop on Oct.
27.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index plunged 69.86 points, or
6.8 percent, to 957.28, down 1.3 percent since the beginning of
1998. The Nasdaq composite index declined 140.43 points, or 8.56
percent, to 1,499.25.
</P>
<P>
   BIDS FOR KIA BELOW MINIMUM PRICE
</P>
<P>
   None of the initial bids for Kia Motors and its affiliate, Asia
Motors, met the sellers' minimum price, leading some industry
officials to predict that the auction would be canceled or
postponed. Creditor banks, which took over Kia after it was unable
to make payments on its $10 billion in debt, received bids from
Ford Motor, Daewoo, Hyundai and Samsung. But all of the bids would
have required the banks to write off some of their loans.
</P>
<P>
   SECRETARY ENTERS NORTHWEST STRIKE
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater asked officials of
Northwest Airlines and its striking pilots union to meet with him
in Washington on Tuesday. Northwest canceled all its flights on
Wednesday and some international flights on Thursday as the strike
by its 6,173 pilots went into its third day with no movement by
either side.
</P>
<P>
   NEW HOME SALES FELL 1.6 PERCENT IN JULY
</P>
<P>
   Sales of new single-family homes declined 1.6 percent in July,
to 886,000 units at an annual rate. The drop was more than
expected.
</P>

   FATE OF LONG-TERM CREDIT BANK
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Parliament has begun discussions on what to do with
Long-Term Credit Bank, which is financially unstable.

<P>
   UNION PACIFIC LIMITING TRAFFIC
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Union Pacific fell 3.92 percent after executives
acknowledged that the company would not be able to reliably, or
profitably, accommodate all who want to use its tracks. The
railroad's chairman, Richard Davidson, announced a plan to improve
service and recover the 10 percent of its traffic lost in the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   SEC SEEKS INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed that
auditors meet annually with company directors to explain what they
have done for the business and how they have maintained their
independence.
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN LOANS TO RUSSIA DOUBLED
</P>
<P>
   Foreign banks more than doubled their lending to Russia in the
first quarter from the previous three months. The figures do not
reflect the recent turmoil in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   KOREA TO CUT BANK RATE
</P>

 &HT;    Mauro's campaign attacks poll results
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ The latest Texas Poll shows Gov. George W. Bush
maintaining a massive lead over Democratic challenger Garry Mauro
as the campaign heads into its final two months.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro's campaign responded by attacking the poll's credibility,
noting that in the previous two gubernatorial elections the poll
said the eventual loser was ahead at this point in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The poll numbers, released today, show Bush with support of 67
percent of likely voters and Mauro backed by 20 percent. The
previous poll, conducted last spring, gave Bush a 70-17 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Poll was conducted Aug. 12-27 by the University of
Texas Office of Survey Research for Scripps Howard media company.
The telephone poll of 1,004 adults asked the gubernatorial question
to the 718 who defined themselves as likely voters. The results on
that question have a margin of error of 3.7 percentage points,
meaning the results could vary that much in either direction.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers also showed Bush with strong job performance
ratings. Seventy-four percent of the 1,004 respondents said Bush
was doing a good or excellent job. The margin of error on that
question is 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The Mauro campaign attacked the poll's credibility and pointed
out its spotty track record. At a similar point in the 1990
gubernatorial race, the Texas Poll showed Republican Clayton
Williams in a 47-37 lead over Democrat Ann Richards, the eventual
winner.
</P>
<P>
   At this time in 1994, the Texas Poll showed Richards with a
47-43 lead over Bush, who won.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Texas Poll is very good at picking losers,'' said Billy
Rogers, Mauro's campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Poll Director Ty Meighan stood by the numbers. He said
Bush's poll numbers are backed up by the 74 percent approval
rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is just off the charts and he has sustained those ratings,
which is even more amazing,'' Meighan said. But he said ``a lot can
happen between Labor Day and the election'' as voters focus more
attention on the Nov. 3 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said the governor is
pleased with the high approval numbers but ``is taking nothing for
granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's approval ratings have not fallen below 66 percent since
the fall 1995 Texas Poll. Richards, viewed as a popular governor
throughout her four-year term, hit 60 percent approval only once
while in office.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll shows Bush leading in all regions and among all
demographic group except blacks (Mauro leads 48 percent to 28
percent) and Democrats (Mauro leads 53 to 31). Independents favor
Bush 67 to 10. Hispanics favor Bush 51 to 31, down from a 67 to 20
lead in the June poll.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro today will focus attention on a low point in Bush's 1994
campaign by heading to Hamilton for the opening day of dove season.
Four years ago, in a classic photo-op-gone-bad, Bush invited
reporters to watch him shoot doves near Houston. Bush shot a
killdeer, a protected nongame bird, and paid a $130 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said a friend invited Mauro to hunt, and Mauro invited
the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been dove hunting, I believe, once or twice before,''
said Rogers, adding that Mauro knows the difference between a dove
and a killdeer. Bush begins a three-day campaign swing for
Republican candidates in Illinois, Georgia, Arizona and Colorado in
what will be his final out-of-state campaign events.

 &HT;    Mauro's campaign attacks poll results
 &HT;    (EDS: Corrects to include Texas in dateline.)

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The latest Texas Poll shows Gov. George W. Bush
maintaining a massive lead over Democratic challenger Garry Mauro
as the campaign heads into its final two months.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro's campaign responded by attacking the poll's credibility,
noting that in the previous two gubernatorial elections the poll
said the eventual loser was ahead at this point in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The poll numbers, released today, show Bush with support of 67
percent of likely voters and Mauro backed by 20 percent. The
previous poll, conducted last spring, gave Bush a 70-17 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Poll was conducted Aug. 12-27 by the University of
Texas Office of Survey Research for Scripps Howard media company.
The telephone poll of 1,004 adults asked the gubernatorial question
to the 718 who defined themselves as likely voters. The results on
that question have a margin of error of 3.7 percentage points,
meaning the results could vary that much in either direction.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers also showed Bush with strong job performance
ratings. Seventy-four percent of the 1,004 respondents said Bush
was doing a good or excellent job. The margin of error on that
question is 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The Mauro campaign attacked the poll's credibility and pointed
out its spotty track record. At a similar point in the 1990
gubernatorial race, the Texas Poll showed Republican Clayton
Williams in a 47-37 lead over Democrat Ann Richards, the eventual
winner.
</P>
<P>
   At this time in 1994, the Texas Poll showed Richards with a
47-43 lead over Bush, who won.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Texas Poll is very good at picking losers,'' said Billy
Rogers, Mauro's campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Poll Director Ty Meighan stood by the numbers. He said
Bush's poll numbers are backed up by the 74 percent approval
rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is just off the charts and he has sustained those ratings,
which is even more amazing,'' Meighan said. But he said ``a lot can
happen between Labor Day and the election'' as voters focus more
attention on the Nov. 3 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said the governor is
pleased with the high approval numbers but ``is taking nothing for
granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's approval ratings have not fallen below 66 percent since
the fall 1995 Texas Poll. Richards, viewed as a popular governor
throughout her four-year term, hit 60 percent approval only once
while in office.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll shows Bush leading in all regions and among all
demographic group except blacks (Mauro leads 48 percent to 28
percent) and Democrats (Mauro leads 53 to 31). Independents favor
Bush 67 to 10. Hispanics favor Bush 51 to 31, down from a 67 to 20
lead in the June poll.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro today will focus attention on a low point in Bush's 1994
campaign by heading to Hamilton for the opening day of dove season.
Four years ago, in a classic photo-op-gone-bad, Bush invited
reporters to watch him shoot doves near Houston. Bush shot a
killdeer, a protected nongame bird, and paid a $130 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said a friend invited Mauro to hunt, and Mauro invited
the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been dove hunting, I believe, once or twice before,''
said Rogers, adding that Mauro knows the difference between a dove
and a killdeer. Bush begins a three-day campaign swing for
Republican candidates in Illinois, Georgia, Arizona and Colorado in
what will be his final out-of-state campaign events.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ruth Whitney, who steered Glamour magazine and
influenced several generations of women through the three most
important decades in American feminism, absolutely hates one of the
signal words of the feminist movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Em-pow-er,'' she said gingerly, her carefully painted lips
forming the word as if it were a vulgar graffito. ``Ugh,'' she
gasped. ``It's overused. It's very commercial. And it's used
cheaply.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mrs. Whitney's 31 years as editor of Glamour _ a middlebrow
Conde Nast publication with a current circulation of 2.3 million _
the magazine has addressed issues both homely and hot.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as she prepares to step aside, Mrs. Whitney is reflecting
on her career. She sat recently in her 11th-floor office at Conde
Nast headquarters on Madison Avenue and pointed proudly to a story
titled ``Women's Health Crisis'' in the August issue, in which
women _ their real names and hometowns printed beside their
portraits _ describe their lives after they contracted venereal
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's amazing is that this is an article about how the
government should be doing so much more,'' she said. ``I don't
think any other women's magazine will touch that.'' She paused, and
then added, ``This isn't flashy stuff, but it's obviously important
to our readers.''
</P>
<P>
   Flashy isn't Mrs. Whitney's style; she was wearing a
black-and-white check suit, and the gray streak in her brown hair
waved into a soft apostrophe over her face.
</P>
<P>
   Her origins are hardly glamorous. She was born Ruth Reinke in
1928 in Oshkosh, Wis. Her father, Leonard, was a designer of
gravestones and mausoleums, but the only effect that had on her,
she said, was that she learned to drive in a cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   She was awarded a scholarship to Northwestern University, where
she met Daniel Whitney, a journalism student, whom she married
after her 21st birthday. Unlike her husband, who eventually ran his
own advertising agency, she decided against journalism school and
instead worked for Time Inc. as a promotional copywriter. She
didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an election year, and I was madly for Adlai,'' she said
in a voice made tremulous by a vocal-cord disorder that has
affected her speech since last year. ``And the company was not
madly for Adlai. So I got more and more sullen and eventually they
fired me.'' The young Mrs. Whitney then found to her chagrin that
she could not get a job writing for Newsweek or Fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I always say next is that if you had a uterus, you
couldn't write for those magazines,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She landed in women's magazines and, at age 28, became editor in
chief of Better Living _ ``one of those little magazines they sell
in supermarkets,'' she said, tossing her hand dismissively. After a
run at Seventeen magazine, she arrived at Glamour in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had a mission,'' she said. ``I wanted to broaden
the scope of a magazine to go with women's lives. I never wanted to
appeal to everyone. That's not what we were about, and that's not
the secret of our success. But I really wanted to make women feel
good about themselves, not just about what they wore.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Her family has long been connected with magazines: Mrs.
Whitney's husband served as her sounding board on all Glamour
matters until his death in 1995. Her son, Philip, 35, is vice
president of consumer marketing at Money magazine; Philip's wife,
Christina Ferrari, is managing editor of Teen People.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Mrs. Whitney made headlines by putting a black woman on
the cover of Glamour _ the first time a mainstream American women's
magazine had done that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of discussion about that,'' she said. ``All
the way up to the president. Controversy always made us stand out.
We're very eager to take it on, whether it's racism or abortion or
lesbians. We want to be out front.''
</P>
<P>
   And while her retirement, she said, was a decision made jointly
with S.I. Newhouse, the chairman of Advance Publications and
overseer of Conde Nast, public remarks she made about her
replacement, Bonnie Fuller, generated the kind of uproar Mrs.
Whitney rarely cultivates.
</P>
<P>
   She was quoted in The New York Post, for example, as saying she
was very disappointed. ``There are all kinds of people I would have
recommended,'' she was quoted as saying. ``There are a lot of
strong, smart editors out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Glamour staff members say they've already noticed a different
feeling. Ms. Fuller, who comes from Cosmopolitan, where she
replaced Helen Gurley Brown two years ago, appeared in the Conde
Nast offices on Monday in black pants and a decidedly
un-Whitneyesque tank top (with bra strap showing, one editor
reported).
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whitney, who favors Armani and Donna Karan suits, will stay
in the office until the end of this week. Asked to discuss Ms.
Fuller, she replied with one word: ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   On the wall by her desk, among plaques from the American Society
of Magazine Editors and Planned Parenthood, is a plaque honoring
Glamour for an article titled ``Sexy Bottoms.'' (``See? We win for
all sorts of stories.'' )
</P>
<P>
   She reached for a picture of some women Glamour had singled out
as notable and pointed to her friends: Tipper Gore, Susan Faludi,
Christie Whitman, Donna Shalala, Pat Schroeder, Mary Matalin. Then
she pointed to a plaque commending an article titled ``Truth in
Fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We win a lot of awards for `truth in' stories,'' she said.
``Truth in Beauty. Truth in Fashion. Truth in anything. Because
when women think they're not getting all the truth, they're usually
right.''

ON PRO FOOTBALL: REDSKINS HOPE TWO BOOKENDS FIT IN TROPHY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Redskins reviewed their 8-7-1 season from a
year ago and found a hole in their hearts. A hole right smack in
the middle of their defense.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents ran right at them. The Redskins allowed an average of
138.3 rushing yards a game, and that was the worst in the National
Football Conference. Washington allowed 4.4 yards a carry; that
equaled the Chicago Bears, a team that won only four games.
Washington's sack total was 37, 13th among the 15 NFC teams.
Overall, Washington ranked 16th in defense and 28th in rushing
defense in the 30-team National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   The more glamorous positions on defense, where money is more
often spent, are cornerback, linebacker and end. Rarely does a team
try to revamp its defense by acquiring tackles _ and by spending
$57.4 million to do it. But that was what Washington did.
</P>
<P>
   In are Dan Wilkinson from the Cincinnati Bengals and Dana
Stubblefield from the San Francisco 49ers. The average size of this
duo of defensive tackles is 6 feet 3 inches and 314 pounds. The
average of their contracts is five and a half years, $28.7 million.
Wilkinson was the NFL's No. 1 draft pick in 1994, a dominating
player from Ohio State who toiled in misery with the Bengals.
Stubblefield was the 1997 NFL defensive player of the year with the
49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Dan and Dana.
</P>
<P>
   No. 94 and No. 95, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Ages 25 and 27, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson on the left side of the defensive line, Stubblefield
on the right.
</P>
<P>
   The dream is that both will sparkle beginning on Sunday
afternoon in Giants Stadium when the Redskins clash with the Giants
in the season opener for both teams. The hope is that they will
plug the middle of the Washington defense. The concept is that with
a sure middle, the team's swift and strong linebacking trio, led by
Ken Harvey, and a prickly secondary, led by cornerbacks Darrell
Green and Cris Dishman, will soar even more.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins begin seeing if hope matches reality in five days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beautiful having these guys in here, but right now it's
still a dream that they solve the problem,'' said Mike Nolan, the
Washington defensive coordinator. ``In baseball, people there talk
about being sound up the middle; having a good catcher, shortstop
and second baseman and a good center fielder. In offensive
football, you talk about the middle, about having a center,
quarterback and running back. Well, on defense, you must have
tackles, a middle linebacker and safety, good ones, to win
championships. The last time I checked, the quickest and easiest
way to the end zone was right down the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, that is where Washington added glue. Will it stick? ``One
or two players does not make a defense,'' Wilkinson said. ``But
maybe one or two guys can make a big difference for a defense. When
the Redskins signed Dana, it made the team more attractive to me. I
saw an opportunity to get with a team that could make the playoffs
and do something special. It was a chance for me to get my career
started the way I wanted. In Cincinnati in four seasons I had three
different line coaches and three different schemes. I didn't play
well and was put in bad situations with losing teams. This is a big
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Stubblefield, however, knows success. During his five NFL
seasons, all with the 49ers, he earned NFL defensive rookie of the
year honors in 1993, three trips to the Pro Bowl and a championship
ring in Super Bowl XXIX (San Francisco 49, San Diego 26). ``There
are a lot of reasons why I am here besides the money: a
playoff-caliber team, great linebackers, great coaching, great
organization, a great city,'' Stubblefield said. ``I want to help
this team practice harder. I want it to win big.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson and Stubblefield will go about it in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson is active. He is a big man who uses finesse and speed
to win his matchups and chase the ball. Stubblefield is a slugger.
He is often double-teamed and still packs a punch. If teams try to
block him with one lineman, he can often toss that guy aside as if
the player were a 150-pounder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan is very athletic for a big man,'' Nolan said. ``He frees
himself and gets in the backfield. The thing is, we want him to
then make the play, to not be so quick that he runs by the play.
Dana wins at the point of attack. He wins the majority of his
one-on-one battles, and that is the essence of a football player.
And he's played in big games.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Stubblefield is a dominant player, he is often not
mentioned among the game's best. He is overlooked. He knows part of
that is because he plays at defensive tackle. Who notices tackles?
Not many.
</P>
<P>
   And for all of his career he has played in a place _ San
Francisco _ where offense was king.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to my name not being household,'' Stubblefield said.
``But I know my role and what I'm supposed to do. I'm supposed to
take on double-teams and free people, especially the linebackers. I
have to make the plays I'm supposed to make when they are there in
front of me to make.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Just when the Redskins believed they had solved a problem, here
comes another. Defensive end Rich Owens sustained a season-ending
knee injury in the preseason. Expect offenses, starting with the
Giants', to run plenty of backside or cutback runs against
Washington. The idea will be to start the running play at the
middle and then break it back to the outside, where the Redskins
appear to be weaker now.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tactic that Wilkinson and Stubblefield expect. The
Redskins must compensate. With a new stadium, so much tradition and
no playoff games since 1992, the time to make hope reality is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know all of that, and I don't see any reason to talk about
it anymore,'' Wilkinson said. ``Let's just go out and make it
happen.''

INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS SPUR DECLINE, ANALYSTS SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sensing a deteriorating world economy,
institutional investors went on a profit-taking spree that sent
U.S. stock markets swooning.
</P>
<P>
   In a day of near-record trade volume Monday, the Dow Jones
industrial average lost 512 points, or 6.4 percent of its value,
the second-largest point drop in the index's history. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 Index similarly fell with a 5.2 percent dip, while the
Nasdaq composite index lost 8.6 percent, its worst decline since
the crash of October 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Trading took on a manic quality late in the day with 80 percent
of the Dow's losses occurring in the final 95 minutes of business,
or roughly 1 point every 14 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said responsibility for Monday's sharp decline lies
squarely with institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you see a huge plunge like this it's institutional
investors moving en masse to get out or lighten their load,'' said
Jeff Hooked, director of Washington, D.C.-based Emerging Markets
Partnership, a private placement investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   Coming after three years of phenomenal growth _ but more
recently, after several months of steady declines _ large investors
such as pension, hedge and mutual funds are trying to lock in
profits made on the stock market since 1995, said Susan Pevear, a
senior analyst at New York-based Standard &AMP; Poor's.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're afraid that's all going to be lost,'' Pevear said.
``You can cite Russia or Latin America or Asia as the cause, but
the cumulative effect is a (sell) mind-set.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the cash that was pulled from the market Monday appeared
headed for the safety of government bonds, which have seen yields
drop and prices rise.The 30-year Treasury benchmark bond rose
1.46875 points Monday, or $14.69 per $1,000 invested. Its yield,
which moves opposite the price, dropped to 5.24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone just wants Treasuries, you're seeing that in all
markets,'' China Trust Bank's Bob Laskowski told The Associated
Press. Laskowski, who manages about $220 million in bonds for the
bank, said he expects yields on government bonds to decline
further.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not every large investor was in a stock-selling mood Monday.
And as prices dropped, some who earlier in the day had sold shares
found themselves wooed by low prices to reinvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Youcan't get around the fact that for every buyer there's a
seller,'' said Larry Harris, a former visiting economist at the New
York Stock Exchange and a professor at the University of Southern
California's Marshall School of Business. ``Some people panicked
and for them (a large drop) takes on a life of its own. Others
think it's a terrific opportunity to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, small investors Monday and in recent weeks have
emerged as more sedate than their professional counterparts,
several analysts said. Monday's sell-off was ``Wall Street in
action, not Main Street,'' Pevear said.
</P>
<P>
   Minneapolis-based American Express Financial Advisors, which
manages $200 billion in assets, said as of last Friday that
investors in the company's mutual funds have deposited and
withdrawn funds in roughly equal amounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't see an outflow from small investors,'' said
Peter Anderson, American Express chief investment officer.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were mixed Monday on whether the market has bottomed
out now, or more declines lie ahead. ``We're going to hit a floor
pretty soon or a lot of companies are going to become takeover
bait,'' said Hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Anderson, say the market may drop further,
perhaps to 7,200 before rebounding. ``But that's assuming we don't
roll into a recession in 1999,'' Anderson said. ``If we do, we
won't be seeing 500-point drops, but a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   While Monday's point drop was the second largest in the history
of the Dow, it was still far short of the 900-point drop necessary
for circuit breakers on the New York Stock Exchange to activate.
New steeper limits allow the NYSE to drop 10 percent, 20 percent
and 30 percent before graduated halts in trading go into effect.
Limits on computer-run program trading also are activated when the
market moves 50 points up or down.
</P>
<P>
   That trading was allowed to continue even in the near-free fall
of Monday's final hour is a good thing, said USC's Harris. ``Had
people been worried about the market closing, they might have tried
to trade ahead of that,'' sending stock down further still, he
said. &QL;

 Investors Ready to Seize the Day   By Mark Veverka  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gas up the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Load your tackle box.
</P>
<P>
   Buy your bait.
</P>
<P>
   And then wait. Yup, wait.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably premature to start fishing the bottom of the
market for prize catches, but it may not be long before it's open
season on battered stocks. The plunge in the Dow Jones industrial
average is still a fraction of a percentage point from meeting the
technical criteria for a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow is down 19.26 percent from its all-time high in July,
and the academic definition of a bear market is a slide of 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, few fund managers and professional traders are
prepared to call yesterday's barbarous destruction the last of the
pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in a mad rush to do any (immediate) buying. I'm going
to sit on my cash and kind of see where this thing backfills,''
says Arthur Bonnel, manager of the Bonnel Growth Fund, part of San
Antonio's US Global Investors Group.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it's never too early to bait your hook and start to
focus on those stocks that you would like to buy when you think
they have hit their lowest ebb, Bonnel says. And naturally, the
veteran stock picker has a list of stocks he is eyeing.
</P>
<P>
   One favorite is Scientific-Atlanta, the Norcross, Ga., maker of
set-top boxes that convert digital television signals to analog
broadcast signals. Television stations will soon begin to send
digital signals, and consumers will be able to convert their sets
by buying or renting these boxes, he says. The stock closed
yesterday around $18, down 36 percent from its 52-week high of 28.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Bonnel isn't alone. There isn't much else for fund
managers to do but scour the market for potential bargains. And
Alan Snyder of Snyder Capital Management in San Francisco is
scratching out his shopping list.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that list is Eidos, a United Kingdom-based video
gamemaker whose American depositary receipts, ADRs, are trading at
$9.50 _ off 57 percent from their 52-week high of about $22. What
Snyder likes best about the stock is that it is carrying about $5 a
share in cash and liquid assets, which means the shares are
actually selling for $4.50 a share. Sony has included one of
Eidos's games in its marketing materials, which should give the
British company's products an edge, Snyder says.
</P>
<P>
   Another stock is General Instrument, a Horsham, Pa. maker of
cable television equipment, including the boxes that go on top of
your set. The stock closed at about around $20 yesterday, down
about 32 percent from its 52-week high of $29.50.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder thinks the stock is undervalued because Wall Street
analysts have not focused on the company's wholly owned subsidiary,
NextLevel, which makes ``the guts of the cable television
equipment'' for telephone companies. Snyder contends that the
Street is ignoring the unit's value, which he says is worth $6 to
$8 a share.
</P>
<P>
   General Instrument was expected to spin-off NextLevel, and
Snyder is confident that the offering will go forward despite the
current market turmoil. Cable giant Telecommunications Inc.,
(better known as TCI) owns about a 22 percent stake in stock and
warrants. And thus, he speculates that General Instrument is
takeover bait.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the stock gets too low, I think somebody _ like TCI _ will
just (buy) out the company,''says Snyder whose firm manages assets
of about $1.25 billion. ``That's why I'm so high on the stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Another bargain hunter we checked in with is emerging growth
specialist James Broadfoot, chief investment officer of Ivy
Management in Boca Raton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Broadfoot especially likes companies with little foreign
exposure, especially in Asia, solid and predictable growth, and
strong balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
   One of his favorites is Property Recovery Group International.
The firm provides accounts payable and other audit services to
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based company closed around $19, down about 44
percent from its 52-week high. Broadfoot sees this company as a
grower whose services will be in even higher demand if the economy
starts to put the squeeze on retailers.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, bottom-fishing is fraught with risk. In fact, the
bottom of a market usually does not become totally evident until it
is in the rear view mirror, warns US Global's Bonnel. But still,
for those willing to cast their lines, there can be huge rewards in
picking a battered stock and watching it reach its full potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunes are made in bear markets, and fortunes are realized
in bull markets,'' Bonnel says.  &LR; id  &LR;  &QL;

GOVERNMENT QUOTES GATES DEPOSITION IN DEFENSDING MICROSOFT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government is attempting to use Bill Gates' own
words against him, quoting from last week's deposition of the
Microsoft chairman in defending its case against the software
giant.
</P>
<P>
   The federal and state governments included Gates comments in a
lengthy document filed with the U.S. District Court Monday night,
urging a judge to reject Microsoft's request that the case be
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The government declined to make copies of the filing available
for reporters, saying confidential information had not yet been
edited from the document.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer familiar with the filing said that when Gates was
questioned at Microsoft last Thursday and Friday, he made comments
that supported the government case, and those comments were
excerpted in the filing.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer declined to be more specific, and Microsoft said the
oblique characterization of a secret deposition was unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Gates is scheduled to be deposed for a third day Wednesday.
Government attorneys said Gates was so argumentative that they
could not get answers to all their questions during the first round
of questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials responded that Gates was fully cooperative
during the questioning, and that government lawyers were frustrated
that he didn't say what they wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   The deposition of Gates is to resume in Redmond, Wash., as both
sides frantically prepare for a Sept. 23 trial in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The trial will be to determine whether Microsoft illegally
sought to extend a monopoly on computer operating system into the
market for Internet browsers, as is contended by the attorneys
general of the United States, 20 states and the District of
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has sought to have the case dismissed, saying that an
appeals court ruling upholding its integration of an Internet
browser into an earlier version of its operating system vindicates
its marketing strategy and undermines the government's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the appeals court ruling, we believe the government's
case has been dealt a serious blow, and we believe the court can
resolve this matter for consumers without the need for a long and
expensive trial,'' said Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray.
</P>
<P>
   But in Monday's filing, according to a lawyer familiar with the
document, the governments argued against the dismissal. The
governments said there are facts in dispute in the case, which
means it can not be dismissed before a trial.
</P>
<P>
   In its filing, the government cites not only the Gates
deposition, but also depositions of officials from Intel, Apple
Computer and Real Networks to bolster its contention that Microsoft
has illegally sought to stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft denies that contention, and says the effort to broaden
the case beyond allegations about the company's relationship with
Netscape shows that the government has become desperate to save a
weakened lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Microsoft has sought to bolster its defense by
subpoenaing internal Netscape Communications Corp. e-mail that
Microsoft believes will show Netscape engineers believed
Microsoft's browser was superior to Netscape's.

 This Year, Seybold Seethes With Fear _ Quark, Adobe Battle  Rattles
Publishing Forum   By Benny Evangelista  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
As he prepared to fly to San Francisco for a major publishing
industry conference this week, Quark Inc. CEO Tim Gill insisted
that he's not trying to start a fight, but a ``friendly
discussion'' about buying bigger rival Adobe Systems Inc.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``If they do want to talk, that would be really cool,'' Gill
said in a telephone interview yesterday from Quark's Denver
headquarters. Gill added that he wants to get Adobe stockholders,
customers and executives talking about a deal ``and maybe they'll
come to a place that's a little more mellow.''
</P>
<P>
   But the brewing battle between two desktop publishing pioneers
has raised the level of angst among the more than 43,000 publishing
industry professionals who are descending today on San Francisco's
Moscone Convention Center for the Seybold Seminars Publishing 98.
Many see Gill as anything but mellow and consider Quark an
aggressor seeking to dismantle the consumer-friendly Adobe Systems,
which has emphatically rejected Quark's offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be vehemently opposed to such an acquisition,'' said
Paul Beyer, who, as an executive at Boston's Banta Corp., a
printing and digital imaging firm, is a major customer of both
firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It foreshadows not only the eventual downfall of Quark, but it
would be a detrimental move for the whole graphic arts industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Quark's overtures to Adobe figure to be the major
behind-the-scenes topic during Seybold, which runs through Friday.
Conference organizers hastily scheduled a ``group therapy'' session
tomorrow afternoon for attendees to ``share your pain, to sort out
your confusion and soothe your anguish'' over the proposed
Quark-Adobe takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get any bigger than this for our business,'' said
Thad McIlroy, a co-chairman of the conference, which shifts into
full gear today.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``People have these strong relationships with their
software,'' and news of Quark's bid for Adobe makes them nervous,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is the fate of San Jose's Adobe Systems, which
announced a management shakeup last month and plans to lay off up
to 300 employees, about 10 percent of its worldwide workforce.
Adobe, known for graphics and desktop publishing programs such as
Adobe PhotoShop, Illustrator and PageMaker, projected flat earnings
or a net loss for the quarter ended yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Quark, a privately owned company whose flagship product is an
electronic page-layout program called QuarkXPress, is about
one-fifth the size of Adobe. But Adobe's stock, which peaked at
nearly $53 per share last September, has since plummeted 50 percent
to $26.25 per share yesterday, leaving an opening for Quark to make
an offer.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe founders John Warnock and Charles Geschke, saying they
have not seen a specific, bona fide offer, have flat out rejected
Quark's overtures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not for sale,'' Warnock said in an interview. ``That
doesn't mean that if someone should come in and offer one
incredible number and it was financible, we would turn it down. We
don't believe that is happening here.''
</P>
<P>
   Geschke said neither Gill nor Quark CEO Fred Ebrahimi has
personally contacted either him or Warnock about a sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little disingenuous to say it's a friendly thing if you
don't make a little phone call and say, `Let's go to lunch and
discuss this,' '' Geschke said.
</P>
<P>
   Some financial and industry analysts were ready to dismiss the
move as a Quark publicity stunt or a last-gasp pre-emptive strike
to prevent Adobe from knocking Quark out of business with a new
``Quark-killer'' page-layout program scheduled for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of problems with a Quark and Adobe
combination,'' said Louis Mazzucchelli, an analyst with Gerard
Klauer Mattison. ``Even if Quark can scrape up enough money,
they're going to end up dismantling Adobe. I can't imagine either
Geschke or Warnock saying, `We think this is a good idea.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Adobe has reduced its dependence on the fate of Apple Computer,
so it might not benefit as much from Apple's recent resurgence,
Mazzucchelli said. Still, Adobe should be able to pull out of its
nose-dive if it can refocus its strengths in desktop publishing and
refocus on new Web-publishing products, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took their eye off the ball for a little while,'' he
said. ``But they have very good market share and good brand
equity.''
</P>
<P>
   But other observers say Quark and Adobe were two companies that
prospered in a desktop publishing market that now has peaked.
Combined, they finally could catch the wave in Web publishing that
both so far have missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is serious and well worth considering,'' McIlroy said.
``To me, there's nothing casual or careless or insincere on Quark's
part. Anyone who wants to ridicule Quark is just taking a cheap
shot. You can't make fun of their product or the talent of Tim Gill
or the people at the company.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  At least one publishing customer agreed that a Quark-Adobe
union might be beneficial. ``If they don't come together,
financially, they are both in trouble,'' said Walter Schild,
founder of Genex Interactive, a Culver City software developer and
interactive-advertising consultant. ``Their tools really work well
together, and I'd like to see them come together and make a solid
platform for publishing.''

 911 Cell-Phone Location Just a Jingle Away   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
You're in an unfamiliar area, and you get into a car wreck. You're
not hurt, but there are injuries in the other vehicle. You whip out
your cell phone and dial 911. Then you try to explain where you are
so that the police can send help.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The problem of locating cellular callers has always been a
bugaboo for 911 workers, but a solution appears imminent. Starting
in November, Audiovox will ship a phone that uses a built-in global
positioning satellite service (GPS) to pinpoint a caller's
location.
</P>
<P>
   Pressing the 911 button on the Audiovox FoneFinder phone
initiates a phone call to 911 and sends your exact latitude and
longitude to the 911 center. The phone can be connected to any
cellular service, with no extra charge for calls utilizing the
location feature.
</P>
<P>
   The technology behind the phone was developed by Robert Tendler,
chairman of Boston-based Tendler Cellular, who got the idea after
inventing a similar system for ship-to-shore radios.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a patent attorney by trade who went wrong and actually
invented something,'' said Tendler, who is patent counselor for the
U.S. arm of Mitsubishi Electric.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is in talks with other phone manufacturers, including
Nokia, and that a major automaker may offer his system as an
accessory.
</P>
<P>
   The new phone does have a couple of drawbacks: It won't work
indoors (because it needs to ``see'' the satellites), and it's
expensive, at about $400.
</P>
<P>
   If you're willing to wait at least until next year, you may be
able to get 911-location service that will work with your existing
phone. Cellular companies are examining technology that will let
them locate callers using special networks at cell sites.
</P>
<P>
   TruePosition, a Pennsylvania company, has conducted successful
trials of the new network approach in New Jersey and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is looking at these two solutions, but Tendler is
the only guy with something that will solve the problem right
now,'' said Lynsie Hall, consultant to the Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   James Daurio, a vice president for Audiovox, said his company
decided to make the FoneFinder ``because our feeling is it's an
immediate solution to a big problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, 911 centers receive an estimated 30 million calls from
cell phones each year. Tendler said Massachusetts, where he lives,
takes in 40,000 calls a month.

 What to Do If the Works Isn't Enough   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
   
Q: The IBM Aptiva PC I bought last summer came loaded with
Microsoft Works (oxymoron!). I've been using it in my job as a
consultant, but it isn't easy to make labels, create databases and
perform mail merges. I am thinking about replacing Works with Word
or Office. Which would you suggest?
<TEXT>
<P>
   A: To be fair, Works isn't a heavy-duty program designed for
business use. It's just an integrated suite that includes a basic
word processor, database and spreadsheet. It will do the things you
require but not as well or as efficiently as a full-fledged office
suite.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Word by itself won't solve your problem. You need to
get the Professional Edition of Microsoft Office, which includes
Word as well as Access, a really good database program. You also
might consider two other options, the professional version of the
Corel WordPerfect Suite or the Lotus SmartSuite. They also have all
the weapons any consultant could ask for. Personally, I'd probably
opt for the Microsoft suite because it's so widely used. You can
send a Word document by e-mail and be fairly confident that the
recipient also will have Word.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a Windows PC with Netscape. When Macintosh users send
me graphics files as e-mail attachments, I can't use them. I can't
save the files, and Netscape won't open them in its mail program.
And sometimes, the attachments just come as garble inside the
message itself. Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   A: Macs use a different method than PCs to encode e-mail for
transmission across the Internet. However, newer versions of
Netscape are equipped to decode the Mac system, which is called
BinHex. So under normal circumstances, you should be able to open
and read attachments.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Netscape tell me that your symptoms suggest that
the attachment either was improperly coded by the sending computer
or was corrupted during its trek through an Internet gateway.
</P>
<P>
   One possible solution is to ask senders to use MIME _ rather
than BinHex _ if their e-mail program supports it. MIME is the
standard Internet protocol and the method used most often in
sending messages between PCs.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work, you might try asking the sender to
manually encode the graphic using UUencode before attaching it to

too, because you'll have to decode the graphic when it arrives.
Fortunately, Uuencoding utilities are widely available as
shareware.

<P>
   Q: My daughter has a 486-DX running at 33 megahertz with 8
megabytes of RAM and a 700-Mbyte hard drive. It's running Windows
3.1. Would this system support Windows 95 or Windows 98? And if
not, would you recommend upgrading or would you recommend a newer
system?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sorry, your trusty old machine is too underpowered for
Windows 95 or Windows 98, both of which need a Pentium-class chip
and at least 16 megs of memory to perform adequately. To bring your
system up to par, you'd have to add memory, upgrade the chip, get a
bigger hard drive and add a CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   A total face-lift like that would run at least $600. You'd
probably be better off just buying a new system. For $800, you
should be able to find one with a 266 MHz chip, 32 megs of memory,
a 4-gigabyte hard drive and a 24x CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend of mine is producing a newsletter and brochures for
a community group and wants to make some backup files. However,
documents like the newsletter are too big to fit on a floppy disk.
The person doesn't have a Zip drive. So what are the options,
besides splitting the newsletter into five different documents?
</P>
<P>
   A: Your best bet is to compress the document using a zipping
utility. I was able to take a 2-Mbyte newsletter created on
Microsoft Publisher and get it down to less than 500,000 bytes by
using Zip-IT, a $39.95 program from Quarterdeck. The amount of
compression will depend on the kind of files you're dealing with _
some graphical images can be reduced by more than 90 percent! If
you're looking for a good shareware zipping program, try WinZip, a
perennial favorite.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK &QC;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Create a Startup Disk for Windows 95 or Windows 98. If your hard
drive fails, you can use the disk to start your computer, diagnose
and fix common hard disk problems. Go to the Windows Control Panel,
open the Add/Remove Programs icon, tab over to Startup Disk and
follow the instructions.

 Norwest, Wells Pick Key Staff   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Wells Fargo and Norwest banks named executives to head six key
staff functions and four business units in preparation for their
impending merger.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Separately, the Federal Reserve Board announced yesterday that
it will hold a single hearing September 17 in Minneapolis for the
public to discuss the impact of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   If the merger is approved, as expected, by regulators and
shareholders, Wells President Rod Jacobs will be chief financial
officer of the combined bank, which will be called Wells Fargo and
be based in San Francisco. Norwest CFO John Thornton intends to
retire in mid-1999. Wells CFO Ross Kari will be deputy CFO.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Vice Chairman David Hoyt will head commercial and
wholesale banking businesses. Wells Vice Chairman Charlie Johnson,
who heads wholesale banking, plans to retire at the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Norwest Executive Vice President Tom Emerson will become chief
auditor. Wells EVP Eric Shand will be in charge of risk asset
review. Wells EVP Donald Dana will manage corporate properties.
Norwest's Bob Strickland will head investor relations.
</P>
<P>
   Norwest's Jerry Gray will lead small-business lending. Wells'
Dick Schliesmann will be in charge of auto finance. Deb Moore,
president of Norwest Card Services, will be in charge of card
services for the combined bank.
</P>
<P>
   In another announcement, Wachovia Corp. of Winston-Salem, N.C.,
has agreed to buy $304 million of credit card loans from Wells
Fargo. This follows Wells' announcement last month that it planned
to sell off about $700 million of its credit card loans, about 16
percent of its portfolio, that go to less credit-worthy consumers.

HARSHBARGER, CELLUCCI INCREASE LEADS, POLL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS AND JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With two weeks to go to the primary election, Acting
Governor Paul Cellucci holds a commanding lead over state Treasurer
Joseph D. Malone in the Republican gubernatorial primary and
Attorney General Scott Harshbarger has pulled far ahead of his two
Democratic rivals, according to two recent Boston Globe/WBZ-TV
polls.
</P>
<P>
   According to the most recent survey taken Saturday and Sunday,
Cellucci, who trounced Malone at the Republican Party convention in
April, now leads by a 25 point margin _ 55 percent to 30 percent
with 12 percent undecided _ among 400 likely GOP primary voters.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger, who won a narrow victory at the Democratic Party's
endorsement convention in June, holds a 31-point lead over his
nearest rival, former state senator Patricia McGovern. Harshbarger
received 50 percent of the likely Democratic voters surveyed, while
McGovern polled 19 percent. Former US representative Brian Donnelly
received 8 percent. Twenty percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   With a series of televised debates and an expected ad blitz by
contenders from both parties still to come, strategists from all
the campaigns believe a significant number of people will make up
their minds or switch allegiances between now and Sept. 15. In
fact, McGovern, who has been absent from the airwaves throughout
the summer, plans to kick off a $600,000 TV campaign today.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the GOP contenders square off in a televised debate
in Springfield Tuesday night. A media consortium that includes the
Globe, the Boston Herald, and major TV stations, plans two debates
before the primary: a Democratic debate at the Kennedy Library
Wednesday and a GOP debate from Worcester on Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe poll taken this weekend, conducted by KRC
Communications Research of Newton, has a margin of error of plus or
minus 5 percentage points. It is the second survey taken in the
last week confirming that the leads of Cellucci and Harshbarger are
substantial. An earlier one conducted by KRC between Aug. 24-27
showed the gap as wide as 41 points for both Cellucci over Malone
and Harshbarger over McGovern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republican primary voters feel Cellucci has done a very good
job as acting governor and see no reason to vote him out,'' said
Gerry Chervinsky, president of KRC Communications Research.
</P>
<P>
   Chervinsky explained the statistical differences in the two
samples by saying likely voters polled during the week may have
different opinions from voters found at home on the weekend. He
also said that the swing by some measures is statistically
insignificant when accounting for the margins of error in both
polls, even though the difference in the gap between the surveys
appear large.
</P>
<P>
   Because Cellucci and Harshbarger's leads seemed so large in last
week's poll _ and larger than in &UR;  &LR; other recent polls _ the Globe
elected to survey a second sample of voters last weekend. Although
the gap was narrower, the second poll still showed the two
front-runners far ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are a blow to Malone's contention that he has
closed the wide gap between him and Cellucci. Last week, the Malone
campaign released its own poll showing him trailing the acting
governor by less than 5 percentage points. Other independent polls
have calculated the gap at between 18 and 30 points.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic contest, Chervinsky also noted that
Harshbarger's support is strong in all age, gender, and income
categories among those surveyed over the weekend. ``It appears that
the primary electorate has basically decided that he is the best
candidate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chervinsky said the survey did find that Harshbarger has not
connected as well as he might on the issues. ``It's more a question
of his ads, his party nomination, and the feeling among Democrats
that he is a winner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chervinsky said the poll indicates that independents, who often
have been a decisive factor in party contests, are shying away from
voting in either primary. In the Republican sample, 59 percent are
GOP registered and 41 percent consider themselves independents. In
some actual election primaries, independents have made up as much
as 50 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Even the negative television ads that both Republican candidates
have thrown at each other has not yet hurt them with voters.
Cellucci is viewed favorably by 63 percent of the GOP primary
voters, while 13 percent give him an unfavorable rating. Malone has
a 48 percent favorable rating and a 16 percent unfavorable rating.
</P>
<P>
   If the Democratic primary were held tomorrow, 50 percent of
likely Democratic voters surveyed said they would choose
Harshbarger. Of those voters, Harshbarger received slightly more
support from women than men, 51 to 49 percent, and from Democrats
than Independents by 51 to 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's support also comes largely from people
aged 18 to 39. Within that age bracket, 54 percent support
Harshbarger, while 52 percent of the people over the age of 65
support him.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen percent of likely Democratic voters said they would
vote for McGovern. Her supporters are more likely to be women than
men, by 24 to 13 percent, and slightly more are likely to be
Democrats than independents, by 19 to 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Donnelly would attract 8 percent of all likely Democratic voters
and his support comes more from men than women, but is split
equally among Democrats and Independents. Donnelly's supporters
also fall in nearly equal parts from every age range.

PTA UNDER FIRE FOR LETTING ADVERTISER USE ITS NAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ohio, Tenn., Texas)  (js) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a decision critics say is at odds with its own policy
opposing commercialism in schools, the national PTA has agreed to
let its name and logo appear, for a fee, in back-to-school
advertisements by a large office-supply chain.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, approved earlier this summer by the PTA's
president, Lois Jean White of Nashville, Tenn., is the first of its
kind for the 102-year-old association, a nonprofit lobby whose 6.5
million members are teachers, parents and others interested in
education issues.
</P>
<P>
   The deal has resulted in a program called Supporting School
Values that was created by the chain, Office Depot Inc. Since the
middle of August, the program has featured television and print
advertisements that include the slogan ``Proud to Sponsor the
National PTA,'' as well as the association's telephone numbers and
Web-site address.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been involved with a lot of organizations, like the
National Leukemia Society and the Urban League,'' said an Office
Depot spokesman, Gary Schweikhart. ``But this year we really wanted
to align ourselves with the national PTA, which is the biggest and
most respected education organization out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The program, which Schweikhart said had been developed by Office
Depot and then proposed to the PTA, includes coupon books for
Office Depot discounts that were mailed to millions of the
association's members. In addition, laptop computers were given to
every state PTA office as well as the national office, Schweikhart
said. A back-to-school sweepstakes and a ``teacher appreciation
breakfast,'' both of which include ``shopping sprees'' at Office
Depot, are also being advertised with the PTA logo, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Yoxall, a spokeswoman at the association's headquarters in
Chicago, said that ``we are pleased by the initial response'' to
the program, adding that in an organization with millions of
members, ``I have received three phone calls'' of protest.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yoxall declined to say how much the association had been
paid for the use of its name, and called the agreement ``a member
service'' in which Office Depot was sponsoring the national PTA
rather than receiving an endorsement, which the association's
policy prohibits.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Igo, the association's vice president for legislation,
said: ``We've done our research on it, we've had legal counsel on
it, and it was the consensus of the leadership that we were not in
violation of our policy. We're not selling Office Depot materials
in the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   But at a time when schools are increasingly attractive targets
for marketers of consumer products ranging from sneakers to soft
drinks, other officials of the association said they were concerned
about the message it was sending to schoolchildren, even though the
agreement stops short of endorsing Office Depot or any specific
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the TV ad, and I called the national headquarters for an
explanation of what this was all about,'' said Millie Waterman of
Mentor, Ohio, a former officer of the national PTA who remains a
consultant to her state chapter. ``I certainly have a concern about
it, that it violates the national PTA's noncommercial policy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A Texas PTA official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
she was also worried about a secondary message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took offense at the commercial,'' she said, noting that the
Dilbert character in it said, ``Don't be a dork when you go back to
school.'' Her objection, she said, is that a remark like that one
runs counter to what the association wants to encourage in
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything,'' she said, ``the PTA wants kids to feel
comfortable about their appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Hagelshaw, a senior program director for the Center for
Commercial Free Public Education, an advocacy group based in
Oakland, Calif., said the agreement with Office Depot amounted to
``a shift'' by the association.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been calling us,'' Hagelshaw said. ``A lot of the
public is just finding out about it as they get ready to go back to
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Another education advocate, Arnold Fege, former legislative
director of the national PTA, said, ``It seems to me that
back-to-school should not be about buying and selling, but about
teaching and learning and ratcheting up reform.''
</P>
<P>
   While the agreement may be reminiscent of the ill-fated one last
summer between the American Medical Association and Sunbeam Corp.,
Schweikhart said Office Depot had ``bent over backwards not to
abuse the PTA and their reputation in any way.'' He added that one
proposal by the company, for rebates to schools in return for
association members' shopping at Office Depot, had been turned down
by the PTA as too blatant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The national PTA thought that would be crossing the line,
telling people you have to shop at Office Depot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA-Sunbeam agreement, in which the medical association was
to endorse Sunbeam products like heating pads in exchange for
royalty payments, raised so many objections among doctors and
consumer lobbies that the AMA withdrew. That prompted a lawsuit
against the association by Albert Dunlap, then Sunbeam's chief
executive. Eventually the association's chief executive, Dr. P.
John Seward, resigned, calling the Sunbeam contract ``a serious
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   But many nonprofits have seen the financial benefits of
licensing their names and logos to corporations. Such income is
usually tax free, as long as it can be shown to conform with the
nonprofit's mission. Corporations, meanwhile, can spruce up their
public image by being linked with an environmental or other
charitable activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a win-win for both sides,'' said Matt Landy, vice
president of the National Charities Information Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to licensing a name, the World Wildlife Fund is
among the better-organized nonprofits. Its marketing division,
which oversees agreements with manufacturers of binoculars,
pencils, neckties, Band-Aids and boxer shorts, now has a full-color
brochure that includes stickers with the fund's black-and-white
panda logo that corporations are invited to try out on their
products to imagine how such an affiliation would look.
</P>
<P>
   ``WWF is regarded as caring, responsible and credible, and can
help your product or service benefit from the fact that 76 percent
of Americans are more likely to buy a product that is linked to a
charity,'' says the brochure, which adds, ``Animal themes and WWF
are an evergreen concept with universal appeal that provide a
superior commercial opportunity. Remember, WWF is as interested in
the bottom line as you are.''

 Market's Rout Won't Cut Off Venture Capital to Startups   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Venture capitalist Roger McNamee paused during a telephone
interview about yesterday's market meltdown to shout at a partner,
``You buying Seibel (Systems)?''
<TEXT>
<P>
   McNamee's stock-buying spree was a sideline to his day job _
bankrolling startups. The good news, according to this venture
veteran, is that the current market rout won't cut off the flow of
capital to new startups, at least not for now.
</P>
<P>
   That's because VCs like him are already flush with cash that
poured into their funds while the stock market was booming. They'll
invest this money over the next few years, almost regardless of
what happens on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   That means startups are unlikely to break their leases or quit
hiring just because stocks are having a lousy month.
</P>
<P>
   Some startups will even find the nerve to go public in this
market maelstrom. eBay, the Internet auction site headquartered in
San Jose, is supposedly primed to pop out the IPO pipeline next
week.
</P>
<P>
   And keep your eye on Healtheon, the latest company founded by
Jim Clark. He's already scored twice with Silicon Graphics and
Netscape. Clark is poised for a threepeat and is rumored ready to
file an IPO for Healtheon, which uses the Internet to expedite
health insurance transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course if the market free-fall goes long enough and deep
enough, all bets are off. IPOs could dry up, which would eventually
staunch the flow of venture capital, and with it, Bay Area
startups.
</P>
<P>
   But McNamee was betting yesterday that wouldn't happen, that
Wall Street would soon hit bottom, making this a bargain market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through enough of these corrections to know it
doesn't matter what you owned going into them,'' he said. ``What
matters is what you own coming out.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Lonely hearts club?  &LR; As if the crises in world and financial
markets weren't enough, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University
have sown doubt about one of the cherished notions of Internet
advocates _ that the global network brings people together into
``virtual communities.''
</P>
<P>
   In a scientific paper that will be published this week in the
American Psychologist, Carnegie Mellon social psychology professor
Robert Kraut suggests that even a few hours a week spent online can
make people more lonely and depressed.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's how the study was encapsulated in a New York
Times article Sunday, and that's how it will reverberate through
other media. Howard Rheingold, the Mill Valley man who coined the
term virtual community a decade ago, sighed yesterday as he tried
to boil a complex discussion down into the bite-size sounds of
public debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kraut is a serious social scientist who has raised important
questions,'' Rheingold said. ``But you can't draw simple
conclusions from a complex study.''
</P>
<P>
   Rheingold said he'll read Kraut's paper to learn about the 169
people who formed his study sample: How well do they represent the
larger population of Web users? What did they do online, flirt in
chat rooms or frequent debating forums?
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we're fighting here is the mythology that
we've lost that Mayberry RFD community where everybody knew
everybody and nobody locked their doors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that face-to-face nirvana, if it ever existed, has long
since given way to the world in which autos and phones, jets and
television alternately tug us apart and pull us together. And he
hopes the current debate over Web communities doesn't lose sight of
the people for whom virtual friends may be the only kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've struck up an online friendship with a teenager afflicted
with severe cerebral palsy,'' he said. ``This is a person with no
other means of communicating with the outside world than punching
out messages into a keyboard with a stick on his head. Online has
widened his world.''
</P>
<P>
   For a scholarly look at how online technology has affected human
communities, Rheingold suggests a paper by Harvard University
sociologist William Galston  &LR; (www.ksg.harvard.edu/visions/ &LR; 
 &LR; galston.htm). &LR;
</P>
<P>
   David Farber, a University of Pennsylvania computer scientist
who publishes an influential online newsletter called ``Interesting
People,'' said most of his 25,000 subscribers have expressed
incredulity at the Carnegie-Mellon findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are online should poll others in their own personal
communities,'' he said. ``Ask them if they've seen more or less
loneliness or depression'' in their cyber circles.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; PowerBooked: &LR;  Apple Computer interim Chief Executive Steve
Jobs speaks at the Seybold publishing show at Moscone Center today.
Jobs, who always knows how to play to a crowd, is expected to tell
these Mac-loving folks that Apple will refresh its high-end
PowerBook line with three new systems based on the ultrafast G3
processor. The systems also will have 14.1-inch active-matrix

 As Stocks Skid, Tech Firms Examine Option Plans   By Arthur M. Louis  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
The stock market debacle of recent days could cause many Silicon
Valley companies to overhaul their stock-option programs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   High-tech workers traditionally receive the bulk of their pay in
stock options while accepting only modest salaries. But with stock
prices suddenly depressed, a lot of recently awarded option grants
have become worthless _ and if the bear market persists, they could
remain that way for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Compensation experts say this could cause a lot of companies to
reprice their options _ reducing the exercise price at which
employees can buy stock.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Advanced Micro Devices, Netscape and Oracle all
have millions of options outstanding with exercise prices below
their current market prices.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, AMD granted its employees options on more than 3
million shares, at an exercise price of $37.50 per share. AMD
hasn't traded near that price in about a year; it closed yesterday
at $13.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape, which closed yesterday at $18, granted options on more
than 7 million shares last year at exercise prices ranging from
$26.38 to $47.88.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle issued more than 16 million shares worth of options last
year at exercise prices in the mid-$20s per share. Its stock closed
yesterday at $19.94.
</P>
<P>
   An AMD spokesman said the company, which last repriced its
options in December 1996, currently isn't considering it.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment
about their stock-option plans.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are more or less forced to reprice their options if
they want to retain skilled workers in today's tight high-tech
labor market, notes Marty Katz, a compensation specialist with
William Mercer in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Carlson, chairman of Spectrum Economics in Palo Alto,
speculated that falling stock prices could lead to especially
serious labor problems at startup firms, where cash salaries are
practically nil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real threat is a downward death spiral for these
companies,'' he said. ``They could bleed to death as their
intellectual capital walks out the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies that might want to reprice their options currently are
under the gun because of a proposed ruling by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board.

   FASB wants to penalize companies that reprice their options by
forcing them to take a special charge against earnings. The charge
would be equal to the difference between the new exercise price and
any subsequent increase in the stock price, multiplied by the
number of shares for which options are granted.
</P>
<P>
   FASB won't put the rule into effect until it holds hearings and
solicits public comment. But sources say it wants to have the rule
apply to repricings that take place from 1999 onward.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley companies sometimes have repriced their options
even when the market was doing well. Occasionally, a company will
report disappointing earnings, its stock will tank and the board of
directors will respond by making it cheaper for employees to
exercise options.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer has repriced nine times, most recently in
December, when the stock was selling near its all-time low.
Employees were allowed to surrender their old options, most of them
priced well above the market, and receive new options that allowed
them to buy the stock at $13.69 per share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employee retention was an issue, and the majority of options
were above the market price,'' says Nancy Paxton, Apple's director
of investor relations.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a great deal for the employees because the
stock soared as high as $43 last month. By yesterday's close, it
had been pummeled down to $31.19, but the option-holders still show
a fat profit of $17.50 per share.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Apple probably won't be repricing again anytime
soon, Paxton indicates.
</P>
<P>
   Some compensation specialists frown on repricings.
</P>
<P>
   Because employees with stock options pull in plenty of money
when the market is hot, they should ``take their lumps'' when the
market is cold, says Graef ``Bud'' Crystal, a nationally renowned
compensation expert who publishes the Crystal Report in San Diego.

FRANCISCO SALVERON, 88, MACARTHUR'S AIDE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Va., Philippines)   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Francisco Salveron, a Philippine-born Army orderly whose
devotion to Gen. Douglas MacArthur in World War II gave him a
front-row role in MacArthur's historic return to the Philippines,
died Aug. 23. at his home in Bladensburg, Md. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lung cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   More than a half-century after V-J Day, a few photographs still
resonate as portrayals of embattled Americans: Eisenhower seeing
the paratroopers off on the eve of D-Day, the Marines raising the
American flag over Iwo Jima, and MacArthur splashing ashore at
Leyte Gulf in the Philippines on Oct. 20, 1944, fulfilling his
pledge when he left Corregidor: ``I shall return.''
</P>
<P>
   Salveron, who had left his family behind in Manila when he
joined the U.S. Army in 1942 and became MacArthur's personal aide,
was also returning. He had been with MacArthur daily for the
previous two years, rising before dawn to prepare the general's
breakfast and his uniforms, and now he was part of the seven-man
group that went ashore at Red Beach on Leyte island.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, walked through the surf, standing alongside the
general. At that instant, the sergeant even upstaged his country's
leaders. Sergio Osmena, the president-in-exile of the Philippines,
and Gen. Carlos Romulo, who would later serve as the nation's
foreign minister, were a few strides behind him.
</P>
<P>
   MacArthur's return to the Philippines, 31 months after his
retreat from the besieged isle of Corregidor, MacArthur's
headquarters off Manila, heralded a turning point in the Pacific
war. Some 200,000 American troops carried out an invasion of the
central Philippines while American ships and planes dealt a major
defeat to the Japanese navy over the following week in the Battle
of Leyte.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the grand strategy, the stakes were immensely personal for
Salveron, who had not heard from his family members all through the
Japanese occupation. He would not see them again until January
1945, when they were reunited near Manila.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember first going to where my house used to be,'' he told
The Prince George's (Md.) Journal in 1980. ``I just stood there and
stared with a tear in my eye, because my house was burned to ruins.
At the same time, a person who looked as if he hadn't eaten in
days, he was so skinny, came running to me. It was my
brother-in-law.''
</P>
<P>
   He soon found his wife and children in what he remembered as
``the greatest moment in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Salveron met MacArthur in 1942 while the general was visiting a
hospital in Brisbane, Australia, where Salveron was recovering from
a shoulder injury he had suffered when his medical-supply ship was
sunk by the Japanese. Despite his injuries, Salveron had managed to
scramble ashore and rescue several men who had lost arms and legs,
covering them with sand so that the scent of their blood would not
attract crocodiles. Soon he would become MacArthur's aide.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the Leyte Gulf invasion, MacArthur donned a
khaki uniform that Salveron had laid out, planning to make a very
dry and spiffy arrival on the beach. But when the barge carrying
the MacArthur party was 50 yards from shore, it ran aground on a
sand bar. One of MacArthur's aides telephoned the Navy beachmaster
to request a small landing craft to take the party all the way in,
but the beachmaster, who was overseeing the landings in his sector
amid the whiz of sniper bullets, snarled into the phone, ``Let 'em
walk.''
</P>
<P>
   So they did. What might have been an unremarkable photo of an
immaculate MacArthur on shore _ four hours after the first wave of
assault troops had arrived _ became a memorable image of the
general, in his familiar gold-braided hat and sunglasses, walking
in water that reached his knees.
</P>
<P>
   Later that afternoon, MacArthur made his famous speech from the
beach: ``People of the Philippines, I have returned.''
</P>
<P>
   Salveron took his family to the United States at war's end and
left the Army. Six months later, he enlisted in the Air Force. He
retired from the military in 1963 and formed a Douglas MacArthur
post of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, the government of the Philippines erected a memorial at
Leyte depicting the arrival of MacArthur and his men. Once again
Salveron was on the beach, this time cast in bronze. In 1994, on
the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the Philippines'
ambassador to the United States presented a liberation medal to
Salveron in a ceremony at Norfolk, Va. For one old soldier who
cherished another, the presentation was held at a perfect setting,
the Gen. Douglas MacArthur Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Anastacia, Salveron is survived by
three daughters, Norma Moore, of Arlington, Va., Alice Bell, of
Fairfax Station, Va., and Eveline Overmiller, of Prince Frederick,
Md.; a son, Arthur, of Bowie, Md; nine grandchildren; and two
great-grandchildren.

MARKET DROPS HAVE MUTUAL FUND INVESTORS' PHONES RINGING OFF HOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Switchboards lit up at mutual fund companies
across the country as worried investors weighed their options in
reaction to the plunge of several stock indexes.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the markets closed Monday, investors' concerns were
well-founded. The nation's three most-watched indexes _ the Dow
Jones industrial average, the Nasdaq composite index and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index _ had each fallen by at least 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fund company officials characterized customer response as
concern, not panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a significant increase in telephone volume,'' said
Patrice Kozlowski, a spokeswoman at the Dryfus Corp. in New York.
``In the afternoon, the only redemptions we saw were those in
high-yield bonds but most of our investors looked at this afternoon
as a buying opportunity back into equities.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's bruising market activity increased calling volume by
about 20 percent at Kansas City, Mo.-based American Century
Investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the major dip, people were actually purchasing but as
the day wore on there were a lot of transfers from stock funds into
money market accounts. There were a few people that cashed out but
a majority of them did not,'' said spokesman Chris Doyle.
</P>
<P>
   Topped by Monday's sell-off, August did acheive a dubious
distinction: It was the first month in eight years that investors
took more money out of stock funds than they put in, according to
Santa Rosa, Calif.-based Trimtabs.com, which tracks 3,400 mutual
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Trimtabs.com registered a preliminary net $1.9 billion outflow
from stock funds in August, compared with a $20.8 billion average
monthly inflow for the first seven months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Individual mutual funds are reporting similar results.
Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price said it recorded its first monthly
outflow from equity funds in five years, said spokesman Steven
Norwitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``On balance, we've had a modest net outflow from equity funds.
All in all, investors are fairly concerned but we haven't seen
anything that resembles panic or people fleeing from stock funds,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based Fidelity Investments anticipated Monday might be a
wild day so workers from other departments were drafted to work the
phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``As has been the case throughout the month of August, we saw
some investors moving more money from equities to more conservative
vehicles such as money market and bond funds. However, the vast
majority of our shareholders have chosen to stay still,'' said
spokeswoman Jessica Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was preoccupied with the Dow's plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Wanger, chief investment officer at the Chicago-based
Acorn Family of Funds, said that call volume at the company was
light.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nothing out of the ordinary. We had more calls relating
to two new mutual funds but nobody was worried about the market. I
think two people called that were worried about the market,'' he
said. &QL;

COMETS SEEK FAST START IN FINALE

<P>
   HOUSTON _ The defending champion Houston Comets and the brash
Phoenix Mercury play for the Women's National Basketball
Association championship Tuesday night at the Compaq Center. Bring
combat boots, not a laptop.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you thought Game 2 was a dogfight,'' Phoenix Coach Cheryl
Miller said, ``you haven't seen anything yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comets' come-from-behind victory here on Saturday tied the
two-of-three-game championship series at 1-1. Trailing by 12 points
with seven minutes left, Houston came back and won 74-69 in
overtime to force the third game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to jump out and get a good start, which we haven't
done in the first two games,'' said Houston's Cynthia Cooper, the
two-time WNBA most valuable player, who scored 19 of her game-high
27 points after halftime Saturday. In Game 1 last Thursday, a
Comets comeback fell short in a 54-51 loss in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to play our game on offense and defense,'' Cooper
said. ``I just kept thinking about what it would have been like if
we'd played defense the way we did the last seven minutes for the
whole game. Or both games. If we do, it's going to be a long game
for them and a short one for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix's star, forward Jennifer Gillom, likes her team's
chances. ``Us by 10, no less,'' she predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team will bill the game as a matchup of superstars, but
it's obvious that Gillom, who was held to 3-for-15 shooting in Game
2, has to be more involved in the offense for the Mercury to have a
chance. The Comets double- and triple-teamed her in a physical
battle under the basket on Saturday, but she's ready to fight back.
``It's going to be a war out there,'' Gillom said. ``Instead of me
taking it, I'm going to initiate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite winning 90 percent of their games in a 27-3 season and
sweeping Charlotte in the semifinals, the Comets entered the finals
with the pressure on them because the first game was at Phoenix.
Houston Coach Van Chancellor has tried to get his team to relax a
bit over the last two days so that the Comets will play their game,
not the one Phoenix has been forcing them into early on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's dead even,'' he said. ``I think it's going to
come down to the last 30 seconds. One team will make a play, and
the other won't.''

JETS' ELLIOTT IS CHARGED WITH DWI AND SPEEDING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jumbo Elliott, the New York Jets' left tackle and a key player
in the team's fortunes, was arrested at 5 a.m. Sunday not far from
his Long Island home, and charged with driving under the influence
of alcohol and speeding.
</P>
<P>
   He was released on his own recognizance and a court date was set
for next Tuesday. That is a day off for players who open the season
on Sunday in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets declined comment Monday and Elliott could not be
reached. The Jets players were given the day off.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Lt. Kevin Caslin, of the Nassau County police
information office, said the 32-year-old Elliott was stopped in his
Mercedes-Benz and cited for driving at 80 mph in a 55 mph zone,
failure to signal and making unsafe lane changes. He was not given
a breath test.
</P>
<P>
   Caslin said Elliott was stopped on the Long Island Expressway
one exit from his home in Manhasset, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott started in Friday night's preseason finale in Chicago,
and complained of a sore ankle afterward. The Jets' players were
off Saturday but had meetings Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The charges are misdemeanors. Because Elliott has no prior
arrest record, it is possible the charges will be reduced.

PLAN TO DEMOLISH CHURCH SPLITS PARISH 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN RATHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CENTER MORICHES, N.Y. _ When parishioners at St. John the
Evangelist Roman Catholic Church learned several months ago that
their bishop intended to demolish their 100-year-old church and
replace it with a larger one, they responded with both relief and
anguish.
</P>
<P>
   Some welcomed a new church because for years parishioners have
had to celebrate Sunday Mass under basketball hoops in the gym of
an elementary school because their church has room for only 225
worshipers.
</P>
<P>
   Many others did not want to lose the old church. But the order
from Bishop John McGann of the Diocese of Rockville Centre,
spiritual head of Long Island's more than 1 million Roman
Catholics, was blunt: there was no way to expand the building _ a
Gothic Revival wood-frame structure with a stucco exterior and a
distinctive copper-clad steeple _ so it would have to be razed.
</P>
<P>
   For the diocese, the matter is elementary. The church is its
people, not its buildings, and what the people urgently need is an
adequate place to worship. This means a new building with room for
750 people in a parish that claims 5,000 member families. Moreover,
a new church could be designed to conform to the liturgical reforms
of Vatican II, bringing congregants closer to the altar.
</P>
<P>
   But even though diocesan officials found the merits of the plan
self-evident and St. John's pastor, Msgr. James McDonald,
vigorously supported it, the bishop's decree did not go down
easily.
</P>
<P>
   When some parishioners joined with preservationists to form a
committee to save the old church, what had been an issue in the
parish spilled noisily into a secular arena.
</P>
<P>
   The diocese turned down pleas that the old church be kept as a
chapel next to a new church. The committee reacted by asking the
Town of Brookhaven, where Center Moriches is situated, to designate
the building a historic landmark.
</P>
<P>
   Diocese officials immediately protested that any action by the
town to hinder the bishop's plans would be an affront to religious
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Parishioners on the committee, McDonald said, ``went to a
secular authority to go against their bishop, and that is not
acceptable in the Catholic Church.''
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, members of the Committee to Save St. John's are suing
the Town Board for refusing landmark status.
</P>
<P>
   The church was designed by Randolph Daus and built in 1898
around an altar originally in St. Augustine's Roman Catholic Church
of Brooklyn. That altar was designed by Patrick Keely, a noted
19th-century architect.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed Aug. 20 in state Supreme Court in Riverhead,
charges that six Roman Catholic members of the seven-member Town
Board, including Supervisor Felix Grucci Jr. and a councilman,
Edward Hennessey, a parishioner at St. John's, voted to deny
landmark status not on the merits of the case but to avoid being
branded ``ecclesiastical criminals'' by the diocese.
</P>
<P>
   It seeks a court order bestowing the landmark status or
requiring the town to hold a new hearing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The dispute with the Town Board dates to an emotional hearing on
the landmark designation held July 16, at which parishioners with
signs saying ``Obey the Bishop'' confronted parishioners carrying
signs saying ``Save St. John's.''
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, the diocese chancellor, Msgr. Francis Schneider,
told the board that under church law it was ``the obligation of
every Catholic, pastors and faithful alike, to adhere to decisions
of the bishop'' regarding ``when and where a new church will be
constructed'' and ``whether an existing church facility is to be
demolished or preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Disobedience is an ecclesiastical crime,'' Schneider told the
board members, ``and may be grounds for just punishment to foster
obedience.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the diocese, William Esseks, said that the
chancellor's statement had not been directed at the board. ``He was
talking to the people who were petitioning the board and who were
members of the parish,'' Esseks said.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Patricia Strebel, the non-Catholic who cast the
lone vote for the landmark designation, and a board spokesman,
Kevin Molloy, also said religion had played no part in votes cast
by the other members. Hennessey said there had been no conflict
between his duties as a St. John's member and an elected official.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision dated four days after the hearing, the board
majority concluded that the church lacked the ``architectural and
artistic distinction'' of a landmark, partly because the structure
had received ``substantial alterations'' over the years, included
placing stucco over the church's original clapboard exterior.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why McGann will not allow the old church to remain as a
chapel, Joanne Novarro, a spokeswoman for the diocese, said: ``In
this diocese, the bishop has decided that we will have one place of
worship in each parish. And this is also about the cost of
maintaining more than one church.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Reid, a member of the Committee to Save St. John's,
said the committee had pledged $600,000 for maintenance of the old
church. A large portion of this would be donated by John Kanas, the
chairman and president of the North Fork Bank, who had attended the
church when he was growing up.
</P>
<P>
   Kanas confirmed that he had offered ``a substantial
contribution'' in a meeting with McGann and McDonald. ``They were
very courteous and they thanked me graciously,'' he said. ``But
they said there was no debate _ the church was going down.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parishioners, distressed by the July hearing and still in
favor of preserving the church, have left the parish. ``I can't be
a part of it,'' said one, Mary Maag, a legal secretary and lifelong
member of St. John's. ``It's just an awful situation. It's very
disheartening.''
</P>
<P>
   At a Town Planning Board hearing last Monday, only Reid and Mary
Field, a member of the committee but not the parish, opposed
approval of the site plan for the new church. They said they had
told others to stay away to avoid abuse from an audience that they
said was stacked in favor of the diocese position.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Armbruster, one of several parishioners who spoke in
favor of the diocese plan, told the board, ``The parish is the
people, not the building.''
</P>
<P>
   The board tentatively approved the site plan and granted a
parking variance. Part of the new parking lot will be where the old
church stood.  &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Start spreading the news: Pete Sampras is feeling
historic, Martina Hingis is feeling acquisitive and Goran
Ivanisevic is feeling like the turbo-charged hardcourts at the U.S.
Open are delivering his aces almost faster than he can send them
across the net.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to the U.S. Open, which cranked itself up to full speed
Monday at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, Queens,
to cut through the late summer haze and cut right to the chase. The
top-ranked Sampras, now just six victories from a record-tying 12th
Grand Slam title, and the top-ranked Hingis both zipped through
their opening-day assignments in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
   And Ivanisevic was feeling invincible, at least for a New York
moment, in the same city where he had been paralyzed by first-round
ineptitude in three of his last four visits.
</P>
<P>
   Those who could handle the pace advanced; those who let jitters,
or the invisible flu bug that has been circulating through the
men's and women's locker rooms, undermine their energy level fell
by the wayside early. Justin Gimelstob of New Jersey and Andrew
Ilie of Australia, who are both subject to temper tantrums, were
downed by tempestuous cramps and defaulted. So was German qualifier
Alex Radulescu, who pointed miserably to his stomach as he went to
the net to concede prematurely to 575th-ranked Taylor Dent, the
17-year-old wild card who is the youngest man in the event.
</P>
<P>
   After getting through his first match unscathed, Sampras, who
gained his 11th Grand Slam title by downing Ivanisevic in the
Wimbledon final in July, could afford to be sympathetic to those
who did not handle the Open's opening day pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understand that this Slam, compared to all the rest, I think,
is the most hectic,'' said Sampras, a four-time Open champion,
after his untaxing 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 victory over Marc-Kevin Goellner
kept him on the road to tying Roy Emerson's record of 12 Grand Slam
singles titles. ``You walk out at Wimbledon, you feel kind of the
charm of the place. Here at Flushing, you just kind of feel a
certain electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of hoopla when you play here in New York, and this
one certainly is difficult to win, but I've been playing here
enough to kind of figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, whose precocity is unquestioned, figured the place out
at the age of 17, when she won the third of her 1997 Grand Slam
crowns by outwitting Venus Williams in the final at the brand-new
Arthur Ashe Stadium. On Monday, Hingis, who is making a title
defense here a priority after stalling in the semifinals at the
French Open and Wimbledon, was back inside the stadium, and back to
her old supremely confident self after trampling Aleksandra Olsza
of Poland, 6-2, 6-0, in just under an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely not as confident as I was last year, but this
year wasn't as bad as sometimes I hear on TV, that Martina Hingis
was so beatable,'' protested Hingis, whose last title was at the
Italian Open in May. ``Well, not by everybody, I wouldn't lose
against a nobody. Once you keep losing, one day you get sick of it,
so I am kind of moving up again. So far I haven't lost against
anybody who wasn't top 10, so it's OK.''
</P>

<P>
   Hingis, who will face unseeded Iva Majoli, the 1997 French Open
champion, in the second round, denied that she had lost her
appetite for winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the Grand Slams, I won the first one, and this
one is still open,'' Hingis said. ``It's the last one of the year,
so you're going to put all your energy into this tournament. I'm
very positive, and I'm in a good mood now.'' She described herself
as the ``black horse'' last year, who sneaked up on the rest of the
field and ``won almost everything I played.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic, who won almost nothing he played this year until he
rediscovered his serving prowess at Wimbledon, left that tournament
a broken man after failing, for the second time in his career, to
get the better of Sampras in a Wimbledon final. He said he felt
like killing himself, but instead he took a boating vacation,
showed up in the United States on schedule for his summer campaign
and reached the final at New Haven, Conn., before his serving arm
went haywire again. But the arm and the man were back in form
Monday. With 23 aces, the Croatian Ivanisevic found safe mooring in
the second round after an acrimonious 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 defeat of
32-year-old Mark Woodforde of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Miffed that Woodforde, who had previously characterized the
14th-seeded Ivanisevic as a one trick pony with a big serve and
little else, failed to apologize after smacking him with a ball,
Ivanisevic later praised his own serve and denigrated his
opponent's entire game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my serve is there, then anything else I want to hit is
going in,'' he said. ``The way his game is, man, I think it's time
for him to retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to emulate the example her older sister Venus set here
last year, 20th-ranked Serena Williams made a successful Open debut
despite being hobbled by a sore right hamstring midway through her
6-3, 3-6, 6-4 defeat of 94th-ranked Nicole Pratt of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old Williams squandered a pair of match points with
a wildly careering volley and a net-bound backhand before breaking
Pratt for her first Open victory. She later called it ``a case of
classic nerves.'' Made aware that her father and coach, Richard,
who was attending his first Grand Slam event with his daughters,
had attracted attention by exiting the Louis Armstrong Stadium in
the second set, Serena Williams played down the effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, my dad always said negative attention is better than no
attention, so long as the truth lives inside of us,'' she said.
``If I was in the crowd and saw someone playing the way I was
playing, I would have left, too; I don't think I played that
well.''
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS:
</P>
<P>
   The day session proved disastrous for just one seeded player,
15th-seeded Alberto Berasategui of Spain, who ran out of resilience
after the first set's tie breaker against Thomas Muster of Austria
and wound up wilting, 7-6 (7-1), 6-2, 6-3. ``I cannot really say
I'm afraid going out against anyone,'' said the 30-year-old,
30th-ranked Muster, who terrorized all comers back in 1995 when he
won the French Open but has never passed the U.S. Open's
quarterfinal round. ... Monica Seles, wearing a black dress in
memory of her father, Karolj, who died in May, defeated Argentina's
Florencia Labat, 7-6 (6-0), 6-2, Monday night. ... Mirjana Lucic,
the 16-year-old Croat, eliminated Kristie Boogert of the
Netherlands, 6-3, 6-2. ... Justin Gimelstob, who said he had been
diagnosed with anemia, was leading his match with Wayne Black 6-3,
5-7, 3-2 when he was overcome by cramps and had to default. ``I
just started locking up everywhere,'' he said.

AUCTION OF KOREAN AUTOMAKERS CANCELED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Story changed throughout, following cancellation of
auction.)  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (lb) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The auction of two South Korean automakers was
canceled Monday night because none of the four initial bids met the
sellers' minimum price.
</P>
<P>
   Despite robust auto sales in North America and Europe, most of
the world's 33 mass-production automakers are losing money. There
are enough surplus auto factories around the globe to supply the
entire U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   But automakers remain important sources of employment and
symbols of national strength in many countries, making governments
reluctant to allow their closure or sale to foreign investors. Such
worries appeared to have played a role this week in the failed
auction of Kia Motors Corp. and its truck-making affiliate, Asia
Motors Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   But as the setbacks in the auction of Kia Motors Corp. and its
affiliate, Asia Motors Co. Ltd., show, merging the remaining
automakers remains a difficult task. Asian automakers currently
have the greatest excess capacity, but their enormous debts have
made American and European automakers reluctant to acquire them,
combine operations and close unneeded factories.
</P>
<P>
   Kia and Asia Motors were put up for sale together this summer by
their creditor banks after becoming unable to make payments on
their many debts, which total an estimated $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But with some of the largest banks now financially troubled and
effectively controlled by the South Korean government, the terms of
the auction went far beyond a conventional sale to the highest
bidder.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the terms required each bidder to submit a business
plan to maintain exports and invest more cash. The auction's terms
also required that bids include a stiff price for the automakers'
shares and an agreement to repay all of the automakers' debt.
</P>
<P>
   None of the bids from Ford Motor Co., Daewoo, Hyundai and
Samsung met all of these conditions, Korean officials announced on
Tuesday morning in Seoul, when it was still Monday night here in
Detroit. Lee Jong-dae, Kia's president, said another auction would
be held soon, but he did not set a date.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent failure of the auction lessens the likelihood that
Kia or Asia Motors will close any factories soon, so the global car
market is likely to remain glutted, depressing prices and profits.
The difficulties with the auction also represent a setback for
South Korea's efforts to streamline its industrial sector, which
suffers from heavy debts and excessive staffs in many industries.
</P>
<P>
   Auto-industry deals actually taking place now are unlikely to
reduce global overcapacity. Chrysler Corp. is preparing to merge
later this year with Daimler-Benz AG, for example, but the two
automakers have almost completely different lineups of vehicles and
no plans to close factories.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Eaton, Chrysler's chairman and chief executive, said in
an interview Monday that the recent plunge in stock markets around
the globe is very unlikely to affect the planned merger, in which
shareholders of both companies will turn in their stock for shares
in the combined company, DaimlerChrysler AG.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler shares had tumbled 13.5 percent last Thursday but
partly rebounded on Friday. The stock fell Thursday on speculation
that the Daimler merger might not take place, because Russia's
economic and political troubles had caused the German stock market
to plummet, dragging down the value of Daimler shares.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. market has also been battered since then. Eaton
said Monday morning that there had been no discussion of
renegotiating the merger terms. The merger would be in trouble only
if the performance of the German and American stock markets
diverged dramatically and the share prices of Daimler and Chrysler
also diverged, he said, adding that he believed this was very
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the markets move relatively the same, I don't see
any impact,'' Eaton said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another recently announced auto-industry transaction also
appears unlikely to relieve the industry's excess capacity. Toyota
Motor Corp. announced on Friday that it would spend $259 million to
raise its stake in Daihatsu Motor Co. Ltd. to 51.2 percent. But
Toyota's previous stake of 34.5 percent had already given it
control of Daihatsu, which is strongest in the manufacture of very
small cars, one of Toyota's few weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Kia sale has attracted international attention because
American, European and Japanese automakers have worried that if a
buyer accepts the company with all of its debts, the purchaser
could be forced to dump large numbers of low-priced Kia cars on
international markets in an attempt, which might be futile, to keep
up with interest payments.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler did not bid on Kia, partly because it is still busy
with the Daimler merger and partly because Chrysler executives were
dubious about the profitability of East Asian markets even before
the region's financial crisis began. ``The only way Kia would be
attractive to anybody would be if you restructured or reduced the
debt,'' Eaton said Monday.

HACKETT'S INFLUENCE SHOWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Thirty minutes into Paul Hackett's first game
Sunday, it was hard to tell that John Robinson still wasn't at the
helm of the USC football program.
</P>
<P>
   More disturbing than USC's 17-10 deficit was how it got to that
point. Mental miscues and a host of penalties _ like having 12 men
on the field _ were prevalent. The much-heralded defense allowed
Purdue to have the ball for all but two minutes of the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Mediocrity, it seemed, had carried over for another season.
</P>
<P>
   But Hackett demonstrated he's no Robinson in the second half.
And because of that, USC is 1-0 after a 27-17 victory.
</P>
<P>
   It's not very difficult to see the changes Hackett has already
brought to the program:
</P>
<P>
   __He made a bold decision by playing quarterback Carson Palmer
in the third quarter. And despite the coach's cautious postgame
comments, the freshman provided the difference.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow! &UR; !off! &LR; Hackett's commitment to conditioning paid off in
the stifling heat. USC was simply a stronger team than Purdue in
the second half. The players credited Hackett's new strength coach,
Matt ``Chickenhawk'' Schiotz, and it was hard to argue with the
results.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Trojans are not a significantly better team, they
will be better conditioned. That alone should quell some boosters,
who were tired of watching USC get beaten down in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   __The emphasis on special teams, led by new coach Shawn Slocum,
has already paid dividends. This year, USC begins practice by
working on special teams. Last year, it wasn't addressed until the
conclusion of practice.
</P>
<P>
   When Antuan Simmons broke through and blocked a Purdue field
goal, it might have been the first time Purdue's offense felt
frustrated Sunday. Chad Morton's 98-yard kickoff return and Adam
Abrams' two field goals, including a 45-yarder that was only a yard
short of his career best, were other highlights. Almost forgotten
was freshman punter Mike MacGillivray, who averaged 44.2 yards per
kick.
</P>
<P>
   __The Trojans were able to make adjustments at halftime. The
defense finally found its bearings after trying to get used to
Purdue's wide-open offense and regrouped nicely in the second half.
The failure to adjust was another major complaint about previous
regimes.
</P>
<P>
   How has this coaching staff been able to make changes?
</P>
<P>
   Instead of focusing on technical adjustments, it stressed
playing aggressively and cutting down on the miscues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't make the same mental mistakes in the second
half,'' defensive coordinator Bill Young said. ``It shows a little
maturity by the defensive players.''
</P>
<P>
   As first games go, survival might be the prime consideration.
Now that Hackett has done that, the bar will be raised, even if the
Trojans face San Diego State and Oregon State in their next two
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans still have some major problems _ the offensive line
to name one _ and will have difficulty with the elite teams on the
schedule. One game into the season, though, it's clear that
Hackett's decision-making skills paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer makes anyone look like a better coach. But does anyone
who watched John Fox play nearly the entire season before being
replaced last year believe a true freshman would have made his
debut this early under the previous staff?
</P>
<P>
   If there was a downside Sunday, it might have been Hackett
wasn't as bold at the tailback position. It's too bad freshman
Frank Strong didn't get a chance to play tailback, especially when
no one else was fooling Purdue's defense.
</P>
<P>
   The offense could still use a spark to compensate for its
overall lack of explosiveness, but wide receiver R. Jay Soward
returns for the next game.
</P>
<P>
   The big question during the next two weeks will be who throws
passes to Soward when USC takes the field again on Sept. 12.

EDITORIAL: INVESTORS TAKE FLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 1:
</P>
<P>
   For most of the past decade, the individual U.S. investor has
been a bulwark against panic in world financial markets. When money
managers got scared and started selling, it was individuals who
bought, believing that all declines, like the 1987 crash, were
buying opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Now that appears to be changing. The flood of selling that hit
Wall Street in the final hour of trading Monday bore the imprint of
Main Street concern. Some reports indicated that a good part of the
selling came from mutual funds, which presumably were reacting to
redemptions by fund investors. During that hour the Dow Jones
industrial average fell 320 points to end the day with a loss of
512 points, or 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This plunge, which has affected markets around the world, comes
at a time when the global economy looks shakier than it has in
years. With Asia in recession and worried investors reluctant to
supply financing to developing economies, worldwide economic growth
is weak and getting weaker. Scenarios from the 1930s, in which
country after country devalues its currency, seeking trade
advantages but instead impoverishing the world, seemed outlandish
only a few months ago. Now they seem less implausible. Russia's
share of the world economy is tiny, but its decision to effectively
renounce its debts to investors crystallized investor fears.
</P>
<P>
   In isolation, the declines in the major U.S. stock averages
would not be cause for concern for policy makers. The Dow and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks are down less than 20 percent
from their mid-July peaks, and are well above where they were a
year ago. But they are merely the last to fall. Smaller U.S. stocks
have done much worse, as have most world markets.
</P>
<P>
   Rallies are always possible, but this is a slide that the
markets are unlikely to end on their own. Faith in the ability of
governments and central banks to keep the world economy on an even
keel is vanishing. What is needed from the major economies now are
policies that will sustain consumer demand while fixing financial
systems that have been badly damaged by excessive credit given out
during booms. So far, the signs that governments are up to the task
are limited at best. Russia is broke and has a paralyzed political
system. Japan is rich, but its political system also seems to be
unable to act effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rubin, the treasury secretary and a man who prospered as
a trader in financial markets, said Monday that the G-7 countries
were conferring on the problems. They will need to mount concerted
action to prevent economic contraction.

UCLA FRESHMAN NOSEGUARD MIGHT MISS OPENER
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Second-string nose guard Ken Kocher, one of the Bruins' most
promising freshmen, is doubtful for UCLA's Sept. 12 season opener
against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Kocher suffered a sprained/bruised right ankle Wednesday. He was
on crutches for several days and is now using a walking cast.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's injury report lists him as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be nice if he's ready,'' defensive coordinator Nick
Aliotti said. ``But he hasn't practiced in quite a while, so I
don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Kocher's ankle heals, he probably won't be mentally
prepared after missing vital learning time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were force-feeding him (the defense),'' Aliotti said. ``But
with the injury, he's way behind.''

FERRARO RUNS FIRST TV ADS IN SENATE RACE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After 10 months of running a curiously quiescent
campaign for U.S. Senate, Geraldine Ferraro turned up the volume
Monday with her first two television advertisements, while her
opponents for the Democratic nomination, Mark Green and Rep.
Charles Schumer, spent the day touting their records on social
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Because the traditional start of all-out campaigning, Labor Day,
falls so late this year _ on Sept. 7 _ and the primary is just
eight days later, the candidates used the final day of August to
shake off the sluggishness of summer when the attention of most
voters is focused more on vacation than politics.
</P>
<P>
   Green, New York City's Public Advocate, appeared Monday
afternoon outside the midtown Manhattan offices of HIP, one of the
nation's largest managed care providers, to discuss his efforts to
regulate health maintenance organizations, and presented a 20-point
plan to do so.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour earlier, Schumer, the nine-term congressman from
Brooklyn, stood outside a midtown Manhattan police station and
stressed his support for increased federal money for shelters for
battered women. Flanked by women who run shelters, he said the
demand for space far exceeded the number of beds.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant development of the day was the introduction
of Ms. Ferraro's first television advertisements, two 30-second
spots that promote her experience as a mother, teacher, prosecutor
and congresswoman as qualifications that make her the best-suited
for the Senate. Aides said about $1 million was spent on the spots,
which are to run until primary day, Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, who has been advertising heavily on television for
months, countered with what may be his most attention-grabbing
advertisement so far, a new 30-second clip in which he attacks the
``Senator Pothole'' reputation of the three-term Republican
incumbent, Alfonse D'Amato. The last scene takes a political poke
at D'Amato, showing an actor resembling the senator directing a
roadwork crew like an orchestra conductor.
</P>
<P>
   After criticizing D'Amato's voting record on crime, education
and health care, Schumer says sternly: ``He calls himself the
pothole Senator, but D'Amato's votes in Washington create thousands
of potholes here in New York. Then he fills a few near election
time, and he wants our vote?''
</P>
<P>
   All three of the Democratic candidates released information
Monday on their campaign finances.
</P>
<P>
   The Green campaign said it had $1.1 million on hand, after
raising $240,000 in July and August and spending about the same
amount in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The Schumer campaign said it had $4.9 million in the bank, after
spending nearly $3 million and raising $630,000 in July and August.
</P>
<P>
   And the Ferraro campaign reported that she has $1.35 million on
hand, after raising $680,000 in July and August, including a
$300,000 personal loan she made to her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of three new advertisements seemed to confirm
expectations that the final days of the Democratic primary could
become a media war. Green is expected to begin his television
campaign this week.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Shrum, the campaign consultant who developed Ms.
Ferraro's spots, said they would play a major role. ``New Yorkers
think they should have big and significant senators who can
accomplish big and significant things,'' he said. ``And I think
that's what people think about when they think about Gerry.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition to noting Ms. Ferraro's experience, both of the
advertisements touch on many of the issues that polls have shown
are most on voters' minds now _ including hiring new teachers and
improving education, safeguarding the Social Security system and
protecting patients from the abuses of health maintenance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In a quick trip to Buffalo Monday afternoon, Ms. Ferraro touched
again on some of those issues during brief remarks at a shopping
center. In particular, she attacked D'Amato for accepting
contributions from the health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But she also tailored her message to some local concerns,
speaking out in favor of federal urban empowerment zones.
``Empowerment zones and enterprise communities are an effective way
to help New York's communities create jobs and prepare their work
force to take those jobs,'' she said.

 McCAUGHEY ROSS AND HUSBAND MEET ON CAMPAIGN'S FUTURE 
 (nk) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wilbur Ross Jr., the investment banker who has been
financing the gubernatorial campaign of his wife, Lt. Gov. Betsy
McCaughey Ross, held a formal meeting with her on Monday night to
discuss the future of the campaign amid indications that he has
grown reluctant to give the campaign carte blanche, people close to
the campaign said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Davitt, a spokesman for Ms. McCaughey Ross, said the
couple was having a routine dinner to talk about the campaign. But
people close to the campaign, who insisted on anonymity, described
it as more of a negotiating session between benefactor and
candidate than a conversation between husband and wife.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Ms. McCaughey Ross, one of four Democrats
seeking the gubernatorial nomination, led her primary opponents in
the polls, and political strategists predicted a summertime
advertising blitz that would give her an even greater advantage.
She and some of her aides even talked of Ross spending $10 million
or more on the primary and the general election.
</P>
<P>
   The lieutenant governor has a larger war chest than any of her
rivals: $2.6 million by Aug. 15. But most of the money has come
from Ross. And even as Ms. McCaughey Ross has fallen behind her
chief rival, Peter Vallone, in recent polls, she has spent hardly
any money, raising questions about whether Ross was really willing
to spend his money on the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that Ms. McCaughey Ross is by far the best-known
Democrat in the race. But her three opponents all enjoy a generally
favorable reputation among the Democratic voters who know them,
while many more voters rate Ms. McCaughey Ross negatively than
positively. Supporters have been pressuring Ms. McCaughey Ross to
begin television advertising as the Sept. 15 primary nears, and
have become increasingly frustrated at her delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that if she can get it together on television, that
she can very well be a success,'' said Stephen Sabbeth, the Nassau
County Democratic chairman, one of her strongest supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Sabbeth said he thought Ross was not spending money because he
believed his wife could win the primary without it. But she will
probably persuade him to spend it anyway, Sabbeth said. ``Wilbur
Ross is a man of his word,'' he said. ``I don't think Wilbur wants
to pay for a landslide. But I think he'll spend what they need to
win.''

 NO MOONSHOTS IN MIAMI FOR McGWIRE  
(nk) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The sense of anticipation was certainly there. Every
time Mark McGwire batted Monday night, an unusually boisterous
Florida Marlins crowd booed and hooted when Marlins pitchers threw
him a pitch outside the strike zone. And they groaned when McGwire
made an out.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of groans by the end of the game, as McGwire
went 0-for-3 in the St. Louis Cardinals' 5-3 victory over the
Marlins at Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   After a pop-up, two strikeouts and two walks, McGwire still had
55 home runs _ six short of Roger Maris' record, with 25 games left
to play. And he had been tied by the Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa, who
hit a home run in the fourth inning Monday night against
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins drew their fourth-largest crowd of the season _
36,584, about two-thirds of whom left after McGwire walked in the
top of the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire came in knowing that he would represent the biggest
attraction of the Marlins' dismal season. ``I figured that out when
they said they were taking the tarps off up in the upper deck,'' he
said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 people were on hand just to watch him take
batting practice. He homered on nine of 20 pitches, with several of
them estimated to have traveled more than 500 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``His biggest asset is that he has super powers of
concentration,'' Cardinals Manager Tony La Russa said of McGwire's
ability to deal with distractions surrounding the home run chase.
``He is concentrating on the things that mean the most to him.''
</P>
<P>
   When he is on the road, McGwire said, he sometimes uses several
friends in Los Angeles as sounding boards. Otherwise, he seems
content to listen to music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people may think I'm a loner,'' he said. ``I'm not really
alone. I'm very content with my life.''
</P>
<P>
   His son Matthew, 10, is at many of his father's games _ he
sometimes flies in from San Diego to serve as a bat boy in Busch
Stadium _ and McGwire smiled as he anticipated his son's ``having
to miss some school'' as he gets closer to Maris' record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you can spend a lot of time with your son at the ball
park, it's very, very special,'' he said.

   Two million dollars for a book by Monica Lewinsky? ``Not
exactly,'' book editor Judith Regan said Monday. ``And that's all
I'm going to say.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she went on to say a lot more, calling herself ``a
great defender of Monica Lewinsky'' and calling Bill Clinton ``that
president.''
</P>
<P>
   The fuss began when The New Yorker magazine reported that Ms.
Regan, who has edited best sellers by Howard Stern, Kathie Lee
Gifford and Drew Barrymore, had offered $2 million. But the
magazine also said she had been topped by a $6 million deal from
another publisher, which it did not identify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how this gets started,'' Ms. Regan said. ``It's
like a game of telephone. The story gets bigger and bigger, as do
the numbers being bandied about.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear her tell it, the big-money days for book deals ended
long before the stock market's 512-point plunge on Monday. They
ended when so many books about the O.J. Simpson case fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine that any publisher is going to offer her $10
million for the book rights,'' she said of Ms. Lewinsky. ``They'd
have to sell millions of copies in hardcover, which doesn't happen
anymore for anybody, not Tom Clancy, not Anne Rice.''
</P>
<P>
   What goes through an author's mind when someone hands the
president his book? ``Just when you think you've used your
imagination, reality has a way of catching up to you,'' said
Richard North Patterson, whose political thriller ``No Safe Place''
was given to President Clinton last week on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Accidental Tourist
</P>
<P>
   This sounds like a wild and crazy, but stylish, movie. Diane Von
Furstenberg missed the plane to the boat because she was in a car
accident.
</P>
<P>
   She was driving to a New York-area airport on Friday _ her
spokeswoman, Ruth Patkin, would not say which airport or where the
accident took place _ when it happened. Miss von Furstenberg had
been scheduled to fly to Alaska to join several hundred other
passengers on a cruise ship chartered by Paul Allen, a co-founder
of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she suffered broken ribs, cuts and bruises, and was
taken to a hospital, Ms. Patkin said. ``Diane was concerned that if
she was at all out of commission, people would think she's sick,''
Ms. Patkin said, ``and she's not.''
</P>
<P>
   As for what Miss von Furstenberg missed on the cruise, she could
have chatted with Candice Bergen, James Cameron or Dan Aykroyd,
among others. Or she could have braved 70 mph winds on deck.
</P>
<P>
   Delicious Romance
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first anniversary of the death of Diana, Princess
of Wales, and Dodi Fayed on Monday was just another day at the
Diana-Dodi delicatessen, on Second Avenue near East 13th Street.
The proprietor, Rahman Abdelnaser, was behind the counter of the
3-month-old deli, making coffee and sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had chosen the name because ``their story, it touched
me.'' But he did not go so far as to name anything on the sandwich
menu above the counter after them. A ``Princess Pastrami'' or a
``Dodi Deviled Ham'' would be, well, unseemly. ``I don't want to
use their name for that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the deli's name has not won unanimous approval from
customers. ``Some complain I'm cashing in'' on Diana's death, he
said. ``To cash in, you need T-shirts and things like that. This is
just a little store. Is anyone going to come here just because of
the name?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, maybe not. This much is certain, though: Diana-Dodi is on
an international block. Next door is a restaurant called Little
Poland.

PANEL SEES MANY WAYS TO REDUCE PROPERTY TAXES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JENNIFER PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ The state Property Tax Commission, created by
Gov. Christie Whitman after her narrow re-election victory last
fall, has agreed on dozens of recommendations intended to lower
real-estate taxes in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   At the governor's request, the commission did not consider
statewide tax increases to offset property-tax bills, but panel
members said one proposal would give the state's largest cities and
towns new taxing authority.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of relying on property levies alone, municipalities
might be able to raise revenue by taxing parking, payrolls, hotels
or even entertainment and sporting events. The recommendation would
require approval by the state Legislature, where word of the
proposal has already met with some skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   The panel is also expected to recommend placing a cap on the
salaries of school, municipal and county employees, a proposal
guaranteed to draw strong union opposition. Other suggestions
include state incentives for local governments to share services
and having the state pick up the $200 million cost of New Jersey's
21 county prosecutor offices.
</P>
<P>
   During her hard-fought campaign last year, Whitman vowed to
tackle the issue after polls showed that voters did not think she
had answered their concerns about paying the highest property taxes
in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-member panel, made up of local and state government
officials, as well as business and academic leaders, is expected to
outline its recommendations to Whitman early in September. Many of
the suggestions would require legislative action, panel members
said.
</P>
<P>
   While some panel members said there was no single suggestion
that would immediately deliver significant property-tax relief,
they also said that the recommendations, taken together, could
reduce property-tax bills over time.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is expected to point out that New Jersey's
longstanding tradition of home rule, including the reluctance of
communities and school districts to share costs and control, is one
of the biggest reasons property-tax bills are so high. The report
notes the hundreds of layers of local government: 566 municipal
governments, 21 county governments, 188 fire districts and 611
school districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no easy answers,'' said Barbara Cannon, the mayor of
Old Bridge Township and chairwoman of the commission. ``Nothing is
simple. There are going to have to be some choices made here.''
</P>
<P>
   One possible solution was off limits, at Whitman's request: a
statewide tax increase. ``We did not want to increase the state's
overall tax burden,'' Ms. Cannon said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jerseyans pay the highest per-capita property taxes in the
nation. The average property-tax bill for homeowners is $4,000 a
year, with public schools taking the largest chunk of that money.
The state covers about 40 percent of the cost of local schools; the
national average of state assistance to public schools is 50
percent of the total cost.
</P>
<P>
   Although some experts say that significantly increasing state
aid, particularly to schools, would be the most direct way to
reduce local property taxes, New Jersey voters have already voiced
their disapproval of that approach.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Jim Florio was widely criticized for pushing through
a state income-tax increase in 1990 to bolster state assistance for
local schools and provide property-tax relief. He lost his
re-election campaign four years later to Whitman, who promised to
roll back the income-tax rate increases. She kept her promise in
her first term, but critics contend that she helped pay for part of
the tax cut by not increasing state aid to municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to offering specific suggestions, the commission's
recommendations are intended to raise awareness among taxpayers of
the cost of various programs and policy decisions, particularly
those concerning land use.
</P>
<P>
   The panel is expected to issue a warning to municipalities about
the high cost of some new development projects. For years, cities
and towns embraced development to expand their property-tax bases,
but the panel notes that unchecked development can often end up
adding to the tax burden.
</P>
<P>
   The panel is also expected to urge municipalities to follow the
state's master development plan when making land-use decisions. The
plan is an attempt to guide growth away from environmentally
sensitive and rural areas to parts of the state with existing roads
and sewers that can support new development.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Since many of the commission's recommendations would require
action by the state Legislature, some lobbying groups, including
the state's largest teachers union, are already preparing for
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Joseph, a spokeswoman for that union, New Jersey Education
Association, said the association did not think that the best
approach to lowering property taxes was capping public employees'
salaries, as the panel suggests. ``We would be opposed to such a
move,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It remains uncertain which recommendations are likely to win the
backing of state lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a silver-bullet solution to this,'' said
Assemblyman Richard Bagger, R-Westfield, chairman of the Assembly
Appropriations and Budget Committee. ``It is a combination of a lot
of different ideas. But I am a dedicated incrementalist. And I am
very confident that there will be a series of proposals that the
Legislature can act upon and that will have some positive benefits
for property taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Joseph Roberts Jr., a Democrat who has been long
involved in state fiscal matters, said he agreed with some of the
recommendations that have been made public, particularly those
urging local governments and school districts to consolidate some
services. ``I have tried to keep an open mind until I see a final
document,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Roberts, whose legislative district includes the troubled
city of Camden, said he was concerned about the recommendation that
would allow cities and large municipalities to impose new taxes.
</P>
<P>
   A few cities _ Newark, Elizabeth, and Jersey City _ already have
authorization from the state Legislature to impose some levies
beyond property taxes, including payroll and parking taxes. The
recommendation would allow those cities to expand their taxing
authority and enable other large municipalities to impose new
taxes. In some cases municipalities may look to shift the burden
from residents to people who work or visit but who do not live
there.
</P>
<P>
   Newark's mayor, Sharpe James, said that he welcomed the
recommendation because it would give cities more flexibility and
help relieve the tax burden on residential-property owners.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, James said that Newark and other cities had to
be careful about not imposing any taxes that would hurt the city's
economic development efforts.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Joseph Kyrillos, R-Middletown Township, a member of
the Senate budget committee, said that the property-tax problem was
similar in some ways to the automobile-insurance problem. The
Legislature finally approved a package of bills earlier this year
that was intended to lower auto-insurance rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``With auto insurance, you had to change the product to change
the cost,'' Kyrillos said. ``With property taxes, we may not be
able to afford all the government that we now have. We are going to
have to make some real choices, and hopefully, people will allow us
and encourage us to make those types of choices.''

ASIAN MARKETS REACT TO WALL STREET JITTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Stock prices cascaded around the region on Tuesday in
response to the deep plunge on Wall Street, spreading anxiety over
a possible global slowdown that could fan greater financial
instability in Asia and quash any hopes for an economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Asia has always been sensitive to jitters on Wall Street, but it
has been particularly vulnerable recently as local economies are
registering their largest economic contractions in years, even
decades for some countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Nikkei index of 225 shares dove at the opening to a new
12-year low of 13,664.74, down 442.15, or 3.1 percent from Monday's
close. Stock prices also tumbled 3.5 percent to 826.61 in
Singapore, partly on news that the Malaysian government suspended
trading in shares on Monday. The Malaysian government also said it
would not recognize share trading of Malaysian shares in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 20 minutes of trading in Hong Kong, stocks fell
nearly 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a free fall, isn't it?'' said Patrick Mohr, a strategist
at Merrill Lynch Japan Ltd. in Tokyo. Referring to the Tokyo stock
market, he added: ``This looks like a reaction to Wall Street in
the short term. In the long term, there's just a lot of uncertainty
about the fate of the financial system.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, a senior economic official warned that Japan would
have economic difficulty over the next few months, suggesting that
even with a multibillion economic stimulus package in the works
that growth might still be elusive to the world's second-largest
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The one bright spot for the region was the yen, which
strengthened against the dollar to about 139 yen to the dollar.
Investors sold dollars after the fall on Wall Street, and Japanese
officials immediately seized upon this, saying that the yen might
be on a strengthening trend.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There is a chance of a very rapid dollar weakening and yen
strengthening,'' said Haruhiko Kuroda, a senior official at the
Japanese Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the stronger yen, stocks in South Korea also held
steady. A stronger yen means that Japanese exports become more
expensive, leaving room for Korean exports to outbid their Japanese
competitors. A stronger yen also helps stabilize export markets in
the region, reducing the chances that Asian exporters engage in a
competitive bidding war.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the market in Tokyo appeared to be collapsing, some
investors said that the low levels could force the government to
bring about change. Japan is pivotal in the Asian region, and if
leaders here can bring about an economic recovery, there may be
dividends throughout Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This market pressure is the only catalyst to shock the
Japanese bureaucrats into making the difficult decisions necessary
to restore confidence,'' said Mohr at Merrill Lynch.

SALES TAX TAKES A HOLIDAY FOR SOME BACK-TO-SCHOOL SHOPPERS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a back-to-school gift to shoppers and retailers,
the fourth tax-free shopping week in the last two years begins
Tuesday in New York state, with state sales taxes eliminated on all
clothing and shoes costing less than $500.
</P>
<P>
   New York City has suspended its own tax as well, meaning that
through next Monday, shoppers will not have to pay the normal 8.25
percent in sales tax on most types of apparel. The reprieve is
intended in part to keep shoppers from taking their business
elsewhere, as lower-tax states like New Jersey have often drawn
people at peak shopping times such as the holidays and before the
opening of school.
</P>
<P>
   Some retailers are worried, however, that the recent turmoil on
Wall Street and other factors may undermine the impact of this
week's tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``During past tax-free shopping weeks, United Colors of Benetton
stores citywide saw a dramatic surge in sales,'' said Carlo
Tunioli, general manager of Benetton USA. ``However, this tax-free
shopping week may be impacted by the recent instability in the
financial markets and the unrelenting hot weather, making customers
reluctant to shop and thereby affecting a normally profitable sales
period.''
</P>
<P>
   The 8.25 percent sales tax in New York City is made up of three
components: a 4 percent state sales tax, a 4 percent city sales
tax, and a 0.25 percent tax levied by the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority. During the last legislative session,
lawmakers approved the gradual elimination of the state's sales tax
on certain clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Under the measure, the state share of the sales tax on clothing
will be eliminated on clothing and footwear for items under $500
from Jan. 17 to 24, 1999, and will be permanently eliminated for
clothing and footwear sold for less than $110 beginning Dec. 1,
1999.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   Ethel Sloan, marketing director of the Manhattan Mall, at
Broadway and 33rd Street, said that past tax-free weeks have drawn
a sharp increase in shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are anticipating an extremely strong response,'' Ms. Sloan
said. ``The past times we have had the tax-free week, our retailers
have reported substantial increased traffic and sales, particularly
stores like Modell's, Children's Place and Express.''
</P>
<P>
   The accounting and consulting firm KPMG Peat Marwick, which has
studied past tax-free weeks, has forecast that retail sales volume
in New York City would rise 125 percent during the week, in part
because of normal back-to-school shopping. The figure was higher
than the increase in sales in 1997, partly because of an improved
economy and the inclusion of footware as a tax-free purchase, the
firm said.
</P>
<P>
   The firm also noted in its report on January's tax-free week
that the tax reprieve prompted additional spending on taxable items
while consumers were purchasing clothing and shoes. This week, the
articles that are still taxable include watches, umbrellas,
Rollerblades, sunglasses, handbags and helmets, among other items.
</P>
<P>
   Not all cities in New York are following the state's lead in
suspending taxes for the week. The local 2 percent sales tax in
White Plains, for example, remains in effect, though shoppers will
still get a break on the state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Ettenberg, chief executive officer of Bozell Retail
Advertising, said the tax elimination was a great boon to parents
shopping for school supplies for their children. ``If you do the
math, at back-to-school time alone, the city loses $40 per child _
that's the cost of another outfit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mistake to have this tax at all,'' he said. ``The city
should get its tax money from hotel taxes, from the visitors who
are clogging the city, instead of hurting the people who live
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The tax-free week started symbolically on Sunday when Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani knocked down a stack of milk bottles with ``tax''
printed on them and then went shopping at Modell's in midtown
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already seen a sharp increase in the sales of both
footware and apparel during tax-free shopping week, especially with
the New York Yankees merchandise line,'' said Michael Modell,
president of Modell's Sporting Goods.

SEVENTH TV NETWORK DEBUTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY ALEX ROTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just moments before air time on the set of ``Great
Day America'' and the premiere of the newest TV network in America,
a crew member barked into her headset, ``Susan has the puppy! I
repeat, Susan has the puppy!''
</P>
<P>
   The puppy was a golden Labrador retriever guide dog. And
co-anchor Susan Crenshaw, who was doing a segment on foster homes
for guide dogs, had the envious job of cuddling the animal in her
lap.
</P>
<P>
   The puppy was a perfect guest for the debut of ``Great Day
America,'' a late-afternoon talk show that aims to be cute and
entertaining but also informative.
</P>
<P>
   Other than a brief Teleprompter malfunction and a slightly
off-color anecdote by actor Rod Steiger, Monday's show went off
without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a camera briefly during rehearsal, but hey, it's the
first show,'' said co-anchor Michael Young, the former host of the
1970s show ``Kids Are People Too.''
</P>
<P>
   The live debut Monday at Universal Studios in Los Angeles of
``Great Day America'' also marks the launch of the nation's seventh
TV network, Pax TV.
</P>
<P>
   With programming ranging from a talk show on women's issues to
reruns of ``Touched by an Angel,'' the network is promoting itself
as a family-oriented alternative to its larger, more mainstream
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The network is going to fill a niche that's been kind of
vacated by family programming,'' Pax TV spokesman John Michaeli
said. ``There's not a lot of programming the entire family can
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   To succeed, the network faces the challenge of altering the
public's notoriously deep-rooted television-viewing habits. And
with literally hundreds of cable channels to compete against, the
network could easily fall through the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great Day America'' will mix celebrity interviews with feature
segments on such topics as home decoration and health. Its target
audience is primarily women, whose other late-afternoon choices are
cartoons, game shows and the blood-and-guts of television news.
</P>
<P>
   The show is filmed in Universal Studio's former Roman Noodle
restaurant, which has been converted into a studio. The format is
loosely patterned after the ``Today'' show, down to the tourists
who can gawk at the taping through a window facing the studio lot.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday's show, guest Steiger discussed his battle with
depression. The 73-year-old actor was joined by a psychiatrist who
offered depression-warning signs and tips about treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Other segments included advice on inexpensive home decorating, a
feature on educational family vacation spots and an interview with
a Utah couple who have written 16 books on parenting.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, Richard and Linda Eyre, have nine children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had the ninth one first, she'd be an only child,''
Richard Eyre told the national audience.
</P>
<P>
   Studio officials were cautiously optimistic, although they admit
it's hard to tell whether the show _ and the network _ will
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a start-up network,'' Universal Studios Vice President
Kac Young said. ``There could be four people watching; there could
be four million. You never know.''

AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY: CLINTONS, GORES AND MINI-U.N. 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In what is shaping up as a remarkable lineup of
domestic and foreign leaders at New York University, President
Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton have agreed to lead a day of
discussions on the global economy at a conference later this month,
with guests including the prime ministers of Britain and Italy, the
White House said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is also likely to attend the daylong
session at the NYU School of Law, a White House official said on
condition of anonymity. University officials said the event would
be a historic concentration of political power in Greenwich
Village.
</P>
<P>
   The Sept. 21 event coincides with the opening session of the
U.N. General Assembly, which accounts for the university's success
in drawing other heads of government to Clinton's afternoon
discussion. The law school dean, John Sexton, is a longtime friend
of the president and Mrs. Clinton, which in part accounts for the
Clintons' agreement to appear.
</P>
<P>
   The conference promises to be a notable moment even for this
president. Although Clinton has repeatedly demonstrated an affinity
for extended discussions of policies with scholars _ this one will
go at least 90 minutes, Sexton said _ it is the first time he has
attempted something like this with a panel of foreign dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   It also promises to be a notable moment for the NYU School of
Law, which is sponsoring the forum, titled ``Strengthening
Democracy in the Global Economy.''
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, a group of its students, selected
by lottery, and faculty members will in the space of the day
witness a morning seminar led by the first lady, a luncheon speech
by Gore, and an afternoon discussion of international affairs with
a panel that is to include Clinton, Prime Minister Tony Blair of
Britain and Romano Prodi, the prime minister of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of Canada, Brazil, Bulgaria, Sweden and the
Netherlands also have been asked to attend, school officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The conference promises to be interesting for both political and
logistical reasons. As a rule, the General Assembly's opening
sessions, with their influx of foreign dignitaries, motorcades and
security details, bring traffic tie-ups and disruption to the
streets and sidewalks around the United Nations. The conference
promises to extend that confusion to Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact that the Clintons will be attending the same
conference, though not necessarily appearing together, during a
time of public scrutiny of their private life could mean an unusual
amount of attention to a conference devoted to the arguably dry
theme of global economics and politics.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whatever the case, White House and NYU officials said they were
delighted with the way the conference was shaping up. University
officials said it would draw attention to the new Global Law School
Program, which is devoted to the study of how democratic
governments have been affected by the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton's aides said it would give the president a chance to
be spotlighted talking about policy.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the discussions will be open to about 275 people,
including the students, faculty members and outside guests invited
by the university. ``We are aiming for a sizable group of people
from the general intellectual, business and labor community,'' said
Norman Dorsen, the chairman of the Global Law School Program.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the audience will be allowed to ask questions or make
comments, either by passing the questions forward on sheets of
paper or by going to an open microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton will lead the morning forum, which will be called
``Civil Society and the Future of Democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The president will lead the afternoon forum, which will be a
general discussion by the government leaders on themes that were
raised during the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the president will talk about _ your guess is as good as
mine, if I may be only slightly facetious,'' Dorsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's communications aide, Sidney Blumenthal, said the
president's discussion would be devoted to ``strengthening
democracy in the world economy; globalization; everything from a
civil society to how you create more opportunity for people in the
new economy; how you respond to new realities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been an event like this,'' Blumenthal said.

million after taxes, in its arbitrage and Russian-related credits
businesses. After allowing for profits from its private client and

felt ``like I had just been through a B-52 bombing.'' ``It felt
like everything in my body just blew out the top of my head,'' said
McBay, a Vietnam veteran. ``When I came to I was in the fetal
position 15 feet away from where I had been standing.'' McBay of
Gulfport was struck by lightning, as far-fetched a phenomenon as
winning the lottery for most but a real risk in Florida, which
leads the nation in deaths and injuries from lightning strikes.

rugged, manly-miened men. By Natalie Angier.

<P>
   SCI-MATH-IMAGE (New York) _ The movie ``Good Will Hunting''
offers some of the worst stereotypes of mathematics and
mathematicians. The elegance of the subject, or its relevance to
science are not even suggested, while all the cliches are
exploited. But three other popular works of art are mathematically
inspired, showing that math is not just a collection of complicated
problems studied and understood by a few, but that it is a subject
which on a very profound and intuitive level speaks to all of us.
By Dan Rockmore.

<P>
   SCI-ANIMAL-ORIGINS (Undated) _ The first animals may have been
shocked into existence by the evolutionary one-two punch of a
climatic episode so cold that the oceans froze _ snowball earth _
followed by one of the hottest periods in earth history, according
to a new hypothesis based largely on studies of carbon atoms in
ancient sediments. ``We think we have, finally, an explanation for
the first appearance of animal life on earth,'' said the Harvard
geologist who led the study. By William K. Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HEARING-LOSS (Undated) _ Researchers say they are making
progress against noise-induced hearing loss and have begun testing
treatments that may be able to rescue hearing in ears damaged by
unusually loud noise. Military researchers say they have developed
a technique that may be able to restore health to delicate cells
within the ear that are often irreparably damaged or killed by
excessive noise. It may also be possible, they add, to develop
drugs that can be taken in advance to protect against damaging
sounds. By Warren E. Leary.

   SCI-PROSTATE-HEALTH (Undated) _ Prostate cancer patients who are
given radioactive Iodine-125 seeds implanted into the gland can
fare as well or better than those who receive more conventional
beam radiation or prostate removal treatments, a new study shows,
based on 10-year survival rates.

<P>
   John Kifner, 56, now a metropolitan reporter for The Times, won
for the body of his work, for both foreign and domestic reporting.
The Annenberg School for Communication, which administers the
award, cited his ability to translate ``complicated changes in the
political, economic and cultural landscape for American readers.''
</P>
<P>
   In more than 30 years at The Times, Kifner covered the Iranian
revolution, the Persian Gulf War and the assassination of Yitzhak
Rabin. He also covered the 1968 Democratic convention, the Kent
State shootings, the busing crisis in Boston and the Oklahoma City
bombing. He won two George Polk Awards, most recently in 1989 for
his coverage of the Palestinian uprising.
</P>
<P>
   A seven-member committee of journalists and others chose the
winner. Sander Vanocur, a veteran television journalist, said, ``We
wanted to honor a working reporter who was still slugging it out _
who gives you facts over punditry.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nelson, chief Washington correspondent of The Los Angeles
Times, said, ``I've had to compete against him; I know he's
hard-hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   The award is given in honor of John Chancellor, the NBC
television correspondent and anchor who died in 1996, and it will
be presented at a dinner in Philadelphia on Oct. 21. It carries a
$25,000 prize.

EDITORIAL: RUSSIA ON THE VERGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 1:
</P>
<P>
   Boris Yeltsin's hastily arranged deal with the Communists over
the weekend was troubling, but Sunday night's sudden collapse of
their bargain could prove even worse. Its first negative
consequence was Tuesday's parliamentary rebuff to Yeltsin's nominee
for prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin. Russia is left without a
government at a moment when urgent action is needed to check the
country's vertiginous financial free fall. A prolonged vacuum in
Moscow could fracture the geographically sprawling Russian
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Such a troubled country would be an uncertain environment for a
politically healthy U.S. leader. President Clinton, in his weakened
state, runs the risk of appearing ineffective and surrounded by
chaos wherever he turns. Yet, having chosen not to postpone his
trip, Clinton will have to address the crisis that will swirl
around him in Moscow. He must speak forthrightly to the Russian
people and to Russia's riven political leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's 251-to-94 parliamentary vote against Chernomyrdin is
part of a bargaining process that could still produce agreement
between Yeltsin and the Communist-dominated legislature. The
Communist leader, Gennady Zyuganov, rejected the political truce
his subordinates worked out because he feared that once
Chernomyrdin was confirmed, Yeltsin might renege on his commitment
to yield some presidential powers. Chernomyrdin has two more
chances to be confirmed before Yeltsin can call new parliamentary
elections. The Communists presumably will use those votes to
bargain for firmer guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia has no time for such gamesmanship. Confidence in the
ruble and the government's ability to pay its obligations,
including salaries, is near zero. Private foreign investors are
pulling out. Russia needs infusions of money from Western
governments, but they are saying that no new help will be
forthcoming until Russia has a stable government with a serious
economic program.
</P>
<P>
   The most urgent task facing the next Russian government is not
repaying foreign bankers or politically powerful domestic tycoons.
It must regain the confidence of Russia's people, many of whom,
including soldiers and nuclear scientists, have not been paid in
months. Assuaging their anger will require the cooperation of all
three elements battling for power in Russia _ Communists, business
barons and Western-oriented reformers. All stand to lose if the
current disintegration proceeds. They need to coordinate their
efforts under the leadership of Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin to pull
Russia back from the precipice.
</P>
<P>
   This is primarily a challenge for Russian politicians. But
Clinton, while there, should take every opportunity to encourage
the Russian people and tell Russian leaders that they can no longer
look to Western bailouts as a way to avoid fundamental economic
challenges at home. If Clinton cannot command the respect that once
was his, he can at least mix reassurance with necessary candor.

RANGEL WELCOMES MARCHERS BUT NOT LEADER TO HARLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Navigating the treacherous political waters of the
Million Youth March, U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel of Harlem on Monday
urged his constituents to welcome the young marchers, but he
criticized the event's organizers and praised Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani for his handling of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been critical of Khalid Abdul Muhammad, the
march's driving force, Rangel has been restrained on the issue of
the march itself. But with Muhammad having won a court battle last
week allowing the march, and with the date of the rally _ this
Saturday _ fast approaching, he said he saw the need to speak out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to show support for the young people without in any
way showing support for those that convened the march,'' Rangel
said in front of City Hall. ``We're just not prepared to allow
racists and bigots to chase us off our streets.''
</P>
<P>
   His sentiments on the march and Muhammad echoed remarks that
some other black leaders have been making for weeks. Many have
found themselves in a delicate position of not wanting to alienate
the thousands of young people expected to attend the rally, while
at the same time trying to distance themselves from Muhammad's
anti-Semitic, anti-white rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   While Giuliani has been accused of indirectly helping to
energize the event by calling it a ``hate march,'' Rangel praised
Giuliani, saying he had shown admirable restraint in being ``so
quiet about this march.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor returned the compliment Monday by exempting only
Rangel from another round of criticism of black leaders who he said
had failed to speak out loudly enough against the march.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would only hope that there would be more courage and more of
a willingness to stand up against hatred by the political
leadership,'' Giuliani said, ``and so far, the only one who's
unequivocally done that is Charlie Rangel, to his great credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, responding to reporters' questions, repeated his
criticisms of Muhammad and the march, saying that it was ``probably
a way of self-aggrandizing on the basis of hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's latest comments annoyed some black leaders who have
criticized both Muhammad and Giuliani for being inflammatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I counted 17 venues in the last three weeks where I have
denounced Khalid Muhammad's rhetoric, on television, on black
radio, and on the BBC if the mayor was tuning into that,'' said
state Sen. David Paterson, D-Harlem. ``The difference between
Rangel and I is that I've been raising issues about the mayor's
conduct in this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, who supports the march, said that he and
other religious leaders _ even some who oppose the march _ have
been planning ways to accommodate it. He said that Rangel was
simply acknowledging what is already happening. ``I think he sees a
tremendous mobilization among mainstream Harlem and I think that
makes him understand that this is not a hate march and never was,''
Sharpton said.

NEW GENERATION OF AMERICAN MEN FINDS WAYS TO WIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Following in the sneakerprints of Pete Sampras, Andre
Agassi, Jim Courier and Michael Chang has the potential to be a
very thankless task. But Monday at the U.S. Open, several members
of the latest, if probably not greatest, generation of American
men's tennis players managed to prosper at the expense of visitors
from foreign lands.
</P>
<P>
   There was Bob Bryan making his U.S. Open singles debut and
outlasting Marcus Ondruska of South Africa in five sets and nearly
four hours. There was Bryan's teammate at Stanford, Paul Goldstein,
getting his first Open victory at the expense of Australian Andrew
Ilie.
</P>
<P>
   There was also Taylor Dent, who turned professional this week at
age 17. Dent won his first three-of-five-set match without having
to flirt with the limit after his opponent, German qualifier Alex
Radulescu, defaulted early in the third set with a stomach ailment
evidently caused by antibiotics he had taken for a respiratory
infection. Dent was leading by 4-6, 7-5, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good to be 1-0,'' said Dent, the son of former
Australian professional Phil Dent.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Dent is 1-0 with an asterisk, his father/coach was
pleased as well. ``I think for the first time out there in a big
event, he played well,'' Phil Dent said. ``He was composed: a lot
of good stuff. I would have liked for the match to continue because
it's good experience for him. But he'll get another match now.''
</P>
<P>
   So will Bryan and Goldstein, who both are friendly with
Stanford's most prominent undergraduate of the moment, Chelsea
Clinton, and who both reached the National Collegiate Athletic
Association singles final on May 31 in Athens, Ga. Though Goldstein
was the No. 1 player on Stanford's championship team and Bryan was
No. 3, the pecking order did not hold true in Athens. Bryan won the
title in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein's only other loss in college this season came to
Bryan's twin brother, Mike, in a tournament in Los Angeles in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Mike was in the sunlit stands at Court 7 as his brother
rallied from a two-set deficit to defeat Ondruska, 3-6, 6-7 (5-7),
6-1, 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Ondruska, who turned professional in 1989, has been plying his
trade long enough to have experienced plenty of five-set matches.
But for Bryan, this was a first, and his body was not about to let
him forget it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how I'm going to feel tomorrow, but I think it's
going to feel like I played a whole tournament,'' he said after
experiencing shivering and numbness and leg cramping in the match's
final stages.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan still had enough energy to break the inconsistent Ondruska
at 4-4 in the fifth set and save a break point on his serve in the
final game.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother and I have been in the doubles here before, so that
took some of the nervousness away,'' Bryan said. ``But even if
we've been around here for four years, it's great to win the first
singles match.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Bryans turned professional in June after making the
difficult decision to leave Stanford following their sophomore
year. When they were young junior players, their parents
discouraged them from facing each other in tournaments, and the
twins would take turns defaulting when they reached finals. They
have stopped defaulting in recent years, and their singles record
against each other is a very brotherly 8-8. But only Bob earned a
wild card into the main singles draw of the Open, courtesy of his
NCAA title.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein also received a wild card, and his match against the
gifted Ilie was very much a wild ride. After splitting sets, Ilie
began suffering visibly early in the third set, serving underhand
at 2-2 and vomiting on court two games later. He also began
experiencing cramps in his right hand, and at 3-4 he began
switching his racquet to his left hand. He later hit an overhead
with both hands on the grip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like my chances if he's switch-hitting,'' Goldstein said
after Ilie had defaulted with Goldstein leading, 6-7, 7-6, 6-4,
3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein probably likes his chances less against another
natural right-hander in the second round. The right-hander's name?
Sampras.

 What to Do If the Works Isn't Enough   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
   
Q: The IBM Aptiva PC I bought last summer came loaded with
Microsoft Works (oxymoron!). I've been using it in my job as a
consultant, but it isn't easy to make labels, create databases and
perform mail merges. I am thinking about replacing Works with Word
or Office. Which would you suggest?
<TEXT>
<P>
   A: To be fair, Works isn't a heavy-duty program designed for
business use. It's just an integrated suite that includes a basic
word processor, database and spreadsheet. It will do the things you
require but not as well or as efficiently as a full-fledged office
suite.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Word by itself won't solve your problem. You need to
get the Professional Edition of Microsoft Office, which includes
Word as well as Access, a really good database program. You also
might consider two other options, the professional version of the
Corel WordPerfect Suite or the Lotus SmartSuite. They also have all
the weapons any consultant could ask for. Personally, I'd probably
opt for the Microsoft suite because it's so widely used. You can
send a Word document by e-mail and be fairly confident that the
recipient also will have Word.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a Windows PC with Netscape. When Macintosh users send
me graphics files as e-mail attachments, I can't use them. I can't
save the files, and Netscape won't open them in its mail program.
And sometimes, the attachments just come as garble inside the
message itself. Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   A: Macs use a different method than PCs to encode e-mail for
transmission across the Internet. However, newer versions of
Netscape are equipped to decode the Mac system, which is called
BinHex. So under normal circumstances, you should be able to open
and read attachments.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Netscape tell me that your symptoms suggest that
the attachment either was improperly coded by the sending computer
or was corrupted during its trek through an Internet gateway.
</P>
<P>
   One possible solution is to ask senders to use MIME _ rather
than BinHex _ if their e-mail program supports it. MIME is the
standard Internet protocol and the method used most often in
sending messages between PCs.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work, you might try asking the sender to
manually encode the graphic using UUencode before attaching it to
the message. They'll need a special utility for that, and you will,
too, because you'll have to decode the graphic when it arrives.
Fortunately, Uuencoding utilities are widely available as
shareware.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My daughter has a 486-DX running at 33 megahertz with 8
megabytes of RAM and a 700-Mbyte hard drive. It's running Windows
3.1. Would this system support Windows 95 or Windows 98? And if
not, would you recommend upgrading or would you recommend a newer
system?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sorry, your trusty old machine is too underpowered for
Windows 95 or Windows 98, both of which need a Pentium-class chip
and at least 16 megs of memory to perform adequately. To bring your
system up to par, you'd have to add memory, upgrade the chip, get a
bigger hard drive and add a CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   A total face-lift like that would run at least $600. You'd
probably be better off just buying a new system. For $800, you
should be able to find one with a 266 MHz chip, 32 megs of memory,
a 4-gigabyte hard drive and a 24x CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend of mine is producing a newsletter and brochures for
a community group and wants to make some backup files. However,
documents like the newsletter are too big to fit on a floppy disk.
The person doesn't have a Zip drive. So what are the options,
besides splitting the newsletter into five different documents?
</P>
<P>
   A: Your best bet is to compress the document using a zipping
utility. I was able to take a 2-Mbyte newsletter created on
Microsoft Publisher and get it down to less than 500,000 bytes by
using Zip-IT, a $39.95 program from Quarterdeck. The amount of
compression will depend on the kind of files you're dealing with _
some graphical images can be reduced by more than 90 percent! If
you're looking for a good shareware zipping program, try WinZip, a
perennial favorite.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK &QC;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Create a Startup Disk for Windows 95 or Windows 98. If your hard
drive fails, you can use the disk to start your computer, diagnose
and fix common hard disk problems. Go to the Windows Control Panel,
open the Add/Remove Programs icon, tab over to Startup Disk and
follow the instructions.

BACK FROM VACATION, GORE TRIES TO CONDUCT BUSINESS AS USUAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects Communications Workers of America; adds Gore's refusal to
comment on Reno inquiry; polishing throughout.)  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ohio)  (js) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Back on the campaign trail in Illinois and Ohio after
his two-week holiday in Hawaii, Vice President Al Gore turned to
his companions Monday morning on Air Force Two and asked,
``Anything happen while I was gone?''
</P>
<P>
   This was about as close as Gore came to alluding to the
difficulties that are roiling the Clinton-Gore White House. Two
weeks ago, there was the president's admission that he had an
improper relationship with Monica Lewinsky and had misled the
American people about it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last week, Attorney General Janet Reno ordered a 90-day
preliminary inquiry into whether Gore lied to investigators last
year when he was interviewed about his telephone fund-raising
solicitations from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   And Monday, as Clinton headed for Moscow, Gore could not take
solace in the choice of his friend, Viktor Chernomyrdin, as prime
minister by the embattled President Boris Yeltsin of Russia.
Chernomyrdin's nomination is in grave trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But in his first interview since Clinton's disclosure about Ms.
Lewinsky, Gore made clear that his strategy would be to say as
little as possible about the tribulations that threaten to dog him
until the November election and beyond, to his own planned run for
the Democratic nomination in 2000. He did not move beyond his
statement of last week that he would be vindicated in the
fund-raising matter and declined to discuss details of the Reno
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Clinton had assured him he did not have a
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, Gore told reporters aboard Air
Force Two: ``I've never talked about my private conversations with
the president _ and I'm not going to start now.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said he did not agree with Democrats who say
they fear the Lewinsky matter will be a major liability in this
year's elections. Asked if he felt beleaguered, he said, ``Not at
all. Not at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's calculation seems to be to stand by his close friend, the
president, but not too close. For example, he acknowledged in the
interview that he did not join Clinton in recent days in calling
leading Democrats on Capitol Hill to reassure them that they would
endure the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore insisted that he was not distancing himself from the
president, and said White House aides ``didn't ask me to make a
bunch of calls'' because he was tied up making calls on
international issues such as Russia and the U.S. strikes against
targets in Sudan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Only when the interview turned from ethical questions to Russia
did Gore appear comfortable, answering questions and displaying his
expertise on foreign policy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As if to defy those who say the administration is in trouble,
Gore set off on a full round of campaign events. He started the day
talking to school children at a town meeting in Dayton, Ohio, then
attended a fund-raising event for Mary Boyle, the Democratic Senate
nominee from Ohio. In Chicago, Gore was the headline speaker at a
convention of the Communications Workers of America, then he
dedicated an AIDS prevention and care center, and ended the day at
a fund-raising reception for the re-election of Sen. Carol
Moseley-Braun.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gore said nothing about the developments that have
buffeted the administration, they were clearly on the minds of
those in the audience. At the event for Ms. Boyle in Dayton, the
vice president drew perhaps his most sustained applause of the day
when he showed his allegiance to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me say this loudly and clearly: I am proud that Bill
Clinton's policies have made this country a better place,'' he
said. ``I'm proud to serve with President Bill Clinton in helping
to improve the lot of working families in America.''
</P>
<P>
   As if he were oblivious to his own party's problems, Gore turned
his fury on the Republicans, asserting, ``The Republican Party is
in such disarray that the right hand doesn't know what the far
right hand is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But some in the audience said they feared that Clinton's ethical
woes and the fund-raising questions threatened Gore's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel for him both on the personal level and on the political
level,'' said Jan Rudd, a veteran community worker and Democratic
organizer in Dayton. ``Already, you can see that Republicans across
the country are using the Lewinsky issue against Democrats. Are
they going to use it against Gore? Yes. Big time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Jackson, a teacher who attended the Boyle event, said Gore
may not be safe from the taint of the Lewinsky matter because
``there's always the term, `guilt by association,' but I'm more
concerned that Reno says there should be an investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gore was reciting the Clinton administration's
accomplishments in education and the economy, Jackson jabbed his
thumb toward the vice president in the distance and said, ``Any
time you're in politics you're going to be remembered more for the
problems than the good. That's why he's harping on the good
today.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Ruvolo, a former chairman of the state's Democratic
Party, said the Lewinsky matter should be the least of Gore's
worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's running mate is the economy,'' he said, speaking of
2000, ``not Bill Clinton.''

EDITORIAL: THE CRISIS AT LEGAL AID 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 1:
</P>
<P>
   The quality of legal services for New York City's poor
defendants continues to decline. The city has steadily reduced its
contributions to the Legal Aid Society, the main nonprofit agency
providing representation for indigent defendants, even as caseloads
have grown. A recent report from a court-appointed committee shows
how desperate the situation has become.
</P>
<P>
   Legal Aid's troubles go back to a disastrous four-day strike in
1994 that prompted Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to retaliate by farming
out some of the public-defender work to other nonprofit groups.
Since then City Hall has steadily cut Legal Aid's funding from $79
million in 1994 to roughly $52 million this year, based on the
assumption that the agency's workload would drop accordingly. But
the decline did not materialize. Instead, the agency has been
representing nearly the same number of clients for far fewer
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Legal Aid's arrangement with the city requires it to represent
poor criminal defendants for a fixed contract price. But Giuliani's
vigorous pursuit of quality-of-life crimes has produced many more
cases than expected. The average lawyer in the agency's Manhattan
office is assigned some 650 criminal cases a year, a breathtakingly
high number that makes proper representation extremely difficult if
not impossible. The other defender agencies have city contracts for
a fixed number of cases.
</P>
<P>
   The court-appointed panel calls it ``imperative'' that the city
change its contract with Legal Aid to limit the caseload or provide
more funding. The City Council allocated an extra $10 million to
the Legal Aid Society in the fiscal 1999 budget, but Giuliani has
refused to release the money. The new report shows that the agency
needs more resources to meet the city's constitutional obligation
to provide legal services for the accused.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Start spreading the news: Pete Sampras is feeling
historic, Martina Hingis is feeling acquisitive and Goran
Ivanisevic is feeling like the turbo-charged hardcourts at the U.S.
Open are delivering his aces almost faster than he can send them
across the net.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to the U.S. Open, which cranked itself up to full speed
Monday at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, Queens,
to cut through the late summer haze and cut right to the chase. The
top-ranked Sampras, now just six victories from a record-tying 12th
Grand Slam title, and the top-ranked Hingis both zipped through
their opening-day assignments in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
   And Ivanisevic was feeling invincible, at least for a New York
moment, in the same city where he had been paralyzed by first-round
ineptitude in three of his last four visits.
</P>
<P>
   Those who could handle the pace advanced; those who let jitters,
or the invisible flu bug that has been circulating through the
men's and women's locker rooms, undermine their energy level fell
by the wayside early. Justin Gimelstob of New Jersey and Andrew
Ilie of Australia, who are both subject to temper tantrums, were
downed by tempestuous cramps and defaulted. So was German qualifier
Alex Radulescu, who pointed miserably to his stomach as he went to
the net to concede prematurely to 575th-ranked Taylor Dent, the
17-year-old wild card who is the youngest man in the event.
</P>
<P>
   After getting through his first match unscathed, Sampras, who
gained his 11th Grand Slam title by downing Ivanisevic in the
Wimbledon final in July, could afford to be sympathetic to those
who did not handle the Open's opening day pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understand that this Slam, compared to all the rest, I think,
is the most hectic,'' said Sampras, a four-time Open champion,
after his untaxing 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 victory over Marc-Kevin Goellner
kept him on the road to tying Roy Emerson's record of 12 Grand Slam
singles titles. ``You walk out at Wimbledon, you feel kind of the
charm of the place. Here at Flushing, you just kind of feel a
certain electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of hoopla when you play here in New York, and this
one certainly is difficult to win, but I've been playing here
enough to kind of figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, whose precocity is unquestioned, figured the place out
at the age of 17, when she won the third of her 1997 Grand Slam
crowns by outwitting Venus Williams in the final at the brand-new
Arthur Ashe Stadium. On Monday, Hingis, who is making a title
defense here a priority after stalling in the semifinals at the
French Open and Wimbledon, was back inside the stadium, and back to
her old supremely confident self after trampling Aleksandra Olsza
of Poland, 6-2, 6-0, in just under an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely not as confident as I was last year, but this
year wasn't as bad as sometimes I hear on TV, that Martina Hingis
was so beatable,'' protested Hingis, whose last title was at the
Italian Open in May. ``Well, not by everybody, I wouldn't lose
against a nobody. Once you keep losing, one day you get sick of it,
so I am kind of moving up again. So far I haven't lost against
anybody who wasn't top 10, so it's OK.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hingis, who will face unseeded Iva Majoli, the 1997 French Open
champion, in the second round, denied that she had lost her
appetite for winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the Grand Slams, I won the first one, and this
one is still open,'' Hingis said. ``It's the last one of the year,
so you're going to put all your energy into this tournament. I'm
very positive, and I'm in a good mood now.'' She described herself
as the ``black horse'' last year, who sneaked up on the rest of the
field and ``won almost everything I played.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic, who won almost nothing he played this year until he
rediscovered his serving prowess at Wimbledon, left that tournament
a broken man after failing, for the second time in his career, to
get the better of Sampras in a Wimbledon final. He said he felt
like killing himself, but instead he took a boating vacation,
showed up in the United States on schedule for his summer campaign
and reached the final at New Haven, Conn., before his serving arm
went haywire again. But the arm and the man were back in form
Monday. With 23 aces, the Croatian Ivanisevic found safe mooring in
the second round after an acrimonious 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 defeat of
32-year-old Mark Woodforde of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Miffed that Woodforde, who had previously characterized the
14th-seeded Ivanisevic as a one trick pony with a big serve and
little else, failed to apologize after smacking him with a ball,
Ivanisevic later praised his own serve and denigrated his
opponent's entire game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my serve is there, then anything else I want to hit is
going in,'' he said. ``The way his game is, man, I think it's time
for him to retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to emulate the example her older sister Venus set here
last year, 20th-ranked Serena Williams made a successful Open debut
despite being hobbled by a sore right hamstring midway through her
6-3, 3-6, 6-4 defeat of 94th-ranked Nicole Pratt of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old Williams squandered a pair of match points with
a wildly careering volley and a net-bound backhand before breaking
Pratt for her first Open victory. She later called it ``a case of
classic nerves.'' Made aware that her father and coach, Richard,
who was attending his first Grand Slam event with his daughters,
had attracted attention by exiting the Louis Armstrong Stadium in
the second set, Serena Williams played down the effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, my dad always said negative attention is better than no
attention, so long as the truth lives inside of us,'' she said.
``If I was in the crowd and saw someone playing the way I was
playing, I would have left, too; I don't think I played that
well.''
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS:
</P>
<P>
   The day session proved disastrous for just one seeded player,
15th-seeded Alberto Berasategui of Spain, who ran out of resilience
after the first set's tie breaker against Thomas Muster of Austria
and wound up wilting, 7-6 (7-1), 6-2, 6-3. ``I cannot really say
I'm afraid going out against anyone,'' said the 30-year-old,
30th-ranked Muster, who terrorized all comers back in 1995 when he
won the French Open but has never passed the U.S. Open's
quarterfinal round. ... Monica Seles, at her first Open since her
father/coach, Karolj, died of cancer, had a victorious evening. The
two-time Open champion Seles may be more welcome at Flushing
Meadows, where she is seeded sixth, than downtown at the New York
Stock Exchange, where she turned up Monday by invitation and rang
the bell that opened a horrendous day of trading. After a slow
start against 55th-ranked Florencia Labat, Seles turned on the
power and advanced, 7-6 (7-0), 6-2. ... After a career crisis that
sent his ranking plummeting to 141st last year, Andre Agassi's
season of resurgence sent him into the Open seeded eighth and
fixated on ending a three-year Grand Slam drought. Monday night the
28-year-old Agassi, the 1994 Open champion, ignited this year's
campaign with a 6-4, 6-1, 6-4 demolition of 75th-ranked Sebastien
Grosjean of France. ... Mirjana Lucic, the 16-year-old Croat,
eliminated Kristie Boogert of the Netherlands, 6-3, 6-2. ... Justin
Gimelstob, who said he had been diagnosed with anemia, was leading
his match with Wayne Black 6-3, 5-7, 3-2 when he was overcome by
cramps and had to default. ``I just started locking up
everywhere,'' he said.

LABOR LOATH TO OPPOSE A POPULAR GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ About this time in election years, the political
gears of New York's powerful labor unions begin turning _ grinding
out mailings, setting up phone banks, organizing rallies and
issuing endorsements. In statewide elections, those blessings are
usually bestowed on Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But in the governor's race this year, the unions have been
mostly silent, and many labor leaders say they will remain neutral.
Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, spent his first 18 months in
office in pitched battles with unions. But over the last two years,
he has effectively neutralized the unions.
</P>
<P>
   That has not only denied the Democrats one of their most potent
allies but has also given Pataki a tactical advantage in not having
to defend against a well-financed and organized attack from labor.
</P>
<P>
   There is still no political lovefest between labor and Pataki.
But union leaders have calculated that the governor is almost
certain to win re-election and that going to war with him would be
pointless and would harm their future dealings with him.
</P>
<P>
   Labor chiefs have concluded, warily, that Pataki is someone they
can work with. They point out that since 1996, Pataki has eased up
on budget cutting and has signed a handful of labor-friendly bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``This governor has a lot of drawbacks, but he's trying, and
we're trying to work with him,'' said Danny Donohue, president of
the Civil Service Employees Association of New York, which
represents 265,000 state and local government workers.
</P>
<P>
   But underlying such judgments is the calculation that a popular
governor is too powerful an enemy to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's certainly a consideration and I'm not going to deny
that,'' said Roger Benson, president of the 53,000-member New York
State Public Employees Federation, a union of white-collar state
workers that does not plan to make an endorsement in the race. ``We
have to maintain a relationship with the governor. We're not
interested in being at war.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Lubin, executive vice president of the 400,000-member New
York State United Teachers, said: ``Some unions endorse an
incumbent, or stay out of it, because they know he's going to win.
Why waste your money when you can have more of an impact in close
races that you can make a difference in?''
</P>
<P>
   Zenia Mucha, Pataki's campaign manager, argued that labor
leaders view the governor more favorably because ``they've decided
that the governor's policies are working for their members.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic factor is that more of their members are working,''
she said. ``The governor's been able to improve the economy, where
union members are now employed.''
</P>
<P>
   Many union officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
say they prefer Peter Vallone, a Democrat, to Pataki, but do not
think he can win. Vallone, the New York City Council speaker, is a
leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of unions, including the Buffalo Teachers Federation,
are in the Vallone camp. But leaders of many of the state's largest
and most politically active unions say their groups will probably
not make an endorsement in the governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue said his group might actually endorse the governor. The
state AFL-CIO, representing 2.5 million union members, is likely to
remain neutral in the governor's race, according to several of its
board members.
</P>
<P>
   District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees, the umbrella organization for 120,000 New
York City employees, is working for Vallone in the Democratic
primary, but Stanley Hill, the council's president, said he was
unsure whether it would play a role in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McCabe, Vallone's campaign manager, contended that the
unions' neutrality is actually a sign of the governor's weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're this powerful incumbent and things are going so
well, why isn't labor out there endorsing him?'' he asked. ``By
definition, some of the public employee unions aren't going to go
with us because they've got to work with the other guy to negotiate
a contract. But they can't go to their members with Pataki's record
and convince people that he's the right person.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Pataki is not the first politician whose power and
popularity have discouraged potential antagonists from taking
sides. Business groups that disliked Gov. Mario Cuomo, a Democrat,
were loath to take him on at the height of his popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's one-time mentor, U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, has proved
to be an expert at co-opting his opponents. But D'Amato, who has
less direct power than the governor to influence the issues labor
cares most about, has not managed to silence unions the way Pataki
has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'd probably guess we're going to come out against
D'Amato, go with whoever wins the Democratic primary'' in the
Senate race, said Ed Cleary, president of the state AFL-CIO.

PATIENT AT LAST, SOSA KNOCKING THEM OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Sammy Sosa is in the batting cage at Wrigley Field,
and his coaches are talking hitting. They use a strange vocabulary,
with talk of tap stepping and loading up, of quiet hands and early
feet. They are all code words for patience.
</P>
<P>
   For the first six years of his career, Sammy Sosa was one of the
least patient players in the game. He could hit the long ball and
steal a base, but he was undisciplined. Moving the runner to third,
protecting the plate with two strikes _ these things were not his
style. Last year Sosa struck out 174 times, more than any Chicago
Cub since Wrigley was called Weeghman Park.
</P>
<P>
   Now he can joke about those years, saying, ``I was trying to hit
two home runs in every at-bat.''
</P>
<P>
   The young man in a hurry has learned to wait. At age 29, a
mature Sosa is handling more than National League pitching. He is
the cool competitor in the Roger Maris chase, the man who tied Mark
McGwire of St. Louis by hitting his 55th home run Monday night
against the Cincinnati Reds as they both push toward 61 home runs
and beyond. And Sosa has not been tossed from a game yet.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the cage, his coaches smile as Sosa sends another low
fastball into the seats. As he moves toward the conclusion of a
dream season, they recall the arc of his maturation as a player and
as a man.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa came to the Cubs at age 24, carrying a dual reputation. The
good Sammy loved to play. He appreciated what he had, and how he
had risen from poverty in the Dominican Republic. The bad Sammy was
a sucker for a two-strike curve in the dirt. He had a career
average of .233.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, he sometimes seemed to play for himself, not the team. He
would steal a base when it did the team no good, padding his
statistics. He did not always think where he should position
himself in right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a rockhead,'' said Mark Grace, the blunt leader of the
Cubs' clubhouse. ``He played Barry Bonds and Rafael Belliard the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   And he tried to pull every pitch to left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy didn't believe there were any base hits in right
field,'' said Billy Williams, a Cubs coach and a Hall of Famer as a
player.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Sosa were Cub rookies together in 1992. Sosa had
just finished two dismal years with the crosstown White Sox, and
Williams was back with the Cubs at age 53, as the hitting coach.
</P>
<P>
   Williams knows hitting (he is 164 career home runs ahead of
Sosa, who had 262 after Monday's game), and he knows the burden of
high expectations. Back in 1961, the kid from Whistler, Ala., was
the rookie of the year, and then an All-Star six times. He believes
the young Latin players of today have it a bit easier than his
generation of African-American players, despite the language
barrier. ``Now they have a veteran who will teach and talk and
tell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's talent was obvious. Ted Williams, an extraordinary hitter
in his day, has said the swing starts in the hips, and Sosa arrived
with one of the strongest lower bodies in the game. But he also was
quick with his hands. And the list of players with that combination
is short, say Billy Williams and Jeff Pentland, who became the
Cubs' hitting coach in 1997. There are Bonds, Gary Sheffield, Sammy
Sosa and not many more.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1992, one of the first things Williams taught Sosa was
to quit diving into the plate on every pitch, making himself
vulnerable to a ball thrown at his hands. Williams talked to him
about standing farther back. And he told him to keep his head back,
behind the point of contact.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa practiced hard, in the weight room and in winter ball, and
developed into a hitter. In 1993 Sosa became the first Cub to hit
30 homers and steal 30 bases. By 1995 he was second in the league
in both homers and runs batted in. In 1996 he reached 40 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every player,'' Williams said, ``goes through that barrier
where he says: `Hey, I belong in the major leagues. I'm as good as
these other guys.'''
</P>
<P>
   A lesson in finesse came next. A former minor leaguer, Pentland
was Bonds' hitting coach at Arizona State. ``Sammy didn't have much
finesse,'' Pentland said. ``Sammy was all out.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentland collected videotapes of Sosa at the plate. As he
stepped toward the pitcher and just before he began his swing,
there in freeze frame was the ball _ already halfway to home plate.
``That's too late,'' Pentland said. ``You can't swing till the foot
hits the ground. It's called having late feet.'' They worked on
keeping Sosa's hands down, closer to the point of impact, making
his swing shorter. The goal was to give him more time to recognize
the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   And Sosa added another touch on his own: the tap step. Chipper
Jones of Atlanta uses it, as do others. Last August, Sosa began
learning the tap. Before the pitch is delivered, he steps back,
with his front foot, away from the pitcher. It's a timing device.
It starts a rhythm. First the back step and then the forward
explosion. ``Rhythm,'' Pentland said, ``is another word for
coordination.''
</P>
<P>
   The tap step also breaks the swing down into stages: a first
stage (the rearward tap step) that always happens, and a second
stage (the forward swing) that is held in reserve for the right
pitch. Tapping delays the launch decision a split second.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gives him time to read the pitch, to load up, to build
up,'' Pentland said. ``We want Sammy ready to swing even if he
doesn't commit.''
</P>
<P>
   While the coaches worked on Sosa's swing, Mark Grace worked on
his head. The first baseman is the only Cub who remembers the
team's last taste of the playoffs, in 1989. He had a few chats with
Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he had accomplished everything he could as a
player,'' Grace said. ``He'd stolen 30 bases. He had 40 home runs
and 100 RBI. He was an All-Star. But he'd never been to the
playoffs. To be a superstar, you need to be a superstar in the
post-season.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa said, ``Well, I was in the playoffs in the Dominican
Republic,'' But Sosa knew what Grace meant. And now, with a month
to go in the season, Sosa is trying to pass Roger Maris'
single-season record of 61 home runs in 1961 at the same time he is
trying to push the Cubs past the Mets and the San Francisco Giants
in the National League wild-card race. It is a more complicated
assignment than McGwire has, because the Cardinals are not
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``My situation is different,'' Sosa said. ``I'm in the middle of
a pennant race and I can't go out there thinking about a home run
all the time. Mark's only looking for one thing _ to go out there
and break the record.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But with all that at stake, Sosa is more relaxed now than he
used to be, when a negative newspaper story would stay on his back
for a week. Now he relaxes after a game, an ice wrap on his ribs,
welcoming questions whether he hit a home run that day or not.
</P>
<P>
   It has all come together for him: the waiting, the early feet
and the tap step. Then, 55 times, the leap of exclamation, the
heart kisses for his family and the ``V'' signs he says are to
honor the late Harry Caray, the longtime Cubs announcer.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa still strikes out a lot _ 134 times entering Monday's game,
the most in the major leagues, and just ahead of McGwire, who has
struck out 129 times. But he is moving the runners over. He leads
the league in RBIs and total bases. With a month to go, he has a
third more walks than he had last season.
</P>
<P>
   A June 13 game in Philadelphia was an example of his
improvement. He hit a two-run home run _ to right field, where
one-fourth of his homers this year have landed. More important,
twice with two strikes he made just enough contact to drive in a
run _ on a groundout and on a sacrifice fly. The Cubs won, 10-8, in
10 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa swings a light, black bat, 32 ounces, with a thicker handle
than most power hitters prefer. Unlike McGwire's high, towering
shots, many of Sosa's home runs are line drives. From just a few
feet away, the confrontation of bat and ball produces a
thunderclap.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hits the ball hard, doesn't he?'' Pentland said, watching
Sosa hit. ``He doesn't swing hard, does he? I call it easy power.
McGwire has it. Sammy has it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has done it with nothing stronger in his locker than baby
lotion, although he has used creatine, a muscle-building amino acid
powder, sporadically in the past.
</P>
<P>
   These days, on his way to work at Wrigley, Sosa can take a
detour on the Kennedy Expressway and drive past a three-story mural
of himself slamming a home run. It is being painted on the Bigsby &AMP;
Kruthers warehouse, where an image of Dennis Rodman and his
technicolor hair colors stopped traffic in 1996. Now Sosa is the
three-story man.
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard for any player in his situation not to have an
inflated view of himself. But Billy Williams can still help with
that. As it turns out, he is now the Cubs' outfield coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``His errors,'' Williams said. ``Knowing where to position
himself and where to throw. He could improve on that.''

   WASHINGTON _ A Senate committee has concluded that while the
government failed many veterans of the Persian Gulf war, there is
insufficient evidence to conclude that exposure to Iraqi nerve gas
caused the illnesses reported by thousands of American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Veterans Affairs Committee reached those conclusions
after a yearlong study and will present them in a 310-page report
to be released on Tuesday. Although highly critical of the
Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, the report's authors
said they could not conclude, as others have, that nerve gas caused
the so-called Gulf War Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is insufficient evidence at this time to prove or
disprove that there was actual low-level exposure of any troops to
chemical weapon nerve agents or that any of the health effects some
veterans are experiencing were caused by such exposure,'' the
Senate panel concluded.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the report might seem surprising, because the
Senate Veterans Affairs Committee _ like the House Committee on
Government Reform and Oversight and a pPresidential commission _
has been critical of how the Pentagon and Veterans Affairs
Department have handled soldiers' complaints of illnesses after the
1991 war.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear on Monday night whether the report's cautious
wording, and its stress on insufficient evidence, reflected the
background of the panel's chairman, Sen. Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania, who was a prosecutor before becoming a lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   The House committee concluded last October, after a 20-month
investigation, that ``a variety of toxic agents in the gulf war,''
including Iraqi chemical weapons and pesticides, were probably
responsible for the health problems reported by up to 100,000
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   And the presidential advisory committee concluded a week later
that the Defense Department had dismissed credible evidence that
thousands of Marines may have been exposed to poison gas when they
crossed Iraqi minefields in the war.
</P>
<P>
   In concluding that there was not enough evidence to blame
exposure to chemical weapons for the widespread illnesses, the
Senate panel nevertheless said the Defense Department and veterans
agency had not investigated diligently enough.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that the veterans agency had shown ``chronic and
pervasive inability to generate valid and reliable data about the
Gulf war veterans it serves.''
