<HEADLINE> Peers Honor 'Peanuts' Creator Schulz  </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The rest of the world knew him, rather formally,
as Charles M. Schulz. But to his many friends, the late creator of
Charlie Brown and Snoopy was simply ''Sparky.''
</P>
<P>
   Those friends, many of them fellow cartoonists, celebrated
Sparky's 50 years in the funnies business Saturday evening by
running Schulz-themed cartoons in the nation's newspapers. More
than 80 strips paid homage to ''Peanuts'' -- everything from ''Alley
Oop'' to ''Ziggy.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, 600 members of the National Cartoonists
Society and guests honored Schulz posthumously with The Milton
Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award. His widow, Jeannie, accepted the
organization's highest honor during the black-tie event.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sparky had hoped for all of his life that he would receive
this award and had hoped he would be here for it, and in many ways,
I think he is,'' she said to a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick McDonald, who created the cartoon called ''Mutts,''
presented the award to Schulz's wife.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lets get the record straight right now,'' McDonald said.
''Charles Schulz was the greatest cartoonist who ever lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Bil Keane, master of ceremonies who created ''Family Circus,''
added, ''This was a small tribute to an icon we all consider a dear
friend for decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Mort Walker, who created ''Beetle Bailey,'' paid tribute to
Schulz in his Saturday cartoon, which showed Beetle, Gen. Halftrack
and Sgt. Snorkel saluting a blimp with Snoopy on its side.
</P>
<P>
   ''We salute you, Snoopy and Sparky,'' it read. ''We'll miss you,
old friend.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saturday coordination of cartoons was organized by Pulitzer
Prize-winning artist Mike Luckovich of The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. It was timed to coincide with the Caniff
Award for Schulz, who died Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought this would be a fun way for cartoonists to
personally honor and thank Sparky,'' Luckovich said. ''This tribute
is a celebration of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Peanuts'' made its official debut on Oct. 2, 1950. The daily
tales of the ''little round-headed kid'' and his pals eventually
ran in more than 2,600 newspapers, reaching millions of readers in
75 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz won the Reuben Award, comic art's highest honor, in 1955
and 1964. In 1978, he was named International Cartoonist of the
Year, an award voted by 700 comic artists around the world.

Train Derailment Triggers Explosion
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   EUNICE, La. (AP) -- Thousands of people were ordered to evacuate their homes
and businesses on Saturday after a Union Pacific freight train loaded with
hazardous chemicals derailed and exploded, sending fireballs into the sky. No
injuries were reported. Officials said the worst chemicals in the wreckage were
methyl chloride, acrylic acid, toluene diisocyanate, and dichloropropane. Large
amounts can cause convulsions, coma, and death. Lower amounts can cause
staggering, blurred or double vision, dizziness, and fatigue, among other
things.

Wendy's Suspect Faces Charges
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A man arrested in the execution slayings of five people at a
Wendy's was a fugitive free on $3,500 bail after a string of armed robberies at
fast-food restaurants, authorities said Saturday. Prosecutors had requested a
bail of $100,000 for John ''Benji'' Taylor, but the judge released him last
summer. The 36-year-old suspect and an alleged accomplice were to be arraigned
Sunday for killing five Wendy's employees and wounding two others. Their heads
wrapped in plastic, they were bound, gagged and shot execution-style.

Ulster Unionists Endorse Joint Gov't
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Northern Ireland's major Protestant party
voted Saturday to resume power-sharing alongside the IRA-linked Sinn Fein. The
grassroots council of the Ulster Unionist party decided by a 459-403 vote to
revive on Tuesday the joint government that began operating in December but was
suspended because the Irish Republican Army refused to make any disarmament
commitments. The IRA broke the impasse three weeks ago, promising to begin
disarming if power-sharing resumed. Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams, speaking in
New York, called the vote the ''right decision.''

Gore Criticizes Bush Nuclear Plan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WEST POINT, N.Y. (AP) -- Al Gore criticized George W. Bush's proposal to cut
America's nuclear arsenal whether or not Russia does the same, telling West
Point cadets on Saturday that it ''will create instability and undermine our
security.'' Bush last week proposed reducing the U.S. nuclear stockpile to its
''lowest possible number consistent with our national security,'' even without
Russia making cuts. The Texas governor paired the cuts with a broad national
security review that must include a missile defense system. He also opposes a
treaty that bans worldwide tests of nuclear weapons.

   LEACHVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Thunderstorms and tornadoes damaged homes and downed
trees and power lines in northern Arkansas Saturday, injuring at least one
person. Five people died in traffic accidents. A tornado touched down near
Leachville, in the northeast corner of Arkansas, Arkansas State Police said. At
least one person was injured, authorities said. The heavy rain also prompted
flood warnings and stranded several campers, canoeists and kayakers along the
rapidly-flowing Buffalo National River. National Park Service employees rescued
one kayaker from a tree at Ponca.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Knicks withstood the losses of Marcus Camby and
Patrick Ewing and beat the Indiana Pacers 98-95 on Saturday in Game 3 of the
Eastern Conference finals. Latrell Sprewell broke out of a series-long slump and
scored 32 points and Allan Houston won his matchup with Reggie Miller and scored
28 as the Knicks cut the Pacers' lead to 2-1 in the best-of-seven series. Game 4
is Monday. It was another chapter of adversity overcome for a Knicks team that
always seems to play its best when things look their worst.

<HEADLINE> Royals 6, Angels 5, 10 innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Dave McCarty hit a game-tying two-run
homer in the ninth inning, and Carlos Beltran scored the winning
run in the 10th on a sacrifice fly just past first base as the
Kansas City Royals beat the Anaheim Angels 6-5 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals, who rallied from 5-3 down in the ninth against Troy
Percival, won for the 12th time this season in their final at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Jermaine Dye led off the 10th with a single off Eric Weaver
(0-2) and went to third on Beltran's single. After Mark Quinn was
intentionally walked, Jorge Fabregas hit a grounder to Weaver, who
got the force at home.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Randa then popped one into foul territory and first baseman
Mo Vaughn backpedaled to catch it. Vaughn hesitated throwing it
home and Beltran scored with the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reichert (3-3) pitched two hitless innings for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Percival, who leads the AL with 14 saves, blew his third chance
of the season in the ninth. Pinch-hitter Scott Pose led off with a
single before McCarty hit Kansas City's first pinch-hit homer since
Shane Mack did it May 22, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had scored three runs in the eighth to take a 5-3
lead. Vaughn walked off Jerry Spradlin with one out and Tim Salmon
doubled to left sending Vaughn to third. Spradlin then walked Garet
Anderson intentionally to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus' infield single tied the score and Ben Molina's
two-run single with two outs made it 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad hit a two-run homer in the third inning for
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals answered with three runs in the bottom half off Kent
Bottenfield, but they could have had more, as they had two runners
retired on the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Fabregas led off with a single. Jeff Reboulet followed
with a grounder to short, but second baseman Adam Kennedy bobbled
Benji Gil's throw, allowing Fabregas to advance safely. However,
Fabregas thought he was out and wandered off the base, and Kennedy
tagged him out.
</P>
<P>
   Rey Sanchez then singled to center. Reboulet slid under the tag
at third and Sanchez went to second on the throw. Johnny Damon tied
it with a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs, Mike Sweeney walked and Jermaine Dye hit an RBI
single. Dye took second on the throw to third, but Sweeney was
thrown out at the plate, ending the inning.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Royals are 228-204 record all-time versus the Angels,
including 105-106 in Kansas City. The 228 wins is the most against
any opponent. ... The Angels tied a club record for home runs in a
month with 44, first done in August 1982. They now have homered in
39 of their 49 games. ... Molina extended his hitting streak to a
career-high 10 games with a one-out single in the third. ... Kansas
City's Mark Quinn had his 10-game hitting streak snapped.

<HEADLINE> Report: Nets Set To Hire Jackson  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Nets are set to hire Michael
Jackson, the former Georgetown basketball player-turned television
executive, as team president, according to a published report.
</P>
<P>
   The Star-Ledger of Newark, citing unidentified sources, also
reported Sunday that the Nets are interested in hiring John
Thompson, Jackson's former college coach, as director of basketball
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Nets team officials could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Michael's got the president's job,'' the newspaper quoted one
person close to the team's search as saying.
</P>
<P>
   But the paper also reported that Thompson might prefer to coach
in the NBA, and pass up a front office job with the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the ownership would give him a shot at being the
coach,'' the source told the newspaper. ''I think they think enough
of him to do that. He's a name coach.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper reported an announcement could come as early as
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Reds 8, Marlins 6, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By TERRY KINNEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Cliff Floyd homered twice, and Preston Wilson
drove in the go-ahead run with a bloop single in the 10th inning as
the Florida Marlins snapped an eight-game skid with an 8-6 win over
the Cincinnati Reds on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd hit a two-run homer in the first and a solo shot in the
fifth for the Marlins, who had lost 11 straight at Cinergy Field
since Sept. 23 1997. Floyd finished with a career-high five RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Castillo walked off Scott Williamson (2-3) to lead off the
10th inning. Mark Kotsay followed with a single and Floyd walked,
loading the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson then blooped a single to right field to score the
go-ahead run. Dave Berg then walked on four pitches to make it 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Alfonseca (1-3) pitched two scoreless innings for the
win.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Brad Penny pitched 5 1-3 innings of hitless ball for
Florida, but did not return following a 45-minute rain delay.
</P>
<P>
   When play was halted, a hit had been charged to Penny. But the
official scorer reversed himself after reviewing replays that
showed Dmitri Young's grounder glanced off first baseman Derrek
Lee's glove and second baseman Castillo was unable to make a play
because first base was uncovered. Lee was charged with an error.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, who also had a sacrifice fly in the sixth and an RBI
groundout in the eighth, led off the fifth with a 437-foot homer
into the upper deck. There have been 32 upper-deck homers in the
stadium since it was built in 1970. The longest -- an estimated
473-footer by Mark McGwire, came earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson followed with his 11th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Benito Santiago had a sacrifice fly in the second and a two-run
single in the sixth for Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Pokey Reese tripled and scored on Barry Larkin's groundout in
the seventh to tie the game at 5. Reese walked with the bases
loaded in the eighth off Dan Miceli to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Floyd has reached base in a career-high 25 consecutive
games. ... This was the third time this season the Marlins have had
consecutive home runs. Floyd and Wilson did it last on May 25 at
St. Louis. ... Cincinnati retired Tony Perez's No. 24 jersey in a
ceremony before the game. The Big Red Machine first baseman is
special assistant to the Marlins' general manager. ... Castillo has
reached base in 16 straight games and 31 of the 32 he has played.

<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Robin Ventura broke a seventh-inning tie with a
two-run, bases-loaded single as the New York Mets ended the St.
Louis Cardinals' five-game winning streak, 5-2 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hampton (6-4) escaped early trouble to win his fourth
straight start, quieting an attack that had totaled 48 runs during
the streak. He allowed two runs and nine hits in eight innings, and
has given up only three runs in 30 1-3 innings during his streak.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start, last year's NL Cy Young runner-up is 6-1 in
his last eight outings. He also went 2-for-3 at the plate with a
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Edmonds hit his third homer in four games, his 16th overall,
and Fernando Vina had a run-scoring groundout for St. Louis. Mark
McGwire, the major league leader with 20 homers, went 0-for-3 with
a walk.
</P>
<P>
   New York won for the seventh time in 10 games as Ventura
improved his career average with the bases loaded to .364 with 154
RBIs and 14 homers in 129 at-bats. He also hit a sacrifice fly in
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals pitchers tied a season-high with nine walks, including
three straight by Pat Hentgen that forced in a run in the first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 2-all in the seventh, Mark Thompson (0-1) got two
outs and then walked Derek Bell, Edgardo Alfonzo and Mike Piazza,
bringing up Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton got out of a bases-loaded, one-out situation in the
first when Eric Davis grounded into a double play. The Cardinals
loaded the bases in the second on singles by Placido Polanco,
Hentgen and Fernando Vina before Edgar Renteria struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton nicked Mike Matheny with in the fourth and it finally
cost him a run as Polanco singled, Hentgen sacrificed with a
two-strike bunt and Vina followed with a run-scoring groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Hentgen, who has a 5.52 ERA, put together his second straight
solid outing, allowing two runs and four hits in six innings.
Notes: Edmonds is almost halfway to his best season homer total of
33 in 1995. ... Armando Benitez pitched a hitless ninth for his
13th save in 14 chances. ... Cardinals pitchers also had nine walks
April 20 at San Diego. ... The Cardinals have 97 homers in 47 games
and need three in the next three to tie Seattle's record of
reaching 100 homers in 50 games last season. The NL record for
reaching 100 is 64 games by the 1956 Reds. ... Alfonzo is only
6-for-30 for his career against the Cardinals. ... Cardinals C Mike
Matheny has thrown out 17 of 28 would-be basestealers. ... The
Cardinals are 23-7 against teams with losing records and 5-11 vs.
winners. ... Derek Bell is in an 0-for-17 slump.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have won seven of their last nine games and eight of
their last eleven.
</P>
<P>

had a two-run double in the first inning, a two-run homer in the
third and a sacrifice fly in the fourth.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Stunt Plane Crash Kills Couple  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUNNELL, Fla. (AP) -- Two planes piloted by a husband-and-wife
aerobatic team collided Saturday as the couple practiced a maneuver
that was part of their air show.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Heligoin, 68, and Montaine Mallet, 52, were killed after
the planes crashed to the ground. They had been practicing a stunt
in which both planes fly straight up, stall their engine, begin
falling in unison and then make a last-second recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But one of their CAP 10 airplanes clipped the other at about
10:45 a.m., bringing both crashing to the ground at Flagler County
Airport, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Witness Joanna Chambers said she saw the wing of one plane hit
the other.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first I just thought it was some trick where one plane goes
around the other,'' she said. ''There was no explosion, just
pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   The airport, about 30 miles northwest of Daytona Beach, has two
runways and no control tower. Pilots are expected to communicate
with each other to arrange landings and takeoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Mallet and Heligoin, both natives of France, called their
routine The French Connection Airshow, which included
close-formation aerobatics, such as loops and rolls, performed in
unison.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration and the National
Transportation Safety Board were investigating the crash.

<HEADLINE> Phillies 7, Dodgers 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Desi Relaford had a career-high five RBIs,
including a three-run homer, and Pat Burrell homered for the second
time in four career games as the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Los
Angeles Dodgers 7-6 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Person (5-2) went five innings for the victory, as the
Phillies won for only the fourth time in 14 games. The right-hander
allowed four runs and six hits, including a pair of two-run doubles
by Eric Karros.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers lost third baseman Adrian Beltre in the sixth inning
when he strained his right hamstring running out a grounder to
second base.
</P>
<P>
   Karros, who leads the Dodgers with 44 RBIs, trimmed
Philadelphia's lead to 6-4 in the fifth with his second two-run
double. Todd Hundley singled off reliever Wayne Gomes' glove with
the bases loaded in the seventh, making it 6-5. But pinch-hitter
Dave Hansen lined out to center.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers put the tying run on third again in the eighth, but
right fielder Bobby Abreu robbed Mark Grudzielanek of a bloop
single to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lieberthal ended an 11-game RBI drought with a solo homer
in the ninth to give the Phillies a two-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Brantley got three outs for his fourth save. Brantley
allowed a solo homer to Gary Sheffield, his 15th, leading off the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell led off the Phillies' four-run second inning off Darren
Dreifort (3-2) with a drive into the pavilion in right-center.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second homer in 14 at-bats for the No. 1 overall pick
in the 1998 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort then walked Rob Ducey and gave up a single to Kevin
Jordan before Relaford homered inside the right-field pole for his
third homer, giving Philadelphia 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Relaford, who had only three RBIs in his 38 previous career
at-bats against the Dodgers, made it 6-2 in the third with a
two-run single to center.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort allowed six runs and six hits over three innings in his
shortest outing of the season. It was the third straight time he
has allowed six earned runs, following his two-hit shutout on May
12 at St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Burrell was picked off first base by Alan Mills in the
seventh inning. ... Relaford, who has batted eighth in 37 of the 38
games he has played, has eight RBIs in the first five games of the
Phillies' road trip. He had only nine RBIs in his other 33 games
this season. ... Lieberthal thought he was hit on the hand with a
pitch from Matt Herges with runners at the corners with one out in
the sixth. Plate umpire Greg Gibson ruled it a foul ball off the
bat handle, provoking a lengthy argument from Phillies manager
Terry Francona. ... Person, who entered the game with the NL's
second-best ERA in road games, saw it jump from 2.08 to 2.90
following his fifth road outing of the season. ... Dodgers RF Shawn
Green committed his second error of the season when he allowed
Jordan's fifth-inning single to elude him.

FBI Pursues Cause of E-mail Virus
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Computer experts and the FBI pursued yet another e-mail
virus Saturday, this one using a guise of a woman's work resume to threaten the
world's computers. Unlike an earlier bug that claimed to be looking for love,
the new threat was discovered Friday looking for a job. The virus -- called
''Killer Resume'' -- is spread through e-mail systems using the Microsoft
Outlook program, FBI officials said. They refused to elaborate on the
investigation. The FBI advised computer users not to open e-mail with the
subject line ''Resume - Janet Simons,'' to deactivate the executive summary
feature in Outlook, then to delete the e-mail without opening it.

   EUNICE, La. (AP) -- Thousands of people were ordered to evacuate their homes
and businesses on Saturday after a Union Pacific freight train loaded with
hazardous chemicals derailed and exploded, sending fireballs into the sky. No
injuries were reported. Officials said the worst chemicals in the wreckage were
methyl chloride, acrylic acid, toluene diisocyanate, and dichloropropane. Large
amounts can cause convulsions, coma, and death. Lower amounts can cause
staggering, blurred or double vision, dizziness, and fatigue, among other
things.

<HEADLINE> Rare Whooping Crane Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- A whooping crane whose birth was the
first documented in the U.S. wild in 60 years has died, apparently
after being attacked by a bobcat.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said the
bird was found Thursday in 2 inches of water with signs that it had
been chewed and partially eaten, ''conditions associated with
bobcat predation.''
</P>
<P>
   The chick, which was born in March, was hailed by biologists as
the first solid sign of success in a 7-year-old program to
reintroduce the rare birds to the wild in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Excitement over the birth, however, was mitigated by the fact
that the chick's chances for surviving to adulthood were slim since
it was likely to be eaten by a predator.
</P>
<P>
   The chick was about to enter one of the most dangerous phases of
its life -- learning to fly -- when it was attacked. Fledglings who
leave their parents' nest are vulnerable to predation.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists had fitted the chick with a transmitter to track its
movements and progress, said Steve Nesbitt, project leader for the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   The whooping crane was near extinction by 1938, when only two
small flocks remained, one in Canada and the other in Louisiana. A
storm wiped out all but six of the Louisiana birds, and none laid
eggs again.
</P>
<P>
   The last survivor of that flock died in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have been working since the late 1960s to raise the
birds in captivity.

<HEADLINE> Israel Transportation Minister Quits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's transportation minister resigned
Sunday in light of sexual assault and harassment charges filed by
three former subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of Yitzhak Mordechai, a former defense minister
and highly decorated army officer, was expected to hamper Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's efforts to pull his coalition together after
two partners have threatened to resign over the government's peace
policies. The coalition troubles could cloud Barak's peace process
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai's resignation from the ministry was accepted in a
Cabinet meeting Sunday and will take effect Tuesday, Barak's office
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai will continue to serve as a member of the parliament,
the Knesset, but has also resigned from the leadership of the
Center Party, said Leor Horev, a spokesman. He will not try to
prevent the lifting of his immunity as a parliament member, Horev
added.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation came two days after Attorney General Elyakim
Rubinstein announced that charges would be pressed against
Mordechai. The charges centered on accusations by a former employee
that Mordechai shoved her onto a couch and put his hand under her
shirt on Feb. 25.
</P>
<P>
   After the accusations were made public, two other women came
forward with accounts of unwanted sexual advances from Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai did not make any public statement in his resignation.
Previously, he has denied all charges.
</P>
<P>
   According to Israeli law, the names of the three women have not
been made public. Rubinstein said Mordechai, 55, would be charged
with aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault and sexual
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear who would replace Mordechai in the
ministry post. The moderate Center Party was slated to meet later
Sunday to decide who would take Mordechai's place in its top seat.

<HEADLINE> Everest Climber Took Hour Longer  </HEADLINE>
By BINAJ GURUBACHARYA
<TEXT>
<P>
   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) -- A Sherpa guide who set a new record for
the fastest ascent of Mount Everest said Sunday that he took an
hour longer to climb the world's highest peak than had been
reported earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Babu Chhiri, 34, scaled the 29,035-foot mountain to its summit
on May 21 through icy winds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I climbed the mountain in 16 hours and 56 minutes and not 15
hours and 56 minutes as reported due to communication problems
between the base camp and me,'' Chhiri told reporters when he
arrived in Katmandu.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the extra hour he said he took, Chhiri still broke the
record for the fastest climb, set two years ago by Kaji Sherpa, who
climbed Everest in 20 hours and 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Most climbers take two to four days to cover the distance from
the base camp at 17,500 feet to the summit, depending on the
weather.
</P>
<P>
   This was Chhiri's 10th successful summit of Everest. Only two
others have achieved this feat. In 1995, he became the first
climber to scale Everest twice in the same season.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Nepalese Sherpas, Chhiri climbs without bottled
oxygen, even though air pressure is low, making breathing
strenuous.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have made the climb in about 14 hours if it had not
been for the heavy wind and snow,'' Chhiri said.
</P>
<P>
   Chhiri's brother, Dawa, had scaled the mountain earlier and
waited at the summit to welcome him.
</P>
<P>
   At the summit, the two brothers spent only about 10 minutes
before making a hasty retreat to lower camps.
</P>
<P>
   Most climbers retreat within a few minutes of scaling the peak,
with its high winds, freezing temperatures, rapid weather changes
and lack of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Chhiri's May 21 ascent came a year after he set a record by
camping for 21 hours on the peak.
</P>
<P>
   The Sherpas, who live at the foot of the Himalayas, are known as
''Tigers of the Snows.'' Renowned for their mountaineering skills
and stamina, many work as guides and porters for tourists in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first recorded climb of Everest in 1953 by Sir Edmund
Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay, more than 800 people have
conquered the tallest peak. Some 180 people have died on its
slopes.

</P>
<P>
   Amami Oshima is part of a chain of smaller islands stretching
southwest of Kagoshima, which is 615 miles southwest of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The coast guard received a fax from China's Rescue Coordination
Center in Beijing saying a Chinese boat rescued the entire crew of
the Pratibha Yamuna, said coast guard spokesman Shinya Nakawatase.
</P>
<P>
   The tanker was not carrying any oil at the time of the accident,
and no oil leakage has been found.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was brought under control, and the tanker, which will
be taken by Chinese tug boat to Shanghai, was not in any danger of
sinking, said Coast Guard official Shigenobu Tanaka.
</P>
<P>
   The tanker, which departed from Singapore, was en route to China
after stopping in South Korea, he said. The coast guard was
investigating the cause of the fire.

<HEADLINE> Radiation Detected at Japan Reactor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A nuclear reactor at a plant in northern Japan was
shut down Sunday after an unusually high level of radiation was
detected in its cooling water.
</P>
<P>
   Radiation did not leak into the environment, and the level of
radiation, which was about 300 times the normal level, was still
within safety limits, said Ichiro Kudo, spokesman for Tokyo
Electric Power Co., the plant's utility company.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 6 reactor, one of seven reactors at the
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant, was being shut down manually, Kudo said.
</P>
<P>
   A similar high level of radiation was detected momentarily last
August. The plant, 130 miles northwest of Tokyo, will be checked
for a possible fuel leak as a precautionary measure, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's worst nuclear accident, on Sept. 30 at a fuel-processing
plant in Tokaimura, 70 miles northeast of Tokyo, took the lives of
two workers.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Reports 'Senseless' Attack  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG NELSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) -- Eritrea reported fighting Sunday on all
fronts on the eve of peace talks with its neighbor, accusing
Ethiopia of ''senseless destruction'' in the bombing of a civilian
power plant.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a new front opened in Eritrea's humanitarian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Ongoing fighting near the central city of Mendefera threatens to
uproot 200,000 people, U.N. Eritrea coordinator Simon Nhongo
warned, dramatically intensifying the civilian flight from a
2-week-old offensive that already has sent an estimated one-seventh
of the nation's people fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks, buses and vans commandeered by the government poured
into the grounds of a school 22 miles south of the capital Sunday,
disgorging hundreds of women and children, each carrying a bulging
bag or two of their belongings.
</P>
<P>
   Boys clambered off the high-paneled, open-backed trucks first.
Parcels, babies and women -- clasping their skirts to protect their
modesty -- followed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have only these pieces of clothes,'' said 70-year-old
Bisrat Berhe. Her son was fighting on the front, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The primary school grounds -- deserted the day before -- held at
least 18,000 people Sunday morning, with 6,000 more arrivals
expected by day's end.
</P>
<P>
   The civilians fled ahead of Ethiopia's artillery and
aircraft-backed pursuit of Eritrean forces retreating from the two
countries' disputed border.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea said last week that the fighting already had uprooted
555,000 of its 4 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Punished by the offensive, Eritrea agreed to withdraw from all
disputed territory and to talks due to start Monday in Algiers on
resolving the neighbors' 2-year-old war over their ill-delineated
border in the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia, however, says it will keep up its attack until it is
satisfied Eritrea has indeed withdrawn from all land Ethiopia
claims as its own.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning, Ethiopian warplanes bombed a nearly completed
power plant near the port city of Massawa, Eritrea's Foreign
Ministry said, calling the attack ''vandalism and senseless
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia late Saturday accused Eritrea of launching an offensive
from one of the points from which it had promised to withdraw,
saying the countries' artillery gunners exchanged fire at the
eastern town of Bure.
</P>
<P>
   In Asmara, Eritrea's capital, presidential spokesman Yemane
Gebremeskel reported fighting on all fronts Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was also the ninth anniversary overthrow of the military
regime that once ruled Ethiopia, which in 1991 still included the
province of Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians rallied in their capital,
Addis Ababa, celebrating both the anniversary and victories in the
ongoing offensive in Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans of the 1930s guerrilla war against Italian dictator
Benito Mussolini's forces stood alongside armed units in a central
square, watching warplanes away from the front perform aerobatic
rolls overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ''The invading Eritrean forces have been demolished,'' President
Negasso Ghidada told the elated crowd, listing cities and
territories retaken after being captured by Eritrea earlier.

<HEADLINE> Indian Leader Opens China Visit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- India's president arrived in China's capital
Sunday, opening a weeklong visit to bolster relations between the
often uneasy Asian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   President Kocheril Raman Narayanan was greeted at Beijing's
airport by Chinese Foreign Ministry officials and groups of
expatriate Indian children waving Indian flags.
</P>
<P>
   Narayanan's formal agenda begins Monday with an honor guard
review in Tiananmen Square and talks with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin. He will also meet Prime Minister Zhu Rongji and National
People's Congress Chairman Li Peng during his stay, the United News
of India news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The visit will carry forward attempts by India and China to
soothe years of bitterness by holding dialogue on key issues.
</P>
<P>
   India and China fought a 21-day war in 1962 and have been
holding talks since 1988 to settle a boundary dispute. There has
been no breakthrough in 12 rounds of discussions, although the two
sides last month agreed to accelerate the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions caused by the territorial dispute have been compounded
by rivalry between the two for influence in Asia. For much of the
past 50 years, China has forged close relations with Pakistan,
India's nemesis, to offset Indian power.
</P>
<P>
   But desire for stability on its southwestern flank and fears of
an Indian-Pakistani nuclear arms race have caused Beijing to take a
more evenhanded approach, while still favoring Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   Narayanan also plans to meet with agriculture and industry
experts and travel to the northeastern port of Dalian and the
southwestern city of Kunming. Two-way trade between Indian and
China is valued at $2 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Narayanan, whose position as president is largely ceremonial,
first visited China in 1994 when he was vice president. He also
served as India's ambassador to China in the 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Teens Throw Stones at Israel Border  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN SEVAREID
<TEXT>
<P>
   KFAR KILA, Lebanon (AP) -- Lebanese and Palestinian teens threw
stones at an Israeli army border post and one attempted to climb
the frontier fence Sunday, drawing shots that caused at least three
slight injuries amid growing tension after Israel's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   A boy was hit in the back by what appeared to be a rubber bullet
fired by the Israelis at the border some 50 miles south of Beirut.
A man in his 20s, said to be a supporter of the Lebanese Amal
guerrilla group, was carried away with a minor wound in his right
leg after more shots rang out.
</P>
<P>
   About four soldiers emerged from the post later, pointed their
rifles toward the crowd and fired up to five shots, injuring one
more person in the leg. Witnesses said a fourth person was hurt but
that could not be independently determined.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army would not immediately comment on the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Lebanese, guerrillas and civilians, have been
converging on the border fence at Kfar Kila since Israeli troops
hastily withdrew Wednesday from Lebanon after an 18-year
occupation. Guerrillas quickly moved in to fill the vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   People have come to look across at Israel, a country many have
never seen, or to vent their anger. Others have tossed bottles and
firebombs, prompting Israeli soldiers to fire shots in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's trouble at the border began when about 10 teen-age boys
from a crowd that sometimes swelled to about 500 ran back and forth
at the fence, collecting stones to launch at a building that once
served as an Israeli border crossing before Israel slammed shut the
gates upon its army's pullout from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Some stones hit the roof or bounced back on a metal fence
surrounding the two-story building amid shouts of ''We're coming.
We're coming'' or ''Barak tell the truth. Are you scum or not?''
The Israeli prime minister is Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are our enemies and are still in Palestine,'' said
Youssef al-Mamoun, a 20-year-old Palestinian, as he headed toward
the fence with a stone in each hand.
</P>
<P>
   About four busloads of Palestinian refugees had come down to the
border fence to join the Lebanese. A Palestinian flag flew among
many Lebanese guerrilla and national flags.
</P>
<P>
   Mahmoud Ahmed, 13, criticized stone-throwers. ''They are not
acting civilized. I am not with Israel but they should not be
throwing stones. They got out of our land,'' he said, adding that
his concern was ''maybe some Israeli soldier will ... shoot
someone.''
</P>
<P>
   The injured boy was identified by his relatives as 15-year-old
Fadi Nemeh, a Palestinian. Blood trickled from his back as he
walked away but his injury appeared to be light.
</P>
<P>
   Without U.N. peacekeepers and Lebanese troops, who are yet to
deploy on the border, tension has been growing in the past few
days. Israel complained to the U.N. peacekeeping command, which
sent a patrol on Saturday to keep people away but the U.N. patrol
later left.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli soldiers have been keeping people away from their side
of the fence and Barak said Sunday that the army will only fire in
self defense or for rescue missions on the tense border.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah said in an interview
Saturday that the demonstrations at the border were to be expected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, the Israelis have been showering us with bombs and
shells for more than 20 years. Let them tolerate this,'' he said
with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel Sunday, Barak told his Cabinet that more than 90
percent of the Chebaa farms border area will not be evacuated
because it is not in Lebanese territory, according to U.N. maps.
Lebanon has called for a complete evacuation of the area and
Hezbollah has warned it will continue attacks unless troops leave
the farms.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the army completed an evacuation of two outposts in
the Chebaa farms region, north of Israel's border.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's office also denied media reports that Hezbollah and the
Israeli army had reached a temporary cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army continued round-the-clock construction to
finish fortifications along the international border, setting up
fences, putting up warning signs and establishing roads, at some
points only a few yards from Israeli communities.

<HEADLINE> Contributions Slow for Nazi Fund  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The German envoy to talks setting up a fund to
compensate Nazi-era forced and slave laborers criticized the slow
pace at which German firms were signing up to contribute Sunday,
but said he remained confident the money would be raised.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in the Welt am Sonntag newspaper, Otto
Lambsdorff called for striking a clause from the law being drafted
for the $4.8 billion fund, under which it would only come into
effect once the full amount has been collected.
</P>
<P>
   Lambsdorff said that was ''not acceptable'' because it could
delay the payments to victims, which the German government hopes to
begin this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we presume that the German industry holds to its promise --
and it will hold to it -- then we can also let the law take effect''
without requiring that all the money first be there, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,260 companies have so far pledged about $1.4 billion of
the $2.4 billion it has to raise. The other half is to come from
the German government.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from the governing coalition worried the cash-strapped
government could be forced to come up with more than its half if it
strikes the clause and business doesn't hit its target.
</P>
<P>
   ''Legislators should not get into a situation that could bring
new risks to the budget,'' lawmaker Volker Beck said.
</P>
<P>
   Lambsdorff again criticized the slow pace of firms signing up.
Only about half of the country's 1,000 biggest firms have joined.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hesitation is damaging the image of German industry,''
Lambsdorff said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was optimistic that talks with representatives of the
U.S. government and other parties this week would resolve one of
the last remaining issues holding up the deal: the question of
legal protection for German firms against lawsuits from Holocaust
victims.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has agreed to prepare a ''statement
of interest'' to be submitted in any U.S. court dealing with such a
lawsuit, expressing the U.S. government's position that such claims
should best be directed to the compensation fund for settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Lambsdorff said the ''crunch point'' is that Washington wants
the statement to explicitly say that it is not legally binding, due
to the constitutional separation of powers.
</P>
<P>
   The German side would prefer the point be left unaddressed to
avoid making the statement look weak, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lambsdorff doubted the final declaration would be ready until
late June, despite hopes President Clinton and German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder could sign it during Clinton's visit to Berlin
this week.

<HEADLINE> Sitting All Day Can Be Bad for Back  </HEADLINE>
By IRA DREYFUSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- White collar life can be bad for the back.
Sitting all day at a desk, not working out, and then maybe golfing
on the weekend is just asking for trouble, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sitting position maximizes pressure on the lumbar discs in
the lower back, and that leads to back problems in adults,'' said
Dr. Vijay Vad of the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City.
''Unfortunately, because of the twisting motion of the back, golf
falls into the high risk category for low back problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have to suffer through a day at the office when they
are not golfing make their problems worse by not doing exercises to
strengthen the muscles of the lower torso, said Vad, who works with
touring pros in the Professional Golfers Association and the
Association of Tennis Professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that the discs do not circulate blood
through veins and arteries, but get their nutrients through fluid
circulation that comes as the back moves, said Dr. Vert Mooney, an
orthopedic surgeon at the University of California, San Diego.
Sitting still can't be counted on to provide enough fluid
circulation, he said. The lack of nutrient movement in, and waste
movement out, reduces the discs' ability to maintain healthy
strength, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Office workers would be better off thinking of sitting as an
athletic activity, in which they put the weight of their upper body
on their lower back -- maybe then, they'd prepare for it, Vad said.
''One of the things you can't afford not to do is simple stretching
exercises for the lower back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most cases of low back pain go away within a few weeks, but the
problem affects many people. Over 2 million people seek care each
year for lower back pain, said Vad and a fellow doctor at the
Manhattan hospital, Leon Root.
</P>
<P>
   Root and Vad say 15 minutes of abdominal, back, hamstring and
gluteal exercise a day can help people avoid or reduce the risk of
back problems. Among the exercises are leg extensions and partial
situps. Other exercises also can be valuable, and these include
weight training 2 or 3 times a week, Mooney said.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise can help people who have injured their backs avoid
doing it again, the doctors said. Studies of first-time back pain
patients in Australia found that people who did not exercise
regularly after their injury had an 80 percent chance of needing
more medical care, compared with only 20 percent of exercisers,
Mooney said.
</P>
<P>
   Weekend athletes, especially golfers, face additional problems.
The twisting motion of a golf swing is just what people with back
problems don't need, the doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   And golfers with poor swings make things even worse for
themselves, Vad said. A bad swing relies mostly on the upper body,
and twists at the waist, while a good one draws power from the legs
up, he said. In a good swing, the lower back just transmits power
instead of initiating it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden starts, stops and twists of tennis also can cause
problems, but they are less common, the doctors said. ''Tennis is
(a sport) of moderate risk,'' Vad said.
</P>
<P>
   Root also warns that bowling can be bad for the back of those
who are not experienced bowlers. The unevenness of the throw,
caused by the heavy weight that results from having the ball in one
hand, can lead to lower back problems, he said. However, horseback
riding seems safe enough, as does baseball, unless the player tries
to put too much into the swing, Root said.

<HEADLINE> Ficus for Congress: A campaign rooted in satire   </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A team of candidates for Congress, deeply
rooted in the environment, is trying to strike a blow this election
year against the power of incumbency.
</P>
<P>
   The challenger in one Pennsylvania campaign traveled the
district on a ''listening tour.'' In Georgia, a candidate felt at
home at the grand opening of a greenhouse. A Texas candidate sports
a cowboy hat, while one in South Carolina posed outside Bob Jones
University.
</P>
<P>
   And a candidate in New Jersey had no comment after the state
Board of Elections refused to accept its petition for a spot on the
ballot under the slogan, ''Because a Potted Plant Can Do No Harm.''
</P>
<P>
   If 1992 was the ''year of the woman'' in congressional
elections, some people want 2000 to be the year of the ficus.
Mobilized by satirist Michael Moore, whose documentary ''Roger &AMP;
Me'' assailed General Motors Corp. for closing its plant in Flint,
Mich., political skeptics across the country have signed up to seek
write-in votes for trees from the family ficus.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm doing this because the American people no longer show up
to vote,'' Moore said during a campaign appearance in April for the
tree challenging Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J. ''The majority
of people feel they have no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ficus trees are being offered as candidates in three House
districts in Alabama, one in Arkansas, two in California, one in
Illinois, one in New Jersey, one in New York, two in North
Carolina, one in Ohio, two in Pennsylvania, one in South Carolina,
three in Texas, four in Virginia and one in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   One senator, Republican Craig Thomas of Wyoming, has ficus
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 23 House ficus campaigns, 21 target Republicans. Another
is against Rep. Virgil Goode of Virginia, who switched his
affiliation in January from Democrat to independent. The other is
for the seat being vacated by retiring Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the evident political slant, the campaign was designed
to challenge veterans in both parties who draw little or no
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Voters have stopped going to the polls because today's
politicians -- Republicans and Democrats -- all stand for pretty much
the same things,'' reads the first plank in the ficus platform.
''The ficus campaign has recaptured voters' imagination in a way no
other candidate can, by offering a real choice: politician or
potted plant.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign volunteers say they see the effort as a lark, but one
with a message.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Cook of State College, Pa., said she was ''really
disappointed'' when she learned that Republican Rep. John Peterson
of Pennsylvania had no Democratic opposition this year. So she and
her husband Sean volunteered to host a ficus campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that people need to know that even when an incumbent
is running unopposed, they do have a choice,'' said Cook, who works
at Penn State University.
</P>
<P>
   Lorne Wolfe, an associate professor of biology at Georgia
Southern University, is helping run the ficus campaign against
Republican Rep. Jack Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a plant biologist,'' he said, ''I was glad to see that
(Moore) chose a plant to represent an alternative for the voting
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Seeman, who is running the ficus campaign in Ohio against
Republican Rep. Ralph Regula, said his campaign theory is simple:
''Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it would be better to have a potted plant
represent us in Congress, but I certainly don't see how it could be
worse,'' said Seeman, field representative for a national radio
syndicator.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbents targeted by the ficus have responded in the spirit of
the campaign. Kingston pledged to ''keep my feet firmly planted in
the issues'' affecting his district in Georgia. Frelinghuysen said
his ficus opponent is ''truly green when it comes to politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The ficus campaign is taking place largely on the Internet,
through a home page set up by Moore. The campaign last week sent
supporters an e-mail asking them to film footage of their ficus in
campaign mode, for use on Moore's cable television show, ''The
Awful Truth.''
</P>
<P>
   One supporter posted a message on the web site wondering, ''What
will happen if one of the Ficus actually wins?''
</P>
<P>
   Not a problem, replied a fellow ficus fan, who said he watches
C-SPAN and notices members talking among themselves while a
colleague is addressing the House.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least the ficus will be quiet while others have the
floor,'' he wrote.

<HEADLINE> A new approach to getting rid of old tires  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GORMLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Environmental activism and business
development would be combined under a new proposal to rid New York
state of the growing, silent threat of old tire dumps.
</P>
<P>
   A bill making its way through the state Legislature would
promote the development of stable, private-sector tire recyclers by
providing them with state grants and other government assistance.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a company that already manufactures asphalt for
road surfaces could receive a grant to buy equipment that would
allow recycled tires to be incorporated into its paving materials,
the bill's sponsors say.
</P>
<P>
   Those businesses would be fueled by old tires in individual
sites in Suffolk, Saratoga, Chenango, Oswego, Erie and Chautauqua
counties. Sites with 100,000 or more tires each are found in
Ulster, Columbia, Rensselaer, Albany, Wyoming and Cattaraugus
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Most other counties also have smaller scrap tire stockpiles,
said Assemblywoman Audrey Hochberg, a Westchester Democrat and
chairwoman of the Assembly Solid Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In all, it is estimated that between 25 million and 40 million
old tires have been dumped, mostly illegally, in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mosquitos breed in scrap tries at an unbelievable rate,''
Hochberg said. ''Mosquitos, the only known source for transmission
of the West Nile Virus, reproduce at a rate up to 4,000 times
greater in scrap tire piles than in their natural environment ...
and there is an inability for pesticides to penetrate the tire
stockpile.''
</P>
<P>
   The virus has killed seven people in New York City and infected
1,900 people in Queens alone, state and federal health officials
said. The water in scrap tires prompts the fast breeding of
mosquitos while sheltering them from natural predators.
</P>
<P>
   ''The recycling of scrap tires has not kept pace with the
production of new scrap tires,'' said state Sen. Carl Marcellino, a
Long Island Republican and chairman of the Senate's committee on
the environment. ''The resulting waste tire piles create two
potential hazards -- tire fires and mosquito infestation.''
</P>
<P>
   Tire fires are a particular environmental hazard.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, a tire fire in the picturesque Greene County town of
Catskill created a canopy of thick, toxic smoke for months. The
acrid smoke from this and seven other major tire fires in New York
since 1994 have threatened air and water. The fires can burn for as
long as a year and toxins generated by the blazes can seep into the
water supply for years afterward.
</P>
<P>
   David Higby of Environmental Advocates said shredded tires can
be recycled in ''any number'' of new products, if the proper
assistance is provided to businesses to make it worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Higby is also part of a statewide committee of tire industry
leaders and environmentalists that helped create the legislation
now before the Legislature That 2-year-old partnership is why he
believes the measure has a strong shot at becoming law in these
last few weeks of the 2000 legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   ''This legislation takes us forward towards a comprehensive plan
to manage both the stream of new scrap tires and the clean-up of
the scrap tire dumps that plague our state,'' Marcellino said.

<HEADLINE> State to require safety course for all 'Jet Ski' riders  </HEADLINE>
By L. ANNE NEWELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- People thinking about hitting the water on
''Jet Skis'' in New York will have to hit the books first under new
guidelines from the state parks department.
</P>
<P>
   The rules will require anyone who wants to use a personal
watercraft, more popularly known by the trademark ''Jet Ski'' name,
pass a daylong boating safety course taught by a certified
instructor.
</P>
<P>
   The office cited an increasing number of fatal accidents
involving personal watercraft in implementing the guidelines last
week. The Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation was
mandated to implement the guidelines by the state Legislature,
which passed a broader law to require the move two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dominic Jacangelo, director of Marine, Coastal and Legislative
Program Development for the office, said it has taken two years to
develop the education program since it will involve so many people.
He said there are 50,000 personal watercraft in New York and
estimated there are twice as many personal watercraft operators.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York will have the largest education program for personal
watercraft operators in the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fruition of the law pleased lawmakers, including Assemblyman
Harvey Weisenberg. Weisenberg, a Long Island Democrat who is also a
lifeguard, sponsored the measure in the Assembly when it passed in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel very strongly that this legislation is going to save
people's lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Weisenberg also cautioned the guidelines will only be as
effective as their enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Parks officials say that while personal watercraft comprise only
10 percent of vessels registered in New York, they are involved in
30 percent of waterway accidents. The office says inexperience and
lack of training are the main cause of personal watercraft
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines take effect incrementally; this year, any person
aged 10 to 19 will have to take the test, as minors have had to do
for more than 30 years. Children younger than 10 are not allowed to
operate personal watercrafts.
</P>
<P>
   By 2001, anyone under 23 will take the test; by 2002, it is 27;
by 2003, it is 31 and by 2004, potential riders of all ages will
have to spend a day in a classroom before getting their day in the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   The courses will be offered through the parks department, but
others can apply to become teachers. The classes will be free, but
a permanent certificate stating people passed the course will cost
adults $10, which will go toward funding the program. The fee will
be waived for children.
</P>
<P>
   The department estimates private instructors will charge between
$30 and $80 for classes and ''well more'' than 100,000 people will
have taken a safety course through 2004.
</P>
<P>
   People who are caught operating personal watercraft without
passing the class will be subject to a series of fines. A
first-time offender faces a fine of between $25 and $100 and up to
seven days in jail. A person caught twice within two years faces a
fine up between $100 and $200 and up to 15 days in jail. A person
caught three times within two years faces a fine of between $200
and $500 and up to 30 days in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''Year by year, our recreational boating report gives clear and
convincing information that personal watercraft accidents occur
because of the inexperience of the operator,'' Jacangelo said. ''We
know we can overcome inexperience through education.''

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Guerrillas Focus on Farms  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN SEVAREID
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEBAA, Lebanon (AP) -- A fertile patch of rolling hills once
prized most by farmers and cigarette smugglers on mules could be
the rallying point for reigniting a battle that has taken two
decades to quell.
</P>
<P>
   The Chebaa farms, a strip of land tucked into the western
foothills of Mount Hermon between Lebanon and the Israeli-annexed
Golan Heights, remains disputed territory in a region trying to
redefine borders that all sides can tolerate. Guerrillas whose
roadside bombings and rockets finally wore out Israel's will to
stay in south Lebanon have warned Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
to be wary as long as his forces are there.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian and Lebanese governments also want Israeli troops to
turn the Chebaa farms over to Lebanon as part of their pullout from
the country's south, completed last week after 22 years of
operating in or occupying the area. But Israel has said it won the
land from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war and is not obligated to
give it to Lebanon -- a position accepted by the United Nations as
it takes on the task of confirming a complete Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah did not say whether a
continued Israeli presence in Chebaa farms would be enough on its
own to prompt an attack by his guerrillas, but he has called on
Barak to remove his troops.
</P>
<P>
   ''The farms of Chebaa will return to Lebanon. The days will
prove that,'' Nasrallah told 30,000 jubilant supporters at a rally
last week in the former occupied zone in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Fertile ground for barley, fruits and vegetables, the area's
location at the corner where Syria, Israel and Lebanon meet also
has made it an ancient route for smuggling. In recent decades, it
was known as a path for smuggled cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   As U.N. envoy Terje Roed-Larsen has noted, Lebanon and Syria,
which politically and militarily dominates its smaller neighbor,
haven't designated an international border at Chebaa. To residents
of Chebaa village, the agricultural land on its outskirts is
Lebanese -- many say their families have deeds to property there.
</P>
<P>
   There are no accurate figures on the size of the Chebaa farms,
but Lebanese press reports said 13 farms stretch about 15 miles
long and five miles wide. They run along Mount Hermon's western
foothills between Chebaa and the village of Kfar Chouba to the
south.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's withdrawal from the surrounding area has allowed
Lebanese close enough to see into Chebaa farms through a
barbed-wire fence. Though many came to take a look in the heady
days following Israel's withdrawal and to congratulate each other
on what is viewed as a guerrilla triumph over Israel, some
residents said the occupation isn't quite over.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can congratulate me when we're 100 percent free,'' said
Raed Hashem, a 36-year-old goat herder who said his family owns 11
acres in the Chebaa farms.

<HEADLINE> Hollywood On Pace for Record year  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Force is not with Hollywood this year.
Movie-goers do not seem to mind, though, as they continue shelling
out record bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into its busiest season, the industry has a good head
start on breaking its box office revenue record for a third
straight year, without the benefit of a mega-blockbuster ''Star
Wars'' flick. Revenues are up 9 percent from the same time last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the lower-profile lineup of movies this
summer can collectively match last year's torrid pace. A record 12
movies released between May 1999 and early September hit $100
million, while the overall box office from Memorial Day to Labor
Day last year was an all-time high of nearly $3 billion. Two
surprise hits alone, ''The Blair Witch Project'' and ''The Sixth
Sense,'' accounted for 10 percent of the summer total.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood was in a box office funk until about this time last
year, when ''Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' set off a
flurry of film-going that resulted in a record $7.5 billion in
movie grosses for 1999. ''Phantom Menace'' took in $431 million
domestically.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the industry enters its busy summer season a step
ahead of 1999. Through May 21, U.S. audiences had spent $2.44
billion on movie tickets, up from $2.25 billion in the same period
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year, the months of May, June, July and August all were
record months,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor
Relations, which tracks movie ticket sales. ''That's tough to beat,
but the year looks good so far.''
</P>
<P>
   While revenues are up, movie attendance remains far below
Hollywood's heyday of the 1930s and 1940s. Still, movie attendance
climbed through much of the 1990s, and audiences the last two years
have been the largest since the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year, when blockbusters such as ''The Matrix'' and
''The Mummy'' dominated the pre-summer period, the wealth has been
spread among a slate of more modestly successful films. Two
pictures, ''Gladiator'' and ''Erin Brockovich,'' have hit $100
million this year, while many others have delivered respectable
returns, including ''Scream 3,'' ''The Whole Nine Yards,'' ''Next
Friday,'' ''Snow Day,'' ''Romeo Must Die,'' ''Rules of Engagement''
and ''U-571.''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks' ''Gladiator'' and Disney's ''Dinosaur'' kicked May
into high gear, with Tom Cruise's ''Mission: Impossible 2'' close
on their heels. Cruise's caper opened Wednesday, taking in $80
million in its first five days, distributor Paramount estimated
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you think of 'Gladiator,' 'Dinosaur' and 'Mission:
Impossible,' that's a fairly strong month of May,'' said Walter
Parkes, co-head of DreamWorks Pictures, the studio's movie
division. ''Let's just hope it carries over into summer.''
</P>
<P>
   While nothing has quite the hype ''Phantom Menace'' did in 1999,
this summer has solid prospects with Nicolas Cage in ''Gone in 60
Seconds''; Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer in ''What Lies
Beneath''; Mel Gibson in the flesh for ''The Patriot'' and by voice
in the animated ''Chicken Run''; Samuel L. Jackson in ''Shaft'';
Jim Carrey in ''Me, Myself &AMP; Irene''; George Clooney in ''The
Perfect Storm''; Eddie Murphy in ''Nutty Professor II: The
Klumps''; and those comic-book mutants in ''X-men.''
</P>
<P>
   Other high-profile movies include ''The Adventures of Rocky and
Bullwinkle,'' featuring Robert De Niro; Clint Eastwood and Tommy
Lee Jones in ''Space Cowboys''; Keanu Reeves in the football comedy
''The Replacements''; and ''Pokemon The Movie 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sleeper hits likely will crop up. Kevin Bacon's
invisible-scientist turn in ''Hollow Man'' includes visceral
special effects that could help the movie catch fire.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, no one saw ''The Sixth Sense'' coming, with Bruce
Willis working with a boy who saw dead people. This summer, Willis
is paired with another boy in ''Disney's The Kid,'' a comedy that
could break out in a summer that's light on funny family films.
</P>
<P>
   Theater owners are counting on summer's diverse lineup to pack
in the crowds. A building boom by cinema developers has been
credited for drawing audiences back to movies, but it also has left
theater chains burdened with debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we will have a third straight record year in terms of
total grosses,'' said John Fithian, president of the National
Association of Theatre Owners. ''We need to, frankly, because we
have more screens than we've ever had before.''

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Rebels Free Captives  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Rebels released 30 U.N. hostages
Sunday, boosting hopes that the remaining personnel being held
captive in Sierra Leone would be freed soon.
</P>
<P>
   The development brought the number of remaining U.N. captives to
fewer than 100 from about 500 initially captured in early May. Some
143 hostages were flown Friday and Saturday from Monrovia to
Freetown, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said the 30, all Zambians, were
flown to the Liberian capital of Monrovia. Liberian officials said
they had arrived from the remote northeastern Sierra Leonean town
of Pendemu, where rebels handed them over.
</P>
<P>
   Wimhurst said more would be freed soon.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in military uniforms and clutching bottles of mineral
water, the former hostages expressed relief and joy. Most were in
good physical condition, although some were being treated for
malaria, minor injuries and fatigue, Liberian medical officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel very happy. I thought we were never going to reach this
place. Thank God we are here,'' said Lance Cpl. Elias Mwanza, who
suffered from a swollen jaw and other injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Mwanza said some of the captors had tormented the hostages while
others were more kind and promised not to kill them ''because we
are their African brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Pvt. Goma Justin, who had deep cuts on his foot from stepping on
broken glass, described his captivity as ''rough.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the releases, fighting between rebels and pro-government
forces was reported over the weekend at the strategic crossroads of
Rogberi Junction, about 50 miles east of Freetown, Wimhurst said.
He had no further details.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-government forces were advancing along the road east from
Rogberi Junction to Lunsar, Lt. Col. Sam Mboma said at a news
briefing Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, West African heads of state were gathering for
weekend meetings in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, to discuss the
crisis in Sierra Leone. Informal talks were held Saturday and with
the main gathering was being held Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have killed tens of thousands of people and
intentionally mutilated many more during the 8-year-old civil war.
The conflict reignited earlier this month when the Revolutionary
United Front rebels took the U.N. peacekeepers hostage and began
advancing toward Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a ragtag alliance of pro-government forces has tried
to push the rebels away from the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Associated Press Television News cameraman Miguel Gil Moreno de
Mora and Reuters correspondent Kurt Schork were killed Wednesday in
a rebel ambush. South African cameraman Mark Chisholm and Greek
photographer Yannis Behrakis suffered light injuries in the same
attack.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Has Chance To Show Strength  </HEADLINE>
By EARLEEN FISHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- With the departure of the last Israeli
occupation troops, the Lebanese government has its first chance in
decades to show authority throughout its own country and, perhaps,
even become a partner instead of a pawn in regional politics.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it takes the opportunity -- not to mention the land
vacated last week by Israel -- depends upon how, or even whether, it
can cut through a complicated knot of internal and external
realities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are on the edge of a new era. It can be something
completely positive for Lebanon, and it can be something completely
dark for Lebanon,'' said Gebran Tueni, publisher of An-Nahar, the
most independent newspaper in Lebanon. ''Everything is moving.
That's why everything is so dangerous. That's why we are really on
a turning point where anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The unquestioned power in this nation is and will remain Syria,
the authoritarian regime that wraps around Lebanon's northern and
eastern borders. Syrian soldiers have been stationed in Lebanon
since 1976, nominally as a deterrent but also as a participant in
the civil war that raged from 1975 until 1990. They now number
about 30,000. In the last few years, the number of Syrian laborers
injected into Lebanon, population 4 million, has swelled to as many
as a million during peak demand.
</P>
<P>
   But something unique happened last week when Hezbollah
guerrillas -- the Shiite Muslim spearhead whose attacks weakened
Israeli resolve to remain in Lebanon -- moved into border villages
vacated by Israel's army and its quick-to-evaporate militia allies
of the Christian-led South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah's backing comes from Syria and Iran, but the
guerrillas who fought the Israelis and took over the border zone
when they left were Lebanese, saluted even by the Lebanese
government as liberators acting in the national interest. Lebanon
has seen scores of militias seize territory over the years, but
rarely, if ever, have any of them showed so much discipline after
victory.
</P>
<P>
   There have been spots of looting in Christian villages dotting
Shiite-majority south Lebanon since the Israelis pulled out last
Wednesday, but -- despite the killing of a Christian man by a
guerrilla on Sunday -- there have been none of the bloody vengeance
attacks and massacres that were an integral part of territorial
turnovers in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Such restraint could give Hezbollah a chance to increase the
seven seats it now holds in the 128-member Parliament in elections
expected later this summer. But under Lebanon's complicated
electoral system, which apportions seats geographically and then by
a variety of religious sects within each district, neither
Hezbollah nor any other single group can aspire to a majority.
</P>
<P>
   The road to Lebanon's future has a clear set of destinations,
but the timetable is uncertain. One goal is peace talks between
Syria and Israel, leading to a treaty under which Syria recovers
the Golan Heights it lost to Israel in the 1967 war. That would
clear the path for a Lebanese-Israeli peace treaty, which can
happen only after the Syrian treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need the Syrians,'' said An-Nahar commentator Sarkis Naoum,
voicing a sentiment grudgingly shared by Lebanese from many social
and sectarian backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Syrians are a stabilizing factor, and they are also a
destructive factor,'' Naoum said. ''It's in our interest to
continue the cooperation with the Syrians. But after the Israeli
withdrawal, the Syrians have no excuse to stay in Lebanon
militarily. Politically, they will stay.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Lebanese government has moved tentatively
in returning to the southern tenth of the country vacated by
Israel. About 400 Lebanese policemen have been sent to the area,
but they constitute little more than a living flag if they are not
reinforced quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, deployed just north of the
Israeli-controlled zone since 1978, has started mobile patrols
along the border while awaiting the arrival of more troops to swell
its current force of 4,500 peacekeepers to as many as 7,900.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrians, meanwhile, have a more peaceful way of using
Lebanon to pressure Israel than supporting the guerrillas who
lobbed rockets into the Jewish state. Syria could use the precedent
Israel set -- fulfilling a U.N. resolution by withdrawing from
Lebanon -- to campaign for implementation of other resolutions
calling for withdrawal from Syria's occupied Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a new tool in the Syrian negotiations,'' said Talal
Salman, publisher of As-Safir, a newspaper with close ties to
Damascus. ''Why did Israel implement U.N. resolutions in Lebanon
but not in Syria?''
</P>
<P>
   He echoed the views of others here that the international
community, including the United States, cannot allow Israel to pick
and choose which U.N. resolutions it will honor. A 1978 resolution
called for Israel to get out of Lebanon, but earlier ones in 1967
and 1973 called for Israel to return all war-won lands -- which
include the Golan.

<HEADLINE> Gene Kelly's Widow Hands Out Awards  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Patricia Ward Kelly said she didn't know who
Gene Kelly was when she met the ''Singin' in the Rain'' star in
1985, but when he later asked her to help him write his
autobiography, ''We worked together and we fell in love.''
</P>
<P>
   He was 73, she was 26. The actor's widow told a Gene Kelly
Awards ceremony in his hometown Saturday that as they worked on the
book, Kelly told her about Pittsburgh -- memories of air filled with
coal dust, dance classes at a synagogue and arguing philosophy and
politics in local taverns.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said his childhood in Pittsburgh was the greatest time in
his life, almost idyllic -- nothing ever compared to it,'' Mrs.
Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gene Kelly Awards are presented by the Pittsburgh Civil
Light Opera for excellence in high school musical theater.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will always be a very special place in his memory and now a
very special place in mine,'' she said of the city.

<HEADLINE> Mac attack: For Somers Point entrepreneur, image is everything  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMERS POINT, N.J. (AP) -- Bubba Mac is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   He's up there on the wall mural, cooking up barbecued ribs for
B.B. King, Muddy Waters and Stevie Ray Vaughan. He's over there on
the American Gothic-style T-shirts, holding a guitar by the neck,
standing alongside a smiling alligator.
</P>
<P>
   He's there on the front door of Bubba Mac Shack, his shaggy
Jerry Garcia-like visage etched into the glass.
</P>
<P>
   He's on the ersatz $1 ''Bubba Bucks'' that come attached to the
Shack's menu, right under the ''You kill it, we grill it''
inscription.
</P>
<P>
   His face is even on the rubber hand-stamp that is used to show
who has paid the cover charge.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the Jersey shore's most eccentric new club -- his
real name: Herbert Birch Jr. -- is no egotist. He knows his own
quirky image gives the club its cachet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a marketing thing,'' he says. ''Hey, it worked for
Kentucky Fried Chicken. It worked for Jerry Garcia.'' Besides:
''It's distinctive, it's easy to remember and it means I'll never
HAVE to get a haircut.''
</P>
<P>
   But the image is only an image.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the shoulder-length blond hair, the Grizzly Adams beard
and the wire-rimmed eyeglasses is a creative, well-financed
businessman who knows what sells -- and has enough backing not to
worry if it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a patent attorney, Birch started his career as an
accountant. In 1976, he founded a management consulting firm, Birch
&AMP; Davis Holdings Inc., in Silver Spring, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which provided health care management and
consulting services to governments, blossomed into a $70
million-a-year juggernaut with 900 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, he and his partner sold out in a
multimillion-dollar deal that made Birch rich. One of the first
things he did was build a bonfire, burning all his suits and ties
at once.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am no longer a suit,'' he says, wearing an open-necked
shirt, baggy pants and sandals.
</P>
<P>
   Next, he began making plans for a restaurant club combining two
of his loves -- New Orleans-style cuisine and the blues.
</P>
<P>
   He picked the Jersey shore, having spent summers in Ocean City
as child.
</P>
<P>
   Birch, his son Mac, and two other partners settled on a
14-year-old waterfront building on Bay Avenue that has been the
site of several failed restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Renaming it Bubba Mac Shack (''barbecue, seafood and blues''
reads the sign), they gutted the place and started over, aiming to
convert it into a restaurant with the best live blues music
available -- or a blues club whose menu really cooks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted a place that was upscale but down-home, a place with
a kind of split personality. It's like a casual day at the office:
You can get funky but still be treated with a certain level of
class,'' Birch says.
</P>
<P>
   The result is an eclectic hybrid of a place that offers free
lessons in swing dancing two nights a week; three stages for live
music; a second-floor deck called the Lizard Lounge, just for
sunbathing; a menu that includes crawfish etouffee, shrimp creole
and oyster po' boys; and a Sunday brunch featuring a seven-person
gospel choir, free copies of The New York Times and all the Bloody
Marys you can drink, for $22.95.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget the Bubba Mac Blues Band, an eight-man ensemble
that performs three times a week, featuring -- you guessed it --
Bubba Mac himself on guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Bubba Mac Shack opened in March and has been a huge hit, despite
breaking ranks with the other bars along Bay Avenue, which cater
almost exclusively to young people.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's done a tremendous amount of business this spring, which
is shocking because there's just not that many people around,''
said Randy Scarborough, who owns the building.
</P>
<P>
   This may be only the beginning. Birch says he hopes to build 10
similar Shacks over the next 10 years, all on the water.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll never leave the water. If you can't get there on the
inland waterway, we don't want to be there,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   There are other deals in the works, too. The Bubba Mac Blues
Band has released an 11-song CD, titled ''Road Kill.'' Birch also
plans a record label and a recording studio.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes they all succeed, but they don't have to. After all, he
says: ''I'm not underfinanced.''

<HEADLINE> Rehnquist Tells Grads To Enjoy Life  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government's highest-ranking judge
warned new law school graduates Sunday not to devote too much time
to their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, offering ''a few bits of
advice,'' said aspiring to greatness is fine. But he urged young
lawyers to ''develop a capacity to enjoy pastimes and occupations
that many can enjoy simultaneously -- love for another, being a good
parent to a child, service to your community.''
</P>
<P>
   In his commencement speech to George Washington University's
graduating law class, Rehnquist suggested that ''these other fruits
of life'' will loom large when ''each of you will undoubtedly look
back many years from now upon your lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that large law firms in big cities try to hire top
graduates, Rehnquist said high salaries and the chance to do
interesting work are the pluses.
</P>
<P>
   ''The drawbacks are the relentless demand for billable hours,
which may leave less time than one would like for a personal
life,'' according to a copy of his prepared remarks.
</P>
<P>
   In smaller law firms in smaller cities, the chief justice said,
''You will certainly receive a smaller salary. ... There will be
less novel litigation, but the chances that you will actually go to
court and try a case are probably much greater.
</P>
<P>
   ''You will have more time for your family, for civic activities
and hobbies and will be able to feel more a part of the community
in which you live.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist, 75, graduated from law school 48 years ago and served
as a Supreme Court law clerk before heading to Phoenix, where he
practiced law for 16 years. He has been a Supreme Court member
since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lawyers were not nearly as time-conscious then as they are
now,'' Rehnquist said. ''This meant that they probably earned less
money than they might have, but had a more enjoyable life.''

<HEADLINE> Portugal Has Changed Over 15 Years  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY HATTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- When President Clinton flies into Lisbon
for a three-day visit Tuesday, he will encounter a country that has
undergone deep changes since the last U.S. president paid a visit
15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan came in 1985, a time when Portugal had not yet
shaken off the legacy of Antonio Salazar's stifling 41-year
dictatorship. It also had not recovered from the decade of
political upheaval that followed Salazar's ouster in a 1974
army-led coup.
</P>
<P>
   But 1985 was a significant year for Portugal, a country of 9.9
million people on the southwestern edge of Europe that is slightly
smaller in size than the state of Indiana. That was the year
Portugal joined the European Union and embarked on a period of
fast-track economic growth driven by billions of dollars in EU
development funds from the bloc's wealthier member states.
</P>
<P>
   ''The modernization of Portuguese society has been far-reaching.
Above all, it has been extremely swift,'' University of Lisbon
sociologist Antonio Barreto said.
</P>
<P>
   By embracing EU participation, Portugal quickly shed its image
as one of Europe's stragglers. Annual average gross domestic
product per person has risen from about 50 percent of the EU
average to about 70 percent, or $10,900, over the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU.
Clinton is coming for an EU-U.S. summit in Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   Lisbon, most of all, illustrates the deep changes. As Portugal
posted annual economic growth rates of up to 6 percent in the late
1980s -- among the highest rates in the world -- sleek glass-fronted
office blocks sprung up next to the city's centuries-old and ornate
stone buildings.
</P>
<P>
   A cosmopolitan city of recently-arrived European workers and
African immigrants who came after the 1974 coup, the capital clings
to seven hills overlooking the saucer-shaped bay by the mouth of
the River Tagus. A red suspension bridge across the bay is
reminiscent of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone has profited from the new wealth. Those who
could manage it moved from Portugal's poor rural interior to the
cities, and now 40 percent of the population resides in Lisbon and
Oporto, the second-largest city. The average monthly salary is
about $555, but some in the interior still live mainly from
subsistence farming or on the minimum wage of about $266.
</P>
<P>
   The country also lags behind its wealthier EU partners in
education. Of people ages 25 to 64, only 20 percent stayed in
school until they were 18, according to the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development.
</P>
<P>
   Development was stunted under Salazar. Under the slogan
''Proudly Alone,'' he shut out foreign influences with the help of
censorship. His feared secret police repressed any opposition. Many
people emigrated in the 1950s and '60s for a better life abroad,
creating large Portuguese communities in New Jersey, France and
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar, resisting the wave of independence that swept Africa in
the 1960s, sent thousands of troops to perpetuate Portuguese rule
in its African territories: Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape
Verde, and Sao Tome and Principe.
</P>
<P>
   Decolonization and democracy finally came after the dictatorship
was toppled by a group of disgruntled army captains. But the
withdrawal was abrupt and disastrous: Cut loose, the African
countries drifted into the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   After the army coup, the Communist Party and moderate
left-wingers struggled for dominance in Portugal. The prospect of a
communist regime alarmed the country's NATO allies, including the
United States, which has kept a major air base in the Azores
islands since 1946.
</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese became weary of those political battles and now
cherish their political stability. The center-right Social
Democratic Party governed for 10 years after 1985, and now the
moderate Socialist Party is in its second term.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Portuguese experience has demonstrated that peaceful,
democratic change and progress are possible,'' President Bush said
in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Other cities have role in pier inspections  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- While Philadelphia officials have maintained
it is not the city's responsibility to inspect piers such as the
one that collapsed May 18, spilling dozens of nightclub patrons
into the Delaware River, government does take a role in other
cities to make sure such piers are structurally sound.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse killed three young women who worked at the New
Jersey State Aquarium across the Delaware in Camden, N.J.:
25-year-old DeAnn White of Philadelphia, the aquarium's public
relations manager; Jean Ferraro, 27, of Cherry Hill, the marketing
manager; and Monica Rodriguez, 22, also of Cherry Hill, N.J., who
had just finished the first day as a special events assistant.
</P>
<P>
   A check of cities with waterfront development -- such as San
Francisco; Baltimore; Norfolk, Va., and San Diego -- indicates that
many local governments assume some responsibility for the
structures, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Trenton, N.J., does not require inspections of waterfront
properties, but the South Jersey Port Corp., a quasi-state agency
that operates the cargo piers in Camden, conducts regular
inspections and was recently informed that about $6.35 million in
work is needed on their five piers, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, the port has divers inspect piers at least once a
year, and every 18 months a contract to replace old and damaged
wooden pilings is bid out to private contractors. In Norfolk, the
city hires a private firm for underwater inspections of its 300
publicly owned piers.
</P>
<P>
   In Oakland, across the bay from San Francisco, the agency
overseeing the port does the work itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do all of the underwater work,'' Juan Valerio said of the
city's inner harbor. ''It's critical for us to have our own people
down there. We're mandated by our own liability insurance to do
this. Other ports don't.''
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, the entire bayfront area is owned by the Port
of San Francisco, a state-created governmental agency. In general,
officials said, each pier is inspected underwater every two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a pretty good idea up and down the waterfront what the
conditions are,'' said Cliff Jarrard, chief engineer for the Port
of San Francisco. ''We know which are the stronger ones, which are
the weaker ones, and which are in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the city's piers were built in the 1920s, most to handle
cargo. While uses ranging from apartments to athletic clubs have
been proposed for them during the city's current waterfront
development boom, many would require structural changes underwater
for such uses, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd be very careful about a proposal on some facility that's
very old and in the past has been used to store cargo, and now
someone wants to put people on it,'' Jarrard said. The office
complex under construction at Pier One, for example, required
extensive underwater upgrading of the pier.
</P>
<P>
   The port recently ordered a permanent evacuation of three old
piers used for small offices after divers found the
steel-reinforced concrete pilings were damaged. The concrete had
eroded and the steel had rusted, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can look at them from above, and they look fine,'' Jarrard
said. ''You go below, and it's frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, Commissioner Ed McLaughlin of the city
Department of Licenses and Inspections has said the structure of
the property is the owner's responsibility, and it is the owner's
responsibility to correct any problems.
</P>
<P>
   The city also has not required pier owners and developers to
provide proof that they had inspected the structures but has now
asked the owners of the 180 piers on the Delaware River to submit
inspection reports from private engineering firms by the end of
June.
</P>
<P>
   The department and Philadelphia police are investigating the
collapse of Pier 34, and the district attorney's office Friday
announced plans to convene a grand jury to determine whether
criminal charges should be filed in connection with the accident.

<HEADLINE> Ban on Palestinian Cities Lifted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli army on Sunday lifted a ban on the
entry of Israelis and foreign tourists to three Palestinians cities
in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The ban was imposed May 21 after a 2-year-old Israeli girl was
badly burned by a firebomb while riding in a car through the West
Bank city of Jericho. The child is still in intensive care a week
later, a hospital official said.
</P>
<P>
   The firebomb incident followed the worst clashes in years
between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian demonstrators calling for
the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
   After the firebombing, the Israeli army banned Israeli civilians
and foreign tourists from entering all Palestinian cities in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. The army cited security reasons, but
Palestinian security chief Jebril Rajoub said it was collective
punishment aimed at harming the Palestinian economy.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the ban was lifted from the cities of Nablus, Jenin
and Qalqilya. It had already been lifted in Jericho.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it remains in force in Ramallah, Tulkarm, Bethlehem and
Hebron, except for the small part of Hebron still controlled by
Israel. It also continues in Gaza City and in Khan Yunis and Rafah,
also in the Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Rebels Reject Crisis Offer  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- The leader of rebels holding the former prime
minister and 30 others hostage in Fiji on Sunday rejected an offer
to end the crisis -- but said there could be a peaceful resolution
within days.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel leader George Speight said he expects a new offer within
two days that could lead to the release of the captives. He told
Australian television that he ''would not be surprised if it is
over this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, late Sunday in the Fijian capital of Suva, 200 rebel
supporters, some carrying guns, defied roadblocks, vandalized a
local television station and fired shots into the air.
</P>
<P>
   A police officer died from gunshot wounds Sunday night, a
hospital spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity. It was unclear
when or where he was shot, and the death could not be immediately
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to end the 10-day crisis, President Ratu Sir
Kamisese Mara on Saturday fired the democratically elected
government and said the rebels would likely be granted immunity
from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   But Speight rejected the offer, insisting Mara resign and that
Fiji's 1997 constitution, which indigenous Fijians blame for giving
too much power to the nation's ethnic Indian minority, be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Mara, a figurehead who normally holds little government power,
said he would appoint a caretaker administration by Monday and rule
the Pacific nation until then through state-of-emergency powers.
</P>
<P>
   Speight and about 60 gunmen have been holding Prime Minister
Mahendra Chaudhry and more than 30 members of his government
hostage since storming the parliament compound on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry, elected last year, is the country's first leader from
its minority Fijians of Indian ancestry. Speight claims to be
acting on behalf of the Pacific island nation's majority indigenous
Fijians, and wants to reduce the powers that Indians can hold in
the government.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter for Australian television who was allowed briefly to
visit Chaudhry said he saw no signs of physical abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, rebel guards holding automatic weapons opened
the gates of parliament to let in some 1,500 supporters for a
90-minute Methodist church service. Afterward, Speight stood for 10
minutes shaking hands with supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Main trading partner Australia as well as New Zealand, the
United States and the United Nations have condemned any deal that
replaces the elected government as giving in to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign nations have threatened to impose economic and
diplomatic sanctions. Mara warned that Fiji's main industries of
sugarcane growing and tourism would collapse under sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to face not only purgatory, but hell,'' Mara
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji Hoteliers Associated president Hafiz Khan said
cancellations had skyrocketed since the crisis began, following
government advisories in Australia, New Zealand and the United
States that travelers avoid Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will slowly grind the tourism industry to a halt,'' Khan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji, which had two bloodless coups in 1987, is an island nation
in the Pacific 2,250 miles northeast of Sydney. Fijians of Indian
ancestry make up 44 percent of the population of 813,000, while
indigenous Fijians account for 51 percent.

<HEADLINE> NY County Is Lyme Disease Hot Spot  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL
<TEXT>
<P>
   RED HOOK, N.Y. (AP) -- This is a place where hikers wear long
pants on the hottest days, a place with its own Lyme disease hot
line and Lyme disease walk-in clinic.
</P>
<P>
   This is a place where tick-eating hens patrol front lawns, and
where full-body tick inspections are a standard evening routine.
</P>
<P>
   This is Dutchess County, a national hot spot for Lyme disease.
Last year, 1,385 cases were reported in this leafy Hudson Valley
county 60 miles north of New York City. A lot more cases could
result this summer -- the prime Lyme season -- because of a bumper
crop of the deer ticks that spread the disease.
</P>
<P>
   If that weren't bad enough, residents are bracing for the
potential spread of the mosquito-borne West Nile virus from the
metropolitan area. People accustomed to watching where they walk
are now watching the skies with trepidation, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''My concern is people will be afraid to go out,'' said Barbara
Butler, who walks local woods regularly with a local bird club.
</P>
<P>
   Lyme disease, which can cause fever, fatigue, headaches and
arthritis-like symptoms, has been a scourge of many suburban areas
surrounding New York City through the 1990s. Reported cases in
Dutchess over that time have skyrocketed. The Centers for Disease
Control does not yet have county breakdowns for last year, but
Dutchess topped all counties nationwide in 1998 with 1,537 reported
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Dutchess County a Lyme disease hot spot?
</P>
<P>
   Blame geography, experts say. Deer and white-tailed mice, which
ticks latch on to, are plentiful in the county's many pockets of
undeveloped land. The local suburbs often stand on the edge of
those fields and woods.
</P>
<P>
   The result: plenty of interaction between ticks and humans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's getting to the point in Dutchess County where just about
everyone knows a neighbor or friend who's had Lyme disease,'' said
John Nowakowski, director of the Hyde Park Lyme Disease Walk-in
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Berthold-Bond got it. So did her husband. And her
daughter. Bond, an author of books on non-toxic living, said the
short-term memory problems associated with her bout were so severe
she stuck Post-it Notes to her sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   She now avoids walking in the woods around her rural home.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very sad not to sit on the grass and to feel like you can
walk on your bare feet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Families with pets face additional worries. Raymond Winchcombe
of Verbank said it's common to feel engorged ticks under the fur of
his dog. One hunter, who didn't want his name used, recalled a
horrifying glimpse of a deer he shot last fall: ''Under his muzzle,
his neck, under his belly, on his back, he was a mass -- honest to
God -- he was a mass of ticks!''
</P>
<P>
   People still enjoy the countryside here; they just take
precautions against tick bites. Butler says members of her bird
club wear light-colored clothes and tuck their pant in their socks,
and she sprays her pants with a tick repellent.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of area residents, Butler checks herself in a
full-length mirror after coming inside, looking for ticks that can
be as small as a poppy seed.
</P>
<P>
   The Lyme disease vaccine is also popular, so much so that the
town of Poughkeepsie is considering offering Lyme disease
vaccinations to its employees.
</P>
<P>
   Other residents have taken the battle to their front lawns --
buying guinea fowl in the hopes their endless pecking will
eradicate the bugs or having their lawns sprayed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our client base for deer tick spraying has been increasing on
a regular basis over the last five years,'' said Mike Ignaffo of
Bug Busters Pest Control in Hyde Park.
</P>
<P>
   With the ticks' busy season looming, predictions of a bad year
are often based on the mild winter. David Weld of the American Lyme
Disease Foundation in Westchester County has predicted a
''horrendous'' year for the whole area.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Ostfeld of the Institute of Ecosystem Studies bases his
prediction on another indicator: acorns. A healthy local crop of
acorns in 1998 provided a feeding bonanza for mice. That meant more
mice in the summer of 1999. And that meant more mice for larval
ticks to feed on. Those are the ticks that will be out to feed this
summer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our prediction is for the highest number of cases yet for
Dutchess County,'' Ostfeld said.

<HEADLINE> Siblings separated by tragedy reunited 74 years later  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SCHNECKSVILLE, Pa. (AP) -- Irene Spitko was 8 years old on the
cold February day in 1926 when her 13-month-old brother was taken
away to be adopted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ran after him crying,'' said Spitko, who will turn 83 on
Monday. ''Many days didn't go by that I didn't wonder about him and
if he got a good home.''
</P>
<P>
   Her questions were answered Saturday, when the Reading woman was
reunited with her brother Jim Beatty, 74 years after tragedy pulled
their family apart.
</P>
<P>
   Murmuring ''after all these years,'' Jim Beatty fell into the
arms of his sister, crushing between them the bouquet of roses he
was carrying. Beatty and his wife, Dorothy, now live in Barnegat,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't believe it,'' Spitko said. ''My last memory of you was
of a strange lady carrying you out the door.''
</P>
<P>
   The reunion of the two siblings at the Schnecksville home of
Arthur Spitko, Irene's son, happened after four years of research
by Beatty's son, John Beatty and his wife, Karen. The couple
started their search after Jim Beatty received his adoption papers
when his father died.
</P>
<P>
   The papers named Beatty's birth parents and said he was born in
Bethlehem. Beatty told his son he really wanted to see a photograph
of his birth mother, Erma Waters.
</P>
<P>
   John and Karen Beatty headed to Bethlehem to sift through county
records, church listings and newspaper archives for clues. In
census records from 1920, five years before Beatty was born, they
discovered Erma Waters had lived in Bethlehem with a son and
daughter. It seemed Beatty had a brother and sister.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a lot of detective work,'' the younger Beatty said.
''But things were beginning to fall into place like someone was
guiding us.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a few more trips to Bethlehem, but the couple found
Beatty's parents' marriage certificate. That led him to the name
Spitko, and searches through phone books finally led to his
long-lost sister.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in shock,'' Spitko said. ''I start to cry every time I
think of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The two then made plans for their meeting Saturday, where the
brother and sister clung tightly to each other and marveled at the
coincidences.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a statistics teacher,'' said Jim Beatty, a math professor
at Burlington County Community College. ''What's the possibility of
this happening?''
</P>
<P>
   Spitko said she had tried to find her brother but was stopped
cold by the sealed adoption records.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every year it seemed less likely it would happen,'' Spitko
said. ''But I never gave up hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitko said she had told her own children about the adoption of
her brother only eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mother had a baby out of wedlock and I didn't want anyone
to think badly of my mother,'' she said. ''I have nothing but good
memories of my mom. She was wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitko's father had already been dead for five years when her
mother became pregnant. After Jim, then called Neal, was born, Erma
Waters discovered she was dying of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was sick and couldn't take care of a baby,'' Spitko said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months after the adoption, her mother died and Spitko went
to live with her grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Jim had been adopted by the Beatty family of Latrobe,
Westmoreland County, and grew up unaware he was adopted until he
was 15.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just accepted it,'' he said. ''I never thought any more of
it. I had no idea I had any biological family at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The siblings also are hoping to be reunited with another sister,
Wilma, who went to live with relatives when their mother died. A
brother died in infancy.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Irene Spitko and Jim Beatty have a lifetime to
catch up on.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm so happy for my dad and his sister,'' John Beatty said.
''I'm just beaming from ear to ear.''

<HEADLINE> Party To Leave Polish Coalition  </HEADLINE>
By BEATA PASEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- The junior party in Poland's center-right
governing coalition voted Sunday to withdraw its ministers, likely
spelling the demise of Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek's 2{-year-old
government.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy with Buzek's inability to control maverick lawmakers
from his own Solidarity bloc, the executive council of the Freedom
Union voted nearly unanimously for its five ministers to submit
their resignations Monday. They will remain in office in a
caretaker capacity until a new government is formed.
</P>
<P>
   The party held open the option of forming a new coalition with
Solidarity under different leadership. Buzek has repeatedly offered
to resign if that would keep the partners together.
</P>
<P>
   The decision means Buzek's weakened government will stay in
place until the two sides hold talks. At that point, the Freedom
Union could either join Solidarity in a new government or it could
ditch the coalition altogether, leaving Solidarity to try to get by
with a minority government. The Solidarity bloc controls 185 of the
460 seats in the lower house.
</P>
<P>
   Such a government would probably not be able to get the 2001
budget passed, though. According to the constitution, parliament
would then have to be dissolved and early elections held in the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't exclude the possibility of renewing the coalition''
under a new prime minister, Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz,
who heads the small Freedom Union, said at the start of Sunday's
meeting. He called for ''fast, complete and conclusive'' talks with
Solidarity leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The market-oriented Freedom Union was unhappy with Buzek because
deputies from the splintered Solidarity bloc have voted against the
government's own economic reforms on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Government leaders consider the reforms crucial to prepare
Poland to join the European Union. But some Solidarity lawmakers
argue such reforms ignore the needs of the very workers and farmers
who helped the Solidarity labor movement bring down communism a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Government decisions were blocked in parliament in some
essential elements while decisions harmful for the country were
forced through,'' Balcerowicz said in explaining his party's loss
of confidence in Buzek.
</P>
<P>
   Bronislaw Komorowski, leader of a conservative Solidarity
faction, accused the Freedom Union of trying to save face in a
situation it provoked. He said negotiations on appointing new
ministers would be ''very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to keep the 2{-year-old coalition together, Solidarity
last week suggested a replacement for Buzek: central bank economist
Boguslaw Grabowski. Grabowski, who co-authored Solidarity's
economic program, supports fast privatization and restraints on
government spending -- views close to Balcerowicz's.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom Union praised the choice, but complained that
Solidarity still had not done enough to address its concerns about
party discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Many Solidarity politicians want Balcerowicz to resign as deputy
prime minister and finance minister if Buzek goes. That condition
could prove unacceptable for the Freedom Union and force it out of
the coalition altogether.
</P>
<P>
   If new elections end up being called, Solidarity could face a
stiff challenge at the ballot box. According to recent polls, the
left-wing, ex-communist opposition enjoys at least a 10 percentage
point lead over the Solidarity bloc.

<HEADLINE> WWII Bomb Found in Verona, Italy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Some 20,000 people were briefly evacuated in Verona
and the city's train station and airport were closed for hours on
Sunday so explosives experts could defuse a half-ton bomb from
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb, dropped by U.S. forces during the war, was found
recently during digging at a construction site near the train
station in the northern city of 250,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Work to defuse the bomb began in the morning and was completed
by early evening, when residents were allowed to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Evacuated from their homes as a precaution were those living
within a half-mile of the site.
</P>
<P>
   Flights flying in and out of Verona's Villafranca airport were
diverted to the northern city of Brescia. Trains were allowed to
pass through the station for only a half-hour in the afternoon
while work to defuse the bomb was briefly halted, said the Italian
news agency ANSA.
</P>
<P>
   Police patrolled neighborhoods to discourage any looters from
entering vacated homes.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan: Kashmir Is Key to Peace  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Marking the second anniversary of
Pakistan's nuclear tests, army ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf said
Sunday that Pakistan and India have to settle their dispute over
Kashmir to remove ''the threat of a nuclear holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   The military chief said he has repeatedly offered talks with
neighboring India to settle the long-running dispute, which sparked
a bitter border battle last summer and has led to two full-scale
wars in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want the people of South Asia to live under the
threat of a nuclear holocaust,'' Musharraf said. ''But India
shouldn't take our offer as a sign of weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   He told a public gathering in the federal capital that Pakistan
is not interested in embarking on a nuclear arms race. However, he
warned that Pakistan would not be left behind if neighbor India
forged ahead with nuclear weapons development.
</P>
<P>
   The speech came exactly two years after Pakistan ran underground
nuclear tests in response to Indian tests weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Today, depending who you ask in Pakistan, it's either a safer
Asian subcontinent because of the tit-for-tat nuclear explosions --
or it's the likeliest spot for the world's first nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf says nuclear deterrence has ensured Pakistan's
security and created a strategic balance in a region that has seen
three wars in the last 53 years. As recently as last summer, the
border dispute over Kashmir -- a mountainous region divided between
Pakistan and India and claimed in its entirety by both -- threatened
to escalate into an all-out confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Musharraf said he didn't believe either side would be
foolish enough to take their nations to the brink of a nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   But others in Pakistan are not so certain. Some fear that many
in Pakistan and in India -- where the literacy rate is barely 30
percent, even less among women -- may not realize the effect of a
nuclear explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ... consequences of nuclear weapons are too horrible to
think of, but in India and Pakistan most people don't know about
it,'' said Mohammed Illyas, who owns a camera shop in the federal
capital. ''They are emotional. They think of each other as a rival
and they want to kill each other even if it means their own
death.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last year, Pakistan built monuments to its nuclear
capability. Replica ballistic missiles were erected at major
intersections. On the outskirts of the federal capital, a giant
fiberglass rock was erected to represent Chagai Hills, where the
underground explosions took place.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Kamal, who runs a roadside business, said Pakistan's
decision to conduct underground nuclear tests on May 28, 1998, made
him feel proud.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel safe because now everybody knows about our power, our
neighbor knows,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts worry that unless the two countries begin talking --
and quickly -- the South Asian subcontinent will be launched on a
nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality of a nuclear South Asia is there and that is not
going to go away,'' said Dr. Riffat Hussain, a political scientist
at Islamabad's Qaid-e-Azam University.
</P>
<P>
   Both Pakistan and India have said nuclear weapons are a part of
their arsenals. Both countries possess ballistic missiles capable
of carrying nuclear warheads, though neither country is believed to
have developed a nuclear warhead. Hussain says they have to start
talking before they cross that threshold.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have this small window of opportunity now and if we don't
take advantage of it we are heading toward deployment and a nuclear
arms race,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But relations between India and Pakistan are hardly conducive to
dialogue. India refuses to talk to Pakistan unless it withdraws
militant secessionists from Indian Kashmir. Pakistan, meanwhile,
denies all involvement in arming or training the militants fighting
in the Indian-ruled section of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz Saddiq, a spokesman for the Human Rights Commission of
Pakistan, a fierce opponent of nuclear development, said Pakistan
is worse off today than two years ago. The economy is in ruins,
international pressure has persisted and relations with India are
at an all-time low, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What have we gained?'' he asked. ''Nothing. Two years ago
everyone knew we had the nuclear capability. We could have not
tested, gained economically and internationally from it.''

<HEADLINE> Eritreans Flee Heavy Fleeing  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG NELSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) -- Fighting raged Sunday between the Horn of
Africa's warring neighbors on the eve of peace talks -- opening a
new front in Eritrea's smoldering humanitarian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Infantry and artillery clashes in what's become the heaviest
fighting in the 2-year-old border war threaten to uproot 200,000
people around the central city of Mendefera, the United Nations
warned. The 2-week-old Ethiopian offensive already has sent nearly
one-seventh of Eritrea's people fleeing north, some into
neighboring Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks, buses and vans commandeered by the government poured
into the grounds of a school about 20 miles north of Mendefera,
disgorging hundreds of evacuees, mostly women and children, each
carrying a bulging, plastic bag or two of their belongings.
</P>
<P>
   Boys clambered off the high-paneled, open-backed trucks first.
</P>
<P>
   Parcels, babies and women -- clasping their skirts to protect
their modesty -- followed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have only these pieces of clothes,'' said 70-year-old
Bisrat Berhe, pinching the hem of her skirt as she crouched under
the eaves of a primary school that in the past day had become home
to 18,000 Eritreans.
</P>
<P>
   At least 6,000 new arrivals were expected by day's end, said
Simon Nhongo, a U.N. official.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea said last week that fighting already had dislodged
555,000 of its 4 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia's military now is pursuing the retreating adversary
miles deep into Eritrea -- putting its citizens into panicked flight
ahead of the advance.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly punished by the latest offensive, Eritrea agreed
last week to withdraw from all disputed territory and return to
talks set for Monday in Algeria on resolving the neighbors'
2-year-old war over their poorly delineated border.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia has made plain its bargaining strategy for the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We shall negotiate while we fight and we shall fight while we
negotiate,'' Prime Minister Meles Zenawai told African diplomats in
the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, last week.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning, Ethiopian warplanes bombed a nearly completed
power plant near the port city of Massawa, Eritrea's Foreign
Ministry said, calling the attack ''vandalism and senseless
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia said the planes attacked a military installation, not a
power plant.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Ethiopia accused Eritreans on Sunday of shelling
its forces near one of the eastern towns from which they had
pledged to withdraw, Bure.
</P>
<P>
   In Addis Ababa, Ethiopians rallied by the hundreds of thousands
to celebrate the ninth anniversary of the overthrow of the military
regime that once ruled Ethiopia, which in 1991 still included the
then-province of Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   The ralliers -- grizzled veterans of the guerrilla war against
Benito Mussolini's forces alongside young men in uniform -- had new
triumphs to celebrate as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''The invading Eritrean forces have been demolished!'' President
Negasso Ghidada told the elated crowd, listing towns and
territories retaken by the country's forces in past days.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of talks in this David-and-Goliath struggle, which
pits a country of 4 million -- Eritrea -- against one of 61.7 million
-- Ethiopia -- the vaunted Eritrean army seems, at least for the
moment, to have misplaced its slingshot.
</P>
<P>
   An army that successfully fought against the U.S.-backed
royalist regime of Haile Selassie and the Soviet-backed military
dictatorship of Mengistu Haile Mariam has conceded key towns in
western and central Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   By the most obvious measure -- lost territory -- Eritrea's army
has been dealt a sharp setback, though not yet enough of one,
Ethiopian military commanders say.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to show Eritrean forces were intact and spirited, the
Asmara government took reporters to the border town of Adi Keshi on
Saturday and showed them the bodies of at least 24 Ethiopian
soldiers killed in an unsuccessful three-day assault on an Eritrean
mountaintop position last week.
</P>
<P>
   Asked the state of his morale after Ethiopia's march across
large swaths of Eritrean territory, 24-year-old Alhuir Fessehaye
burst out in Italian, ''Cento!'' (roughly, ''100 percent!'') and
laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Around Fessehaye were reminders of the carnage and costs of a
war often fought hand-to-hand.
</P>
<P>
   Slung around the necks of nearby soldiers were ''kushufs,''
tightly wound shawls of often brightly colored cloth that Eritrean
soldiers use as sleeping mats or -- if they're killed -- as burial
shrouds.
</P>
<P>
   Down the boulder-strewn mountainside were the bloated,
decomposing bodies of Ethiopian troops stretched behind jagged
outcroppings where they fell under Eritrean mortar and
automatic-rifle fire.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrean soldiers and an Ethiopian prisoner of war claimed the
Ethiopians had to be goaded by screaming commanders to advance up
the steep mountainside.
</P>
<P>
   Found next to the body of 19-year-old Belete Ketema from
Nazareth, Ethiopia, was his diary in broken English, its last entry
breaking off mid-sentence as it recounted an episode in his brief
life: ''...when I spent my time in the market, I saw how the person
specially there are around me''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby in the nearly deserted town of Adiquala, at least 25
people too young or too old to flee huddled under a bridge to wait
out the war.
</P>
<P>
   Roma Gebrekian, 67, contemplated her fate and her country's
while she waited for Eritrean soldiers to bring her bread and
water.
</P>
<P>
   ''This must have been a curse,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Is Home to Electronic Music  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH ALTMAN Jr.
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Plenty of people recognize the names of the
Motown legends who got their start here: Diana Ross, Stevie Wonder,
the Temptations.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic music was born here too, but the names of its
pioneering Detroiters are far less recognizable: Juan Atkins? Kevin
Saunderson? Ectomorph?
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never heard of them until now,'' said Jennifer Avile, 15.
''But the music is cool. It's really powerful. It just gets inside
of you and you can have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Avile and her friends from Washtenaw County's Pittsfield
Township were like many others at the first-ever Detroit Electronic
Music Festival over the Memorial Day weekend. They have heard the
booming beats and sampled sounds of techno music, but never
realized Detroit was where it all began.
</P>
<P>
   ''Detroit is like the promised land for a lot of people for
electronic music,'' said Carl Craig, the festival's artistic
director and president of Planet E Records. ''Detroit's been kept
alive by music from Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson, Juan Atkins and
Underground Resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene this weekend at Hart Plaza in downtown Detroit
featured a diverse mix of people -- from middle-age parents toting
toddlers to teen-agers who appeared to be no strangers to the
techno scene of dance clubs and all-night raves.
</P>
<P>
   Stormy weather on Saturday and Sunday kept the turnout down, but
organizers were hoping for better crowds on Monday, the festival's
showcase day.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's going to be a lot of different types of people at this
festival,'' said Carol Marvin, the festival's executive producer.
''The most powerful thing I feel about the music is it breaks
through all of society's barriers: race, gender, age, culture.''
</P>
<P>
   A pink-haired woman wearing black leather pants, men sporting
khakis and polo shirts and teen-agers with pierced bodies, baggy
jeans and orange tennis shoes all melded together to listen to the
music.
</P>
<P>
   Some simply sat and listened while others showed off fancy
footwork, bobbing their heads and swinging their arms to the beats
emanating from 10-foot-tall walls of speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic music's fast beats and synthesized samples took
European clubs by storm in the 1980s; the music, so far, has gained
less exposure in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't hear it anywhere else, but I like it,'' said Maria
Romanowski, 44, of Warren, who brought her 17-year-old daughter and
14-year-old son. ''The kids are into it, and this is a good
opportunity to experience it. I don't want them to go somewhere
where it's not safe, and this is a place where the whole family can
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin said the festival is an inviting way to introduce people
to electronic music. When they hear it, they'll enjoy it, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the same music they use at sporting events to get the
crowd excited,'' she said. ''It has all that passion, and they're
going to recognize that, and I think everyone will feel
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Promoters are billing it as the largest free techno festival in
the world, with about 70 musicians scheduled to perform on four
stages.
</P>
<P>
   Craig booked a smorgasbord of electronic music styles, including
house, booty and jazz. Detroit techno pioneers such as May,
Saunderson and Atkins, often called the originator of techno, are
scheduled to perform, along with other artists from around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time this kind of event is happening in
America,'' Marvin said. ''It's revolutionary in music because this
is the birthplace of electronic dance music, and Detroit is revered
globally for its achievement.''

   Among the allegations: A transsexual detainee claims to have
been sexually assaulted twice by an officer; a female detainee
alleges one guard had sex with her; she and another woman have
become pregnant while being held in the facility, one allegedly by
the guard, the other allegedly by a fellow detainee.
</P>
<P>
   No names were released, and authorities did not specify the
number under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations were referred to the agency's Office of Internal
Audit and the Justice Department's inspector general, said Maria
Elena Garcia, INS spokeswoman in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Consensual sex between prison or detention officers and their
wards is a misdemeanor under federal law, but a felony under
Florida law, said Al Hazen, a spokesman for the Department of
Justice Office of the Inspector General.

<HEADLINE> Aviation visionary gets state, national recognition  </HEADLINE>
By JIM MEMMOTT
Rochester Democrat and Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMMONDSPORT, N.Y. (AP) -- The best-selling T-shirt at the
Curtiss Museum just south of this Steuben County village has an
airplane on the front and the phrase ''Wilbur &AMP; Orville Who?'' on
the back.
</P>
<P>
   No offense is meant by the question, says Kirk W. House, the
museum director. It's just another way of suggesting that the
museum's namesake, Glenn Hammond Curtiss, was the equal of Wilbur
and Orville Wright, the guys who got aviation off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But life isn't always fair. Even though Curtiss made
extraordinary contributions to aeronautics at the beginning of this
century, the Hammondsport native doesn't always get the credit he's
due outside the village of less than 1,000 residents that calls
itself the Cradle of Aviation.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why House is pleased that Curtiss, who died in 1930,
has been selected by the state Department of Transportation as New
York's most significant contributor or contribution to aviation.
</P>
<P>
   Curtiss was named in connection with a program conducted by the
National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Already a member of the Hall of Fame, Curtiss will be in a
state-by-state honor roll that includes some individuals, some
events (memorable flights) and even some airports.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is one of the few greats,'' says Jean Lail, archivist at
the Hall of Fame. ''We're trying to get the word out on him. The
planes he made are still out there. He was an incredible man.''
</P>
<P>
   The Curtiss Museum gives support to Lail's assessment,
chronicling a life of extraordinary and diverse achievement. ''He
was into so many things, you can't stay with him,'' House says.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Hammondsport on May 21, 1878, Curtiss stayed in school
through eighth grade. In 1892, he moved to Rochester to join his
mother and sister, who had gone there so his sister could attend
what is now the School for the Deaf.
</P>
<P>
   Curtiss first worked for the Eastman Dry Plate and Film Co.,
which would become the Eastman Kodak Co. He then took a job as a
bicycle messenger for Western Union.
</P>
<P>
   The job, or at least bicycle riding, changed his life.
</P>
<P>
   ''With an inborn love for the sheer physical sensation of rapid
motion, and endowed with long legs that were like a pair of
muscular pistons, Glenn Curtiss caught racing fever,'' writes C.R.
Roseberry in ''Glenn Curtiss: Pioneer of Flight,'' which was
published in 1972 and reprinted by Syracuse University Press in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   When he wasn't working or taking part in bicycle races, Curtiss
rode his bike from Rochester to Hammondsport and back, about 70
miles each way.
</P>
<P>
   Curtiss moved back to Hammondsport in 1896 and eventually took
over a bicycle shop. By 1901, he had built a motorcycle, the first
of many. The Curtiss museum has an exhibit on early motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   His creations quickly became faster and faster, and in 1907
Curtiss set a land-speed record of 136.36 mph on his motorcycle. By
this time, he was also beginning to catch up with the Wright
brothers, who had made their first flight on Dec. 17, 1903.
</P>
<P>
   Curtiss joined with Alexander Bell, inventor of the telephone,
and other investors to build the June Bug, a biplane powered by one
of Curtiss' lightweight V-8 engines. On July 4, 1908, Curtiss
piloted the June Bug in the first pre-announced, officially
observed flight in the United States. The Wright brothers had not
announced their flight beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   The June Bug traveled a little over a mile, 20 or so feet above
the ground. Average speed: 39 mph.
</P>
<P>
   After the flight, Curtiss' life was a series of triumphs, though
House says it was not the aviator's nature to brag. ''He was a
private, quiet man,'' House says. ''He wasn't a real social type. .
. . But everyone described him as a kind man.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis received the first pilot's license in the United States
in 1911, and he designed the first plane to take off and land on
water.
</P>
<P>
   He also created the Curtiss ''Jenny,'' a World War I plane made
first in Hammondsport and then Buffalo. The success of the Jenny
made Curtiss a millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he also became involved in real estate in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Early in July 1930, Curtiss was stricken with appendicitis while
on his way from Hammondsport to Rochester for a court hearing. An
appendectomy in Buffalo seemed to be successful, but a pulmonary
embolism, or blood clot, took his life on July 23, 1930. He was 52.
</P>
<P>
   ''After risking his life in every kind of vehicle, he died in
that way,'' House says.
</P>
<P>
   Curtiss is buried in the Pleasant Valley Cemetery just outside
the village of Hammondsport, close to where the June Bug made its
flight.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's people here who have never heard of the Wright
brothers,'' says Jane Honeyman, who is in her 80s and has lived in
Hammondsport all her life. ''But everybody has heard of Glenn
Curtiss.''

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Parties Outline Differences  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Dissident members of Northern
Ireland's major Protestant party lost no time Sunday in declaring
their resistance to a soon-to-be restored administration that
includes members of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party.
</P>
<P>
   And Sinn Fein made clear it was not giving up its opposition to
Britain's plan for reforming the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the
province's police force, which many Catholics despise. Sinn Fein
says reform plans are inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists' narrow approval Saturday of a return to
power-sharing cleared the way for Britain to restore the
administrative authority it suspended in February over the refusal
of the outlawed Irish Republican Army to disarm. Power returns at
midnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble barely managed to persuade
his badly divided party to give the IRA a chance to live up to its
unprecedented pledge three weeks ago to begin putting its weapons
''completely and verifiably beyond use'' if the new provincial
administration resumed.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Trimble warned the IRA that it must deliver on
its promise.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let there be absolutely no doubt that I and my colleagues will
hold the republicans to the promises they have made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein declined to speculate on when the IRA would begin to
reveal any of its secret weapons dumps to international inspectors
-- the most concrete commitment made in its May 6 disarmament
pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble won with only 53 percent of the council vote. Many
Ulster Unionists oppose the 1998 Good Friday peace accord under
which the new Cabinet and Assembly were established in December.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important the voices of the 47 percent are heard,'' said
Jeffrey Donaldson, one of Trimble's strongest opponents within the
party. ''If we need to come back again to press for IRA disarmament
that's what we'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein deputy leader Martin McGuinness, who will return as
education minister, welcomed Trimble's success.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have waited for far too long to see an Ulster Unionist
leader and that section of the party who have told us consistently
that they are for the Good Friday Agreement face down the unionist
rejectionists who are out to destroy it,'' McGuinness told GMTV
television on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   McGuinness criticized the police reform plan put forward by
Britain's minister for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, as a
''pale shadow'' of recommendations made last September by a reform
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Britain had insisted that the police force be renamed as part of
a reform effort, although Protestant hard-liners objected
vehemently. Before the Ulster Unionist vote, Mandelson suggested
the RUC name might be retained in some form.
</P>
<P>
   In a further bid to help Trimble, he announced he would have the
final say on whether the British flag flew over government
buildings -- another sore point with the Protestants.

<HEADLINE> Tiananmen Crackdown Commemorated  </HEADLINE>
By PRISCILLA CHEUNG
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- Gathering to commemorate the Tiananmen Square
military crackdown, more than 1,000 activists marched in Hong Kong
Sunday and vowed to keep fighting until China becomes a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters chanted slogans and sang patriotic songs. They
marched under the blazing sun amid a sea of black-and-white
placards that said: ''Demand accountability for 6.4 massacre,'' and
''Don't forget June 4.''
</P>
<P>
   Several protesters carried a wooden dummy coffin during the
four-mile march to the downtown government headquarters to
commemorate the dead from the 1989 crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we're seeing momentous economic developments in China,
why aren't we also seeing the end of one-party rule?'' asked labor
unionist and independent lawmaker Leung Yiu-chung.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds, if not thousands, of people were killed when tanks and
troops descended on demonstrators at Tiananmen Square in Beijing in
the early hours of June 4, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing officially regards the student-led demonstrations as an
attempt to overthrow the government. Hong Kong activists hold
frequent protests to demand that Beijing release all jailed
dissidents and reassess the 1989 demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said about 2,000 people attended the march Sunday,
although the crowd appeared slightly smaller. Police did not
immediately give their estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators said younger people should learn about the
importance of democracy in China and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ''Time erodes our memories. China has no hope unless the new
generation understands the importance of democracy,'' said Andrew
To, a veteran activist and a district councilor of the popular
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Mok Chin-to, 41, waved a 3-foot by 5-foot Taiwanese flag during
the march, which he said represents the hope of multiparty,
democratic elections on Chinese soil.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan elected Chen Shui-bian as president in March, generating
attacks from Beijing, which distrusts the former pro-independence
opposition leader. Beijing claims Taiwan as a renegade province to
be retaken eventually, by force if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, Chinese dissidents asked the government to stop
condemning the 1989 democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
   In separate appeals, Wang Hongxue and Cheng Fan called on the
communist leadership to reappraise the seven weeks of massive
student-led protests that led up to the crackdown, the Hong
Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democracy said.
</P>
<P>
   More than a million people in Hong Kong protested the crackdown
in 1989, and the issue remains a sensitive one in the territory.
Anti-China and anti-government protests have remained legal after
the handover.

<HEADLINE> S.Leone Rebels Free UN Captives  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Rebels released 61 U.N. hostages
Sunday and U.N. officials said they expected 28 more to be freed
soon, a development which appeared to bring the four-week-old
hostage crisis nearly to a close.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the 28 captives waiting to be transferred to northern
Liberia, U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said only 23 peacekeepers
were still being held out of some 500 U.N. personnel snatched last
month. The immediate fate of those 23, from India, remained
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the releases, fighting between rebels and pro-government
forces was reported over the weekend at the strategic crossroads of
Rogberi Junction, about 50 miles east of Freetown, Wimhurst said.
He had no further details.
</P>
<P>
   The 61 were flown to Liberia's capital of Monrovia in two
batches from eastern Sierra Leone, Wimhurst said. The 28 were
expected to be airlifted out late Sunday or Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Some 143 hostages were flown Friday and Saturday from Monrovia
to Freetown and hundreds more had trickled out in the weeks
earlier. The releases were negotiated by Liberia's President
Charles Taylor, the closest regional ally to the Revolutionary
United Front rebels, a secretive and isolated group notorious for
its diamond dealing and atrocities against civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in military uniforms and clutching bottles of mineral
water, the hostages freed Sunday were relieved and joyful. Most
were in good physical condition, although some were being treated
for malaria, minor injuries and fatigue, Liberian medical officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel very happy. I thought we were never going to reach this
place. Thank God we are here,'' said Zambian Lance Cpl. Elias
Mwanza, who suffered from a swollen jaw and other injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Mwanza said some of the captors had tormented the hostages while
others were more kind and promised not to kill them ''because we
are their African brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Pvt. Goma Justin, also Zambian, who had deep cuts on his foot
from stepping on broken glass, described his captivity as
''rough.''
</P>
<P>
   The 23 Indian peacekeepers continued to be held in
semi-captivity in the village of Quiver in the eastern Kailahun
district, Wimhurst said. They were apparently surrounded by rebels
and barred from leaving, but were allowed to keep their weapons,
according to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, West African heads of state were gathering for
weekend meetings in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, to discuss the
crisis in Sierra Leone. Informal talks were held Saturday and with
the main gathering was being held Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have killed tens of thousands of people and
intentionally mutilated many more during the 8-year-old civil war.
The conflict reignited earlier this month when the Revolutionary
United Front rebels took the U.N. peacekeepers hostage and began
advancing toward Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a ragtag alliance of pro-government forces has tried
to push the rebels away from the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Associated Press Television News cameraman Miguel Gil Moreno de
Mora and Reuters correspondent Kurt Schork were killed Wednesday in
a rebel ambush. South African cameraman Mark Chisholm and Greek
photographer Yannis Behrakis suffered light injuries in the same
attack.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Reformist Parliament Opens  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's reformist legislators said Sunday
that they intend to live up to their pledges they made to voters
who are anxious for greater social freedoms and economic stability.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were elected because we promised to pursue reforms. So, we
are intent on delivering the promises we have made,'' legislator
Soheila Jelowdarzadeh told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jelowdarzadeh, who won a Tehran seat in February's
legislative elections, conceded that reformists face an uphill
road.
</P>
<P>
   ''To meet popular demands, we need time to succeed. Opponents of
reforms will continue to resist and therefore we should still
expect political tension to continue in the future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution that
the legislature has slipped out of the control of hard-liners, who
want no dilution of the clerical government's laws, many of them
unpopular due to their restrictions on personal freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   ''So far, the reformists have not bargained against their
promises. I'm happy with that,'' said businessman Mohammad
Eskandari. ''Now I expect them to deliver their promises and pass
laws lifting the restrictions and protecting people's freedoms.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, the state of Iran's ailing economy is a more pressing
matter than social freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation of 62 million, half of whom are under the age of 25,
Iranians are struggling with more than 20 percent unemployment and
high inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want a job. I need money to live. I expect the new Majlis to
help create jobs for the unemployed,'' said Mahmoud Lotfi, a young
man waiting with more than a hundred others for daily construction
jobs at a Tehran square, a sight repeated in many cities across
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the victory of the reformists, who won about
three-fourths of the 290 seats in the Majlis in the Feb. 18 polls,
their power struggle against the hard-liners is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   The Guardian Council, a supervisory body controlled by
conservatives, must approve new legislation before it becomes a
law.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-liners also control the judiciary, the broadcast
network and the security forces, and their chiefs are appointed by
Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final
say in all matters.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, hard-liners have shut down 19 newspapers,
18 of them pro-reform, and jailed several reformist editors and
leaders.

<HEADLINE> Two arraigned in five murders at Wendy's  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two men accused of shooting seven people, five
of them fatally, in the holdup of a Queens fast-food restaurant
were formally charged on Sunday with multiple counts of murder,
attempted robbery and weapons possession.
</P>
<P>
   Queens Assistant District Attorney Greg Lasak described in
chilling detail how John Taylor, 36, and Craig Godineaux, 30,
allegedly bound and gagged their victims with duct tape, then
executed them one by one.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were marched single file into a big freezer box. They
were told to get on their knees, and they were each shot by the
defendants once in the head,'' Lasak said, his voice tremulous with
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Lasak told Queens Criminal Court Judge Michael Aloise that the
defendants had given videotaped statements admitting the shootings
at a Wendy's restaurant in Flushing last Wednesday night. In
addition, he said, witnesses picked them out of a police lineup,
and detectives seized money, a security tape from the restaurant's
camera and other evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The evidence we have to tie these defendants to the case is
overwhelming,'' Lasak said.
</P>
<P>
   All seven people shot were employees of the restaurant. Five
were killed and two others survived with wounds, one of them by
playing dead until the bandits left.
</P>
<P>
   Lasak described the victims as ''seven hardworking people,
working in that restaurant that night... they were directed to lay
down on that floor. They were gagged over their mouths so they
could not scream.''
</P>
<P>
   Queens District Attorney Richard Brown has 120 days to decide
whether to seek the death penalty. Brown, who has twice before
recommended the death penalty, said he would use the time to
investigate, talk to victims' families and evaluate the defendants'
backgrounds, state of mind and mental capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision in regard to the death penalty is a decision I do
not take lightly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown refused to comment on media reports that Taylor had said,
''no witnesses,'' as his reason for shooting the workers after
taking $2,300. Most of the money, recovered at Taylor's house, was
in coins, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
   Aloise set the next hearing for June 26 and remanded the pair
without bail. Lasak asked for no bail, saying there was ''no
greater risk of flight'' than a potential death penalty.
Court-appointed attorneys John Youngblood and Heidi Segal reserved
bail requests.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor later was placed on suicide watch, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, a short, heavyset man, stood during the proceeding,
staring straight ahead. Godineaux, tall and rangy, gazed at the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who appeared to be a friend of Godineaux walked in and
out of the courtroom, wearing a red sweater over her head. She
refused to identify herself to reporters, but as the defendants
were led away, she cried out, ''I love you, Craig,'' broke down in
sobs and wailed, ''Oh, God.''
</P>
<P>
   Each was charged with 10 counts of murder in the first degree
and 10 counts of murder in the second degree, plus the lesser
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Taylor was a fugitive who jumped bail in a previous
fast-food robbery and had a record stretching back to 1996, when he
was accused of trying to break into a safe at a McDonald's where he
was assistant manager, and sentenced to five years probation.
</P>
<P>
   In one week last June, he was linked to robberies or attempted
robberies at four fast-food businesses in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The five workers killed at Wendy's were Ramon Nazario, 44; Anita
C. Smith, 23; Jeremy Ryan Mele, 18; Ali Ibadat, 40, and Jean
Auguste, 27, the night manager.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Castro, 23, shot through both cheeks, played dead, then
freed himself two hours later and called 911. He was released from
the hospital Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   JaQuione Johnson, 18, remained in critical condition after
surgery for a head wound at New York Hospital Medical Center in
Queens.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in TV Personality Slay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- British police on Sunday charged a man with the
murder of television personality Jill Dando, more than a year after
she was gunned down on the doorstep of her London home.
</P>
<P>
   A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said that Barry Michael George, also
known as Barry Bulsara, had been charged with killing the popular
TV newscaster and would appear before West London Magistrates Court
early on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   George, an unemployed 40-year-old who lived in the same west
London district as Dando, had been held for questioning since
police raided his home on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Under British law, police can detain a suspect for 24 hours
without charge. Further extensions can be granted up to 96 hours.
Police had received three extensions allowing them to hold George
until 11 p.m. local time Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   George had legally changed his name to Bulsara, reportedly in
admiration of the late Queen singer Freddie Mercury, whose original
surname was Bulsara.
</P>
<P>
   Dando, 37, was shot in the head at point-blank range as she
returned home from shopping errands in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   She had appeared on news and current affairs programs for the
British Broadcasting Corp., and was popular among audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Police floated several theories about the murder, speculating
that Dando might have been killed by an obsessive stalker or
targeted by a hitman as a result of her involvement in the program
''Crimewatch,'' which appeals to the public for help in solving
real-life crimes.

<HEADLINE> Nelson, Cuban Reach Mavs Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Don Nelson has reached agreement with owner Mark
Cuban to coach the Dallas Mavericks for three more years, followed
by three more as general manager.
</P>
<P>
   For the first three years, Nelson will make $5 million a year as
coach and GM, Cuban, an Internet billionaire, told The Associated
Press on Sunday. For the last three years, Nelson will receive $1.6
million a year to serve only as GM.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are incredibly excited to have him back,'' Cuban said. ''He
is an innovator and a great basketball man.''
</P>
<P>
   The extended agreement, reached Saturday, will give the
60-year-old Nelson an opportunity to groom new assistant Sidney
Moncrief for the top job.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mark wants me to be a part of it, and I want to be a part of
it,'' Nelson said. ''After three years, someone else will take
over. Hopefully, it will be Sid. That's the plan. I think Sid will
be more than ready.''
</P>
<P>
   When Cuban reached an agreement to purchase majority control of
the franchise Jan. 3, Nelson's 22-season coaching career appeared
over. The Mavericks were 9-21, and fans urged Cuban to get rid of
the coach immediately.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprising turnaround, the Mavericks went 31-21 after
Cuban's arrival to finish 40-42 -- their best record since going
47-35 in 1989-90, their last postseason appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' unlikely playoff charge ultimately fell short, but
Mavericks players Michael Finley, Dirk Nowitzki and Gary Trent
publicly lobbied Nelson to reconsider retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nellie is a great bench coach, and the longer I can keep him
the better,'' Cuban said.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he is now ready to coach through 2003, even after
complaining this season about feeling old.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, I see myself doing all three years,'' Nelson said. ''And
I'm not going to hack through these next few years. I think I'm
going to enjoy it. I think it's going to be a lot of good times.
Losing takes so much out of you. It wrecks your life. But I'm not
expecting to lose from this point on. I'm expecting to get
better.''

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein's Adams Talks to Grads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOWELL, Mass. (AP) -- With prospects brightening again for peace
in Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams told college
graduates that people are the same beneath their skin and that they
must start now to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the IRA-allied party also received an honorary
degree Sunday for the University of Massachusetts at Lowell, his
first from an American university.
</P>
<P>
   The commencement ceremony came one day after the Ulster Unionist
Party voted to rejoin the country's power-sharing government. Adams
welcomed Saturday's vote, which prompted the British government to
agree to restore home rule on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to develop a just society,'' he told the
audience of 6,500, including 1,700 graduates, in Lowell's Paul E.
Tsongas Arena. ''We have to keep focused on the prize because the
only way the bigots, rejectionists and naysayers can succeed is if
the rest of us give up ... and we are not giving up.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain suspended the young government in February after the
Irish Republican Army refused to make any firm disarmament
commitments and Unionists threatened to walk out. The IRA broke the
deadlock three weeks ago, promising it would gradually place its
hidden weapons stockpiles ''verifiably and completely beyond use''
in cooperation with international arms inspectors if power-sharing
resumed first.
</P>
<P>
   Adams told students that any one of them could make a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ''We start from where we are,'' he said. ''You make a difference
wherever you happen to be. ... Below the skin we are all the
same.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers won't take on organized labor in retirement payout limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) -- Wary of organized labor's clout, which
has hampered recent efforts to put controls on retirement payouts,
New Jersey lawmakers have pulled two bills that would cap how much
money state workers could receive for unused sick and vacation time
and quieted any rhetoric pushing such reforms.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. Christie Whitman, who made a failed attempt two years
ago to implement the caps as part of her ''smaller, smarter
government'' reforms, said she will try again to push through a
statewide limit on so-called ''golden parachute'' payouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Record of Hackensack reported in Sunday's editions that the
retirement payouts eventually will cost taxpayers at least $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Unions have argued they have the right to negotiate whatever
benefits they can, and over the past four year have derailed at
last a half-dozen efforts to control the payouts to teachers and
municipal employees.
</P>
<P>
   After a mobilization by the 162,000-member New Jersey Education
Association, the New Jersey School Administrators Association and
other groups, Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, R-Union, on
March 30, 1998, withdrew a bill that would have limited payouts to
public employees and school board employees at $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill sponsored by state Sen. Leonard Connors, R-Ocean,
was pulled March 19.
</P>
<P>
   DiFranceso has denied he pulled the bill because he was afraid
of losing union support in a run for governor, saying he was
persuaded by arguments the groups presented in opposing the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Joseph, an NJEA spokeswoman, said the benefits were
properly negotiated with bargaining representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the state to interfere in the collective bargaining
process undermines everything that the process is about,'' Joseph
told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   It would be ''ill-advised'' to attempt to take the benefit from
workers who negotiated in good faith, said Charles Wowkanech,
president of the New Jersey AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's no different than you negotiating a mortgage rate with
your bank,'' Wowkanech said. ''And all of a sudden the president of
the bank says, 'I'm not going to honor that deal.'''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, there's evidence unions took on Whitman's ''smaller,
smarter government'' rhetoric through a series of battles with the
Legislature during her first term.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers allied with labor fought the governor over policies
that would have fired public workers and replaced them with private
companies. And last year, more than half the Legislature signed on
as co-sponsors of a bill that would prevent Whitman from
overhauling civil service rules.
</P>
<P>
   The rhetoric toned down during Whitman's second term, when
members of the administration cited concerns that the public
wouldn't support layoffs and cuts during a booming economy. In the
past year, Whitman has signed 15 bills that increased or restored
public employee benefits and signed none curtailing benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But Whitman said Republicans should try again at reform, this
time with a new strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Without offering a timetable or specifics, she suggested
presenting a limit on the payouts as a way to control New Jersey's
local property taxes, which are the highest in the nation. Any
Republican wanting to take her place could turn such reform into a
political gold mine in next year's election, Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   But few lawmakers want to confront unions openly, although ''I
have seen data that says public employees are not particularly
popular,'' said Stephen Salmore, a Republican Party strategist.
</P>
<P>
   ''But no one is willing to take on the public employees and
remain confident that they can make up for those attacks with
broad-based support from the public,'' Salmore said. ''Politicians
are not risk takers.''

<HEADLINE> Rockies 11, Pirates 2  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Rolando Arrojo pitched seven innings for his first
victory in nearly seven weeks as the Colorado Rockies beat the
Pittsburgh Pirates 11-2 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Goodwin was 3-for-4 with three runs, and Mike Lansing
homered and had three RBIs for the Rockies, who improved to 16-6 at
Coors Field. Todd Helton went 3-for-4 to raise his major
league-leading average to .415.
</P>
<P>
   Looking nothing like the pitcher who had lost four straight
decisions, Arrojo (2-4) gave up two runs and six hits. He struck
out eight and walked one in his first victory since April 10, a
span of seven starts.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo's success came at the expense of Pittsburgh left-hander
Jimmy Anderson (1-3), who lasted just one inning. He gave up five
consecutive hits to start the game, and all five came around to
score.
</P>
<P>
   Lansing, who had an RBI triple in the first, gave the Rockies a
7-1 lead with a two-run homer off Josias Manzanillo in the fourth.
Colorado went ahead 9-1 before Brian Giles hit a solo homer, his
14th, for Pittsburgh in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates ended their road trip 1-5 and have lost seven of
eight.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Helton had reached base eight straight times before
grounding out in the third. He had five singles, two homers and a
walk in that stretch. ... Pirates C Jason Kendall went 3-for-4 to
extend his hitting streak to 13 games. He was 8-for-13 in the
series. ... Pittsburgh pinch hitters have one hit in their last 20
at-bats. Pirates leadoff hitters aren't faring much better, mired
in a 2-for-29 slump. ... Anderson has allowed a first-inning run in
six straight starts. He is 0-3 over that period. ... Colorado OF
Jeffrey Hammonds did not play Sunday after straining his left hip
flexor Saturday when he slammed into the wall in foul territory
along the first-base line. ... The Rockies got encouraging news
when OF Larry Walker threw for a second straight day as he recovers
from an elbow injury.

tensions underlining the fragility of security conditions in the newly liberated
Lebanese territory. In the first fatality since Shiite Muslim guerrillas took
over southern Lebanon on Wednesday after Israel's withdrawal, a guerrilla shot
and killed a 50-year-old Christian man and wounded another Christian in Rmaish
village, a former stronghold of the now-defunct Israeli-backed South Lebanon
Army militia. Police, in a terse statement, said the suspect was apprehended,
describing the shooting as an ''individual incident.'' Hezbollah, the leading
guerrilla group in south Lebanon, denied involvement.

Bush Offered Pentagon Access
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen offered George W. Bush
access to the same Pentagon information Vice President Al Gore is privy to,
saying that would keep politics out of national security and produce a more
informed debate in the presidential campaign. Cohen, a Republican like Bush,
said today he believes proposals the Texas governor made last week likely would
lead to dangerous new arms races. Gore had similar criticisms yesterday in a
speech at the U.S. Military Academy. Cohen said President Clinton appointed a
Republican as defense secretary ''to take the politics out of national security
debates.''

Rain Delays Memorial Golf Tournament
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) -- The conclusion of the Memorial Tournament, gaining the
same soggy reputation as Pebble Beach, was delayed until tomorrow because of
heavy rain that flooded the course and kept Tiger Woods from even warming up.
The fourth round was to resume at 8 a.m. EDT, with Woods leading Steve Lowery by
six strokes. ''Hopefully, I can still win the tournament,'' Woods said. ''It's
like taking a day off. You're not going to lose your game in one day. It's not
like you're going to struggle to break 90.''

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 12, Tigers 7  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Carlos Delgado hit two homers to drive in five
runs as the Toronto Blue Jays beat Detroit 12-7 on Sunday, giving
rookie Clayton Andrews his first major league victory.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Polonia, Dean Palmer and Bobby Higginson homered for the
Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado gave the Blue Jays an 8-6 lead with a two-run homer, his
16th, in the sixth, making a winner of Andrews (1-1) who tossed
four perfect innings after taking over to start the fourth. Delgado
hit a three-run shot in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews, recalled Thursday from Triple-A Syracuse, allowed only
four balls out of the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Blair (2-1), who relieved starter C.J. Nitkowski in the
fourth, took the loss. Blair gave up five runs on six hits in 4 2-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of batting practice to pregame rain didn't seem to
bother either team. The Tigers scored four in the first, but
Toronto came back with three in the second and three in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's Alex Gonzalez made it 9-6 with an RBI grounder in the
sixth. Delgado homered off Allen McDill in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit loaded the bases with no outs on two singles and a walk
in the first. It looked as if Chris Carpenter might pitch his way
out of the jam after getting Juan Gonzalez on a soft fly to short
right and striking out Bobby Higginson.
</P>
<P>
   But Palmer hit a two-run single and Robert Fick followed with a
two-run double to give Detroit a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays got three of those back in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Nitkowski hit Tony Batista on the right hand and Marty Cordova
followed with a single. An RBI single by Jose Cruz and a two-run
double by Chris Woodward made it 4-3 with no outs, but Nitkowski
settled down to end the threat on a groundout, strikeout and
flyball.
</P>
<P>
   Polonia hit a solo homer, his third, for a 5-3 lead in the
bottom of the inning. Higginson hit a solo homer, his fifth, in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer hit a two-out solo shot, his ninth, to make it 6-3 in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova and Cruz singled to start the Toronto fourth, Woodward
made it 6-4 with an RBI double, and Blair relieved with no outs.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Castillo's RBI grounder scored Cruz and Shannon
Stewart's sacrifice fly to center drove in Woodward to tie it at 6.
</P>
<P>
   Nitkowski gave up six runs on seven hits over three-plus
innings. Carpenter also yielded six runs on seven hits in three
innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes@: Delgado has two multihomer games this season and 19 in his
career. ... Detroit's Juan Gonzalez, who left Saturday night's game
with a strained left foot after the seventh, returned to the lineup
as the designated hitter. He was 0-for-5. ... Stewart extended his
hitting streak to 12 games. ... The start of the game was delayed 1
hour, 53 minutes because of rain. ... With two outs in the Detroit
third, Jose Macias struck out, but reached when Carpenter's pitch
in the dirt got away from catcher Alberto Castillo. The play went
in the books as a strikeout and wild pitch.

<HEADLINE> Social Security number is out there for the taking  </HEADLINE>
dtnbrnhr
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Your Security Number isn't very secure
anymore and is one of the critical pieces a thief needs to steal
your identity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the years, the Social Security number has become the
universal number. It is an entry key,'' said Chief State's Attorney
John Bailey, who said identity theft is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Those unique nine digits are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The banks have it. So do credit card companies and colleges.
Even some fitness clubs and video stores routinely ask for the
number.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union calls it a disturbing trend.
</P>
<P>
   ''Social Security numbers have become extremely dangerous
things,'' said Joe Grabarz, executive director of the Connecticut
Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once somebody has your Social Security number, they have the
key to all your records,'' said Grabarz.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security Administration began assigning the numbers
in 1936 and uses them to track earnings and the benefits people
will receive upon retirement. The agency has no official policy on
how other organizations use the number, said Michael Blum, an
assistant manager at the Hartford Social Security office.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't prohibit disclosure or use of the number,'' said
Blum. ''It's their number. And if they want to pass it on, it's
their choice.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also the law that they don't have to pass it on.
</P>
<P>
   The Privacy Act of 1974 makes it unlawful for any federal, state
or local government agency to deny any individual any right,
benefit or privilege provided by law because of such individual's
refusal to disclose his Social Security account number, unless
there is a specific law requiring the individual to do so. The law
also requires any government agency that requests the number to
explain why it is needed and under what specific law it is
required.
</P>
<P>
   Blum said the Hartford office fields about one complaint a month
from people claiming to be victims of identity theft.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 state law makes it easier to prosecute the crime. It is
now a felony to obtain personal information on an individual and
then use that information for unlawful purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Cecilia Gamble, 46, of Hartford, was sentenced Friday to eight
months in prison for identity theft. The victim was an older woman
with an excellent credit record. Gamble managed to get the victim's
purse, then used her Social Security card to get a Connecticut
state identification card. Authorities said Gamble opened several
credit cards in the victim's name, ran up huge bills, and even
tried to take out a home equity loan.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble was ordered to pay $47,000 in restitution to the victim.
</P>
<P>
   Many universities use a student's Social Security number for a
college ID. Grades, student health information, financial aid
histories and other data can be stored under that number.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why would any school want to do that to their students?''
asked the CCLU's Grabarz. ''That's almost inviting people to look
at the records.''
</P>
<P>
   But college officials say it's not that easy because of many
safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   ''I work here, but I can't call up a student's records,'' said
Karen Grava, a spokeswoman for the University of Connecticut. ''A
faculty member cannot call up a student's records. There is limited
access to those records.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some checks and balances in the credit card industry,
as well, but the Social Security number remains an important piece.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a whole number of factors we have to look at to make
sure we are matching the right person with the right credit
report,'' said Colleen Martin, a Chicago-based spokeswoman for
Trans Union, one of the three major credit reporting agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Social Security number is definitely a critical piece (of
information),'' she said. ''In this society, it's the common medium
of identification.''

<HEADLINE> Fire in Edison condominium complex forces dozens to evacuate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EDISON, N.J. (AP) -- At least 60 people were evacuated in a
pre-dawn fire that destroyed three condominium buildings under
construction and damaged two others where people were living,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the 3:43 a.m. fire began in a unit under
construction, then wind blew embers to other homes in the Village
Point complex.
</P>
<P>
   One firefighter suffered smoke inhalation injuries, and a police
officer injured his back when he tried to kick in a door during the
evacuation, said Edison Police Lt. Robert Ellmyer, who also is the
community's Emergency Management Coordinator. One elderly woman was
sent to the hospital to be treated for dehydration, Ellmyer said.
</P>
<P>
   All three were treated at John F. Kennedy Medical Center in
Edison and released.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was under control by daybreak, but took most of Sunday
afternoon to extinguish entirely. Firefighters were still at the
three-year-old complex at 5:45 p.m., trying to douse hot spots.
</P>
<P>
   Three of four unoccupied buildings under construction were
destroyed. All 18 occupied condominiums in another building were
damaged, and a building with seven occupied units suffered minor
damage.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross, Salvation Army and other emergency
groups helped in the evacuation. Most evacuees found temporary
housing on their own, but two families were helped to local hotels
by the Red Cross, Ellmyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the fire started in one of the buildings under
construction. The cause of the fire, considered suspicious, hadn't
been determined.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Not Ruling Out Russia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- NATO Secretary-General George Robertson said in an
interview aired Sunday that he does not rule out Russia ultimately
joining the western alliance.
</P>
<P>
   After Russia-NATO talks in Italy on Thursday, Robertson told
Russian state television that Russia's inclusion in the alliance
could be debated ''in the next two decades'' but there were no
immediate plans to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Vladimir Putin, then acting Russian president, told
the British Broadcasting Corp. that Russia could join NATO ''if and
when Russia's views are taken into account as an equal partner.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My answer to the same question is 'Why not?''' Robertson said
in the Russian state TV interview.
</P>
<P>
   Russia-NATO ties were almost completely frozen last year over
NATO's bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, which Russia strongly
opposed. Tensions were later aggravated by Western criticism of
Russia's war in breakaway Chechnya, but an agreement to restore
ties was announced in February when Robertson visited Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Top Franchise Value List  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- When it comes to money, the New York Yankees are
king of the hill, top of the heap.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes magazine said Sunday the Yankees are worth $548 million,
making the two-time defending World Series champions the most
valuable team in baseball for the third straight year.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are worth more than six times as much as the least
valuable franchise in the survey, the Montreal Expos
</P>
<P>
   Second-highest among the 30 franchises is the Atlanta Braves at
$388 million, Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   Completing the list of the top 10 most valuable teams are
Cleveland ($364 million), Baltimore ($347 million), Los Angeles
($325 million), the New York Mets ($314 million), Colorado ($305
million), Texas ($294 million), Seattle ($290 million) and Boston
($284 million).
</P>
<P>
   The least valuable franchises are Montreal ($89 million),
Minnesota ($91 million), Kansas City ($122 million), Florida ($125
million), Oakland ($134 million) and Philadelphia ($150 million).
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have baseball's highest payroll at $92.5 million,
more than the value of either the Expos or the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees made $17.5 million in operating income, the magazine
said, on revenue of $195.6 million. The only team that beat the
Yankees in operating income was the Braves at $18.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees owner George Steinbrenner led a group that paid $10
million to purchase the team from CBS in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner was in negotiations last year to sell the team to
Cablevision. But the deal fell apart when Cablevision chairman
Charles Dolan, brother of Indians owner Lawrence Dolan, wouldn't
allow Steinbrenner total control of the team.
</P>
<P>
   While the value of the Yankees increased 11 percent from 1999,
the biggest jump was recorded by Detroit. The Tigers, playing in
new Comerica Park, are worth $200 million, a one-year increase of
32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said 13 of the 30 teams had operating losses last year,
topped by the Los Angeles Dodgers at $21.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukee Brewers, owned by a trust established by Bud Selig
when he became commissioner, lost $14.4 million. Texas lost $9.5
million, San Francisco lost $9 million and San Diego lost $8.8
million.

<HEADLINE> Hospital Hit With $55M Verdict  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A jury has awarded $55 million to a woman who
entered a hospital with pneumonia and came out with brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Mederos, now 59, suffered bleeding during a bronchoscopy
examination in 1995, according to her lawyers. There was a delay in
intubating Mrs. Mederos, which kept her from receiving needed
oxygen and caused her to suffer irreversible brain damage
</P>
<P>
   The award by the Cook County jury late Friday is the largest in
a medical malpractice case in Illinois in the last decade, said
John L. Kirkton, editor of the Jury Verdict Reporter in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ravenswood Hospital Medical Center, the award was
against Dr. Donald L. Vidger, an anesthesiologist; Sunnyside
Anesthesia Association; and Dr. James B. Gallai, a specialist in
pulmonary diseases.
</P>
<P>
   During a bronchoscopy, Gallai may have hit an artery, according
to the woman's attorney, Joseph Power. It caused the ''greatest
amount of bleeding in my career,'' Gallai testified in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors declined to comment on the award. A spokeswoman for
Ravenswood Hospital would not discuss details of the case or say if
the hospital or its parent company, Advocate Health Care of Oak
Brook, would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Mederos has a full-time nurse, and her husband, Eusebio, has
quit his job as a truck driver to care for his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The award is the latest blow to the reputation of Ravenswood
Hospital. In 1998, the hospital got a spate of negative publicity
when personnel failed to treat a 15-year-old, who was shot by a
gang member and died just outside the emergency room door.
</P>
<P>
   Employees said they were following hospital rules not to leave
the emergency room and called police and an ambulance. The policy
has since been changed.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Election Council Targeted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A government official in charge of
safeguarding citizens' rights said Sunday that voting authorities
should face questioning after Venezuela's national elections were
postponed.
</P>
<P>
   The National Election Council has come under enormous public
pressure to step down this week for failing to carry out the
election that had been set for Sunday, but was postponed due to
computer glitches and bad planning.
</P>
<P>
   But Dilia Parra, a top government official, promised to ask the
legislature not to allow the council to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ''This would mean continuing the vicious practice in Venezuela
that there are not severe sanctions for those who shamelessly
violate their oath to serve the country and later pretend to remedy
the situation by offering their resignation,'' Parra said in a
radio interview.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member council could face prosecution if found
responsible for the problems that led to the postponement of the
election in this South American country of 23 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the country's high court postponed the vote, citing
technical glitches. The legislature has not determined a new date
for balloting.

<HEADLINE> Blazers' Wallace Tries To Rally Team  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Rasheed Wallace tried to rally the
Portland Trail Blazers. Without any help from his teammates, he
didn't stand a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace scored 18 of his playoff career-high 34 points in the
fourth quarter, when the rest of the Blazers contributed just seven
points, as the Los Angeles Lakers pulled away for a 103-91 victory
Sunday and a 3-1 series lead.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace added 13 rebounds, also a postseason best. His previous
highs of 29 points and 12 rebounds came in Portland's Game 2
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, playing on a sore left ankle, missed his first two
shots of the fourth but then scored the next 13 points for the
Blazers. His turnaround bank shot with 5:40 to play cut the lead to
89-79 -- the same margin the Lakers had to start the period.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers still had a chance to rally. But Wallace, never
known to demand the ball even when he has an advantage, somehow
disappeared in the Blazers' halfcourt offense.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he scored again -- on a dunk after twice grabbing his
own miss -- the Blazers trailed 99-82 with just under three minutes
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, Wallace was 6-for-12 from the field and 6-for-8
from the line. The rest of the Blazers took just 10 shots, making
three.
</P>
<P>
   The first Portland player to score other than Wallace was Steve
Smith, who hit one of two free throws with 5:06 left. Portland
didn't get a basket from another player until a meaningless dunk by
center Arvydas Sabonis with 2:15 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Blazers didn't fall behind for good until the
Lakers went on a 14-3 run in the third quarter, they were hurt
early by Sabonis' two first-quarter fouls. Sabonis hit two quick
jumpers, including a 3-pointer, to start the game, and Shaquille
O'Neal faced a long day of chasing the 7-foot-3 Lithuanian all over
the court.
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis played just eight minutes in the first half, however,
sitting out the entire second quarter. He came back with seven
points in the third, including a rousing baseline move on O'Neal
for a dunk and foul that cut the lead to 60-57 with 5:25 left.
</P>
<P>
   Portland got within 60-58, but Kobe Bryant's 3-pointer capped a
quick 9-2 run that ended another Blazers rally.

<HEADLINE> Plea Bargains Offered For Carruth  </HEADLINE>
By RANDALL CHASE
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rae Carruth and three co-defendants have been offered a plea
bargain that could spare them possible death sentences, a source
familiar with the case told The Associated Press on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Carruth's lawyer said the former Carolina Panthers player was
not interested in a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing that Rae Carruth is interested in is a speedy
trial to clear his name, a trial as soon as possible to clear his
name,'' defense attorney David Rudolf said.
</P>
<P>
   A source who has seen the plea offers made to Carruth and Van
Brett Watkins told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity
that lawyers for all the defendants had filed statements indicating
plea offers were received from the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The plea-bargain offerings were reported in the Sunday editions
of the Charlotte Observer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just not going to have anything to say about this story,''
assistant district attorney Gentry Caudill said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Carruth and the other men are charged with first-degree murder
in the Nov. 16 shooting of Cherica Adams. Adams, Carruth's
girlfriend, who was gunned down while driving in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   She was pregnant with Carruth's child at the time. Doctors
delivered a boy by emergency Caesarean section hours after the
shooting. Adams died Dec. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Carruth, Watkins, Michael Eugene Kennedy and Stanley Drew
''Boss'' Abraham are charged with first-degree murder, which
carries a sentence of life in prison or the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Each defendant also is charged with conspiring to commit murder,
shooting into an occupied vehicle and using a gun to try to kill
Adams' unborn child.
</P>
<P>
   James Gronquist, a lawyer for Abraham, said state rules prohibit
him from discussing plea negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone messages for lawyers representing the other two
defendants were not immediately returned Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The plea offers call for different punishments based on the
defendants' alleged roles and criminal records, with Carruth facing
as much as 30 years in prison, the Observer reported.
</P>
<P>
   Carruth and Watkins, the accused triggerman, must both plead
guilty for their deals to be accepted by prosecutors, the newspaper
said. Watkins, who has a criminal record, would get the harshest
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Gronquist said such plea offers don't necessarily mean
prosecutors think they have a weak case.
</P>
<P>
   ''Plea offers are relatively routine, even in murder cases, in
our county,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolf filed motions last week asking that Carruth's trial be
held on or before Nov. 15, one day before the anniversary of the
fatal shooting. He also wanted a timetable for prosecutors to turn
over discovery material.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still haven't gotten it all,'' Rudolf said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Carruth has been held without bail since December. The other
defendants also have remained in custody, and no trial date has
been set.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers are due in court Tuesday to discuss the discovery phase
and other issues.

   CORNING, N.Y. (AP) -- Betsy King made a 10-foot birdie putt on
the second hole of sudden-death playoff with Kelli Kuehne and Vicki
Goetze-Ackerman on Sunday to win the LPGA Corning Classic for the
second time.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 33rd career victory for King and the eighth triumph
in 14 playoffs for the Hall of Famer. King, who won $120,000, also
won the 1991 Corning Classic after barely surviving the cut. It was
the fourth playoff in the tournament's 22 years and first involving
three players.
</P>
<P>
   This was Kuehne's tournament to win for the second straight
year. Instead, she lost it, giving away a two-shot lead with a
double-bogey on the tricky 377-yard, par-4 18th.
</P>
<P>
   Goetze-Ackerman, seeking her first tour victory, had a
final-round 67 to finish at 12-under 276. She was giving interviews
to the media when Kuehne's third shot on No. 18 landed in the deep
rough to the right of the green.
</P>
<P>
   When King made par and Kuehne's chip left her with a 12-foot
bogey putt that she missed, Goetze-Ackerman suddenly found herself
back in the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   All three players parred the first extra hole, No. 18, and were
quickly whisked to the 345-yard No. 8, another par-4.
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne's second shot nearly hit the pin but rolled about 30 feet
past the hole, while Goetze-Ackerman put her second shot within 12
feet -- birdie range.
</P>
<P>
   King, whose drive landed in the right rough, had to clear a tree
with her second shot and did, with her ball landing on the green
and glancing off Goetze-Ackerman's ball and stopping about 10 feet
from the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne missed her birdie try as the ball broke right 2 feet.
After Goetze-Ackerman rimmed her birdie attempt out to the moans
and groans of the crowd, King then calmly holed hers, watching it
break about 8 inches as it rolled straight into the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Hurst, who had a closing 69, could have made it a four-way
playoff but bogeyed No. 18 when her second shot sailed over the
green into the gallery. She finished alone at 11-under 277.
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Eathorne was fifth at 278 after a closing 68 and Leslie
Spalding was another stroke back in sixth. Liz Earley of Canada,
who got as low as 11 under with a birdie on No. 5, a 449-yard
par-5, faltered with three bogeys on the final 10 holes and
finished in a three-way tie for seventh with Emilee Klein and
Sherri Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne started the day with a one-shot lead over King, and the
two battled back and forth throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   A two-shot swing on the tough 412-yard, par-4 No. 13 put King
ahead by a stroke. Kuehne's drive had hit the right rough and she
two-putted for bogey from 35 feet while King drained a 20-foot putt
to go in front.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was King's turn to play giveaway. Leading by a stroke,
she hit her drive on the 304-yard 16th under a pine tree, and when
her wedge flew over the green she had bogey. Kuehne, on the green
in two, calmly sank a 20-foot putt for birdie and had the lead back
again.
</P>
<P>
   Goetze-Ackerman, who began the day four shots off the lead,
zoomed into contention with five birdies on the front nine, three
in a row. Her 67 tied Joan Pitcock for the best round of the day.

<HEADLINE> Padres 4, Expos 3  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Al Martin drove in San Diego's first three
runs, and the go-ahead run scored when Montreal third baseman Andy
Tracy dropped a popup as the Padres rallied to beat the Expos 4-3
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who had been 2-for-32 with runners in scoring position
this year, hit an RBI double in the first and a two-run single in
the fifth. He added a triple in the seventh to finish 3-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, who fell behind 3-0 in the first inning, have won
four straight games for the first time since July 10-16, a streak
that spanned the All-Star break. The Expos have lost five straight.
</P>
<P>
   After Martin tied the game at three in the fifth, the Padres
scored the winning run without benefit of a hit in the sixth. They
got a walk, a fielder's choice, a hit batsman and two errors.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Boone reached when his grounder erased Ryan Klesko at
second for the second out. He then stole second, with an errant
throw by catcher Brian Schneider allowing him to take third. After
Ruben Rivera was hit by a pitch from Carl Pavano (5-2), Wiki
Gonzalez hit a popup. Tracy fought the sun but appeared to have a
bead on the ball, which popped out of his glove after Boone had
already crossed the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy's error was the third by the Expos and the fifth in the
game overall.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Walker (1-0) got his first big league win by pitching the
scoreless sixth, allowing one hit and one walk. Walker was promoted
from Triple-A Las Vegas on April 13. Trevor Hoffman pitched a
perfect ninth for his 11th save in 12 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Martin tied the game at 3 when he poked a two-run single just
over the outstretched glove of second baseman Jose Vidro. He was
thrown out trying to stretch it into a double to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Martin started the Padres' comeback with a first-inning double
to score Eric Owens, who hit a leadoff single and stole second.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos jumped on Padres starter Stan Spencer to take a 3-0
lead in the first inning. Lee Stevens hit a two-run homer with two
outs, a high shot to right, his 11th, and Rondell White drove in a
run with a groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer's slow delivery gives runners a great chance to steal,
and Peter Bergeron did just that after reading on a leadoff walk,
then advanced on Vidro's groundout and scoring on White's grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Pavano allowed four runs -- three earned -- and six hits in seven
innings. Spencer, who struck out nine, allowed three runs and six
hits in five innings. He walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Padres third baseman Phil Nevin committed two errors in the span
of two batters in the sixth inning, but the Expos failed to
capitalize.
</P>
<P>
Notes: With starter Woody Williams on the DL and Sterling
Hitchcock likely headed there, the Padres are set for another round
of callups. RHP Adam Eaton, currently with Double-A Mobile, is
scheduled to make his major league debut on Tuesday and Rodrigo
Lopez is to be called up for the second time this season from
Triple-A Las Vegas to start Wednesday in Hitchcock's spot. ...
Hitchcock plans to seek a second opinion on the sprained ulnar
collateral ligament in his throwing elbow from Anaheim Angels Dr.
Lewis Yocum. ... Tony Gwynn, who raised his average from .186 to
.260 in eight games since coming off the disabled list, got Sunday
off.

N. Ireland Parties Outline Differences
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Dissident members of Northern Ireland's
major Protestant party lost no time Sunday in declaring their resistance to a
soon-to-be restored administration that includes members of the IRA-allied Sinn
Fein party. And Sinn Fein made clear it was not giving up its opposition to
Britain's plan for reforming the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's
police force, which many Catholics despise. Sinn Fein says reform plans are
inadequate. The Ulster Unionists' narrow approval Saturday of a return to
power-sharing cleared the way for Britain to restore the administrative
authority it suspended in February over the refusal of the outlawed Irish
Republican Army to disarm.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen offered George W. Bush

saying that would keep politics out of national security and produce a more
informed debate in the presidential campaign. Cohen, a Republican like Bush,
said today he believes proposals the Texas governor made last week likely would
lead to dangerous new arms races. Gore had similar criticisms Saturday in a
speech at the U.S. Military Academy.

Russia-U.S. Missile Deal Not Expected
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin is unlikely to agree to
treaty changes sought by President Clinton that would allow deployment of a U.S.
anti-missile system, a top White House official said today. ''I think it's a
good opportunity for us to explain our view of the threat and President Putin to
talk about his concerns,'' said Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security
adviser. The idea is to ''see whether we can understand each other better.''
Berger said the leaders have a full agenda for their first official meeting at a
Moscow summit this week, June 4-5, with another three meetings probable this
year.

and violent protests in his quest today for a third term in a runoff election
boycotted by his rival and characterized as tainted by foreign monitors. Voters
lined up by the hundreds to cast ballots in Lima and around the country,
disregarding challenger Alejandro Toledo's call to stay away from the polls.
Peruvians faced fines if they did not vote, but many said they planned to mark
''no to fraud'' on their ballots.

Juan Montoya Wins Indy 500

   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Juan Montoya made a dominating detour from auto racing's
civil war today with an Indianapolis 500 victory that was the strongest case yet
for which side is best. Montoya, the defending champion of the more established
Championship Auto Racing Teams series, made car owner Chip Ganassi's decision to
return to Indy after a four-year absence look brilliant. The 24-year-old
Colombian fended off a late challenge from 1996 Indy winner Buddy Lazier, passed
teammate Jimmy Vasser to retake the lead 21 laps from the end and raced on to
become the first Indianapolis rookie to win since Graham Hill in 1966.

finals for the first time since 1991 with a homecourt victory Tuesday night.

<HEADLINE> Cubs 4, Giants 1  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Kerry Wood pitched seven strong innings,
using an unusual double play to get out of a fifth-inning jam, and
Sammy Sosa homered as the Chicago Cubs beat the San Francisco
Giants 4-1 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Wood (2-2), who missed all of last season after undergoing
reconstructive elbow surgery, allowed three hits and six walks to
win for the second time in five starts since his May 2 return from
the disabled list. He struck out five.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cubs leading 3-0, in the fifth, Wood walked Rich
Aurilia and gave up an RBI double to Doug Mirabelli. Pinch-hitter
Armando Rios and Bill Mueller walked around Marvin Benard's
strikeout to load the bases for Barry Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Wood went to a full count before Bonds hit a pop-up that soared
straight up. Catcher Joe Girardi, Wood and Bonds, all apparently
unable to see the ball against the bright sky, barely moved and the
base runners also held.
</P>
<P>
   When the ball landed in fair territory just in front of home
plate, Girardi stepped on home for the force and then threw out
Bonds at first to complete an inning-ending double play. The
umpires did not call an infield fly.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa hit his 16th homer of the season and first in San
Francisco's new Pacific Bell Park in the ninth off reliever Felix
Rodriguez. Sosa has now homered in 32 ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Buford had a two-run single and another run scored on
Sosa's sacrifice fly, which was dropped by right fielder Ellis
Burks for an error.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the Cubs, who beat the Giants 3-2 in 11
innings on Saturday, had won consecutive games since May 2-3 and
marked just their second road series win of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Aguilera worked the ninth for his ninth save and second in
as many days.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Rueter (2-4) allowed three runs -- one earned -- and six hits
in five innings but still lost a third straight decision. He walked
four and struck out one.
</P>
<P>
   Wood used a slightly more conventional double play to get out of
the seventh. He issued consecutive walks to Aurilia and Mirabelli
to start the inning and then reliever Aaron Fultz, attempting to
sacrifice, bunted the ball back to the mound, and Wood started a
third to first double play before fanning Marvin Benard.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, benefiting from a Giants error, scored three runs in
the first. Eric Young doubled, took third on a sacrifice and scored
on Sosa's fly that Burks dropped. Following a single by Glenallen
Hill, a force play and a walk to Willie Green, Buford singled
sharply to left field to drive in two runs.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Young's double to lead off the game snapped an 0-for-13
string at the plate over the previous three games. ... Giants
center fielder Calvin Murray, after entering the game as a
defensive replacement in the eighth, made a sensational basket
catch of Girardi's warning-track drive. ... The Cubs last won a
road series when they took two of three at Houston on April 25-27.
... Bonds, who went 0-for-4 for the second straight game, went
hitless in successive games for just the third time this season.
... Sosa also has a homer in the other new NL park in Houston,
going deep at Houston's Enron Field on April 26.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori Defies Peru Vote Warnings  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori risked
international isolation and violent protests in his quest Sunday
for a third term in a runoff election boycotted by his rival and
characterized as tainted by foreign monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Voters lined up by the hundreds to cast ballots in Lima and
around the country, disregarding challenger Alejandro Toledo's call
to stay away from the polls. Peruvians faced fines if they did not
vote, but many said they planned to mark ''no to fraud'' on their
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Naturally I'm going to void my vote, a vote of protest,
because what we want is to regain democracy,'' said Gerardo
Cantano, 52, an out-of-work accountant. ''We've never seen this
before, a president clinging so tightly to power. He's bringing us
economic isolation. There will be no foreign investment.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke in La Victoria, an inner city working-class
neighborhood in Lima with high unemployment. Posters of Fujimori's
smiling face hung from lampposts on the street outside the school
where people voted. Polls closed late Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As elsewhere, soldiers and police patrolled the nearby streets
to control any outbreak of violent protests by anti-Fujimori
demonstrators. As the day wore on, officers used tear gas and water
cannons to disperse small groups of protesters who tried to gather
in plazas in downtown Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, who came to power in 1990, counted on solid support
among Peru's poor majority to deliver certain victory and weather
the international storm provoked by the refusal of election
officials to delay the disputed poll.
</P>
<P>
   His support is solid in the sprawling shantytowns on Lima's
outskirts, where he has paved streets, installed electricity, built
schools and provided soup kitchens for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   In Lurigancho, located among barren, dusty foothills on Lima's
eastern outskirts, large red-and-white letters painted on the
school's front wall said ''Fujimori Gets Things Done!''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Marin, 40, waiting in line to vote with two small
daughters in tow, agreed with the message.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is the only one to get things done for us,'' she said,
repeating Fujimori's campaign slogan. ''He paved the streets, fixed
up the schools. More than anything, he is with the people. When it
rains, he gets his feet muddy.''
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year-old Fujimori, dubbed ''The Emperor'' for his
autocratic style but with a common touch that appeals to Peru's
poor, ignored the boycott by Toledo, violent street protests and
the withdrawal of foreign monitors who warned a fair vote could not
be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori was seeking a third five-year term despite a
constitutional ban on three consecutive terms. On the eve of the
vote, Toledo said the refusal of election officials to postpone the
runoff ''announced the death of democracy in Peru.''
</P>
<P>
   But after casting his ballot in Lima, Fujimori smiled amid a
crush of supporters and insisted ''the absence of observer missions
doesn't take away from the validity'' of the election.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Toledo had not formally removed himself from the
race or election officials would have already proclaimed a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an election in which there are two candidates because
Mr. Toledo has not withdrawn. If he had withdrawn, then there
wouldn't be an election,'' Fujimori said.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted Sunday's vote ''will demonstrate to the
international community that this is a clean and fair election and
there is no coercion of any kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said he would refuse to recognize any Fujimori victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fujimori is going through the second round alone. We are now
starting the third round, a round for democracy,'' said Toledo, who
added he didn't cast a ballot. ''We have called for peaceful
resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo also disputed the fairness of the runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here you have a soccer game in which one of the teams is owner
of the field, writes the rules of the game, chooses the referees,
decides when the game starts and ends and decides which news media
will broadcast it. You know ahead of time who is going to win,'' he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo spent the afternoon in a poor district of unpaved streets
and cement-block homes where hundreds of people gathered, lofting
banners and shouting ''Toledo, president!'' repeatedly as dozens of
police looked on.
</P>
<P>
   Promising jobs and capitalizing on his Indian appearance, the
54-year-old Toledo made a surprising surge in the first round. But
Fujimori fought back, depicting the U.S.-trained economist as a
populist who would plunge the country back into the political chaos
and hyperinflation of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori won 49.9 percent of the first-round ballot, just shy of
the majority he needed to avoid a runoff against Toledo, who
collected 40.2 percent and afterward complained that fraud
prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   But election officials disregarded growing international
pressure to postpone the final round in order to evaluate new
software for tabulating votes. In the first round, election
officials were unable to explain how the number of ballots cast
exceeded the number of voters by more than 1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   More than 14 million Peruvians were registered to vote.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, President Clinton made a last appeal to Peru to
postpone the runoff. He warned that relations with Peru
''inevitably will be affected'' if there is fraud.

<HEADLINE> Nelson Wins Boone Valley Classic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Mo. (AP) -- Larry Nelson eagled No. 17 to counter one by
Tom Watson on the same hole and went on to win the $1.5 million
Boone Valley Classic by three strokes Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Watson chipped in from more than 50 feet off the green to go 15
under and take a one-stroke lead over Nelson who was playing in the
same group.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who was about 10 feet off the green and about 20 feet
from the hole on the 491-yard par-5, then made his chip to get to
16 under and take a one-stroke lead.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson made a par on 18 for a 4-under-par 68 and 16-under 200
total.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, whose runner-up finish was his second in as many weeks,
lost any chance to force a playoff when he hit his approach shot
into the water in front of No. 18 and made a double-bogey 6 for a
closing 70.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who started the final round with a one-stroke lead over
Watson, won this tournament for the second time in three years. He
won $225,000 to move into first place on the money list with $1.06
million in 14 events. Bruce Fleisher, who had been leading the
money list, did not play at Boone Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson and Watson were tied at 13 under after 14 holes when
Watson two-putted from about 50 feet for a birdie while Nelson was
making a routine par 5 on the 476-yard hole.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson took the lead again on 15 when he made an 8-footer for
birdie while Watson parred.
</P>
<P>
   David Graham, who entered the final round two shots back, had a
73 and finished third, two strokes behind Watson.
</P>
<P>
   The final round was closed to all but a few hundred spectators
after five inches of rain since Friday flooded tournament parking
lots. The event, held at the Boone Valley Golf Club, about 40 miles
west of St. Louis, was a sellout for the first time in its
five-year history. Tournament officials said refunds would be
issued.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson widened his lead on the first hole to two shots over
Watson and three over Graham when he made par while the other two
bogeyed the 405-yard, par-4.
</P>
<P>
   Watson birdied Nos. 6 and 7 while Nelson 6 to narrow the gap to
one stroke going to the back nine. Nelson and Watson each shot
1-under 35s on the front nine at the 6,723-yard course.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, Watson and Graham, who were in the final group, have won
13 major titles, including three U.S. Opens.
</P>
<P>
   Watson earned $132,000 for finishing second and Graham got
$108,000 for third.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche Series Ends With Near Win  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Fittingly, their season ended with a shot in the
waning seconds that ricocheted off the post, spinning crazily but
refusing to cross the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Avalanche came oh-so-close to reaching the Stanley
Cup finals, mounting a rally from a three-goal deficit that fell
one short in a 3-2 loss to the Stars in Game 7 of the Western
Conference finals Saturday night in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't believe it,'' Avalanche forward Adam Deadmarsh said.
''A half inch to the right, it's in.''
</P>
<P>
   Deadmarsh fought for position in front of the net and tipped Ray
Bourque's shot with 12 seconds left. The deflected puck went past
goalie Ed Belfour but hit the left post.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd rather have it miss the net than hit the post,'' forward
Chris Drury said. ''It's a tough way to see your season end.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Dallas appeared to get lucky bounces on all three
of its goals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We said all along that both teams are so evenly matched that a
bounce would probably decide the winner and the loser,'' Avalanche
coach Bob Hartley said. ''Their power play gave them two big goals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came out flying in the second and third periods and kept
applying pressure and got some good traffic in front of the net.
But we were short by a couple of bounces.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Stars' three goals, they were all deflections. But give
them credit. When you go to the net, good things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, which also lost to Dallas in seven games of the
conference finals a year ago, felt it had the talent to win its
first Stanley Cup since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't happen, and there were multiple reasons: a suddenly
toothless power play, offensive slumps by Joe Sakic and Sandis
Ozolinsh and, finally, brilliant play by Belfour, who outduelled
Patrick Roy.
</P>
<P>
   There were no signs of trouble in the first two rounds of the
playoffs, when Colorado dispatched Phoenix and Detroit, each in
five games.
</P>
<P>
   They the Avalanche advanced to meet the defending Stanley Cup
champions and promptly won Game 1 in Dallas. Dallas squared the
series in Game 2, and Colorado went up 2-1 in Denver on Roy's
second shutout in three games. The Avs would win only once more.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche outshot the Stars 110-56 over Games 3, 4 and 5,
but they were outscored 7-5 and won only one of the three games.
Game 4 in Denver was especially frustrating; Colorado outshot the
Stars 39-15 but lost 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 3-2 in the series, they staved off elimination with a
2-1 win in Game 6, but their early 3-0 deficit in the seventh game
proved insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   ''We shouldn't even have been in a Game 7,'' defenseman Adam
Foote said. ''We could have closed out that series earlier. There's
a couple of guys who didn't lay it on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Foote, who broke a bone in his left hand early in the second
period but continued to play, declined to identify the
transgressors.
</P>
<P>
   Foote said he hoped his team learned some lessons from the last
game.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to get dirty and grind, that's playoff hockey,'' he
said. ''You don't see pretty goals in the playoffs. Look at their
three goals. One was a crazy deflection, another came over three
guys' heads and landed in the net, and another went off a knee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Too many times we were looking for the cute pass and looking
for the perfect shot. You're not going to get that in the NHL. You
go to the net hard, and hopefully one goes off your knee every so
often.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his team's playoff exit, Roy said, ''Destiny was just not
there, I guess. I thought we had the team to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's power play, which began the playoffs by going
7-for-23, went scoreless in its last 18 man-advantage situations.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was huge,'' said Sakic, who scored only one goal in the
final 14 playoff games. Ozolinsh also struggled, but Hartley
disclosed he has been hobbled since the second game of the Dallas
series by a bruised foot.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the loss, still-stunned Colorado players reflected
on what possible changes this team might undergo in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never played on a team with such tightly knit guys, guys
who wanted to win so much for each other,'' Shjon Podein said.
''You'd hate to see anybody go. But when you don't accomplish what
you set out to do, sometimes changes are made.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Pierre Lacroix must make decisions about at
least 10 players who will become free agents, including Sakic,
Ozolinsh and Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   ''Colorado was a joy, and I'm definitely interested in coming
back,'' said Bourque, who requested a trade from Boston to a
contender in March but who remains without a Stanley Cup in 21 NHL
seasons. ''I thought we had a good enough team to get there. I
still think we have what it takes.''

<HEADLINE> Test Rocket Successfully Launched  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) -- An Air Force rocket
built from parts of scrapped missiles made a successful launch on
Sunday from this Central California coastal base.
</P>
<P>
   The rocket, designed to be used in creating the nation's
national missile defense system, was a hybrid made up of three
stages from different Minuteman II intercontinental ballistic
missiles, including one built in 1966, said Tech. Sgt. Buzz
Ritchie, a spokesman for the base's 30th Space Wing.
</P>
<P>
   The launch under the military's Orbital Suborbital Program was a
test to determine if the hybrid could be used as a cheaper target
for interceptor missiles. The recycled rocket launch cost $11
million, compared to $21 million for the use of a regular Minuteman
II, said Staff Sgt. Rebecca Bonilla, another base spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   The rocket's stages successfully separated, carrying the target
launch vehicle into space for only about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether the target vehicle burned
up in the atmosphere or fell back to earth.
</P>
<P>
   The military will determine whether the mission was a success by
examining data to see how closely the rocket kept to its specified
course, Ritchie said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Retired Col. Richard P. Keirn, a former Air
Force pilot who was held prisoner during World War II and the
Vietnam War, died Thursday. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Keirn was 20 when he was shot down over
Germany in 1944. He spent nine months as a German prisoner of war.
After the war, he became a member of the Ohio Air National Guard,
and returned to full-time duty in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, he was sent to Vietnam, and was shot down over Hanoi
while on his fifth mission.
</P>
<P>
   He was imprisoned by the North Vietnamese for more than seven
years. He was thought to be dead in 1965, but then newspaper
editors identified him from a wire service photo.
</P>
<P>
   Keirn earned several military honors, including the Silver Star
and Distinguished Flying Cross.
Milo A. Speriglio
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Milo A. Speriglio, a private detective who
looked into the deaths of celebrities such as ''Superman'' star
George Reeves and wrote three books claiming Marilyn Monroe was
murdered, died April 30 of lung cancer. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   Sperilgio's career spanned 41 years, including three decades as
chief of Nick Harris Detectives, Inc., one of the nation's oldest
private detective agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Speriglio co-founded the California Association of
Licensed Investigators, described as the world's largest private
investigator association.
</P>
<P>
   Speriglio's cases were rarely high-profile. He traced missing
people, investigated frauds and cons and spied on unfaithful
spouses.
</P>
<P>
   But he did look into the 1959 shooting death of Reeves, who
played Superman on television in the 1950s. His mother disbelieved
the official verdict of suicide and hired the Nick Harris agency.
The agency's report concluded that two bullets were fired at Reeves
from at least 16 inches away.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Speriglio began investigating Monroe's death. In
three books, he laid out a hypothesis that the film star, who
officially died of a drug overdose in 1962, actually was killed by
a Mafia hit team on behalf of President Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Speriglio's probe led to the opening of police files on the
death and calls for a grand jury investigation. A censored version
of Monroe's FBI file was turned over to the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office, which concluded her death was either a
suicide or accidental and there was no need for further
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, two daughters and a sister.

<HEADLINE> E. Coli Said Sickening Fewer Now  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALKERTON, Ontario (AP) -- Fewer people were getting sick from
one of North America's worst E. coli outbreaks, a health official
said Sunday, though one elderly victim was moved into a terminal
care unit and was expected to die.
</P>
<P>
   Five people have died so far and hundreds were sickened by E.
coli bacteria that contaminated the water supply in Walkerton, a
southern Ontario town of 5,000 people about 90 miles west of
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Waram, acting chief executive of the local South
Bruce-Grey Health Center, said the patient was moved to the
palliative care section.
</P>
<P>
   ''That usually means they don't want any acute care, any blood
tests, any invasive treatments, they want support,'' Waram said.
''They've accepted the fact that death is imminent.''
</P>
<P>
   Another 13 victims of the contamination that emerged after a
storm flooded the area on May 12 have been airlifted to the London,
Ontario, Health Sciences Centers. Eleven of the transported
patients were children, and five remained in critical condition
with kidney problems.
</P>
<P>
   Waram noted her hospital received 30 visits Sunday from people
complaining of E. coli symptoms, compared to 56 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''My sense is that the worst is over, certainly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in another Ontario community that was placed under a
boil order after traces of E. coli showed up in its water said the
problem appeared to be isolated and controlled. There was not
believed to be any connection between the bacteria detected in
Freelton and the Walkerton contamination 60 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks carrying bottled water moved through Walkerton on Sunday,
with volunteers carrying the donated cases to doorsteps in some
areas. Church services focused on forgiveness amid reports that the
local water utility knew of the problem as soon as May 18 but never
notified health officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody messed up,'' the Rev. Suzanne Hollands told her
Anglican congregation. ''But we all make mistakes, even mistakes
that cause death. There is so much pain, but we know we all have to
stick together.''
</P>
<P>
   The intestinal bacteria, often spread through animal or human
feces, may have entered the town wells in flooding that followed
the May 12 storm. City officials have acknowledged the chlorinating
system on one of the town's two main wells had been malfunctioning
for weeks before people started getting sick.
</P>
<P>
   A provincial water agency has taken control of the local water
utility, and police, health and environmental officials are
investigating the contamination. At least one class-action lawsuit
has been filed on behalf of victims, but many residents say they
think seeking legal action is premature.
</P>
<P>
   Garry Palmateer of GAP EnviroMicrobial Services said his company
found another bacteria in the town's water supply as far back as
January. Palmateer said the finding showed surface water was
seeping into the town wells, and that he notified local and Ontario
officials about the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Environment Ministry spokesman John Steele has confirmed the
ministry received similar test results in early May from a
different company.
</P>
<P>
   In Ottawa, Prime Minister Jean Chretien commended the people of
Walkerton for their courage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to make sure that situations like that do not arrive
again in our country,'' he said.

Pakistan: Kashmir Is Key to Peace
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Marking the second anniversary of Pakistan's
nuclear tests, army ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf said Sunday that Pakistan and
India have to settle their dispute over Kashmir to remove ''the threat of a
nuclear holocaust.'' The military chief said he has repeatedly offered talks
with neighboring India to settle the long-running dispute, which sparked a
bitter border battle last summer and has led to two full-scale wars in recent
decades. ''We don't want the people of South Asia to live under the threat of a
nuclear holocaust,'' Musharraf said. ''But India shouldn't take our offer as a
sign of weakness.''

   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Dissident members of Northern Ireland's
major Protestant party lost no time Sunday in declaring their resistance to a
soon-to-be restored administration that includes members of the IRA-allied Sinn

Britain's plan for reforming the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's
police force, which many Catholics despise. Sinn Fein says reform plans are
inadequate. The Ulster Unionists' narrow approval Saturday of a return to
power-sharing cleared the way for Britain to restore the administrative
authority it suspended in February over the refusal of the outlawed Irish
Republican Army to disarm.

<HEADLINE> Costly Fuel Forces Coast Guard Cuts  </HEADLINE>
By MARY LEE GRANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEABROOK, Texas (AP) -- Coast Guard boats that should be
patrolling the Texas coast for safety violations are docked in
Galveston. In Houston, helicopters that usually fly daily searches
for drug smugglers are on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   All along the Texas coast and into the Midwest, rising fuel
costs have forced the Coast Guard to cut back nearly every type of
patrol but search-and-rescue missions by about 25 percent,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no other recourse,'' said Rear Adm. Paul Pluta, whose
Eighth Coast Guard District covers 26 states and includes 1,200
miles of Gulf Coast and 10,300 miles of navigable rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices have increased dramatically in recent months,
reaching $34 a barrel in March, almost $10 higher than in January.
Prices were down to about $28 a barrel this month, but the Coast
Guard still needs more money to make up for higher costs.
</P>
<P>
   Covering the cost of the higher fuel prices for the Eighth
District would take between $700,000 and $1.3 million, Pluta said.
It's just the latest funding problem for a Coast Guard that's still
using boats and planes dating back to the Vietnam era and before,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is discussing the possibility of appropriating more
money to make up for the shortfall, but it could takes weeks, Pluta
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all the budget surplus out there, the Coast Guard should
be given the money to do their job,'' said Frank Reynolds, 51, who
keeps a 54-foot motorboat in Seabrook.
</P>
<P>
   The cutbacks will mean fewer patrols for boating safety
violations, less frequent maintenance of channel markers and less
time spent enforcing environmental regulations for fishing and
shrimping boats, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In Galveston, the marine safety unit has reduced offshore
flights and consolidated harbor patrols from three days a week to
one, Lt. Marie Byrd said. In general, Coast Guard units have
stopped routine safety patrols, but are responding to any reports
of wrongdoing, Byrd said.
</P>
<P>
   The effects stretch beyond the Texas Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the buoys aren't maintained, it could cause us problems,''
said Dave Harms of Lake City, Minn., who boats on the upper
Mississippi River. ''The barges are having enough trouble with low
waters.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrimper Jody Collins, 53, said a lessening of the Coast Guard's
presence around Seabrook may not be such a bad thing. Shrimpers
already comply with environmental regulations, he said, and the
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department duplicates many Coast Guard
services, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just a way for the Coast Guard to get more money,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas, other safety patrols and police organization will
be able to make up for the cut backs. In New Orleans, Benton Brown,
harbormaster for the Southern Yacht Club, said his yacht club can
rely on the sheriff's department patrolling the northern half Lake
Pontchartrain and local police patrolling the southern half.
</P>
<P>
   Search and rescue operations will remain the first priority,
Pluta said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pacific Northwest, Chief Warrant Officer Chris Haley said
Sunday that the shortage is theoretical, so far. But he said his
13th District was fortunate that it had some financial cushion
built in.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've told us to be prepared for operational cuts, and right
now we're looking at our budget to see where we can cut, what we
can cut, and still provide the best service to the public,'' Haley
said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Woods Hole, Mass., the station involved in the
recovery of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane, had used so much of its
budget it was sending patrols only in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Coast Guard address in March, Coast Guard
Commandant, Admiral James M. Loy, said he was working with Congress
and government agencies to increase funding.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard is feeling the pinch from funding shortages, and
that could mean more cutbacks in some non-essential services, Jack
O'dell, a Coast Guard spokesman in Washington, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''People don't realize we have 34,000 people patrolling 144,000
miles of shoreline,'' O'Dell said. ''If it's not a life-threatening
situation, we have to ask how much involvement from the Coast Guard
there should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Davidson, director of the Corpus Christi Marina in Texas,
said the Coast Guard's presence is necessary. It is already
difficult to reach the Coast Guard in his area, even in times of
emergency, he said.
</P>

to call a salvage company.''

<HEADLINE> Stevens Recalls Lindros Hit  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- From the moment the topic turned to
hitting and Eric Lindros' name was mentioned, it was obvious Scott
Stevens was uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   His eyes seemed to glisten and it took a couple of seconds for
the New Jersey Devils captain to decide Sunday whether he wanted to
discuss the crushing hit on Lindros, one that has been seen over
and over in replays since Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was still being talked about two days before the Devils open
the Stanley Cup finals at home against the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, who had just returned to the Philadelphia Flyers last
Wednesday after missing 10 weeks with a series of concussions,
skated into the Devils' zone with the puck early in Game 7 of the
Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   What Lindros didn't see was Stevens. He had No. 88 lined up and
caught him flush in a jaw with a devastating check in which he led
with his triceps. Lindros appeared unconscious even before the back
of his helmet hit the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very hard, it's tough,'' Stevens said Sunday in recalling
the play and knowing how bad he felt. ''It's something I don't like
to think about and I try to put it behind me and go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens then explained why he didn't hesitate to check Lindros,
who has had four concussions in the last five months and was
looking down at the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an important time and the way Eric played in his first
game back (on Wednesday), he was their best player, which is
unbelievable being off 10 weeks,'' Stevens said. ''Coming into Game
7, I'm thinking there is one player on that team that can win that
game and it could have been him.''
</P>
<P>
   So when Stevens had the opportunity to check Lindros coming into
the Devils zone 7:50 after the opening faceoff, he hit him.
</P>
<P>
   While one or two Flyers complained it was a dirty hit, replays
showed Stevens caught Lindros mostly with his upper arm and
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   That's the same way Stevens hit Pavel Bure of Florida in the
opening round and Tomas Kaberle and Kevyn Adams of Toronto in the
second. It's the same way he'll treat anyone on the Stars in the
next few weeks with hockey's biggest prize on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hitting is part of the game,'' Stevens said. ''That's the
bottom line. I get hit and I'm going to give a hit. This is an
important time. I have been playing physical the whole playoffs and
I think everyone knows I'm not going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens has always been physical, whether it was playing hockey
and football (middle linebacker) or just being around his family
growing up in Kitchener, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   '''I have two brothers (Mike and Geoff), we were all a year
apart, so there was a lot of fighting going on in our house,''
Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens also isn't immune to hits. The worst one he took was in
the 1994 playoffs against Boston when he was hit behind the net by
Bryan Smolinski.
</P>
<P>
   ''I skated to the bench, sat on the bench and then went to the
dressing room and the next thing I knew I was on the medical
table,'' Stevens said. ''I guess I was unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a scary feeling,'' added the 6-foot-1, 215-pounder.
''When I woke up I asked (current Devils assistant coach) Bobby
Carpenter why he wasn't playing. He was hurt and he wasn't playing
in the game, but I didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Devils coach Larry Robinson wishes everyone would stop bringing
up the Lindros hit. While it was unfortunate, it was clean.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson also knows how much it bothered Stevens on Friday. For
a while it got him out of his game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to relate a little bit because the same thing happened
to me, so I know how it felt putting a guy out of a game,'' said
Robinson, whose hip check on Edmonton's Craig Simpson hastened the
end of his career. ''It's not a great feeling. It's not maliciously
done. This is a physical game and it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The one hope the Devils have is that it somehow doesn't stop
Stevens from being himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''Scotty will be fine,'' Devils veteran Randy McKay said.
''Scotty is a great leader. I'm sure he felt for Eric a little bit,
but it's part of the game. I'm sure he'll do the same thing if he
can catch someone else. That's the game. It was clean. I'm not
worried about him at all.''

<HEADLINE> 2 Arraigned in Wendy's Shooting  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two men accused of the execution-style slayings
of five people during a robbery at a Wendy's restaurant -- one of
the most shocking crimes in recent New York memory -- were charged
Sunday with multiple counts of murder, attempted robbery and
weapons possession.
</P>
<P>
   Queens Assistant District Attorney Greg Lasak described in
chilling detail how John Taylor, 36, and Craig Godineaux, 30,
allegedly bound and gagged their victims with duct tape, then
executed them one by one.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were marched single file into a big freezer box. They
were told to get on their knees, and they were each shot by the
defendants once in the head,'' Lasak said, his voice filled with
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Lasak told Queens Criminal Court Judge Michael Aloise that the
defendants had given videotaped statements admitting the shootings
at the fast-food restaurant in Queens last Wednesday night. In
addition, he said, witnesses picked them out of a police lineup,
and detectives seized money, a security tape from the restaurant's
camera and other evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The evidence we have to tie these defendants to the case is
overwhelming,'' Lasak said.
</P>
<P>
   All seven people shot were employees of the restaurant. Five
were killed and two others survived with wounds, one of them by
playing dead until the bandits left.
</P>
<P>
   Queens District Attorney Richard Brown has 120 days to decide
whether to seek the death penalty. Brown, who has twice before
recommended the death penalty, said he would use the time to
investigate, talk to victims' families and evaluate the defendants'
backgrounds, state of mind and mental capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision in regard to the death penalty is a decision I do
not take lightly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown refused to comment on media reports that Taylor had said,
''no witnesses,'' as his reason for shooting the workers after
taking $2,300. Most of the money, recovered at Taylor's house, was
in coins, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
   Aloise set the next hearing for June 26 and remanded the pair
without bail. Lasak asked for no bail, saying there was ''no
greater risk of flight'' than a potential death penalty.
Court-appointed attorneys John Youngblood and Heidi Segal reserved
the right to request bail in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the lesser charges, Taylor and Godineaux were
each charged with: 10 counts of murder in the first degree (five
counts for murder committed during the course of another felony and
five counts for murder that resulted in the deaths of two or more
people) and 10 counts of murder in the second degree (five counts
for murder committed during the course of another felony and five
counts for intentional murder).
</P>
<P>
   Taylor later was placed on suicide watch, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, a short, heavyset man, stood during the proceeding,
staring straight ahead. Godineaux, tall and lanky, gazed at the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who appeared to be a friend of Godineaux walked in and
out of the courtroom, wearing a red sweater over her head. She
refused to identify herself to reporters, but as the defendants
were led away, she cried out, ''I love you, Craig,'' broke down in
sobs and wailed, ''Oh, God.''
</P>
<P>
   Police say Taylor was a fugitive who jumped bail in a previous
fast-food robbery and had a record stretching back to 1996, when he
was accused of trying to break into a safe at a McDonald's where he
was assistant manager, and sentenced to five years probation.
</P>
<P>
   In one week last June, he was linked to robberies or attempted
robberies at four fast-food businesses in Queens.

<HEADLINE> Brewers 4, Diamondbacks 3, 11 Ins.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Marquis Grissom hit an RBI single in the 11th
inning and the Milwaukee Brewers stopped Arizona's team-record
11-game home winning streak, beating the Diamondbacks 4-3 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers had lost four in a row. Jeromy Burnitz hit a solo
home run in the eighth into the right-field pool area, tying it at
3.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Tony Womack extended his hitting streak to 23 games,
longest in the majors this season. Erubiel Durazo drove in two runs
for the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Swindell (1-1) retired the first two batters in the Brewers
11th. Charlie Hayes then walked, moved to second on a single by
Jose Hernandez and scored on Grissom's single.
</P>
<P>
   Grissom drove in three runs. He had an RBI double and a
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wickman (2-1) pitched the final two innings for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Burnitz's 13th home run was a two-out shot off Brian Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee took a 1-0 lead in the second as Hayes scored on
Grissom's sacrifice fly. The Diamondbacks tied it in the bottom
half on Turner Ward's RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona loaded the bases in the third against Jamey Wright on a
pair of singles and a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Wright nearly escaped the jam, striking out Matt Williams and
Steve Finley, but Durazo dribbled a single through the right side
of the infield to make it 3-1. Jay Bell scored on the play, the
1,000th run of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Grissom cut the lead to 3-2 in the fourth with an RBI double
just inside third base.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, making his second start since coming off the disabled
list, allowed three runs and seven hits in six innings. He struck
out five, including the side in the third inning, and walked two.
Notes: Anderson's last loss came July 19 at Seattle in the
second-ever game at Safeco Field. The Diamondbacks had won 18
straight games started by the left-hander. ... Burnitz was in an
0-for-10 slump before he singled in the fourth. ... Hayes finished
3-for-4 and is 8-for-18 lifetime against Anderson.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori Appears To Have Lead  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori risked
international isolation and violent protests in his quest Sunday
for a third term in a runoff election boycotted by his rival and
characterized as tainted by foreign monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The first independent vote projection gave Fujimori a large lead
over challenger Alejandro Toledo, but said 30.6 percent of the
ballots had been annulled.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori led with 49.6 percent of the ballot to 15 percent for
Toledo with an additional 4.8 percent of the ballots left blank,
according to the respected polling firm CPI.
</P>
<P>
   The projection was based on an unofficial vote count but no
margin of error was provided. First official results were expected
later Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Voters lined up by the hundreds to cast ballots in Lima and
around the country, disregarding challenger Alejandro Toledo's call
to stay away from the polls. Peruvians faced fines if they did not
vote, but many said they planned to mark ''no to fraud'' on their
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Naturally I'm going to void my vote, a vote of protest,
because what we want is to regain democracy,'' said Gerardo
Cantano, 52, an out-of-work accountant. ''We've never seen this
before, a president clinging so tightly to power. He's bringing us
economic isolation. There will be no foreign investment.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke in La Victoria, an inner city working-class
neighborhood in Lima with high unemployment. Posters of Fujimori's
smiling face hung from lampposts on the street outside the school
where people voted. Polls closed late Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As elsewhere, soldiers and police patrolled the nearby streets
to control any outbreak of violent protests by anti-Fujimori
demonstrators. As the day wore on, officers used tear gas and water
cannons to disperse small groups of protesters who tried to gather
in plazas in downtown Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, who came to power in 1990, counted on solid support
among Peru's poor majority to deliver certain victory and weather
the international storm provoked by the refusal of election
officials to delay the disputed poll.
</P>
<P>
   His support is solid in the sprawling shantytowns on Lima's
outskirts, where he has paved streets, installed electricity, built
schools and provided soup kitchens for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   In Lurigancho, located among barren, dusty foothills on Lima's
eastern outskirts, large red-and-white letters painted on the
school's front wall said ''Fujimori Gets Things Done!''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Marin, 40, waiting in line to vote with two small
daughters in tow, agreed with the message.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is the only one to get things done for us,'' she said,
repeating Fujimori's campaign slogan. ''He paved the streets, fixed
up the schools. More than anything, he is with the people. When it
rains, he gets his feet muddy.''
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year-old Fujimori, dubbed ''The Emperor'' for his
autocratic style but with a common touch that appeals to Peru's
poor, ignored the boycott by Toledo, violent street protests and
the withdrawal of foreign monitors who warned a fair vote could not
be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori was seeking a third five-year term despite a
constitutional ban on three consecutive terms. On the eve of the
vote, Toledo said the refusal of election officials to postpone the
runoff ''announced the death of democracy in Peru.''
</P>
<P>
   But after casting his ballot in Lima, Fujimori smiled amid a
crush of supporters and insisted ''the absence of observer missions
doesn't take away from the validity'' of the election.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Toledo had not formally removed himself from the
race or election officials would have already proclaimed a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an election in which there are two candidates because
Mr. Toledo has not withdrawn. If he had withdrawn, then there
wouldn't be an election,'' Fujimori said.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted Sunday's vote ''will demonstrate to the
international community that this is a clean and fair election and
there is no coercion of any kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said he would refuse to recognize any Fujimori victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fujimori is going through the second round alone. We are now
starting the third round, a round for democracy,'' said Toledo, who
added he didn't cast a ballot. ''We have called for peaceful
resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo also disputed the fairness of the runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here you have a soccer game in which one of the teams is owner
of the field, writes the rules of the game, chooses the referees,
decides when the game starts and ends and decides which news media
will broadcast it. You know ahead of time who is going to win,'' he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo spent the afternoon in a poor district of unpaved streets
and cement-block homes where hundreds of people gathered, lofting
banners and shouting ''Toledo, president!'' repeatedly as dozens of
police looked on.
</P>
<P>
   Promising jobs and capitalizing on his Indian appearance, the
54-year-old Toledo made a surprising surge in the first round. But
Fujimori fought back, depicting the U.S.-trained economist as a
populist who would plunge the country back into the political chaos
and hyperinflation of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori won 49.9 percent of the first-round ballot, just shy of
the majority he needed to avoid a runoff against Toledo, who
collected 40.2 percent and afterward complained that fraud
prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   But election officials disregarded growing international
pressure to postpone the final round in order to evaluate new
software for tabulating votes. In the first round, election
officials were unable to explain how the number of ballots cast
exceeded the number of voters by more than 1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   More than 14 million Peruvians were registered to vote.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, President Clinton made a last appeal to Peru to
postpone the runoff. He warned that relations with Peru
''inevitably will be affected'' if there is fraud.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Offers Bush Pentagon Access  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM C. MANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen offered George
W. Bush access to the same Pentagon information Vice President Al
Gore is privy to, saying that would keep politics out of national
security and produce a more informed debate in the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, a Republican like Bush, said Sunday he believes proposals
the Texas governor made last week likely would lead to dangerous
new arms races. Gore had similar criticisms Saturday in a speech at
the U.S. Military Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said President Clinton appointed a Republican as defense
secretary ''to take the politics out of national security
debates.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that national security will not become politicized,
because it's too important to have a Republican or Democratic label
on it,'' he said on NBC's ''Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Cohen said, ''It would be beneficial for (Bush and
his advisers) to have this information today, before the election,
so that there can be a real serious and solid debate on the
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said Cohen's implication
that the GOP candidate might be ill-informed on security ignores
the quality of his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Surely Secretary Cohen is not suggesting that Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, who led our (national)
defenses, don't understand them,'' Tucker said. ''We are confident
that the Joint Chiefs of Staff would welcome Gov. Bush's proposal,
because it allows military planners to be involved in determining
the appropriate levels of security based on new guidance in a new
security era.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush proposed last week that the United States develop a
national missile defense system and sharply cut back the number of
nuclear weapons in its arsenal even if Russia does not. Bush would
renegotiate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to allow the
national missile defense, which the treaty bans.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration wants a more limited missile defense
and would implement smaller, negotiated and bilateral reductions in
nuclear stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton heads to Moscow this week where he will discuss with
Russian President Vladimir Putin a framework agreement already in
place to reduce the missile levels to 2,000 to 2,500, from current
levels of 3,000 to 3,500 missiles, Cohen said. Cuts much larger
than that could hamstring U.S. policy in ''a tyranny of numbers,''
the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could find yourself in a situation where you're forced to
'use it or lose it,' which is something we don't want to be in
position to do,'' he said. ''It may force you to change your
strategy as far as targeting not strategic assets but humans, which
we don't want to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''And then the third component of that is, as you get smaller,
you may have to give up some of your bomber force, which takes away
from your conventional capability, the kind of capability we used
in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, lowering missile numbers forces development of ''a much
more robust defense system,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That contradicts entirely the need for the Russians and others
to lower the numbers, because any ... military commander will tell
you it's far better to have more numbers against a defense than to
have a higher defense,'' Cohen said. ''And so what you do by going
up higher in defense, you will force the Russians and others to
raise their limits much higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he believes that would encourage Russia, China,
Pakistan, India and other countries to develop more nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Such ''internal inconsistency'' in nuclear policy should be
considered carefully, Cohen said, ''and ... in order to make it
fair, I think Governor Bush should have an opportunity to meet with
the joint chiefs, meet with Admiral (Richard) Mies, who is
commander of the Strategic Command, ... so we can deal with the
situation as it is and likely to be.
</P>
<P>
   ''And then I think that he and Vice President Gore will be in a
better position to debate this in a way that's responsible and, I
think, informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidates normally receive security briefings
after they are nominated. The GOP convention is July 31-Aug. 3 in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   In other matters, Cohen said:
</P>
<P>
   --There will be a ''national moment of remembrance'' at 3 p.m. on
Memorial Day for Americans to remember and ''commemorate those who
have died on our behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   --His spokesmen, Kenneth Bacon, ''made a big mistake'' when he
released information from Linda Tripp's personnel file to a
reporter in 1998. Tripp, who secretly recorded conversations with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, worked for Bacon in the
Pentagon's public affairs office.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could have fired him, but I took into account his total
service to the public,'' said Cohen, who sent his aide a letter
''to express my disappointment'' in his judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also dismissed talk of a conspiracy coordinated with the
White House or executive branch. ''This was done spontaneous on his
part.''
</P>
<P>
   --He intends to return to private life after December. Asked what
he would do if Gore asked him to be his running mate, Cohen said:
''That is a product of irrational exuberance on the part of some of
my friends.'' He said he intends to return to private life after
December.

Fujimori Appears Headed for Victory
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Alberto Fujimori on Sunday appeared headed for a third
term as Peru's president, with poll projections giving him a wide lead in
elections boycotted by his rival and characterized as tainted by foreign
monitors. The first independent vote projection gave Fujimori a large lead over
challenger Alejandro Toledo, but said 30.6 percent of the ballots had been
annulled. Fujimori led with 49.6 percent of the ballot to 15 percent for Toledo
with an additional 4.8 percent of the ballots left blank, according to the
respected polling firm CPI.

Costly Fuel Forces Coast Guard Cuts
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEABROOK, Texas (AP) -- All along the Texas coast and into the Midwest,
rising fuel costs have forced the Coast Guard to cut back nearly every type of
patrol but search-and-rescue missions by about 25 percent, officials said. ''I
had no other recourse,'' said Rear Adm. Paul Pluta, whose Eighth Coast Guard
District covers 26 states and includes 1,200 miles of Gulf Coast and 10,300
miles of navigable rivers. Oil prices have increased dramatically in recent
months, reaching $34 a barrel in March, almost $10 higher than in January.
Prices were down to about $28 a barrel this month, but the Coast Guard still
needs more money to make up for higher costs.

   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Two climbers were missing today after an avalanche
on Mount Foraker in Denali National Park and Preserve. National Park Service
spokeswoman Jane Tranel said another team of climbers witnessed a mass of ice
give way and heard screams and shouts at about the 8,000-foot level of the
mountain early this morning. The two missing climbers, whose names have not been
released, were going up a route known as the Infinite Spur, a steep route of ice

Pakistan: Kashmir Is Key to Peace
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Marking the second anniversary of Pakistan's
nuclear tests, army ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf said Sunday that Pakistan and
India have to settle their dispute over Kashmir to remove ''the threat of a
nuclear holocaust.'' The military chief said he has repeatedly offered talks
with neighboring India to settle the long-running dispute, which sparked a
bitter border battle last summer and has led to two full-scale wars in recent
decades. ''We don't want the people of South Asia to live under the threat of a
nuclear holocaust,'' Musharraf said. ''But India shouldn't take our offer as a
sign of weakness.''

S. Leone Rebels Release U.N. Hostages

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Sierra Leonean rebels on Sunday freed what
appeared to be the last of some 500 U.N. hostages seized earlier this month,
signaling ''a positive change of direction'' among the rebels toward bringing
peace to the war-torn West African nation, a U.N. spokesman said. Eighty-five
former captives arrived in Freetown Sunday night from Monrovia, the capital of
neighboring Liberia, said U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst. A senior Liberian
military official who spoke on condition he not be named said more freed
hostages were still on the Sierra Leone-Liberia border and would be flown out on
Monday.

Juan Montoya Wins Indy 500

   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Juan Montoya made a dominating detour from auto racing's
civil war today with an Indianapolis 500 victory that was the strongest case yet
for which side is best. Montoya, the defending champion of the more established
Championship Auto Racing Teams series, made car owner Chip Ganassi's decision to
return to Indy after a four-year absence look brilliant. The 24-year-old
Colombian fended off a late challenge from 1996 Indy winner Buddy Lazier, passed
teammate Jimmy Vasser to retake the lead 21 laps from the end and raced on to
become the first Indianapolis rookie to win since Graham Hill in 1966.

the Portland Trail Blazers today and is just one victory away from the NBA
Finals. In his biggest game of the playoffs, Glen Rice scored 21 points, 12 in
the decisive third quarter, as the Lakers swept two on the road from the
Blazers. Los Angeles leads the best-of-seven series 3-1 and can advance to the
finals for the first time since 1991 with a homecourt victory Tuesday night.

<HEADLINE> Strike Might Cause Grand Prix Chaos  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- The city of Montreal faces a three-day traffic
nightmare during next month's Formula One Grand Prix weekend -- the
dates selected for a strike by public transit workers.
</P>
<P>
   The workers voted overwhelmingly Sunday in favor of the strike,
threatening to make life miserable for 115,000 spectators expected
at the track on Notre Dame Island, just outside the city center,
from June 16-18.
</P>
<P>
   Even with additional public transportation last year, traffic
backlogs for the event exceeded one hour at some times.
</P>
<P>
   About 98 percent of 2,000 unionized workers voted to pressure
the transit corporation into returning to the bargaining table
after contract negotiations broke down six weeks ago over employer
pension contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have gotten nowhere since the (corporation) ended
negotiations April 15,'' union president Gaetan Chateauneuf said.
''This is a first move to make a big impact on the employer without
affecting workday commuters as much.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether they will be allowed to strike during the Grand Prix
is up to Quebec's Essential Services Council.
</P>
<P>
   Neither buses nor the subway can run without the mechanics,
electricians and other workers responsible for ensuring the
maintenance and safety of the public transportation system.
</P>
<P>
   A previous agreement with drivers excluded public transit on
normal weekends from the list of essential services.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Odile Paradis, spokeswoman for the transit
corporation, the sheer number of people depending on the subway
makes Grand Prix weekend an exception.
</P>
<P>
   ''We transport 20,000 people per hour during the Grand Prix,''
Paradis said. ''Without a (subway), what's the solution? There are
no boats, no trains and access for cars is limited. The traffic
jams would be horrendous.''
</P>
<P>
   But Paradis was not so much concerned with spectators'
convenience as with their safety.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the event of an emergency, the (subway) is the only way to
evacuate the island and traffic jams would make it impossible for
fire trucks or ambulances to get through,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The impasse began in January when the transit corporation
announced it would stop paying the $30 million annual contribution
to employees' pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   The employer said the fund had more money than allowed by law
and wanted to use excess funds to improve the transit system,
triggering several protests and work slowdowns.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Sunday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Red Sox-Yankees:
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON: Boston's bullpen anticipated an easy night with Pedro
Martinez starting. He had gone seven or more innings in all nine
starts this season. Opponents were batting .167 against him, lowest
average against any pitcher, and .054 with runners in scoring
position. ... Martinez's 1.19 ERA is a major part of Red Sox' 3.55
team ERA, which leads both leagues. Boston has not led the majors
in ERA since 1914.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: New York's bullpen leads majors with just four home
runs allowed. Yankees relievers also lead in ERA (2.71) and fewest
hits allowed (112). ... Outfielder-DH Felix Jose is close to being
reinstated from the disabled list. Jose went on the DL April 30,
his first day on the roster, with a strained left groin.
Mariners-Devil Rays:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: After hitting first-inning leadoff homers in his
previous three starts against Tampa Bay, Rickey Henderson grounded
out to start Sunday's game. The Mariners' next hitter, Mike
Cameron, hit a solo homer off Albie Lopez. ... LHP Jamie Moyer,
sidelined since April 15 by a shoulder injury, reported no problems
after pitching a simulated game Saturday and is scheduled to start
Friday against San Diego. ... John Mabry, who allowed two runs and
three hits in two-thirds of an inning, joined infielder Manny
Castillo as the only Mariner position players to pitch in a game.
Castillo gave up seven runs and eight hits -- including three homers
-- over 2 2-3 innings on June 26, 1983 against Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: LF Greg Vaughn (strained right hamstring) was out of
the starting lineup for the second straight game. ''It's still sore
.. it's not an overnight thing,'' manager Larry Rothschild said.
''It's not going to be a quick decision to put him on the DL or not
because of what he means to this time.'' ... OF Randy Winn was
recalled from Triple-A Durham and batted leadoff. It was the first
time this season someone other than Gerald Williams, who batted
second, hit in that spot. ... OF Quinton McCracken was optioned to
Triple-A Durham. ... RHP Cory Lidle may get his first start of the
season Wednesday against Baltimore.
Blue Jays-Tigers:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: The Blue Jays have not lost a season series to Detroit
since 1995. Last season they were 10-2 against the Tigers, their
second-best year ever against Detroit, topped only by an 11-2 mark
in 1989. The Blue Jays have 154 wins over Detroit in their history,
the most over any AL opponent. They have 150 wins over Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: 1B Tony Clark, on the DL since May 13 with a strained
left rib cage, has started swinging a bat again. He hit off a tee
Sunday and planned to take some swings against soft toss on Monday.
Clark said he might try some live batting practice Tuesday.
Rangers-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: The Rangers allowed 20 runs in the first two games of the
series against the Twins, the most given up in a two-game span
since surrendering 26 against Oakland on May 5-6.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: Coco and Kelly Miller, twins from Rochester, Minn.,
who played together on the Georgia women's basketball team, were
part of ''Twins Day'' at the Metrodome. About 500 sets of twins
were expected to attend the game. ... The Twins, who had won only
four season series from the Rangers in the last 12 years, have
already won both series from Texas this season.
Indians-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: Manager Charlie Manuel said RHP Jim Brower will start
Monday at home against Anaheim. Brower gets the call in place of
Paul Rigdon, who went on the disabled list Saturday with a strained
left oblique muscle. ... RHP Sean DePaula will be examined Monday
by doctors to see why he's had lingering arm pain since spring
training. ... The Indians currently have five pitchers on the
disabled list and have made 16 roster moves in the last 11 days.
''Every since day one of the season, we've never been able to get
out five-man rotation going,'' Manuel said. ''We've never got it
set. Once we get it organized and set, we can beat anybody in our
division.'' ... The Indians stole a season-high four bases Sunday
and avoided their first sweep by the White Sox since 1995. ... Omar
Vizquel stole a base Sunday and is now tied with Elmer Flick for
fifth in Indian history with 207. ... Robbie Alomar played Sunday
despite a painful sprained left wrist that he had X-rayed Sunday
morning. Alomar had a pair of RBI doubles and made a nice stop on a
hard-hit grounder by Chris Singleton.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: There's a fungus in the infield. That's the story at
Comiskey Park, where the grounds crew began removing the grass
immediately after Sunday's game with Cleveland had ended. Because
there have been so many rainy days and the field had to be covered
by a tarp so often, a fungus developed ... First baseman Paul
Konerko missed the entire Indians series after fouling a pitch off
his foot Thursday. Konerko was in so much pain that he had a second
X-ray taken. It revealed no break just a deep bone bruise. Konerko
was able to take 75 swings in the batting cage Sunday.
Athletics-Orioles:
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: The Athletics expect to play Sunday's rainout as part
of a doubleheader in September, giving them 18 games over a 17-day
period. ''The fact that it's in September makes it easier to take
because we'll have expanded rosters by then,'' assistant GM Paul
DePodesta said. ... Omar Olivares, the scheduled starter Sunday,
will pitch against the Yankees on Monday. It might be a good thing,
given that the right-hander is 2-4 lifetime against Baltimore,
including 0-1 this season. ... Sunday's washout left Oakland with a
split of the two-game series. The A's are 5-1-2 in road series this
year.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: Injured catcher Charles Johnson got a free day of
rest and hopes to return to the lineup Monday. He hasn't played
since being hit in the groin with a foul ball on Friday night. ...
Baltimore finished the homestand 4-1. ... Despite their 21-26
record, the Orioles are still three games better than last year
after 47 games under former manager Ray Miller. ... Pat Rapp,
slated to pitch Sunday before the game was called by rain, will
face Tampa Bay on Monday night. ... The Orioles have given up 35
homers in May, allowing at least one homer in 19 of 23 games.
Angels-Royals:
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: The last time the Angels hit three straight home runs
was at Boston on April 24, 1984, when Reggie Jackson, Bobby Grich
and Brian Downing all went deep. Sunday's victory allowed the
Angels to avoid their first three-game losing streak of the season.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: These last six games marked the only time the
Royals will play at home in a 32-day stretch from May 8-June 8. ...
After the game the Royals designated LHP Paul Spoljaric for
assignment and brought up C Gregg Zaun from Triple-A Omaha.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Braves-Astros
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Fans weren't the only ones who appreciated Enron
Field's roof being closed for their air-conditioned comfort for the
second straight day Sunday. ''I like it closed better,'' Braves
third baseman Chipper Jones said. ''There is a lot of wind that
comes in here and swirls around with the roof open. That makes a
difference, not to mention the heat and humidity. It's better for
the fans. They deserve to watch the game in comfort.'' Gametime
temperature Sunday was 83 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Tal's Hill, the 30-degree hill that slopes up to the
center field wall at Enron Field, isn't getting good early reviews
from visiting teams. Atlanta's Andruw Jones had to make consecutive
climbs in Friday's game on long fly balls. Astros president Tal
Smith, for whom the hill is named, thinks it will catch on. ''I
think as players become familiar with it they'll adjust and do just
fine,'' Smith said. ''They got used to the hills at Crosley Field
and at Fenway and those hills were steeper than ours. It was
unusual that Andruw had to make two runs in a row, but he'll get
used to it.''
Pirates-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: C Jason Kendall went 3-for-4 Sunday to extend his
hitting streak to 13 games. He was 8-for-13 in the series. ...
Pittsburgh pinch-hitters have one hit in their last 20 at-bats.
Pirates leadoff hitters aren't faring much better, mired in a
2-for-29 slump. ... First-inning woes continued for LHP Jimmy
Anderson. He gave up five runs and five hits against Colorado and
has allowed at least one first-inning run in six straight starts.
He is 0-3 over that period and manager Gene Lamont said he will be
skipped in the starting rotation. ... OF Brian Giles hit a solo
homer that was caught by a fan just beyond the center field fence.
Rockies center fielder Tom Goodwin nearly made the catch but
admitted he probably did not have a chance regardless of the fan's
action. ''He kept apologizing to me every inning,'' Goodwin said.
''I was like, 'Don't worry about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: OF Jeffrey Hammonds did not play Sunday after
straining his left hip flexor Saturday when he slammed into the
wall in foul territory along the first-base line. ... The Rockies
got encouraging news when OF Larry Walker threw for a second
straight day as he recovers from an elbow injury. ... LHP Scott
Karl was demoted to the bullpen after a third straight shaky start.
The Rockies will use a four-man rotation until June 6, when LHP
Brian Bohanon likely will start at Seattle. ... Colorado has held
its opponents to less than 10 runs in 12 straight home games, the
longest such streak since going 13 games from July 10-12, 1998.
Mets-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Monday's expected starter, Al Leiter, is 5-0 with a
3.31 ERA. He has struck out 33 batters in his last 31 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Ray Lankford needs one walk to tie Rogers Hornsby for
sixth on the Cardinals all-time list with 660. He's two home runs
away from Hornsby (193) for third on the team career home run list.
... The Cardinals go on the road Monday, opening a four-game series
against Arizona. St. Louis then returns to Busch Stadium for the
start of interleague play. ... Garrett Stephenson (7-0) is the
expected starter Monday against the Diamondbacks. He's getting the
highest run support, 5.8 per game, of any of St. Louis' five
starters.
Marlins-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Cliff Floyd has reached base in a career-high 26
consecutive games. ... Luis Castillo stole second and third after
leading off the third inning with a single, and added No. 22 in the
seventh by stealing second. Castillo has failed to reach base only
once in 33 games.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Former Braves closer Mark Wohlers is scheduled to
begin a minor league rehab assignment by pitching one inning Monday
for the Reds' Triple-A affiliate in Dayton. Wohlers tore a ligament
in his right elbow and had reconstructive surgery last July. ...
About 3,500 fans came to Cinergy Field early for Camera Day, when
they were allowed to go onto the field to snap photos of Reds
players up close.
Phillies-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Left-hander Randy Wolf's start on Sunday marked
his first appearance at Dodger Stadium since his final high school
game in 1994, when he pitched a complete game victory for El Camino
Real in the L.A. City Championship game and earned MVP honors. The
native of Canoga Park, Calif. might have been a tad nervous -- he
hit his first batter, F.P. Santangelo, with his second pitch. ...
The Phillies, who have scored fewer runs than any team except the
Detroit Tigers, left the bases twice on Sunday. They have stranded
three baserunners 14 times this season. ... Ron Gant ended an
0-for-16 drought Sunday with a third-inning double against Carlos
Perez. ...
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: 3B Adrian Beltre, who strained his right hamstring
running out a grounder to second base in Saturday night's 7-6 loss,
will be placed on the 15-day disabled list Monday, retroactive to
Sunday. Dave Hansen and Jose Vizcaino will fill in until the
three-year veteran returns from his first trip to the DL. ...
Former Brooklyn Dodgers Cy Young winner Don Newcombe, now the
team's director of community relations, said Sunday that his
reaction to a teammate being assaulted by a fan in the stands would
have been no different than that of Chad Kreuter's in Chicago on
May 16. ''There's no doubt about it. I'd be right in the middle of
it, if it happened when I played,'' Newcombe said. ''I would have
gone in there to protect my teammate -- but you also have to be a
peacemaker. I remember one day locking my arms around Don Drysdale
one day in Brooklyn because I wanted to keep him out of trouble.''
Expos-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: Four Expos have at least 35 RBIs and are on pace to
drive in more than 100, which would be a franchise first. They are
Vladimir Guerrero, who leads the team with 40, followed Rondell
White (39), Lee Stevens (38) and Jose Vidro. White had an RBI
groundout in the first inning Sunday against San Diego and White a
two-run homer. There have never been two Expos reach the 100-RBI
mark in the same year. Guerrero had 131 RBIs last year.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: LHP Sterling Hitchcock plans to seek a second opinion
on his injured pitching elbow from Anaheim Angels Dr. Lewis Yocum.
Hitchcock left Friday night's game with a sprained ulnar collateral
ligament. Hitchcock has said he'll need exploratory surgery. Sugary
is an option, assistant trainer Jim Daniel said Sunday, but a
decision hasn't been made yet. Hitchcock likely will go on the
disabled list. ... Tony Gwynn, who's gotten his average up from
.186 to .260 in eight games since coming off the disabled list, got
Sunday off. ... Chris Gomez started at SS Sunday after Damian
Jackson jammed the pinkie on his glove hand diving for a ball
Saturday night. Manager Bruce Bochy said Jackson might be out for a
few days.
Brewers-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Jeromy Burnitz was hitless in 10 straight at-bats
before singling in the fourth. He later homered, too.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Tony Womack extended his hitting streak to 23 games,
the longest in the majors this season.
Cubs-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Sammy Sosa has now homered in 32 different major league
ballparks. ... The Cubs last won a road series when they took two
of three at Houston on April 25-27.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: The Giants' 4-1 loss Sunday marked just their
fourth defeat in the past 16 games at Pacific Bell Park. ... Losing
pitcher Kirk Rueter had his second-shortest outing of the season,
going five innings. Although he lowered his home ERA to 3.23, he
fell to 0-3 in six starts at home.

<HEADLINE> Plane Crashes Near Mall, 3 Die  </HEADLINE>
By TOM VERDIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAWTHORNE, Calif. (AP) -- A small plane crashed on a suburban
street near a shopping mall Sunday, killing all three people
aboard, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The single-engine plane had just left Hawthorne Municipal
Airport when it went down about noon at the edge of the mall
parking lot, snapping power lines and bursting into flames.
</P>
<P>
   The four-seater, which the Federal Aviation Administration
described as a Piper PA-46, was headed to Las Vegas, police Lt.
James McInerny said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot did not report any problems before the plane crashed
about 14 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, McInerny said.
</P>
<P>
   Marisela Guerrero, 25, was working at the drive-through window
of a Taco Bell restaurant about 50 feet from where the plane came
to a rest on a sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 people were inside the restaurant at the time, she
said. ''I came inside and said (to the customers) 'Go, go, go!'''
Most of the customers and workers had already run from the
building, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane caught fire, but the flames were quickly extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Rodriguez, 26, said he was returning to the shopping mall
after making a pizza delivery, and was at a stoplight when the
plane came down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw pieces of the plane flying everywhere,'' he said.

   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)-- Despite forecasts calling for gusty wind, space
shuttle Atlantis' astronauts aimed for an early Monday morning touchdown to
close out their successful space station repair mission. It will be only the
14th time in 98 flights that a space shuttle lands in darkness. ''I've been
practicing for this for the last 10 years,'' said Air Force Col. James Halsell

NATO Chief Not Ruling Out Russia

   MOSCOW (AP) -- NATO Secretary-General George Robertson said in an interview
aired Sunday that he does not rule out Russia ultimately joining the western
alliance. After Russia-NATO talks in Italy on Thursday, Robertson told Russian
state television that Russia's inclusion in the alliance could be debated ''in
the next two decades'' but there were no immediate plans to discuss the issue.
In March, Vladimir Putin, then acting Russian president, told the British
Broadcasting Corp. that Russia could join NATO ''if and when Russia's views are
taken into account as an equal partner.'' ''My answer to the same question is
'Why not?''' Robertson said in the Russian state TV interview.

   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Alberto Fujimori on Sunday appeared headed for a third
term as Peru's president, with poll projections giving him a wide lead in
elections boycotted by his rival and characterized as tainted by foreign
monitors. The first independent vote projection gave Fujimori a large lead over
challenger Alejandro Toledo, but said 30.6 percent of the ballots had been
annulled. Fujimori led with 49.6 percent of the ballot to 15 percent for Toledo
with an additional 4.8 percent of the ballots left blank, according to the

Costly Fuel Forces Coast Guard Cuts
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEABROOK, Texas (AP) -- All along the Texas coast and into the Midwest,
rising fuel costs have forced the Coast Guard to cut back nearly every type of
patrol but search-and-rescue missions by about 25 percent, officials said. ''I
had no other recourse,'' said Rear Adm. Paul Pluta, whose Eighth Coast Guard
District covers 26 states and includes 1,200 miles of Gulf Coast and 10,300
miles of navigable rivers. Oil prices have increased dramatically in recent
months, reaching $34 a barrel in March, almost $10 higher than in January.
Prices were down to about $28 a barrel this month, but the Coast Guard still
needs more money to make up for higher costs.

signaling ''a positive change of direction'' among the rebels toward bringing
peace to the war-torn West African nation, a U.N. spokesman said. Eighty-five
former captives arrived in Freetown Sunday night from Monrovia, the capital of

   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Juan Montoya made a dominating detour from auto racing's

for which side is best. Montoya, the defending champion of the more established
Championship Auto Racing Teams series, made car owner Chip Ganassi's decision to
return to Indy after a four-year absence look brilliant. The 24-year-old
Colombian fended off a late challenge from 1996 Indy winner Buddy Lazier, passed
teammate Jimmy Vasser to retake the lead 21 laps from the end and raced on to
become the first Indianapolis rookie to win since Graham Hill in 1966.

<HEADLINE> Israel-Lebanon Border Tensions Grow  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN SEVAREID
<TEXT>
<P>
   KFAR KILA, Lebanon (AP) -- A Muslim guerrilla gunned down a
Christian man on Sunday and Israeli border soldiers wounded at
least two people in growing tensions underlining the fragility of
security conditions in the newly liberated Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
   In the first fatality since Shiite Muslim guerrillas took over
southern Lebanon on Wednesday after Israel's withdrawal, a
guerrilla shot and killed a 50-year-old Christian man and wounded
another Christian in Rmaish village, a former stronghold of the
now-defunct Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia.
</P>
<P>
   Police, in a terse statement, said the suspect was apprehended,
describing the shooting as an ''individual incident.'' Hezbollah,
the leading guerrilla group in south Lebanon, denied involvement.
</P>
<P>
   There have been scattered reports of break-ins and looting in
Christian towns in the predominantly Shiite region, but until
Sunday none of the revenge attacks that had been feared. The
government sent a few hundred policemen to the region to try to
ease Christian anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, two girls were killed and their father injured when
their vehicle drove over a land mine on a side road in the south,
police said. Another man was hurt when a mine exploded as his
bulldozer was clearing a road of rubble. Police had further
details.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's violence showed how tenuous the security situation
remains in southern Lebanon in the absence of government troops and
U.N. peacekeepers, who are yet to deploy in the areas evacuated by
Israel and its Christian-led militia. The militia's 2,500 mostly
Muslim members have surrendered to authorities or fled to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Israel army said hundreds of Lebanese gathered Sunday at the
Fatima crossing about 50 miles southeast of Beirut, and that troops
fired a stun grenade and used live ammunition when some tried to
cross into Israel.
</P>
<P>
   A 15-year-old boy was seen hit in the back but continued to
walk, an indication his injury was not serious. Two other people
reportedly suffered injuries, but the army confirmed only one more.
It said troops fired warning shots and a man was injured by a
fragment of a concrete pillar that was hit by a bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Since Israel withdrew its forces from southern Lebanon last
Wednesday after an 18-year occupation, Lebanese have been
demonstrating in support of the Hezbollah, throwing stones and
sometimes firebombs toward Israeli troops. Several armed guerrillas
came to the border Sunday and urged people not to throw stones.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak told a Cabinet meeting that
conditions along the border were ''delicate and fragile,'' but that
every day that passes quietly helps to ensure stability.
</P>
<P>
   ''The army has clear instructions to open fire only for
incidents of rescue or self-defense,'' Barak said, according to a
statement. ''The army won't open fire for any other reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's office also denied media reports that Hezbollah and the
Israeli army had reached a temporary cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in a telephone conversation with Barak,
congratulated him on the withdrawal and expressed the hope that
calm and stability would prevail on the border, Barak's office
said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk, called on Lebanon
to send its army into the border area, as stipulated in the U.N.
resolution that called for Israel's withdrawal, and to seize
control from the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army, meanwhile, denied Lebanese reports that the
air force violated Lebanese air space Sunday, insisting that the
training exercises in question took place over the Mediterranean,
outside Lebanese areas.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the army completed an evacuation of two outposts in
the Chebaa farms region, north of Israel's border.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon has called for a complete evacuation of the area and
Hezbollah has warned it will continue attacks unless troops leave
the farms. But Barak said Sunday that more than 90 percent of the
Chebaa farms will not be evacuated because they are not in Lebanese
territory according to U.N. maps.

<HEADLINE> US Reps, Farmers Visit Cuba  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Lawmakers and rice farmers from Arkansas began a
trip to Cuba Sunday aimed at making agricultural contacts on this
communist island and showing support for a partial lifting of a
U.S. trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're anxious to see how we can provide products and open up
trade with Cuba,'' U.S. Sen. Blanche Lambert Lincoln, a Democrat,
said upon arriving Sunday night in Havana. ''We want to know how we
can help our economy, but also how that might benefit the Cuban
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit of the 16-member delegation comes as the House of
Representatives debates legislation that would allow food and
medicine to be sold to Cuba. It would also prohibit the president
from including food and medicine in future embargoes of other
countries without congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate overwhelmingly approved a similar trade measure last
year, and supporters say they're confident it could pass the House
as well. The House Appropriations Committee approved the measure
35-24 earlier this month. Some 220 House members signed a letter
supporting an easing of the embargo, though there is fierce
opposition from some Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Marion Berry, also a Democrat, said the trip had been
in the works for some time and that it was not timed to coincide
with the expected House vote.
</P>
<P>
   Both Berry and Lincoln said it made sense to pass the measure,
as Congress voted to normalize trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can trade with China, largest communist nation in the
world, then why not with Cuba?' asked Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have had such good experiences when we open up trade with
other countries,'' said Berry. ''We think we have the votes.''
</P>
<P>
   David Hillman, president of the Arkansas Farm Bureau, said that
the group's 216,000 members are anxious to sell their products to
Cuba. The state is not only the United States' No. 1 rice producer,
but it is also an important maker of poultry, pork, and soybean.
</P>
<P>
   During their visit to Cuba, members of the Arkansas delegation
will meet a number of high-ranking Cuban officials, including
Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly, or
parliament. They will also tour an agricultural cooperative, a
poultry farm and a farmers' market.

   INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Brazilian-bred Riboletta, the favorite
ridden by Chris McCarron, beat Bordelaise by three lengths Sunday
in the $203,000 Milady Breeders' Cup Handicap at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-year-old mare carried 120 pounds and was pressed on the
lead throughout the 1[ miles. Riboletta shook off bids turning for
home from both Bordelaise and Excellent Meeting before drawing off
to win in 1:42.
</P>
<P>
   She paid $4, $2.60 and $2.10.
</P>
<P>
   The win was the ninth in 22 career starts for Riboletta and the
winning purse of $112,860 improved her career earnings to $574,953.
</P>
<P>
   Bordelaise returned $3.80 and $2.40, while Excellent Meeting was
another length back in third in the field of six and paid $2.10 to
show.

   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori appeared headed Sunday for a
lopsided re-election victory in a runoff poll questioned by foreign observers
and boycotted by his opponent. With 26.9 percent of the vote counted, Fujimori
had 50.1 percent of the ballot to Alejandro Toledo's 16.5 percent, election
officials said. They said 32.4 percent of the ballots had been spoiled and 1
percent left blank. Toledo had originally urged Peruvians to boycott the runoff
election, forced after Fujimori failed to get a majority in the first round. But
voting is compulsory, and he later told them to spoil their ballots by scrawling
on them the words, ''no to fraud.''

<HEADLINE> Military Confronts Bugler Shortage  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As World War II veterans reach their twilight
years, the military is battling a shortage of buglers to play taps
at funerals. As a result, the Defense Department has called in
reserves -- compact disc players.
</P>
<P>
   ''It used to be that every installation or division would have a
band, and the bugler would come from the band. With the downsizing
of the military, well, we don't have the bands in the numbers that
we used to,'' Defense Department spokeswoman Lt. Col. Catherine
Abbott said. ''And unfortunately, our veterans are reaching that
age.''
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that of
approximately 25 million U.S. military veterans, about 1,500 die
each day, two-thirds veterans of World War II. Last year, more than
550,000 veterans died, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   Not every family requests a military funeral honors ceremony,
but the Pentagon tries to honor the wishes of the 10 percent to 15
percent who do.
</P>
<P>
   Families of honorably discharged veterans are entitled to a
two-person uniformed funeral honor guard, the folding and
presentation of the U.S. flag and a rendition of taps.
</P>
<P>
   With the bugler shortage in mind, Congress passed a law that
took effect in January and allows ''a recorded version of taps
using audio equipment'' if a live horn player is not available.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott said ''funeral kits,'' which include a compact disc of
taps, have been sent to 450 funeral directors across the country,
as well as to all offices that deal with such matters at the
nation's military bases.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was not aware of any complaints about the recorded
taps thus far. ''The feedback we have gotten is that folks are
pretty happy with it,'' Abbott said.
</P>
<P>
   VA spokesman Steven Westerfeld said the National Cemetery
Administration tries to avoid using the compact disc and portable
stereo, often by enlisting a bugler from a local military service
group, veterans' organization or a high school band.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is expected to get worse, Westerfeld said. He noted
the agency has created five new national cemeteries since 1997 and
is looking at an additional six sites.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a matter of logistics and manpower,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The use of recordings is not entirely new. Tapes or CDs have had
to be used in the past, officials said, but the law now officially
authorizes the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''The request was made of Congress because as a result of the
downsizing, the installations were having a harder and harder time
meeting the requirements,'' Abbott said. ''As the number of active
duty military is decreasing, the number of deaths is increasing; so
it's a significant challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The original rendition of taps was composed during the Civil
War, in July 1862, when a wounded Union general, Daniel Adams
Butterfield, directed brigade bugler Oliver Wilcox Norton to honor
his 600 troops who died in the battle by playing some notes he had
written on the back of an envelope.
</P>
<P>
   ''The music was beautiful on that still summer night and was
heard far beyond the limits of our brigade,'' Norton would say
later. ''The next day I was visited by several buglers from
neighboring brigades, asking for copies of the music, which I
gladly furnished.''
</P>
<P>
   The piece was soon adopted throughout the military. In 1874, it
was officially recognized by the Army, and it became standard at
military funerals in 1891.
</P>
<P>
   The compact disc version was recorded on Memorial Day 1999 at
Arlington National Cemetery. A member of the United States Army
Band, Master Sgt. Woodrow English, played the bugle that day.
</P>
<P>
   English, a 23-year veteran of the band who has ranked among the
lead buglers for 10 years, said he does not think of the recording
as a personal success. In fact, his name is not even on it; it
simply says, ''Taps.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think of what it means to the soldiers and the soldiers'
families,'' said English, 46. ''The fact that we can't put a bugler
out there is sad enough, but obviously, it makes me feel very
honored.''

By HAL BOCK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- This was a game that belonged in October instead
of May with Boston's Pedro Martinez and New York's Roger Clemens
locked in a brilliant pitchers' duel that had a postseason feel
about it.
</P>
<P>
   With first place in the American League East at stake, Martinez
beat Clemens 2-0 Sunday night on a two-out, ninth-inning home run
by Trot Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez (8-2) limited New York to four hits and struck out
nine. He retired 10 batters in a row before Chuck Knoblauch was hit
by a pitch leading off the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens (4-5) matched him until the ninth, also working on a
three-hitter and striking out 13. With two outs, Jeff Frye hit a
ball back at the pitcher. It glanced off Clemens and Frye was able
to beat it out for an infield hit.
</P>
<P>
   That brought up Nixon, who had tripled in the seventh but was
stranded when Clemens struck out Brian Daubach and Nomar
Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   This time Nixon hit a 2-1 pitch into the right-field bleachers
for his sixth home run of the season, breaking up the scoreless
battle.
</P>
<P>
   After Knoblauch reached in the ninth, Derek Jeter had his third
hit of the game, giving New York its best chance against Martinez.
But the Cy Young winner struck out Paul O'Neill. Bernie Williams
backed Nixon to the running track in right field for the second
out.
</P>
<P>
   After Knoblauch advanced to third on the long fly, Jeter stole
second. With the tying runs in scoring position, Jorge Posada was
hit by a pitch, loading the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez then bounced out to second base to end the game.
Martinez's brother, Ramon, was the first Red Sox player out of the
dugout to celebrate the win.
</P>
<P>
   Twice, the Yankees got their leadoff men on base. Shane Spencer
led off the third with a walk but Martinez got the next three
hitters. In the fourth, Jeter opened with a double but never moved
off second base as Martinez retired the next three hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens had faced the minimum 18 hitters through six innings,
allowing just two hits but erasing both runners. Carl Everett was
picked off in the second inning and John Valentin was caught
stealing in the sixth.

   Then in the seventh, Nixon tripled with one out for Boston. The
Yankees played the infield in but Clemens escaped the jam by
striking out Daubach and Garciaparra.

   Last October, in the American League playoffs, Martinez and the
Red Sox beat Clemens 13-1. It was New York's only postseason loss
en route to their second straight World Series championship.

Notes: Martinez has not lost consecutive games since September,
1998, when he dropped three in a row. ... His 1-0 loss against
Tampa Bay May 6, when he struck out 17, ended a 13-game winning
streak for the Cy Young winner. ... The Yankees receive their 1999
World Series rings before Monday's game against Oakland. ... Plate
umpire Ed Rapuano was struck on the right knee by Ricky Ledee's
foul ball in the fifth inning and left the game in the top of the
sixth, replaced by Brian Runge, who moved from first base.
