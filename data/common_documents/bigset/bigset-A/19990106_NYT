   IRAQ-ARABS (Cairo, Egypt) _ A bitter war of words between Iraq
and its Arab neighbors has followed last month's American-led
bombings, leaving Iraq more isolated than at any time since the
Persian Gulf war. As Iraq has accused the Arabs of failing to stand
by its side, Egypt has responded with particular scorn, all but
calling for the ouster of the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein. The
confrontation became even more intense Tuesday as Saddam called on
Arabs to rise up against leaders who have not given his regime
their full support. By Douglas Jehl.

<P>
   RUSSIA-NORTH (Pevek, Russia) _ Here in Russia's most northern
city, a winter's day is two hours of cheerless gray, the
temperature plunges to 40 below, and delays in getting wages are
measured in years. It is the edge of the world and the end of the
line for thousands of Russians drawn here during Soviet times by
promises of high pay and patriotic appeals. The colonization of the
north was one of the Soviet Union's most audacious ventures. Now
the dismal economics of the north has finally caught up with these
far-flung regions. Russia's new market economy cannot bear the
colossal cost of feeding and heating the northern outposts. By
Michael R. Gordon.

   COLOMBIA-REBELS (Bogota, Colombia) _ President Andres Pastrana
said Tuesday that ending the civil war that has ravaged his country
for nearly 40 years depends on the rebels' willingness to help

   NY-GUN-SUIT (New York) _ In a potentially precedent-setting
lawsuit against gun makers the surviving relatives of six people
killed by firearms in New York shootings are seeking to hold the
gun industry collectively liable, just as many recent suits have
attacked the tobacco industry as responsible for deaths and
illnesses from smoking. The suit is considered potentially
precedent-setting because it invokes ``the theory of negligent
distribution'' of guns, rather than charging liability on the basis
of the product's inherent harmfulness. By Joseph P. Fried.
</P>
<P>
   BLACK-FARMERS (Greensboro, Ga.) _ While pleased by the public
acknowledgment of their plight, many black farmers say that the
settlement will do little to reverse the stunning decline of
independent black farming, a livelihood that has carried a special
nobility ever since freed slaves were granted 40 acres and a mule.
The relief, which calls for farmers who claim they were harmed by
discrimination to receive $50,000 tax-free and to be forgiven their
federal debt, is too little, they said, and it has come too late.
And it does not relieve them of the burden of commercial debt they
took in when they could not get government money. By Kevin Sack.

Big Thing in New York restaurants. It's a sleeping giant, they
would say, coming any day now. Any day. Well, look around you. From
the basket of steaming arepas that arrives with the menu at
Orinoco, a new Venezuelan restaurant on the Upper East Side, to the
grilled Argentine skirt steak served at Ideya in SoHo, the next big
thing is finally here. By Eric Asimov.

   LATIN-ROOTS (Undated) _ The first impulse of many uninitiated
cooks who happen upon root vegetables from Latin America in the
market is simply to shake their heads and walk way. These tubers _
brown, bumpy, sometimes even scaly _ look for all the world like
miniature logs that were tossed into the vegetable bin by mistake.
But nothing could be further from the truth. These vegetables are
bedrock culinary staples throughout Latin America and the Caribbean
and provide great culinary rewards for those willing to explore
them.

<P>
   COOKING-TEACH (New York) _ With all due respect to New York's
great cooking schools, they are, for the most part, relatively cold
places, steely professional institutions that lack the warmth of
home and hearth. That's fine for anyone heading off to labor in
some restaurant dungeon. But for the rest of us there is often a
disconnect. Once _ and the tradition is nearly gone now _ we could
learn the secrets of home cooking alongside our mothers and fathers
by helping them chop, mix, and stir. Domestic cooking was not a
formal art. And yet beautiful food often emerged from those
informal kitchens. Fortunately, in loco parentis, there's a small
band of people who still offer latecomers a way into this domestic
tradition by teaching fine cooking in real, home kitchens. By Polly
Frost.

DEPLETED DOLPHINS FOCUS ON HANDLING DAVIS, AND THE COLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ The Miami Dolphins readily acknowledge that
Terrell Davis is the Broncos' most indispensable offensive player.
Trouble is, the Dolphins are also aware that their two defensive
linemen most responsible for holding the National Football League's
leading rusher to 29 yards late in the regular season will be
missing for the teams' rematch on Saturday in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Jason Taylor of Miami broke a clavicle in Miami's
final regular season game. Then tackle Tim Bowens was lost in last
week's playoff victory over Buffalo with a torn right bicep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim did a great job of plugging the run lanes against Terrell,
and Jason was flying around, making a lot of plays,'' the
third-year defensive lineman Shane Burton said of the teams' last
meeting, won by Miami at home, 31-21, on Dec. 21. ``Those are two
of our main guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton, who along with the second-year tackle Barron Tanner will
try to fill that defensive gap on Saturday, senses the Broncos will
be trying to prove a point with Davis. His 29-yard game was an
aberration in a season that saw him rush for 2,008 yards, becoming
only the fourth player in NFL history to reach 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got away from their game plan the last time we played,''
Burton said. ``They're obviously going to try to run him now.
They've got to run him to have success.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Dwight Hollier said the Broncos (14-2) are likely to
use the same playoff formula that worked last season, when they won
the franchise's first Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got to the Super Bowl on the back of Terrell Davis, and
he's been a factor all year long,'' Hollier said. ``When he's
running well, playing well, everything else opens up for them. So
he is our main focus, doing the type of job we did last time on
him.''
</P>
<P>
   As formidable as Davis figures to be in this American Football
Conference semifinal game, the 11-6 Dolphins have other concerns as
well. Two of their key pass-catchers are hobbling, and they carry
two historic albatrosses into this game _ they have not played well
on the road this time of year and have not fared well in cold
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jimmy Johnson said on Tuesday that tight end Troy
Drayton's right ankle sprain appeared worse than believed, and that
the team's leading receiver, O.J. McDuffie, was limited by a right
foot sprain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably as banged up right now as we've been this
season,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins have not won a road playoff game, excluding Super
Bowls, since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   They are a woeful 4-18 in road games in December and January
since 1988, 4-16 with quarterback Dan Marino healthy. Three of
those losses have come in the playoffs, most recently last season's
17-3 collapse at New England.
</P>
<P>
   It is projected to be between 30 and 35 degrees for Saturday's
game. In their history, the Dolphins have never had to play a
January game in weather that cold.
</P>
<P>
   But a berth in the AFC title game is at stake, and the Dolphins
on Tuesdayy tended to shrug off the possible impact of frigid
weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all fine and good,'' Marino said when informed of
Miami's troubles on the road in cold weather. ``But when you get
right down to it, you've got to execute and play football. That's
really what it comes down to. You've got to have a sense of urgency
any time you play in this league, no matter the conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Lamar Thomas, who caught three touchdown passes in
the first meeting with Denver, sheepishly acknowledged that he has
never played in a game with the temperature below 40 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm looking forward to it,'' Thomas, who played his
college ball at the University of Miami, said at the team's Nova
Southeastern University base. ``I want to play in a game where the
snow is coming down and you can see your breath. I always thought
that looked good on the highlights.'' &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Regarding the nine seasons Nolan Ryan spent with the Astros, one
sentiment stands out among his former teammates.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They were glad to be on his side.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing hitters certainly didn't want to face Ryan, who earned
the reputation as baseball's greatest power pitcher ever.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Ashby, who had the best view of Ryan's 100-mph fastball
from behind the plate for the Astros during the 1980s, still
recalls how hitters would walk to the plate, only to walk back to
the dugout, mesmerized by the newly elected Hall of Famer's
overwhelming dominance. Ashby, who also played for Toronto, was a
strikeout victim of Ryan five times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys would come to the plate and just make comments about
how ridiculous it was to come and try and get a hit off this guy,''
said Ashby, who caught Ryan's fifth career no-hitter Sept. 26,
1981, against the Los Angeles Dodgers at the Astrodome. ``What I
really remember is when he began to master the changeup. He still
maintained that great fastball and curveball, but once he started
to master the changeup, literally some of the best hitters in the
game would come to home plate and just say, `This isn't fair
anymore.'''
</P>
<P>
   From A to Z, if a player crossed paths with Ryan, he likely was
one of a record 5,714 strikeout victims. Rod Carew struck out 29
times against Ryan, Reggie Jackson 23, George Brett 18 and Mike
Schmidt 15. Claudell Washington holds the dubious honor of striking
out the most against The Express _ 39 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Ryan hasn't struck you out, you're nobody,'' said Rickey
Henderson, the 5,000th strikeout victim of Ryan in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most memorable Ryan encounters came June 10, 1981, at
Veterans Stadium, with the Phillies' Pete Rose needing two hits to
break Stan Musial's National League career record. The morning of
the game, Ryan read that Rose had predicted a few weeks earlier he
would break the record against Ryan in the series with Houston, and
it appeared he would deliver on that promise after leading off the
first with a single, tying Musial with his 3,630th hit.
</P>
<P>
   Rose batted three more times in the game, with Ryan striking him
out all three times using nothing but fastballs, except for one
curve that produced the second whiff. After the third strikeout,
Rose tipped his batting helmet to Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the confrontations between Ryan and Rose were just
classic, two of the greatest competitors of all time,'' Ashby said.
</P>
<P>
   Astros manager Larry Dierker was the opposing pitcher at the
Dome in 1968 when Ryan earned his first major-league victory in a
4-0 Mets win. Ryan's line: 6 innings, three hits, two walks and
eight strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, we didn't know he was Nolan Ryan,'' Dierker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker recalls the reaction from the Astros' dugout on another
occasion after Ryan uncorked several fastballs in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody on our bench came off and to the rail, standing
there with mouths agape,'' Dierker said. ``Nobody had ever seen a
fastball like that. We'd seen Sandy Koufax, Bob Gibson and Tom
Seaver. We knew within three or four pitches in the first inning
that his fastball was something special.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, who grew up in nearby Alvin, began his Astros career Nov.
19, 1979, when he signed a contract making him the first player in
baseball history to make $1 million in a season. Over the course of
the next nine seasons, he compiled a 106-94 record, helped the
Astros to division titles in 1980 and 1986 and became the majors'
all-time strikeout king.
</P>
<P>
   ``That broke new ground,'' said Astros president Tal Smith, the
club's president/general manager at the time of Ryan's signing.
``As you reflect on it, it was certainly to somebody that was
well-deserving. He earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ryan developed a reputation as a fierce competitor on the
field, he was equally as demanding of his teammates in the
clubhouse on days he pitched. That competitive nature is one of the
main reasons Ryan continued to pitch into his mid-40s while others,
years younger, bowed out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he hit the dugout, if he perceived in any way that guys
did not have their heads in the game or weren't vesting everything
they had, you would hear about it,'' Ashby said. ``He was really
one of the only pitchers I ever was around that you would hear
about it _ maybe him and Gaylord Perry. You'd absolutely hear about
it directly in your face in the dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Reynolds, an infielder for the Astros from 1979-89, looks
beyond Ryan's mind-boggling numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it was the huge impact his family had,'' Reynolds said.
``In a sense, his wife Ruth needs a plaque, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And while he won't don an Astros cap for Cooperstown, Ryan will
always be remembered as one of the organization's greatest heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved him as a fan,'' said owner Drayton McLane Jr., who
purchased the club prior to the 1993 season. ``After buying the
Astros, just to get to know him better it's all as advertised.''

SENATE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL EXPECTED TO BEGIN THURSDAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for new 27th graf detailing phone conversation between Lott
and Hyde)  (sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL and ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, announced on
Tuesday that he expected Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist to open
the impeachment trial of President Clinton on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he sought a conclusion ``that is fair and hopefully
quick'' but gave no details of how the trial would proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi Republican's reticence reflected the unsettled
situation in the Senate as leaders from both parties met in
hideaways all across the Capitol throughout the day, negotiating
ceaselessly to devise a bipartisan plan that would avert a lengthy
trial that could tie up the Senate for months.
</P>
<P>
   Senators from both parties said one such proposal for an
expedited trial, drafted by Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and Joseph
I. Lieberman, D-Conn., was foundering because of objections from
conservative Republicans, just a day before the 106th Congress
formally convenes.
</P>
<P>
   Showing the depth of the opposition, Sen. Larry E. Craig of
Idaho, a member of the Republican leadership team, said of the
plan, ``I think it's dead and finally, I hope it's dead because I
do not think one should short-circuit the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   But still hopeful, Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the
minority leader, said, ``Contrary to rumors of its demise, I think
that there's still a great deal of interest in pursuing some
framework along those lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott and Daschle had their first of several meetings of the day
early in the morning and then traveled across the street to the
Supreme Court, where they met with Rehnquist for about a half hour
to plan for the first presidential impeachment trial in 130 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although Daschle called the timing still ``tentative,'' he and
Lott said they expected Rehnquist to swear in senators as jurors on
Thursday. On that same day, House managers led by Rep. Henry J.
Hyde of Illinois _ who are expected to be reappointed by the new
Congress on Wednesday _ are to read on the Senate floor the two
articles of impeachment charging Clinton with perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways the day will be a holding action, buying time
for Senate leaders to keep working out the details of what comes
next as they strive to avoid the partisan rancor that overtook the
House, which approved two articles of impeachment last month on
near party-line votes.
</P>
<P>
   Senators huddled in all kinds of groups on Tuesday, some
bipartisan, some by party. Some senators consulted with Gorton and
Lieberman while others floated their own modifications of the plan.
One Democrat said that so many proposals were now flying around the
Senate that ``it's like dim sum right now. They're picking and
choosing.''
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, Lott and Daschle had designated several bipartisan
groups of senators to keep in touch with one another and work out
specific issues. They included some of the most prominent members
of the Senate, among them two Democrats, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of
New York and Robert C. Byrdof West Virginia, and two Republicans,
Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, who met with Lott several times on
Tuesday, said he still hoped to move on to actual trial proceedings
on Monday, as envisioned under the compromise plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an interest in starting this as soon as possible,''
Ms. Snowe said. Even conservatives said they wanted the trial to
end by mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   ``How this all pieces together and what it looks like is very
much up in the air,'' said Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Making the situation more complicated, one official said, is the
schedule of Rehnquist. The chief justice told Daschle and Lott that
the court had oral arguments scheduled in the mornings next week
and that he would prefer to come to the Senate in the afternoons,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Joe Lockhart, the press secretary, said the
uncertainty left the president's lawyers ``in the position of
preparing for all eventualities. In general, we'd like to know
which direction we're going in, but we understand the process.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal drafted by Gorton and Lieberman was designed to
avoid a long Senate trial that showcased the details of Clinton's
affair with Monica S. Lewinsky. The plan was also propelled by the
fact that no one expected the Senate, which has 55 Republicans and
45 Democrats, to have the 67 votes necessary under the Constitution
to convict Clinton and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The plan called for an expedited trial of the president to begin
next Monday without witnesses. House managers, who will be the
prosecutors, and the White House would get one day each to present
their cases. On a third day the senators could question the two
sides by sending written notes to the front of the chamber. On
Thursday and Friday, the senators would be able to state their
views in open debate.
</P>
<P>
   Then the senators would take test votes on whether each of the
two articles of impeachment met the standard for the president to
be removed from office. If, as expected, 67 senators decided the
articles did not meet the standard, a simple majority vote would
allow the Senate to adjourn the trial and move toward censure.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is supported by most Democrats, and Lott, who
desperately wants the Republicans to put forward an agenda this
year, has been sounding out his rank-and-file for days.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of Republicans have complained that the
plan does not give the House managers enough time to make their
case. Some, in deference to House Republicans, want an actual vote
on the articles of impeachment, while others object to test votes
that allow the Senate to move forward with a full trial only if 67
senators agreed. Still others want to hear from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty-seven sounds like we're looking for a deal, not our
duty,'' said Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., who met separately on
Tuesday with Lieberman and with Gorton. ``We shouldn't be
artificially truncating this.''

</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the Republican whip, said he
opposed the proposal's two-thirds vote to move ahead with a trial,
and said the plan did not afford either House managers or the White
House enough time to present their cases. ``I would hope it could
be done in a week or so on each side,'' Nickles said. ``That would
be plenty.'' He said he thought the two-thirds vote requirement
``would be dropped.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators were looking at ways to address all these objections
but the trickiest question by far could be whether to allow any
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The House impeachment managers, meeting on Tuesday night to
prepare for the trial, insisted that they wanted a full trial with
witnesses, and they were drawing support from Senate conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an anomalous thing to have a trial without any
witnesses,'' said Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla. ``Now, exactly who
the witnesses are and how extensive the testimony is, those are
questions that still need to be decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said he would meet with Lott on Wednesday to discuss the
impending trial. ``Time's a wasting,'' said Hyde said, who spoke by
telephone from Chicago on Tuesday with Lott. ``We need to agree on
a format.'' Hyde will urge Lott to allow the House managers to call
witnesses in a trial the managers believe would last two to four
weeks, House Republicans said.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Democrats were equally adamant that witnesses not be
called. ``Issue No. 1 is the witness issue,'' said Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass. ``We think that would really become a zoo and seriously
prolong the process, unnecessarily so.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said witnesses ``would accelerate the partisanship and
acrimony we saw on the House side.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats warned that if Republicans tried to craft a plan
for only a limited number of witnesses the White House would object
and insist on a full trial and defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The witness genie isn't coming partially out of the bottle,''
said one Democratic strategist close to the White House. The
president's lawyers, he said, ``simply cannot afford to gamble and
let House prosecutors present only one side of the story. At this
point political considerations have to be put aside and legal
considerations emphasized.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally problematic was whether the Senate could agree on any
censure proposal if a trial was truncated. Some Republicans called
censure beyond the bounds of the Constitution and a violation of
the separation of powers. Some Democrats thought Clinton needed a
straight up-or-down vote on acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment is the constitutional action available to the
Congress, not censure,'' said Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, in an appearance on C-Span on Tuesday night, also warned
against the conventional wisdom that the impeachment process will
end in censure. ``There's no sound and indisputable count as to
votes here,'' Byrd said, ``and votes may shift depending on things
that are unforeseen at the present.'' He also indicated that he was
undecided how he would vote on Clinton. ``I could go either way
based on the evidence as I've seen it or heard it and I've followed
it pretty closely.''

DEVILS AND SHARKS TIE, 3-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD _ Dave Andreychuk stood on crutches outside the
New Jersey Devils' locker room, trying to find a bright spot in
what had been a miserable night for the team. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They squandered a lead in the third period against the San Jose
Sharks and settled for a 3-3 tie at Continental Arena, but that was
hardly the worst part. Andreychuk, the left wing on the Devils'
most productive line, broke his right ankle, which will sideline
him for about six to eight weeks, the team said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far it's not displaced, which means I won't have to have
surgery,'' said Andreychuk, who will have more X-rays Thursday.
``That's good news.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Andreychuk, who has 11 goals and 11 assists in 29 games on a
line with Bobby Holik and Randy McKay, was injured at 7 minutes 51
seconds of the first period when he twisted awkwardly while trying
to make a play from his knees. He got caught under Sharks
defenseman Marcus Ragnarsson and remained face down on the ice
until being helped off by . Andreychuk, who had fractured his left
ankle in the final game of the 1996-97 season, said, ``You know
right away something's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of what was wrong here on Tuesday night wasn't as obvious
as Andreychuk's injury.
</P>
<P>
   McKay, who returned to action after missing five games with an
assortment of ailments, scored a first-period goal and assisted on
another, helping the Devils forge a 2-2 tie.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of the second period, the Devils' Scott Stevens
mixed it up with San Jose's Jeff Friesen, and the two nearly came
to blows. As the teams left the ice and Stevens went past the
Sharks' bench, players shouted taunts at him. Stevens spotted
Brantt Myhres, who has twice left the Sharks to spend time in
alcohol rehabilitation, most recently last month. The Sharks said
Stevens told Myhres, ``Go have another beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Myhres said, ``I just said, `Why don't you pick on somebody a
little bigger?' and he comes back with a comment as far as
alcoholism goes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `That's pretty classy coming from a guy who's got
someone sitting down from you on the bench who went through the
same thing for a year,''' Myhres added, referring to the Devils'
Ken Daneyko. ``He should think before he says something, but that's
just the mentality of Scott Stevens. An idiot.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said it was all in the heat of battle. ``I was upset at
the time and he was yelling at me,'' Stevens said of Myhres. ``I
yelled something back. Sometimes you say something you regret. I
don't need him yelling at me. Yeah, he's been through some tough
times, but you know, sometimes you should be happy you're in the
league, and he's had a lot of chances as far as I'm concerned.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The problems overshadowed a lackluster performance by the
Devils, who took a 3-2 lead at 5:08 of the third period when Holik
scored his second goal of the game. But the Devils gave that lead
away when Friesen knocked in a rebound with 9:53 to play. &QL;

CLAIBORNE TO TURN PRO, SOWARD TO RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When they made their recruiting trip to USC
together three years ago, wide receiver R. Jay Soward remembered
linebacker Chris Claiborne saying his college career would last
``three years and I'm out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne kept his promise Tuesday, when he officially announced
that he would skip his senior season and turn pro. Soward, who
entertained thoughts of turning pro, provided some relief to coach
Paul Hackett minutes later by announcing he would stay for his
senior season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we would both leave after our junior years,'' Soward
said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither decision was a surprise. Claiborne said the day before
the Sun Bowl that he was going to hire an agent, while Soward told
his father immediately after the game that he would return to
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready for a new challenge,'' Claiborne said. ``I had a
little bit of unfinished business at the university. We wanted to
go to the Rose Bowl. The best thing is that I felt comfortable
about the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett, while lamenting Claiborne's loss, understood the
decision after NFL people told him that Claiborne should at least
start off draft workouts by being among the top 10 players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very torn,'' Hackett said. ``I didn't feel overly one
way or the other. I wanted to be selfish but I don't think either
of us lets selfishness override the discussion. I fully support him
and I think it's going to be marvelous.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my wildest dreams, I didn't think I would have the
opportunity to be around someone of Chris' caliber.
</P>
<P>
   ``You build teams with people, and Chris, from the from the very
beginning, once he got over telling me he might transfer, was
really the model you want as a football coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward's decision wasn't nearly as simple. He had heard he might
go anywhere from the late first round to the third round, which was
enough to dash his hopes of turning pro.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his father, Rodney, sounded in favor of his son going pro
following USC's 28-19 loss to Texas Christian in the Sun Bowl last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad probably still thinks I should have,'' Soward said.
``He wasn't very happy with the season I had. He didn't think I got
enough touches.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward said he intends to meet with Hackett to make sure coach
and wide receiver are on the same page next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and coach, we're going to sit down and have a lot of
planning to make things a lot better,'' Soward said. ``We're going
to come up with different ways to get me the ball. I'm going to be
a big part of this offense. I'm probably the biggest part of this
offense coming back.''

MANY PLAYERS CRITICIZE VOTING PROCEDURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ NBA players are gathering today in New York to
hold a vote that could determine the future of the league. But
before a single player could book a first-class ticket, many were
assailing the voting process itself.
</P>
<P>
   Players had less than 36 hours to make travel plans _ in the
face of a deadly Midwest storm no less _ to get to New York for a
mandatory, in-person vote.
</P>
<P>
   As far as anyone knows, proxy votes will not be allowed, so
failure to attend means forfeiting the right to be heard on the
weightiest of issues: whether to accept the NBA's final offer and
end the six-month lockout, or to reject it and risk cancellation of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   And even that choice is not so clear. According to reports out
of New York, players won't be voting on whether to ratify
commissioner David Stern's final offer. Instead, they will vote on
whether to support the union's decision to reject Stern's offer.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the union had not informed players Tuesday how the
vote would be conducted _ by secret ballot or in an open session
prone to peer pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The Midwest blizzard may pale in comparison to the storms
brewing within union ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've definitely put us in a tough position,'' said Lakers
guard Derek Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Clippers guard Poor Richardson called the situation ``extremely
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   And if players who don't go to New York forfeit their right to
vote?
</P>
<P>
   ``That means a deal is not going to be made anyway,'' Richardson
said. ``That means... there's no season. That means it's been
railroaded.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players felt misled.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is (ridiculous),'' Miami's Keith Askins said. ``Who's
going to fly to New York on two days' notice after a blizzard?
Then, you want to vote on something, and they tell you you can only
vote on something else?
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a vote. This is out of control... This is wrong. I
feel ashamed to be part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's vote by players will be followed Thursday by a vote of
the NBA's 29 owners. If players again reject Stern's final offer,
owners could vote to cancel the season.
</P>
<P>
   But the union is betting otherwise _ that a full-membership
rejection of Stern's offer will force the NBA to resume
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping that this will cause the owners to be a little bit
more pragmatic and a little bit more prudent,'' Hunter said.
``We're expecting (players) to vote in support of the position
promoted by the (union) negotiating committee.. We think the
message that we have to send to the owners is that our players are
still unified.''
</P>
<P>
   According to some agents, the union plans to hold an
open-session voice vote, and only after a pep talk from union
leaders aimed at maintaining a unified voice. That means peer
pressure could influence the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame,'' said the Lakers' Eddie Jones, ``because that's
what it seems like. You get all these guys who are making minimum
(salary) into New York and try to intimidate them. You just can't
do that. You have to go in there as a man and do what you feel is
best for you.''
</P>
<P>
   NBA officials are already calling the vote a sham.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds to us more like a bargaining tactic than an example
of union democracy,'' NBA chief legal counsel Jeffrey Mishkin said.
</P>
<P>
   And the players? Many weren't sure what to think Tuesday as they
finished their morning pickup games at UCLA and prepared to make
travel plans. But most predicted a close vote.
</P>
<P>
   Only Richardson, who favors accepting Stern's offer, would
reveal how he plans to vote. Many said they wouldn't decide until
they got to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope guys do what's best for themselves,'' said Jones.
``Right now you have to be selfish, you have to do what's best for
you. Don't let anybody intimidate you. Do what's best for you and
your family.''

 By ALAN TRUEX  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
MIAMI _ Although the Miami Dolphins have a future Hall of Fame
quarterback in Dan Marino, their coach is convinced the route to
the Super Bowl is not through the pass, but through the run.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jimmy Johnson admits his team faces ``an uphill battle''
Saturday against the defending NFL champion Denver Broncos on their
snowy home field.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dolphins, 12-point underdogs and losers of eight
consecutive playoff road games, have almost no chance of winning
without a running game, regardless of whom they play. Since Johnson
became their coach in 1996, the team is 0-17 when running the ball
fewer than 25 times.
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving in Miami, Johnson has continually pushed the
ground control issue. Last year he was so desperate for a running
back that he brought in the troubled Lawrence Phillips, who soon
departed. When the season ended, Johnson fired offensive
coordinator Gary Stevens ``because of problems we had running the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson then rewrote the Dolphins' playbook, cutting out much of
the passing, and signed one of the NFL's most aggressive run
blockers in former Houston Oiler Kevin Donnalley. And with his 1998
first-round draft pick, Johnson chose a running back, Mississippi's
John Avery.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure was clearly on the incumbent running back, Karim
Abdul-Jabbar, to make a name for himself and keep people from
asking, ``Isn't that a basketball player?''
</P>
<P>
   Jabbar accepted the challenge. He doubled his time in the film
room and the weight room, becoming more knowledgeable and more
durable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be stronger at the end of the season, when
everyone else is wearing down,'' he explained. ``Last season, when
we got to the end, I was ready to take a nose dive. Had we gone all
the way, I would not have been ready.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he's ready to last the entire postseason _ if the
Dolphins surprise Johnson by taking it beyond Saturday. In Miami's
24-17 victory over Buffalo last weekend, Abdul-Jabbar rushed 27
times for 95 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But was that an anomaly?
</P>
<P>
   There were many times during the season when the third-round
draftee from UCLA ran like he was in the Everglades. Although he
held off the challenge of the quick but erratic Avery, Abdul-Jabbar
ranked only 12th in the AFC in rushing with 960 yards and a
3.6-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he made points with Johnson not only because of his work
ethic but because, well, he made points. He scored six times this
season, giving him 32 rushing touchdowns in three years, second
only to Denver's Terrell Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a case of turning it up when you get close to the goal
line,'' Abdul-Jabbar said. ``Sometimes I wish I could run as fast
on the 50-yard line as I do when we're down near the goal line.''
</P>
<P>
   He also runs faster when he has the holes to run through. He
prospered last Saturday when, led by the drive-blocking Donnalley,
the Miami offensive line dominated the Bills' estimable front
seven.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar had not seen that sort of blocking for several
weeks, as Miami's two best linemen were stymied by injuries,
Donnalley with a sprained knee and Richmond Webb with a torn
triceps.
</P>
<P>
   When Webb returned to left tackle last week, his capable
stand-in, Brent Smith, shifted to right guard, and a transformation
occurred: The Dolphins dominated the trenches.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar welcomes the improved blocking, but he's not
depending on it.
</P>
<P>
   He prides himself on making yardage when there's nowhere to run.
When viewing game video, he pays special attention to plays in
which the blocking breaks down. He studies ways to escape tacklers
and plow for yardage on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to make yards without great blocking,'' he declared
when the season began, anticipating what would come.
</P>
<P>
   He spends as much time watching video as some coaches. In fact,
he wants to be a coach some day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten fanatical,'' he said. ``I want to be able to go to
the chalkboard and draw the plays like our coaches do. I want to be
able to put together a game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   It probably would be a game plan to Johnson's liking, full of
running plays.

SKINNY YOUNT BLOSSOMED INTO GREATNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Physically, there wasn't much to Robin Yount when
he was a sophomore at Taft High in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 5-foot-7 and 135 pounds,'' said Ray O'Connor, Yount's
coach at Taft.
</P>
<P>
   But when Yount grew into his body _ and spent a summer living
with his older brother Larry, who was a pitcher in Triple-A _ he
became an All-City Section shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came from being not-a-too-great-or-outstanding junior ...
simply because he finally matured,'' O'Connor said of Yount, who
was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on Tuesday. ``As a senior,
he was about 6-foot and maybe 160 pounds. Rob has a tremendous work
ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't leave after a practice without hitting him another
100 ground balls,'' he said. ``He wanted to work and he had his
sights well-set.''
</P>
<P>
   Yount, who graduated from Taft and went on to get 3,142 hits in
a 19-year career with the Milwaukee Brewers, is the second high
school player from the San Fernando Valley voted into the Hall,
following Don Drysdale, who went to Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, who coached at Taft from 1960 until his retirement in
'82, said he couldn't have predicted a Hall of Fame career for
Yount, who was the City's player of the year in 1973. Yount was the
Brewers' No.2 choice in the amateur draft and an 18-year-old
starter at shortstop by 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite a neat thing, isn't it? I'm just thrilled to death
for him,'' said O'Connor, who lives in Woodland Hills. ``He's a
hell of a neat guy. He's not one of these guys that is a great
athlete but a real (jerk). This guy is a first-class human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Miller, a teammate of Yount's at Taft, was a first baseman
and pitcher. Miller said he was more of a basketball player and he
planned on not playing baseball his senior year _ until Yount
intervened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robin coaxed me into coming out,'' said Miller, who sells
insurance and lives in Canoga Park. ``At the time I was 6-foot-5.
(Yount) told me, `You're a bigger goon than the other first baseman
and you're easier to throw to.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yount told ESPN on Tuesday that he didn't take the Hall of Fame
vote seriously until a few days ago, when his ``stomach was tied in
knots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty incredible feeling,'' said Yount, who was
elected with George Brett and Nolan Ryan. ``I feel very fortunate
even to be mentioned in the same breath as those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett, who grew up in El Segundo, told ESPN he was pleased to be
inducted the same year as Yount.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the guys I played against in 20 years,'' he said, ``I
probably enjoyed playing against him the most. I always looked
forward to playing against Robin.''
</P>
<P>
   Yount was an adequate player as a junior, O'Connor said, but it
wasn't until he got a taste of professional baseball with Larry
that summer in '72 did he dedicate himself to getting better.
</P>
<P>
   In his debut as a senior, Yount hit two triples against
Cleveland and went on to hit .487, O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``During that (summer), he just found himself,'' O'Connor said.
``He grew about three inches and put on about 20 pounds of weight.
He just blossomed as a senior.''
</P>
<P>
   When they were in high school, Yount got to work with Taft
graduates who were either playing or bound for the major leagues.
According to O'Connor, Rick Dempsey, Larry Dierker, Pete LaCock and
Rick Auerbachall were influences on Yount, who went on to win two
American League MVP awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never a doubt in (Yount's) mind when he went up with
Milwaukee that he was going to be good enough,'' he said. ``He grew
up with guys around him that were extremely good players. He just
saw that there was no difference between he and they.''

ALVIN _ In this scenic little farm town, where the principal
industry is honoring Nolan Ryan, immortality came to the favorite
son Tuesday just as everyone knew it would.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Baseball Writers' Association of America made it official by
electing Ryan, George Brett and Robin Yount to the Hall of Fame,
the first time since the shrine opened in 1936 that three players
were accepted in their initial year of eligibility. Ryan led the
way, his fans will not be surprised to learn, by being named on all
but six of the 497 ballots cast.
</P>
<P>
   Now Nolan stood on the stage of the Nolan Ryan Center for
Continuing Education, on the campus of Alvin Community College, and
fielded questions from the media mob whose cars and vans filled the
parking lot. He did it with the easy grace of a Tony Bennett
responding to requests from the audience for his all-time hits.
</P>
<P>
   Every nine or 10 years Ryan changed teams, and by then a new
generation of batters would have surfaced, all potential jelly for
his toast. It worked that way in 1971, when he fled from New York
and landed in Disneyland, and again in 1979, when he left the
Angels for Houston. ``I was very close to Gene Autry,'' he
confided, ``and it was hard leaving the Angels.'' Then, one more
time, he shed his skin and reappeared as a Texas Ranger. On one of
the walls of the Nolan Ryan exhibit center is a quote, describing
the pain experienced by the fans of the Astros on his departure:
</P>
<P>
   ``Some will miss him every day of their lives, and some will
miss him every fifth day.''
</P>
<P>
   Low points? He's had a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has peaks and valleys,'' he said. ``With the Mets, I
had control problems. Then there was my first elbow surgery with
the Angels. In those days, they didn't have sports medicine. I
didn't know if my career was over, if I'd be able to pitch again.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there wasn't a lower day in my life than the day I flew
back from the winter meetings in Atlanta after signing a contract
with the Rangers. I realized I was no longer an Astro, wasn't going
to finish my career in Houston, that I was changing leagues. It
presented a whole new set of problems. I had to move my family up
there, find a home, new teammates, new organization. And this was
very late in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   As matters developed, the move provided Ryan with a powerful
finishing kick to an already illustrious journey. With the Rangers,
Nolie peppered the record book with his sixth and seventh
no-hitters, became the first pitcher to strike out 5,000 batters
and added the final 51 of his 324 wins.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, his career was cut short after just 27 seasons, and he
retired as a callow kid of 46 after blowing out his elbow at
Seattle in the final month of the 1993 season. He left with 53
major-league records. With the classic Ryan economy, he attributed
his Hall of Fame election to ``my longevity, and being able to
maintain a certain level in the later years.''
</P>
<P>
   When you think of all he accomplished over nearly three decades,
you feel a strong urge to tell him to sit down, that he deserves a
rest. But the eyes never revealed any fatigue, and the arm went
where the eyes led. He pitched over 5,000 innings, averaging a
strikeout an inning. This is power. This is consistency. This is
the essence of the game: the will of the solitary man to take on
the many.
</P>
<P>
   A package was handed out to the press Tuesday, 13 pages
detailing the highlights of his career, printed in that tiny type
that almost demands that you reach for a magnifying glass. But
neither words nor numbers are needed to justify Ryan's admission to
baseball's holy sanctuary. All you had to do was see him pitch.
</P>
<P>
   I covered his first win for the Mets, over the Astros and Larry
Dierker, on a Sunday in 1968, in front of his family and friends. I
have written about him off and on ever since, a fringe benefit of
this profession, but not one that entitles me to claim any special
intimacy. Nolan is most at ease with his neighbors, who have known
him all his life, and his former teammates, with whom he shared the
daily grind, the glory and the grief. This is part of his
character. You do not become his friend by lining up and taking a
number.
</P>
<P>
   He took note Tuesday of the campaign by the legendary Ted
Williams to have the Hall of Fame open its doors to Shoeless Joe
Jackson, banned for life after being tainted by the Black Sox
scandal of 1919.
</P>
<P>
   So Nolan used his new platform to work in a plug for one from
his generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind,'' he said, ``Pete Rose deserves to be in the Hall.
I saw Pete play the game. I saw him serve his time. I think he
ought to be honored for what he accomplished as a player.''
</P>
<P>
   This endorsement prompted a reference to the famous duel between
the two of them, when Rose was trying to break Stan Musial's
National League record for career hits _ on his way to Ty Cobb's
all-time mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the competitor Pete was and how hard it was to strike
him out,'' Ryan said, his eyes brightening at the memory. ``As much
as he was focused on getting the record off me, I was focused on
not letting him do it. He got the hit that tied the record his
first at-bat, then I struck him out the next three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``That whole scenario was one of the most meaningful moments of
my career. After he struck out the third time, he broke his bat on
the ground walking back to the dugout. Then he turned around and
saluted me. As a professional, that was one of the highest honors I
ever received.''
</P>
<P>
   All Pete was saying, really, was that ``you're a better man than
I am, Gunga Din.'' He was saying what so many of us have always
felt about this modest farmer from Alvin who built his monuments
one brick at a time.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
TEMPE, Ariz. _ Roy Kramer, the John DeLorean of the Bowl
Championship Series, is a happy man today.
</P>
<P>
   His silly little idea worked. His slick, style-over-substance
bowl scheme came away with a true winner in its first try at
unifying the national-championship race.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee and the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl ultimately deflected all
doubt about just which team was the best in the land.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake. It's Tennessee. BCS or no BCS, playoff or no
playoff, the Vols were a team that should have been No. 1 and
proved it. We have to believe the Vols would have found a way to
have us all whistling Rocky Top at the end of the season no matter
the circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee coach Phil Fulmer called it destiny. And after the
Vols' latest great adventure, we must believe.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs was a season highlighted by an escape at Syracuse, a
close win against Florida and the ball bouncing just the right way
against Arkansas. Monday night, the Vols put forth the lesser of
two ugly games in the Fiesta Bowl and again found a way to win.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Vols had faced a Florida State team at its best, we
have to believe they still would have responded and won.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Vols had had to scratch through a playoff bracket
instead of a one-game brawl for it all, we have to believe destiny
still would have been darling for Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, this is not to diminish what Tennessee accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   But let's look under the hood of Kramer's DeLorean. Let's look
at how the Vols might have won and deserved the national
championship but how the nation seemed to respond to the BCS
inauguration with a collective ho-hum.
</P>
<P>
   Like the DeLorean, the Fiesta Bowl was more glitter than
substance, with all the requisite Super Bowl-type hoopla in and
around Tempe. But the product fell well short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   There was bunting hung from the highest rafters of Sun Devil
Stadium. There were parachutists. There were fireworks popping all
around overhead. There were carnival-like activities bustling
outside the gates and special guests and celebrities arriving from
all over.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways, it was all like the stainless steel on the
DeLorean. It all looked nice but deceived. The game sputtered and
coughed. The public's reception to the game was disappointing to
many.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Tennessee is the best team in the country. But it deserved
to be at its best and sharpest in this championship game and
wasn't. The same is true for the Seminoles, who might never have
looked worse in a big game.
</P>
<P>
   The teams combined for a ridiculous 21 penalties, most of them
of the brain-lock variety. They both made numerous other mistakes.
Worse, there was an inordinate number of injuries on both sides,
including one play on which the starting left tackle and left guard
for Tennessee had to be helped off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Ask yourself something. Better yet, ask Roy Kramer: Would all
this ugliness have happened had Florida State not had a whopping
44-day break since its last game and Tennessee a 30-day break?
</P>
<P>
   Would these teams have been this out of sync and sloppy had a
college football playoff system been in place instead, during which
teams would have been more likely to stay in top form and focused?
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't the Florida State team that we like to be out
there,'' Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden said after the game. ``But
Tennessee had the same problem. Man, 44 days. That's a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Put it this way. The break FSU had between its final
regular-season game and the Fiesta Bowl was longer than spring
training usually lasts.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the only problem.
</P>
<P>
   Had a playoff system been in place, there would have been a
crescendo toward Monday night's championship game. There would have
been a steady association with these teams from the nation's casual
fans. Like what happens in an NCAA Tournament. Like what happens
with an NFL surprise playoff winner _ the Arizona Cardinals, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   More people would have fallen in line behind the likes of
Tennessee and Florida State, and by kickoff, the weeks of buildup
would have had TV viewers tuning in from Poughkeepsie to Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the host city obviously had no reason to feel giddy
about Tennessee or Florida State. Throughout the week, it became
obvious the Phoenix area couldn't care less, preferring to stay
home and watch Keith Jackson's ABC farewell.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices outside the gates plummeted in the hours before
kickoff, with $135 face-value tickets going for as little as $15.
The Arizona Republic reported Tuesday that one person boasted of
getting a ticket offer of ``$10 and a sandwich.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you were a true college football fan or touched by
Jackson's television farewell, there was no reason to stay tuned to
this one past the first few blunders of the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   This inaugural BCS experience showed us more than the mettle of
a true No. 1. It showed us why we still should hope for a playoff.

CANCER TREATMENT CENTER FOR DOGS AND CATS OPENS AT UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SHERRY JOE CROSBY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Reflecting the growing status of pampered pets in
American households, UCLA has opened a radiation-oncology center
for cancer-stricken dogs and cats.
</P>
<P>
   The new Veterinary Radiation Oncology Facility will treat dogs
and cats three days a week on an outpatient basis starting today
using surplus equipment from a campus lab.
</P>
<P>
   A monthlong radiation treatment will cost about $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people consider pets as members of the family,'' said Dr.
Edward Gillette, who pioneered veterinary radiation oncology 40
years ago and helped develop the UCLA facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're willing to pay the cost for medical care. The public
in this country is well aware of medical advances and they're
demanding that care for their animals.''
</P>
<P>
   The single-story west campus building and radiation machine,
valued at upward of $1.5 million, was provided by UCLA's department
of radiation oncology. Doctors from the Veterinary Centers of
America West Los Angeles Animal Hospital will provide the care,
paying UCLA a fee based on treatment planning and the number of
radiation treatments each animal receives.
</P>
<P>
   Veterinarians don't expect the high costs to deter devoted pet
owners. In 1997, Americans spent $7 billion on medical care for
their animals, according to the American Veterinary Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer is the leading cause of death in cats and dogs, and
veterinarians at the center expect 100 to 150 animal patients in
the first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pets are living longer as their owners take better care of
them,'' said Dr. Maura O'Brien, a veterinary surgeon at VCA West
Los Angeles Animal Hospital who will help treat animals at the new
center. ``But this means that pets are at an increased risk for
developing cancer at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle and Robert Pope of suburban Woodland Hills didn't
hesitate to spend $6,000 to treat their 2{-year-old male golden
retriever, Rio, who was diagnosed last fall with malignant melanoma
in his neck. The tumor had spread from his ear through his
lymphatic system toward his left shoulder, Michelle Pope said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were both devastated,'' said Pope, 35, a communications
technology sales manager. ``It was a pretty straightforward
decision. We felt compelled to act quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   With no radiation-oncology center available for animals in the
Los Angeles area, the couple sent Rio to a facility for humans in
suburban Norwalk that treats dog and cat patients after hours. (The
nearest animal radiation-oncology centers are at UC Davis, Colorado
State University and in Tucson, Ariz., doctors said.) If the UCLA
facility had been available, Pope said, they would have used it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The convenience is a big benefit,'' she said. ``We could have
taken him right in, whereas (with the Norwalk facility) we had to
take him in after hours and he had to be taken over in a van with
other dogs and cats.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Rio was not treated at the UCLA facility, doctors there
will continue to monitor the affable pooch, who is taking a cancer
vaccine and appears to be on the mend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing fine,'' Pope said. ``There's no loss of appetite.
The results speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The university decided to transform the building into a cancer
treatment center for animals after the radiation-oncology
department moved out and replaced an old cobalt radiation machine
with a larger model. The machine, which emits radioactive particles
that kill cancer cells, will be used on the animals.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA also had received inquiries from the community about
treating animals with cancer. After consulting with local
veterinarians, UCLA decided to enter into the partnership with VCA
West Los Angeles Animal Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it would be an ideal location and look at what we
would be able to do with this machine,'' said Alice Hacela, vice
chairwoman for administration for UCLA's department of radiation
oncology. ``This treatment option was available to veterinary
medicine. This was ideal for animal medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA students will be able to observe procedures, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The center will not perform surgery, chemotherapy or other forms
of cancer-fighting treatment, said Dr. David Bruyette, medical
director of VCA West Los Angeles Animal Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Veterinarians advise pet owners with pet medical insurance to
check with their carriers to see whether radiation treatment is
covered.
</P>
<P>
   The center's first patient, an 8-year-old domestic shorthair
cat, will undergo radiation treatment today for a fibrosarcoma
tumor between its shoulder blades. Fibrosarcoma is a fast-growing
cancer that tends to occur in older felines.
</P>
<P>
   While veterinarians at the facility said they can deliver the
same level of care to animals that humans receive, they will work
to improve the quality of life for their furry patients rather than
find a cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking cure but improving the quality of life,''
Bruyette said. ``Keeping them at home with their family.''

NUMBERS ARE WHAT COUNT MOST FOR HALL OF FAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For those who hope to stride past the velvet ropes
to baseball immortality, the dress codes just became clearer.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to see and be seen in Club MVP, you'd better get
duded up in the fashionable threads of a playoff team. But if you
want to dance in the exclusive Hall of Fame, it's all right to come
as you are.
</P>
<P>
   As arbitrary as it appears, that's the message of a pair of
recent votes by members of the Baseball Writers Association of
America.
</P>
<P>
   In November they turned Mark McGwire away from the National
League Most Valuable Player Award in favor of Sammy Sosa,
apparently because McGwire failed to ``lead'' his St. Louis
Cardinals to the playoffs while Sosa ``led'' his Chicago Cubs to
the wild card.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Hall of Fame vote announced Tuesday, the writers
honored Nolan Ryan and Robin Yount along with George Brett even
though Ryan and Yount usually were more like McGwire than Sosa when
September came and the pennant drive began.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for them, the unwritten rules of the Hall of Fame
encourage being yourself, no matter the company you keep, as long
as you cut a distinctive and memorable figure.
</P>
<P>
   In the end it didn't matter much that Ryan and Yount _ and even
Brett to a lesser degree _ will not be remembered as Mssrs.
October.
</P>
<P>
   Yount played 20 seasons with the Milwaukee Brewers, ``leading''
them to two playoffs, one pennant (1982) and no World Series
championships. One of the playoff appearances was a cheapie
resulting from the 1981 strike. The overall image is of Yount
slaving away for non-contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan pitched 27 seasons for four teams, making it to five
playoffs, one pennant and one World Series title. His playoffs,
like Yount's, included the '81 strike season. As for the World
Series, it came with the '69 New York Mets, for whom Ryan played
only a minor role. In his greatest seasons, Ryan couldn't overcome
the mediocrity of the Angels, Houston Astros and Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Even Brett wasted much of his prime on losing Kansas City Royals
teams. In 21 years, he made it to seven playoffs, which is more
than his share, and won two pennants and one World Series ('85).
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, a baseball player's greatness, more so than
other team-sport players', is measured by the quality of the
individual and the quantity of his deeds.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the same writers who missed that point last fall, voting
Sosa over McGwire as MVP despite McGwire's superior production, got
it right this week, electing three perfectly deserving Hall of
Famers.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time since the original Hall of Fame class in
1936 that three players were elected in their first year of
eligibility. And each is there for the right reason, because he is
one of a kind, the best or the most of something.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan: not the greatest pitcher of his day, but the prototypical
fastball pitcher of the expansion era; an inspiration to the
middle-aged, racking up 71 victories, four strikeout titles and two
no-hitters in his 40s; and the only man to strike out 5,000
batters.
</P>
<P>
   Brett: a fantastic combination of fire (see the pine-tar
incident) and grace (the template for a left-handed hitter); a
3,000-hit club member; and the only man to win batting titles in
three decades, the first at age 23 in '76 and the last at 37 in
'90.
</P>
<P>
   Yount: a big-hitting shortstop before that was in vogue; a
3,000-hit man; a prodigy who played less than a season in the
minors before joining the Brewers at 18; and one of only three men
to win MVPs at two positions.
</P>
<P>
   Yount's second MVP, in '89, was earned as he played for a
fourth-place team. That was before baseball writers adopted their
current, simplistic definition of ``valuable,'' in which making the
playoffs makes you a saint and missing the playoffs makes you a
selfish showboat.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe playing for the losing Brewers did hurt Yount in the Hall
of Fame vote, just not enough to make a difference. While Ryan and
Brett topped 98 percent, Yount squeaked in with 77 percent, just 2
percent above the threshold.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe Carlton Fisk, who was the best-supported of the
unelected in his first year on the ballot, was hurt by having given
us only one great postseason memory, the '75 home run and dance at
Fenway Park. But a better guess is Fisk, a tower of New England
stoicism, the most durable catcher of all time, will make it in
2000 when the company isn't as dazzling.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan and Yount made it, playoff regulars Tony Perez and Steve
Garvey missed out. So it's about the man, not the team.
</P>
<P>
   If Mark McGwire is never the MVP, he can always settle for the
Hall of Fame.

BCS IS A BUST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The final returns are in, and America has reached a consensus
about the Bowl Championship Series (BCS): It needs to be flushed.
</P>
<P>
   College football's first attempt at producing a national title
within the structure of the bowls proved as successful as America's
first ventures into space. It did not achieve orbit.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred thousand football fans in Tennessee would disagree
with this, understandably so, as might a few dozen bowl directors.
But among those in the nation who do not know the words to Rocky
Top or own any garish bowl blazers, the BCS plan was as tasty and
as satisfying as spam.
</P>
<P>
   Did it produce a national champ? Yes. But a 13-0 Tennessee would
have been national champ regardless of what team the Vols beat in
the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Did it produce a great game? Just the opposite. Tennessee's
23-16 win over Florida State was one untidy bowl, leaving most
viewers numb. If this was the best college had to offer, then maybe
everyone needs to go back to high school. Those who say the layoff
between the regular season and bowls played a role moronically
forget there's always been a four-to-six-week layoff.
</P>
<P>
   Did it capture the imagination of the country? No. The rating
Monday for the first collegiate version of the Super Bowl was a
less-than-expected 17.2. The Rose Bowl between two also-rans in the
BCS world, Wisconsin and UCLA, posted a 17.6.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the BCS is concerned, these are the wrong questions.
The truth is, the BCS did exactly what it was created to do -- keep
the bowls in control of college football's postseason and insure
their own survival.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of this monolith said a lot about creating a fair
system with some integrity, but neither was listed on its agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS selected a team in Florida to play in the Orange Bowl
over teams with better records and higher ranks. It gave an
automatic bid to a conference with a brief history.
</P>
<P>
   It created the kind of hype that can swallow college-age young
men whole. UCLA and Kansas State should have been proud of their
one-loss regular seasons; instead, they found their bowl assignment
to be a bummer, and played accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   It weaved computers into the system, only to find that some of
them can be as cantankerous as Hal in ``2001.'' The one system
considered the most reliable, Jeff Sagarin's USA Today model, had
Kansas State atop its listing the day after it lost the Big XII
title game. The New York Times computer had Florida State on top
most weeks despite having one loss.
</P>
<P>
   What all this does is further push people to the extremes:
College football either needs to go to a full playoff or junk the
BCS and go back to the old system. All of the other suggestions are
flawed.
</P>
<P>
   A two-team post-bowl title game? It wouldn't work. How do you
choose two teams out of four major bowl winners? And how do you
keep bowl business brisk? If you make the Fiesta Bowl a semifinal
of sorts, then 50,000 Tennessee fans don't visit go to Tempe. As it
was, it was a soft ticket in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   A four team post-bowl playoff? Better on one hand, more
troublesome on the other. The Big Four bowls ostensibly would be
quarterfinal games; they would only sign on if they were part of
the post-bowl playoff rotation and could ratchet down Jan. 1
attendance expectations. Plus, there's greater chance at leaving a
quality team out of the field because of automatic conference bids
(i.e., Syracuse over Kansas State, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   A 16-team field? It has the best chance of working. The only
team crying its fate would be the ranked 17th. It would let players
like Tulane into the game. It would not necessarily kill the other
bowls; they could exist and flourish for those schools
bowl-eligible but not playoff-bound, like the NIT.
</P>
<P>
   First-round games would be planted on the home field of the top
eight seeds, giving the playoffs some good momentum heading into
the Jan. 1 quarterfinals. Traditional bowl ties could be maintained
in the Big Four games. And the whole process would be creating
identity and name recognition for the Final Four teams, rather than
pasting a national title bumper on a game between two teams from
the south.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure many NFL fans didn't know Falcon's quarterback Chris
Chandler from ``Friends'' Chandler Bing. But they do now.
</P>
<P>
   Or we could just go back to the understated way things were,
when tradition meant something and teams and conferences earned
their rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Take us back to a simpler time, and you still would have had
Wisconsin-UCLA in the Rose Bowl -- only the Bruins wouldn't be
wallowing over a national title slight. Poll and rank never
mattered before, and it produced some great games, like UCLA over
Ohio State in 1976, and UCLA over Illinois in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Send the Big XII champ to Miami for the Orange Bowl and the SEC
champ to the Sugar. Make the Big East earn a major bowl tie-in on
merit instead of politics. Tell those conference playing title
games that they do so at their own risk. Let the ACC and Gator Bowl
become partners and challenge the Fiesta for prominence, just as
the Fiesta once challenged the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Let the debates rage into the night. Because frankly, they're a
whole lot more fun than Tennessee-Florida State on a Monday night.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Unless Barry Switzer undergoes a broader conversion than the old
Soviet Union, the bet here is that Gary Pinkel is the next football
coach at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Besides having a Husky pedigree, he has been successful on his
own, a Division I head coach for eight years. He's smart, smooth,
diplomatic, conservative, articulate, likable, good-looking and a
youngish 46.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the anti-Lambright.
</P>
<P>
   A Bob Bender in cleats.
</P>
<P>
   And he's anointed by grid god Don James, Hedges' principal
adviser and Pinkel's former boss as player and coach.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem with his selection is that it will be greeted
with a yawn so massive it threatens to sprain jaws throughout
Western Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Pinkel? Wasn't he the guy who slinked out of town in 1990
after Keith Gilbertson usurped him as offensive coordinator? Is he
the best Washington can do?
</P>
<P>
   Yes and yes.
</P>
<P>
   To those steeped in the Husky mythology that depicts the UW post
as a great job, consider how it looks to an outsider with little
knowledge of Montlake politics.
</P>
<P>
   For non-specific reasons, Hedges fired an alum and 30-year
coaching loyalist who had the misfortune of one bad season, and
that bad season was 6-6, not 0-11, in a program hampered by Pac-10
sanctions. He had a 44-25-1 record and was co-champion of the
nation's toughest conference as recently as 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Just a month earlier, he received an unqualified public
endorsement from the boss who subsequently reversed herself and
fired him without warning. Word was that boosters, still infatuated
with the James legacy, intimidated her into the firing.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who expects a coach the caliber of Barry Alvarez or Gary
Barnett to step into this flaming bucket, where they also have no
constituency or familiarity, is not in tune with college football.
</P>
<P>
   The best coaches in big-time Division I programs are highly
unlikely to make a move to Washington that's lateral at best and
messy at worst.
</P>
<P>
   In blowing up Lambright, Hedges also damaged her credibility
with candidates by going back on her commitment. Her statement last
week that the reversal was because ``that was November and this is
December'' sends the message that either she doesn't know what she
is doing, or she ignored problems until they suddenly became
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed by a prospective coach, she might whisper the
evidence she had on Lambright, but that coach has to wonder what
would be in store for him.
</P>
<P>
   Consider also that when Hedges explained the department was on
the hook for only a year's compensation to Lambright instead of all
four years of his rollover contract, she said, ``That way we can
tell recruits he's on a four-year contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Only if he doesn't get fired first. Hedges' dissembling is the
kind of thing that adds nothing to the cachet of the job.
</P>
<P>
   But to someone familiar with the byzantine ways of the UW, the
problems are manageable. Although Pinkel's 11 years as an assistant
ended before Hedges was hired in 1991, he's familiar with the
institutional perils and views the rewards as worth it. He comes
from a mid-major university in Toledo, where he has succeeded
steadily. Twice in the past four years he has been named coach of
the year in the Mid-American Conference, where he has a 57-31-3
record.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkel flew to Seattle last night and will be interviewed
Wednesday. He won't pester Hedges about Lambright's misdeeds. The
coaches worked together for a decade and Pinkel, as well as his
boss at Toledo, ex-UW administrator Pete Liske, remain thoroughly
plugged in to the purple grapevine.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkel will offer up the words of his mentor, James, and will
insist his deeds will be similar, particularly in areas of program
management and public profile, which are big deals to Hedges.
</P>
<P>
   The job of Wednesday's big-time college coach includes a
considerable amount of kissing up and toadying, and not just with
recruits. That's because the public jock factories are always in
need of grander facilities to help seduce the kids, and the jock
crowd no longer dares go to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the UW's $70 million plan to upgrade its multiple
ballyards includes a $36 million solicitation from the big-bucks
boosters, Hedges needs a football coach that not only will win but
will be a slickster to help with the begging.
</P>
<P>
   Lambright was not the type. Hedges has known it for most of his
tenure. For her first few years as AD, Hedges was in a weak
position to challenge the coach for two stupid but tangible reasons
_ she was neither a Husky nor a man.
</P>
<P>
   But through her previous coach hirings, her fund-raising skills
and the uptick in many non-revenue sports, Hedges gradually built
the credibility and guts to pull the trigger on the biggest Dawg.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lambright's own football fumbles eroded his support
sufficiently that the inevitable dismay over his dismissal was
muted and manageable.
</P>
<P>
   Her problem now is that in reaching the coveted point of hiring
her own coach, the carnage has reduced the field considerably. When
Washington gets snubbed by the Oregon State coach, it is plain the
job comes with many more thorns than the roses imagined by Husky
adherents.

US USED UN TO SPY ON IRAQ, AIDES SAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ US intelligence agencies, working under the
cover of the United Nations, carried out an ambitious spying
operation designed to penetrate Iraq's intelligence apparatus and
track the movement of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, according to US
and UN sources.
</P>
<P>
   The operation, which is believed to be ongoing, allowed US
intelligence agents to listen in on secret communications between
elite military units responsible for Hussein's security, the
sources said. It remains unclear if the plan was designed to topple
the regime.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration Tuesday declined publicly to address
the charges. ``I can't comment on intelligence matters,'' said the
US national security adviser, David Leavy. ``The relevant UN
resolutions mandate all member states to cooperate with UNSCOM in
its mission to eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program
and the United States fulfilled its obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   But US officials privately acknowledged that they were engaged
in the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said US infiltration of Iraq's internal security
infrastructure is far more extensive than has been made public. And
it has been largely facilitated, although sometimes unwittingly, by
the UN Special Commission, created by the Security Council in 1991
to make sure Iraq got rid of its nuclear, chemical, and biological
weapons, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The top-secret operation began in February 1996, they said. The
electronic surveillance team, which is operated by international UN
inspectors and run out of UNSCOM headquarters in Baghdad, was part
of a special UN inspection unit that tracked Iraq's ``concealment
mechanism'' _ an intelligence scheme that enabled Iraq to
anticipate UNSCOM's every move and hide evidence of its weapons
programs on a moment's notice. UN officials suspect Iraq received
information on UNSCOM personnel movements from Iraqi officials
assigned to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by Iraq's ability to evade UN weapons probes, the
United States supplied UNSCOM with eavesdropping equipment,
including commercial scanners and U2 spy photographs to monitor the
activities of the elite intelligence apparatus responsible for
hiding Iraq's prohibited weapons and securing Hussein's safety,
according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   The surveillance equipment, among other things, allowed UN
inspectors, sitting in their Baghdad headquarters, to listen in on
radio, cell phone, and walkie-talkie communications by members of
the Iraqi security network, the sources said. British and Israeli
intelligence analysts helped the UN inspectors interpret the
information. The United States also played a major role in
interpreting the data.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew a hell of a lot of information about presidential
security,'' Scott Ritter, former team leader of the UN program to
counter Iraq's concealment mechanism, said in a recent interview.
But he said if his team found any information related to Hussein's
personal safety, ``we would dump it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rolf Ekeus, former executive chairman of UNSCOM, who declined to
discuss the operational elements of the surveillance system, said
the program was run and controlled by the United Nations
inspectors, not the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it run by the US?'' said Ritter. ``Hell, no.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ritter said that changed in March 1998, when the United
States pressured British and Israeli intelligence to stop
supporting the UN eavesdropping operation, and took it over itself.
</P>
<P>
   With the approval of the new chief UN weapons inspector, Richard
Butler of Australia, the United States took control in April,
according to Ritter. By July, the system had been largely
automated, allowing the United States to listen in on Iraqi
communications from a remote location after the UN inspectors left
the country before the US-British bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter said the United States had yet to provide the UN
operation with a single briefing on the information by the time he
resigned in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US decided this system is too sensitive to be run by
UNSCOM. They bullied their way in and took it over,'' Ritter said.
``Now any data collected by this activity is not being assessed by
UNSCOM. Now, the US gained 100 percent access and is not feeding
any of it back.''
</P>
<P>
   A US official warned that the public disclosure of the report
would compromise US intelligence activities in Iraq, and he asked
the Globe to withhold certain operational details.
</P>
<P>
   Butler denied that he had allowed the United States to take
charge of a United Nations intelligence gathering operation. He
said UNSCOM is permitted by Security Council resolutions to accept
assistance from all member countries. But he denied he used that
information to help the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those charges are utterly without foundation. That is
completely false,'' Butler said. ``That I handed over such a
function to the Americans to operate within our organization is
completely false.''
</P>
<P>
   Ekeus said that he had agreed to accept the support of US
intelligence agencies in the hope it would help him get to the
bottom of Iraq's prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
   And he said the system helped UNSCOM counter Iraq's efforts to
hide its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Ekeus, now Sweden's ambassador to the United States, said Iraq
had developed a system of moving key defense assets during the Gulf
War. It had shielded its missile launchers by creating decoy
missiles and putting their real ones on trucks and driving them
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy was later employed to outfox the UN inspectors, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, an American inspector, David Kay, was led on a chase
through Baghdad by an Iraqi truck seeking to hide nuclear weapons
material.
</P>
<P>
   The defection of Brigadier General Hassan Kamal in 1995 produced
greater details on the extent of the Iraqi concealment, Ekeus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned heaps more about Iraqi techniques for hiding''
their weapons, Ekeus said. ``Our task was clear; to find prohibited
weapons. We started to design a system to catch'' them in the act.
</P>
<P>
   He said UN inspectors, selected from around the world, were
ordered to sign a contract pledging never to reveal data they found
to their governments or to the public.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear whether the United States used the
intelligence it gathered from the operation to select its targeting
during Operation Desert Fox, the four-day bombing campaign that
ended Dec. 19. But key figures and organizations under scrutiny by
the United Nations _ the Special Security Organization, the
Republican Guard Headquarters, and the Iraqi Intelligence
headqarters _ were blown up during the operation. So was the home
of Abid Hamid Makhmoud, the head of the concealment mechanism and
Hussein's personal safety operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one of only three people who know where Saddam spends
the night,'' Ritter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is an ongoing covert operation to overthrow Saddam
Hussein, it seems to me that Desert Fox has undermined it,'' said
Bill Arkin, a Washington-based specialist on the Iraqi military.
``The bombing and evacuation of UNSCOM has heightened security and
makes a coup or uprising more difficult to pull off.''

   1. NICK NOLTE WALKS THE DARK LINE Nick Nolte has done his share
of brainless Hollywood blockbusters, but now he says he's doing
only films he loves. Recently that means two dark dramas that may
earn him Oscar nominations : Terrence Malick's ``The Thin Red
Line'' and Paul Schrader's ``Affliction.'' Nolte talks about the
new films, the experience of working with the reclusive Malick, why
he thinks he fell victim to drugs and alcohol when he first reached
Hollywood and why the key to mastering his role in ``Affliction''
was coming to terms with his own capacity for violence. By Ian
Spelling. 1,400 words + photo. 2. PLACIDO DOMINGO INTERVIEW Placido
Domingo is far more than just one of history's most celebrated
tenors. As a burgeoning conductor and the artistic director of two
major opera houses, he is poised to be one of classical music's
most vital, versatile leaders of the new millennium. The
57-year-old Domingo is singing, conducting and promoting opera
around the world with his usual youthful zeal. Interview by Bradley
Bamberger. (Q&AMP;A format.) BPI. 2,500 words + photo. 3. JANIS JOPLIN
- PIECE OF HER ART An indelible icon of the '60s, Janis Joplin
drank Southern Comfort on stage, had affairs with women and men and
cruised the streets of Los Angeles in a Porsche 365 Cabriolet
painted in a psychedelic design. But the free-spirited blues
empress, who died of a heroin overdose at age 27, also talked
hopefully of marriage, babies and a traditional home. Nearly three
decades later, her story continues to tantalize Hollywood. Two
movies about her life are coming up - one is authorized by the
Joplin estate; the other is not. The history of the Joplin projects
proves just how difficult - and how desirable - it is to make
movies about rock legends. By Pat H. Broeske. From The Hollywood
Reporter. 1,800 words + photo. 4. EMILY WATSON Emily Watson's new
film, ``Hilary and Jackie'' is the real-life story of world-famous
cellist Jacqueline du Pri, who suffered from multiple sclerosis and
who died in 1987. Watson talks about the new film, how her Oscar
nomination for her role in ``Breaking the Waves'' changed her life,
how she learned to play the cello and portray the crippling effects
of MS for her latest role, and why she feels that some of the most
bizarre characters offer the best insights into real humanity. By
Jeanne Wolf. 1,200 words + photo. 
____________________________________________________________________
____________ 5. KEVIN SPACEY : AN ACTOR'S ACTOR ON ACTING Every
decade has its ``actor's actor,'' and in the '90s it's Kevin
Spacey, who won a 1995 Oscar for ``The Usual Suspects.'' He had
memorable roles in other films such as ``Seven,'' ``A Time To
Kill'' and ``The Negotiator.'' There's already Oscar buzz about his
latest film, ``Hurlyburly -- and a different kind of buzz about his
other current film, ``A Bug's Life'' (his voice is used for the
villainous grasshopper in this animated film.) Spacey talks about
his new films, his decade-long dedication to the filming of
``Hurlyburly,'' his role as Hopper in ``A Bug's Life,'' his
memories of his winning night at the Oscars and why, to him, it is
incompatible to be both an actor and a movie star. By Cindy
Pearlman. 1,400 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 6.
SEAN PENN IS RESTLESS On a night drive to nowhere in particular,
Sean Penn escapes a Woody Allen set, philosophizes about what's
wrong with Hollywood, trashes the paparazzi - and confides that
he's just got to quit the movie business, again. By Lynn
Hirschberg. From The New York Times Magazine. Full-length (6,500
words) + edited article available.
_______________________________________________________________ 7.
MEN WHO MADE 'MONSTERS' In 1957, director James Whale (he had
directed classic horror films such as ``Frankenstein,'') was found
dead in his Los Angeles swimming pool. There were rumours that the
Englishman had been the victim of foul play. Whale was openly gay
in an intolerant era when few dared to be. Now comes the film
``Gods and Monsters,'' starring Sir Ian McKellan, a speculative
look at the final days of Whale's life. It is a vivid and moving
portrait, both of Whale and of a Hollywood that no longer exists.
By Joshua Mooney. BPI. 1,300 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 8.
EVERYBODY'S FAVOURITE BORG Since Jeri Ryan made her first
appearance as the Borg-turned-human, ``Star Trek: Voyager'' has
received a welcome boost in critical commentary, ratings and fan
buzz. Ryan talks about the series, the struggle of her
cross-country marriage to investment banker Jack Ryan - they
recently split up - how she approaches her unique StarTrek
character (complete with marriage proposals, look-alike teddy bears
and dress-alike fans.) By Cindy Pearlman. 1,400 words + photo.

 &HT;    The politics of a girl's dream
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It is the closing moments of the final
Dole/Clinton debate before the November election. After a weak
start, the candidates are finally on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton: ``I think what really matters is what we can do to help
build strong families. Strong families mean a strong economy. To
me, that means we have to go on and balance this budget while we
protect Medicare and Medicaid and education and the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole: ``Young people are looking to us for leadership. They're
watching what we do, what we say, what we promise, and what we
finally deliver. When I'm president of the United States, I will
keep my word. My word is my bond.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate is over; the candidates step forward to congratulate
each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good job, Elizabeth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well done, Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, a girl can dream, can't she? Maybe it's only because it
has been such a Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad year in
Washington, but, since Elizabeth Dole's resignation Monday from the
American Red Cross, I find myself fantasizing about having a woman
for president.
</P>
<P>
   I know, I know, it's a long way from Dole's sorta-maybe
candidacy and November of 2000, but it's still heartening to hear
people talk about a woman's potential candidacy with something
resembling respect. What a contrast with the election of '84, when
Geraldine Ferraro was widely regarded as a drag upon the ticket.
(Never mind that the real drag on the ticket turned out to be
Walter Mondale.)
</P>
<P>
   I'll never forget the words of the late Cincinnati anchorman Al
Schottelkotte as he broadcast the returns. The Democrats' dismal
showing, he proclaimed, was because of having a woman on the
ticket, ``and it will be a long time before anybody attempts
something that foolish again.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing red, I called a station manager the next morning. His
response, in a nutshell: ``He's a curmudgeon. What can you
expect?''
</P>
<P>
   We can expect better. And what better time, after an outrageous,
disappointing year, than to think of government in new ways?
</P>
<P>
   Dole has as good a shot at 2000 as anybody, predicts University
of Dayton associate professor David Ahern. ``Being a woman in
public office is no longer a negative, as it once was,'' Ahern
said. ``In fact, some argue it's a positive because of the growing
perception that women bring a different style of politics to the
table _ a more consensual, less combative style.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . I think the time is ripe for a female candidate, given
Washington, D.C., today and discussions about the 'politics of
personal destruction.'''
</P>
<P>
   I would never vote for a woman I didn't respect or didn't agree
with on the issues. But I would take great joy in voting for a
woman or a minority I believed in. Why does it matter?
</P>
<P>
   Because it's about darn time. Since George Washington became our
first president in 1789, the Republic has sailed along with only
one woman, and not a single person of color, on a major-party
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Because Congress may well be one of the most segregated work
places, by gender, in America. There are only 65 women in Congress;
there are 470 men.
</P>
<P>
   Because diversity is important in government for the same
reasons it's important everywhere else. Women and minorities bring
different perspectives, could appoint a greater variety of people
in positions of power. A woman might give issues such as child care
and breast cancer the attention they deserve. Or health care. Or
child welfare. Or domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   A woman might even think there are more important issues in
Washington than a politician's sex life.
</P>
<P>
   Like I said, a girl can dream.
</P>

 &HT;    Scientist tours top U.S. lab
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A top Russian space scientist who visited
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base this week might have been impressed
by U.S. technology, but not its ability to deal with snow: The
storm that nearly paralyzed America's midsection last weekend
looked like a typical winter day in Moscow, a base scientist said.
</P>
<P>
   Nikoli Anfimov, first deputy director of Russia's Central
Research Institute of Machine Building, toured laboratories at
Wright-Pat and held ``very in-depth technical discussions'' with
researchers from Sunday through Tuesday morning, said Tom Daniel,
executive director of the Air Force Research Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   AFRL has its headquarters at Wright-Pat, and five of its 10
research directorates are located on the base, Daniel said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian institute provides science, technology analysis and
testing for the Russian Space Agency. Anfimov's visit was the first
to Wright-Pat by a top official from a top member of that
institute, Daniel said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's space program has made news recently mainly for its
financial problems, which have raised concerns in the U.S. about
its ability to deliver its share of hardware for the International
Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel said Russia's problems shouldn't overshadow its
tremendous space expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This financial situation they've found themselves in this last
few years is an extremely difficult one, but it doesn't negate the
fact that there are tens of thousands of superior scientists and
research engineers that have expertise in areas that we're very
interested in,'' Daniel said.
</P>
<P>
   He described Anfimov's visit as an initial contact that could
lead to closer ties between Russian and Air Force scientists,
especially in the area of high speed flight and spaceplane-type
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A face-to-face meeting like this is quite often the start of a
collaborative activity that may go on for years,'' Daniel said.
</P>
<P>
   Anfimov might have suggestions for snow control, too.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel said Anfimov arrived in Washington on Saturday and was
scheduled to fly to Dayton the same day, but the storm that hit the
eastern half of the U.S. delayed his arrival here until late Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks there's nothing wrong with this weather,'' Daniel
said with a laugh. ``He said in Moscow they handle the snow much
better than we handled it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anfimov is also scheduled to visit Air Force research sites at
Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico and Edwards Air Force Base in
California. He was not available for interviews.

 &HT;    Writer of `Key Largo' believes he can grab golden ring again
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Bertie Higgins almost had it all. Just like Bogey
and Bacall. Starring in his own late, late show, sailing away to
Key Largo.
</P>
<P>
   Straddling a meteor and whooping all the way, the singer rode
his song, Key Largo, to the top of the charts 16 years ago. Radio
worldwide has played the infectious pop hit 4 million times, or
300,000 hours.
</P>
<P>
   When the meteor petered, it dropped him back in Tarpon Springs,
Fla., the Greek sponge-diver tourist town where he grew up, about
75 miles northwest of Tampa. With no new hits and no record deal,
he found himself playing the same beach joints where he started.
</P>
<P>
   And then it all got worse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, after 13 years of marriage, his wife left him with
their two sons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he was arrested for DUI, hit and run, fleeing deputies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he served 80 days in jail for the DUI and was ordered
to pay restitution.
</P>
<P>
   But as December drains the last of '98, Bertie's absolutely
joyous. He's crammed against a tiny table at Newk's Cafe across
from Tampa's Ice Palace arena. It's an hour before a Jimmy Buffett
concert, a solid 20,000 sellout.
</P>
<P>
   Foam sharks and fins on their heads, Buffett's middle-age
Topsider/Dockers crowd is ready to get rowdy.
</P>
<P>
   Bertie, in a gray sport coat, plain black T-shirt and gray
slacks, is ecstatic and drinking ice water while those packed
around him slosh rum drinks on each other like a B-movie frat
party.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett's Margaritaville rocks the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what anybody says,'' Bertie shouts as he fishes
for a Marlboro Light in his black leather fanny pack. ``I wouldn't
trade show business for anything. This is great!''
</P>
<P>
   You may not have hummed the last hit from
Portuguese-Irish-German singer-songwriter Elbert J. Higgins.
</P>
<P>
   Bertie has a new 19-song CD _ and a new shot at the big time.
</P>
<P>
   A second chance came when a friend introduced him to Sal
Diaz-Verson.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz-Verson, a former president of AFLAC Inc. life insurance,
owns a Columbus, Ga., investment business. Seven years ago, the
Miami native opened Diaz-Verson Capital Investments, which manages
more than $200 million, a combination of pension money and cash for
``high net-worth'' people including entertainers.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a year ago, he started Key Largo Productions to
promote concerts as well as revive and manage Bertie's career.
Verson's vision is pure business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great asset ... '' says Diaz-Verson. ``He has a real
niche in the (U.S.) market. He's got a great following. Bertie did
very well in the Far East. He's well-liked in Japan and the
Philippines.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz-Verson has no fears launching Bertie into the tropical
music market ruled by Buffett.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bertie was an unknown who never created anything then I'd
worry about that,'' he says. ``Bertie has created his own songs and
earned gold and platinum. He's a writer, composer, singer in his
own right.''
</P>
<P>
   The first thing Diaz-Verson did was finance the new 19-song Trop
Rock CD that includes a few new songs from Bertie such as In
Christiansted and The Breath of God plus his signature Key Largo
and his international hits Just Another Day in Paradise and Jamaica
Me Crazy. There's also Buffett's Margaritaville, the Beach Boys'
Kokomo, Harry Belafonte's Jamaica Farewell, Bobby Bloom's Montego
Bay and Leah, a duet with Roy Orbison recorded just before the
legend died in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Bertie's team is testing sales on radio and cable TV. By spring,
the CD/tape ($18.95/$15.95 plus shipping) will be sold through ads
on VH-1 and other cable channels. Diaz-Verson says if sales hit
225,000 copies, he'll shop it to a label. Down the road,
Diaz-Verson is considering opening a big-band theater in Branson,
Mo., called Bertie Higgins' Club Key Largo.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the Trop Rock songs were produced by Jeff Cook, whose
band, Alabama, has notched 42 No. 1 country hits. The way he sees
it, Bertie doesn't need a No. 1 hit to climb back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to dare imply he won't have one,'' begins Cook,
``but if he never has another No. 1, he has the material and
ability to make a really good living. Especially with that little
(Trop Rock) niche there, he could play the Florida coasts, the
Carolina coasts and Virginia coast all he wants to.''
</P>
<P>
   Lining up dates is Jesse Garon's new job. He owns American
Concerts in Nashville. Garon's a laid-back, homespun,
how's-the-wife-and-kids? have-you-lost-weight? kinda' guy. He books
Johnny Rivers and had past success with Mickey Gilley and Dan
Seals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job before us,'' begins Garon, ``is to have Bertie be the
hit artist as opposed to the artist who puts out hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Longevity in the adult contemporary market is the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll find that the artist people want to take home is
vulnerable, sensitive and emotional,'' says Garon. ``Bertie is
touchable. He's friendly. If some of the things Bertie has had to
live through comes out in his music, I predict he'll have his
resurrection in his back pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Garon is sending a Bertie video, CD and press kit to 3,000
prospective buyers: casinos, corporate conventions, fairs and
festivals. Bertie's New Year's Eve gig at Langley Air Force Base in
Virginia earned him nearly $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``All success,'' concludes Garon, ``comes down to heart and
preparation. If you're not a prima donna who thinks the world owes
you a living, with heart and drive you'll do fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertie, says Garon, has heart and drive.
</P>
<P>
   And this time, after those previous falls fueled by alcohol,
Bertie's armed with a self-effacing nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time I took myself very seriously,'' he says, ``as you
grow older, you realize a sense of humor is as critical as water,
food and air when it comes to facing the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertie was in Atlanta, cold, broke and lonely when he wrote his
biggest hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote Key Largo for my girlfriend (Beverly), who became my
wife,'' he recalls. ``We had broken up. Growing up in Florida, I
had spent a lot of time in the Keys and I was a big
black-and-white-movie Bogart fan. It just all came together.''
</P>
<P>
   When his music publisher, Bill Lowery, heard the song, he danced
around his desk telling Bertie it'd be a hit. ``Lad, you've finally
written one!''
</P>
<P>
   Bertie wasn't sure. ``It was certainly huge in my heart but
after writing 200 songs, you don't know if it's going to be huge.''
</P>
<P>
   But one huge song isn't earning autograph requests 16 years
later.
</P>
<P>
   Bertie squeezes through the Buffett crowd at Newk's to a quiet
spot a half-block away. Mr. Mom since his wife moved out, he's on
his cell phone to make sure his sons, Aaron, 11, ``my skateboard
guy'' and Julian, 14, ``my young film director'' have eaten and
done homework. His ``tiny Portuguese mother,'' Charlotte, 82, and
his girlfriend, Rhonda, help with the boys when he's away. Bertie's
oldest son, Damian, 26, used his computer science degree from Pitt
to become Diesel Boy, a top techno DJ on the rave party circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Beverly had enough Bertie. They remain
separated. These days they talk frequently. She lives in Tarpon
Springs and sees the boys.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his problems eased when he quit drinking after the '96
DUI arrest. His Chrysler rear-ended a 17-year-old girl's Isuzu. She
wasn't hurt but he led deputies on a chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drinking and driving, zero tolerance, I agree with it,'' he
says. ``It was a very difficult time.''
</P>
<P>
   If he was cold in the music biz before the arrest, he was
freeze-dried after the DUI. And he was nearly broke trying to fit
lawyer fees and settlements into his annual Key Largo royalties and
residual checks of $30,000 to $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   With those checks comes a label: one-hit wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I don't like it.'' he says. ``But what do you do
about it? About one percent of people in the music business have a
No. 1 song. I'm in an elite group of people. I'm blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Buffett show, along with other fans, Bertie punches
pre-concert beach balls floating around the arena. He watches
Buffett's elaborate Don't Stop the Carnival opening and after eight
songs he has gotten what he came for _ the rush of a big crowd at a
big concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not as successful as Jimmy Buffett, and I don't compare
myself to Buffett,'' he says. ``I respect him.'' He mentions in
amazement all the work singer-songwriter-author Buffett must turn
down and laughs. ``Hey, I'd settle for being the Kmart version of
Jimmy Buffett.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertie leaves the show and heads down a deserted arena concourse
when a woman jumps out from an arena portal, grabs him and squeals.
Through the grace of the gods, the singer isn't bald or fat and
looks just like his 16-year-old album covers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're Bertie Higgins!''
</P>
<P>
   A bit stunned, he says, ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Ruth,'' she bubbles, hands on his shoulders as she bounces
in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, hello, Ruth,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He walks away beaming on his way to the big climb back.

 &HT;    It's time to get rid of your closet chestnuts
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Even the professional closet-cleaner has
trouble with her own.
</P>
<P>
   An Oscar de la Renta silk cocktail dress, black with large
bright flowers, never seems to make it off the hangar and into
Lenore Ber's consignment-store pile.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she wears it, says Ber, a West Palm Beach wardrobe
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just had a hard time because it's such a beautiful
print.''
</P>
<P>
   Such hopeful foot-dragging, she's found, can backfire _ closets
jammed with wrong-size dresses, pleated pants or blouses with
Knot's Landing shoulder pads.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this might come back in style,'' clients say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I just found a matching pair of slacks ... ''
</P>
<P>
   ``It just needs to be taken in/let out a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Resist, says Ber. With holiday shopping over, it's time to
create some serious closet space.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that easy. To illustrate, we had employees of West Palm
Beach's recreation department delve into their closets.
</P>
<P>
   Why them? Well, last month the women dredged up some
less-than-happening duds to dress as ``Tacky Tourists'' for the
city's holiday spirit parade.
</P>
<P>
   Director Laura Schuppert went to Goodwill for part of her
outfit, a $1 navy vest printed with tiny Scottie dogs.
</P>
<P>
   She's decided to keep it. ``You know what? The reverse side
could work with silk black pants, as long as the puppies didn't
show,'' says Schuppert, who hasn't cleaned out her closet in 12
years.
</P>
<P>
   Some of her co-workers clean as many as four times a year. Yet,
all could find something that's always hanging around _ along with
an excuse for why.
</P>
<P>
   Here are Ber's advice and the rec department women's closet
finds _ some worn, some not, but all still there.
</P>
<P>
   Heave-ho!
</P>
<P>
   Tips from Lenore Ber:
</P>
<P>
   EVERY TIME you buy something, try to get rid of an item in the
same category. Bought a dress? Dump a dress. CLEAN THE CLOSET with
every lifestyle change _ new job, new husband, etc. GET HELP from a
friend who can tell you the ugly truth. FOR EACH ITEM, ask
yourself: Do you wear it? Can you wear it? DIVIDE the iffy clothes
into piles marked ``alterations,'' ``consignment,'' ``cleaners''
and ``toss.'' USE dark bags for the clothes you want to get rid of,
so you don't see them, weaken and pull them back out. REMEMBER,
nothing ever comes back in style exactly as it was before. NO
sneak-cleaning attacks on others' closets. It's rude. DON'T BE a
sucker for sales. A $5 paisley, poofy-sleeve blouse is still a
paisley, poofy-sleeve blouse.

 &HT;    Exclusive club lets in the riffraff
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Eanes school district trustees laid a large egg
when they picked the supposedly members-only Austin Country Club to
interview their three finalists for superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   If this place is exclusive, then I'm a Mongolian sheepherder.
Trust me. They'll let any jerk in at this club.
</P>
<P>
   I know, because on Tuesday I managed to worm my way in for lunch
at the Austin Country Club. And I'm not a member.
</P>
<P>
   Any country club that would let me in off the street unannounced
has to be squirrely, right?
</P>
<P>
   So Eanes trustees were lucky Tuesday when country club officials
decided not to allow the Eanes superintendent candidate interviews
to be held there for fear the general public might show up for the
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the trustees might have found themselves accompanied
by riffraff such as myself.
</P>
<P>
   It was around 11:30 Tuesday morning when I walked into the
Austin Country Club, off Loop 360, like I owned the joint.
</P>
<P>
   The young lady hostess by the front of the elegant,
high-ceilinged restaurant, called The Mixed Grill, asked me if I
was a member. I told her I wasn't. She asked if I was meeting
somebody. No, I said, I just wanted to look the place over. She
took down my last name, but I'm pretty sure she didn't recognize
it. You could tell by the way the hostess and the waiter were
exchanging odd glances that they figured I might be some rich club
member's crazy uncle. So they didn't dare ask me to leave.
</P>
<P>
   After the hostess seated me at my table, a couple of women even
older than me walked in and sat at the next table over. One was
wearing a fur coat, and the other was carrying one.
</P>
<P>
   I thought about saying, ``Looks like it's been a good hunting
season; what's the bag limit on muskrat?'' But I didn't want to
push my luck.
</P>
<P>
   The manager of The Mixed Grill, a polite old gentleman named
Ferdinand von Hapsburg, approached my table, wringing his hands. He
said he recognized my name, but I wondered how could he be sure who
I really was. He didn't ask me for an I.D. He explained the club
didn't take cash because it wasn't set up for it. He asked if I
could provide him with the name of a member, for billing purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I guess one?'' I asked him. I was thinking about giving
him the name of some famous rich guy who might be a member, like,
say, developer Jim Bob Moffett. What the heck? He could afford to
spring for lunch for a walk-in, right? But von Hapsburg wouldn't go
for it. I think what really gave me away was I forgot to ask for
the Grey Poupon.
</P>
<P>
   For non-member gate crashers such as myself, the prices at the
Austin Country Club are extremely reasonable. My ``ACC Burger'' _ a
six-ounce patty of certified Angus ground chuck _ was priced at
only $4.95.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a membership at the club would have set me back
$40,000 down and $250 a month. But being a surprise guest, I didn't
have to concern myself with that. So you downtown winos might want
to check this place out.
</P>
<P>
   I should say that the service was swift. After all, I'm sure
they wanted me the hell out of there. And it was a really good
burger _ cooked medium rare, just the way I'd ordered it. And while
I was eating, von Hapsburg returned and hovered around my table,
like he expected me to steal the silverware.
</P>
<P>
   I asked him if the club had problems with non-members like me
showing up for lunch. He said in the 15 years he'd worked there, it
had happened ``maybe seven times.''
</P>
<P>
   He said this with the conviction of a man who could remember in
great detail all seven loons who had done this.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that is part of life,'' von Hapsburg said with a sigh.
``Every once in a while you get a little diversion, and you take it
with a grain of salt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I've been here, are you going to name this hamburger
after me?'' I asked von Hapsburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's already been named,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Von Hapsburg was a patient man, and handled all this with good
humor. If I'd been in charge out there, I would have thrown me out.
</P>
<P>
   Before I left, I put a $10 bill on the table. If that's not
enough, I'll be glad to go back and wash dishes later.

 &HT;    Legislators would do well to pay heed to venerable statesman
 &HT;    Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ ``Please don't pass any more laws,'' wrote Bill
Hobby, Texas' former lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Hobby is in a position to know what is best for Texas. He is one
of Texas' most respected public servants.
</P>
<P>
   He presided over the Texas Senate from 1973 to 1991 as
lieutenant governor, an elective position considered the most
powerful in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Hobby, a scholar of Texas government, passed along a lot of
sound advice to legislators.
</P>
<P>
   In his ``Dear legislator'' open letter that appeared in the
Dallas Morning News, Hobby congratulated Texas House and Senate
members on their recent election but warned them that the easy part
is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill that really counts is the general appropriations
bill,'' Hobby wrote. ``In that one bill you will decide how well
Texans will be educated, regulated, imprisoned and medicated for
the next two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobby gave the lawmakers advice designed to cut through wasteful
grandstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spend every nickel you can on education,'' he advised. ``Every
nickel you don't spend now will cost dollars in the future for
welfare and prisons.''
</P>
<P>
   But after lawmakers pass the budget bill and put every nickel
possible on education, then what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Then go home,'' Hobby wrote. ``Please don't pass any more
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   But how can Texas legislators go home after passing the
education-heavy budget and ignore the issue every Texas politician
promises to tackle as soon as he or she gets to Austin?
</P>
<P>
   Texas pols love to fight crime. That's why Texas taxpayers own
one of the world's largest and most expensive prison systems.
</P>
<P>
   Hobby could see this one coming. He spelled it out for incoming
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who wants to amend the penal code probably thinks he is
'getting tough on crime' by creating another one. If we could
eliminate, or even reduce, crime by passing laws, we wouldn't have
built prisons. New laws in the penal code create more crimes and
more criminals. We already have enough criminals. So just vote
no.''
</P>
<P>
   Another way to avoid more laws, criminals and expensive prisons,
Hobby advised lawmakers: ``Don't try to tell people what it is you
don't want them to put into the minds or bodies. (See above.)
Ungrateful louts that they are, they won't appreciate your advice
or even pay attention. So just vote no.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobby also has seen his share of bills promoted as improvements
to existing laws. Knowing that legislators will see more of these
better-solution bills, Hobby warned:
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever somebody wants to 'reform' something, hold on to your
purse or wallet tightly. What that person really wants to do is
transfer money or power from some other group to his own group.
Maybe that is all right. In fact, that is why legislatures meet
every year or so _ to change power and money relationships to fit
the political realities of the day. But when somebody tells you
that he wants to 'reform' something, he is saying, 'Trust me.' Just
don't think the world is going to be a better place after it is
'reformed' _ or be disappointed when it isn't. So just vote no.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobby also warned lawmakers to not be ``silly.'' For example, he
told of a law establishing the amount of water needed to flush a
toilet and evolution laws. He might have added the Texas law
designed to punish people who insult Texas cows or vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Hobby warned lawmakers to put Texas ahead of partisanship and to
cut back in several specific government functions.
</P>
<P>
   Spend every spare nickel on education, don't be silly, cut out
unneeded government operations and just say no.
</P>
<P>
   Easier said than done. But it's a the sort of advice that could
make the 76th Legislature the best ever.

 &HT;    Advice from the Bard
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Someone had all the questions and all
the answers long before Dr. Ruth, Abby and Ann or Miss Manners. He
had all the insight long before Freud, Einstein and Andy Rooney. He
wrote Lady Di's life story 370 years before it unfolded. Bill's and
Monica's, too.
</P>
<P>
   The lovers on the Titanic? Old story, done best by this fellow.
Your children driving you nuts? Done. Feel like a fool in love? The
Bard's been there.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   Twelfth night is the last day of the Christmas feasting season.
Shakespeare had something to say about feasting, too. He had
something to say about everything we hold dear.
</P>
<P>
   His simplest lines hold meaning. ``Out, damn spot'' means one
thing to the owner of a Dalmatian, something else again to Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   We took in the new movie, Shakespeare in Love, a wonderful _ if
artistically licensed _ look at the Bard's own love life. It's the
309th film based on Shakespeare's works.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare is quite white, quite dead and quite male, but a
world without his writing is a world without irony, poetry and
insight. He was voted Man of the Millennium by BBC listeners in
Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Our research ended with a perusal of our old volumes for more of
the Bard's hidden meanings, his answers to questions asked by
today's parents, lovers, teenagers and national leaders.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, he's timely.
</P>
<P>
   The Bard on impeachment:
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's big hope _ All's Well That Ends Well
</P>
<P>
   Ken Starr introspects _ ``Wherefore do I do this? So the
question stands.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In one take this week.)
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or E-mail
him at q&AMP;(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several years ago, Q&AMP;A printed information about an
orphanage, maybe in Nevada, that recycles and sells used Christmas
cards. Can you repeat that? I have had my office workers and Sunday
school class save their cards for me.
</P>
<P>
   A: You're remembering St. Jude's Ranch for Children, a Nevada
community focusing on the needs of abused, abandoned and neglected
children of all races and faiths. It operates the St. Jude's Born
Again Recycling Program, which started more than 30 years ago.
Children take the fronts of used greeting cards of all occasions
(not limited to Christmas), glue them to preprinted card backs, and
sell the ``new'' cards to the public. It's important that donors
help by sending card fronts only, with no writing on the reverse,
that can be trimmed to fit 5-by-7-inch card backs. Each child earns
15 cents for each card he or she makes. Send to: St. Jude's Ranch
for Children, 100 St. Jude's St., Boulder City, NV 89005-1618.
Those wishing to buy Born Again Cards can send $6.50 for a package
of 10 to the ranch at P.O. Box 60100, Boulder City, NV 89006-0100;
the same address is for any other correspondence. For credit-card
purchases, call 1-800-492-3562. Other information: 702-294-7124.
</P>
<P>
   Q: For my planning purposes, can you list the dates and cities
of the next several Super Bowls after this year?
</P>
<P>
   A: Super Bowl XXXIV, Jan. 30, 2000, Georgia Dome, Atlanta; XXXV,
Jan. 28, 2001, Raymond James Stadium, Tampa, Fla.; XXXVI, Jan. 27,
2002, Louisiana Superdome, New Orleans; XXXVII, Jan. 26, 2003,
49ers' new stadium, San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Paul Harvey always tells incredible human interest stories on
his radio shows. Has he compiled a book of them, or is a tape of
them available?
</P>
<P>
   A: Harvey has compiled several books, but most are no longer in
print, said a spokeswoman for Paul Harvey News in Chicago. However,
two of them still may be available in paperback, she said: ``For
What It's Worth'' and ``Destiny,'' both published by Bantam.
Bookstores can order them, she added. Audiotapes aren't available.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Please refresh my memory: On what basis did President Gerald
Ford pardon the woman known in World War II as Tokyo Rose?
</P>
<P>
   A: As one of his last acts in office, Ford pardoned Iva Toguri
D'Aquino in January 1977 in the wake of support for a pardon that
had been building since the year before. That sentiment grew out of
a widely held belief that D'Aquino was a victim of anti-Japanese
fervor after World War II. D'Aquino _ the only American-born
Japanese woman out of a dozen or more radio propagandists all
termed Tokyo Rose by American GIs _ had gone to Japan for a visit
in July 1941 and was stranded there against her wishes when the
United States and Japan went to war. She took a job with Radio
Tokyo doing 15-minute broadcasts. After the war ended, she was held
by the U.S. government and indicted on eight counts of treason.
Convicted in 1949 on one count and sentenced to 10 years in prison,
she was released in 1956 for good behavior. At last report, she was
living quietly in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is Henry Hyde being permitted to participate in the
Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton when he voted in the
House for impeachment?
</P>
<P>
   A: The role that Rep. Henry Hyde (R.-Ill.) is performing in the
Senate impeachment trial is different from the one he performed in
the House. He was among a majority of representatives who voted to
present articles of impeachment to the Senate for trial. This is
along the lines of a grand jury voting to indict someone on charges
requiring a court trial.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate trial, Hyde will head a group of 12 other
representatives who will act as ``managers,'' or prosecutors, of
the case against Clinton. They will try to persuade the Senate to
vote to convict. There are 100 members of the Senate and it takes a
two-thirds vote, or 67, to convict. If that happens, Clinton will
be out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The smallest of the octuplets born in Texas _ the one who
died_ weighed 10.3 ounches when she was born. What is the smallest
baby every born to survive?
</P>
<P>
   A: The answer depends somewhat on your definition of survival.
The Guinness Book of World Records 1998 says the smallest,
longest-living baby to survive is a 9.9-ounce premature girl named
Madeline. She was born on June 29, 1989, at Loyola University
Medical Center in Maywood, Ill, and is now 9 years old. Smaller
babies have been born alive but survived for only short periods of
time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent news article said that someone in Louisiana had
developed a board game similar to Monopoly that made fun of
Louisiana politics. How do I get the game?
</P>
<P>
   A: The game is called Politricks and was developed by Kippy
Sumrall, a Baton Rouge entrepreneur who says he hopes one day to
run for public office. It is available at various retail outlets in
Louisiana. It may be ordered, however, from Kippy Productions Inc.,
13953 Perkins Rd., Baton Rouge, LA 70810. Cost, including shipping,
is $34.95, with payment by credit card or check. Kippy Productions'
phone number is 1-225-751-9606.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do glassmakers get the different colors in glass?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to Britannica, little is known about the actual
cause of color in glass beyond the fact that certain materials
added to and melted with certain glass mixtures will produce
various colors. The coloring agents are generally metallic oxides.
The same oxide may produce different colors with different glass
mixtures, and different oxides of the same metal may produce
different colors. Examples given by Britannica include these:
Cobalt normally provides a purple-blue color; chromium, a chrome
green or yellow; manganese, a violet; uranium, a canary; lead, a
pale yellow; copper, a peacock blue or green.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What were the identifying numbers on the hotdogs that were
recalled recently?
</P>
<P>
   A: The recall is for hotdogs and other packaged meats labled
with EST. P-261 or 6911 for Ball Park, Bill Mar, Bryan Bunsize and
Bryan 3-lb. Club Pack hotdogs, Grillmaster, Hygrade, Mr. Turkey,
Sara Lee Deli Meat and Sara Lee Home Roast brands. Call the Food
Safety and Inspection Service at 1-800-535-4555 if further
information is desired.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been using a credit card for some time that offers a 1
percent rebate on purchases, but it is discontinuing the rebate. Do
you know of any good gold or platinum cards that offer a rebate
other than Discover?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several firms that follow credit card offers and
publish information about them. One of the best-known is Cardweb
Inc. of Gettysburg, Pa. You may call 1-800-344-7714 for brief
ordering information, or contact its Internet site at
http://www.cardweb.com for more extensive information. The site
lists more than 50 rebate _ or reward _ credit cards of various
types offered around the nation. Once you reach the site, click on
Cardtrak, then on Card Surveys. Detailed information is provided
about some of the rebate cards, but you have to call others for
details of their offer. The site also provides information on other
types of credit card offers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If President Clinton is censored rather than impeached, what
does censure mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: In simple, political terms, a vote by the Senate to censure
Clinton means he remains in office. A Senate vote to convict means
he no longer is president. In legal terms, ``Black's Law
Dictionary,'' considered the standard authority, defines censure as
``the formal resolution of a legislative, administrative or other
body reprimanding a person, normally one of its own members, for
specified conduct.'' And reprimand is defined as ``to reprove
severely, especially with authority,'' the type of authority a
Senate vote for censure would carry.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was the compact disc developed, and what was the first
music issued on a compact disc?
</P>
<P>
   A: The compact disc was introduced in the United States in 1983,
according to ``Famous First Facts.'' It was manufactured by the
Japanese company Sony using technology pioneered in 1979 by the
Dutch company Philips. Information, whether it's music or computer
files, is stored on a CD, a plastic disc, as a series of digital
pulses that is read electronically. The first music _ or ``album''
_ sold on a CD was ``52nd Street'' by Billy Joel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I fairly often hear people use the expression ``gone south,''
apparently to describe someone abandoning a responsibility of some
sort. What's the meaning or orgin of the expression?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gone south is used to convey two different meanings. The
``New Dictionary of American Slang'' says it means to disappear
quickly ``as if vanishing,'' and probably comes from the ``notion
of disappearing south of the border, in particular the Mexican
border, to escape legal pursuit and responsibility,'' especially in
the days of the Old West when outlaws slipped back and forth across
the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms'' says gone south
means to deteriorate or decline, as in ``the stock market is headed
south again,'' and is thought to allude to compasses and
two-dimensional maps where north is up and south is down.'' Both
dictionaries say a third possible source of the term is the
widespread Native American belief that the soul after death
journeys to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read in the newspaper that the U.S. Census Bureau is hiring
thousands of people to help with the 2000 census. How do I apply
for one of the jobs?
</P>
<P>
   A: Call the Census Bureau toll-free at 1-888-325-7733 for
information on the jobs. The government needs to hire several
hundreds of thousands of workers to complete the census.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent newspaper article referred to ``reformulated
gasoline'' and ``low-sulfur gasoline.'' What are the differences in
the two fuels?
</P>
<P>
   A: To explain all the differences between the two gasolines
would require a chemical engineering degree but, basically, both
are gasolines designed to lower auto exhaust emissions to improve
air quality. Low-sulfur gasoline emits reduced amounts of nitrogen
oxides, which in turn lower ozone levels. Low-sulfur gasoline is
expected to cost a few cents more a gallon than regular gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Reformulated gasoline is an even cleaner burning _ and
considerably more expensive: perhaps 20 cents or more a gallon _
gasoline that reduces various exhaust emissions, including benzine,
a mixture of hydrocarbons. It already is sold in California.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is the Social Security cost-of-living increase so small
this year? Is Social Security running out of money?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 1.3 percent cost-of-living increase for 1999 is the
smallest since 1986, when it also was 1.3 percent _ but it has
nothing to do with the amount of money in the Social Security trust
funds. The Social Security increase for 1999 is based on inflation:
the increase in the Consumer Price Index from the third quarter of
1997 through the third quarter of 1998. Because of low inflation in
recent years, Social Security cost-of-living increases have been
low for the last decade. The biggest increases ever were in 1980
and 1981 when Social Security rose 14.3 percent and 11.2 percent,
because inflation was unusually high those two years.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security's trust funds, the money that underwrites Social
Security payments, are sufficient at the current time to make full
payment to retirees. There is concern, however, that the growth of
the nation's retired population will strain the ability of Social
Security to make full payments beginning early in the 2030s. To
prevent this, government and private officials are studying what to
do to ensure the long-term financial stablilty of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My favorite postage stamp ever is the Sylvester and Tweety
32-cent stamp, but with the change to 33-cent postage, I am afraid
it will be phased out. Who do I write to request that Slyvester and
Tweety be reissued as a 33-cent stamp?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not just your favorite; it seems to be everyone's.
Sylvester and Tweety's portrait was the top-selling stamp of 1998.
The Postal Service says nearly 38 million stamps featuring the
battling cat and canary were saved by collectors during the year,
beating their nearest rivals by several million.
</P>
<P>
   What U.S. postage stamps are issued is not decided by a single
agency, but the place to begin is the Citizens Stamp Advisory
Committee, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW, Room 4474EB, Washington, DC
20260. If it helps your feelings, a 33-cent Daffy Duck stamp will
be issued in 1999. First-class postage rises from 32 cents to 33
cents on Jan. 10. The first 33-cent stamp to be issued will be the
Year of the Hare, one of a series of U.S. stamps celebrating the
Chinese astrological calendar. It goes on sale Jan. 5 in Los
Angeles, and in the rest of the nation the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the regulations regarding overtime pay to employees
who don't work at least 40 hours in a week, but may be required to
work 12 hours or more on a single day?
</P>
<P>
   A: Federal law that governs overtime pay applies only to more
than 40 hours worked in a week, not to the number of hours worked
in an individual day, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. An
employee may be required to work 10 or 12 or more hours in a single
day without overtime pay so long as he or she doesn't work more
than 40 hours that week.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Considering posssible financial problems relating to Y2K,
would U.S. government securities be the safest investment haven for
a concerned retiree?
</P>
<P>
   A: There is disagreement about how much Y2K _ the potential
failure of computers to recognize ``00'' as the year 2000 rather
than 1900 _ will cause financial recordkeeping problems for the
government and private companies. In general, however, there is
little or no disagreement among investment professionals about the
safety of U.S. government securities. U.S. Treasury bills, notes
and bonds are ``the safest possible investment,'' said Grace
Weinstein, author of ``The Lifetime Book of Money Management.''
U.S. securities are direct obligations of the U.S. government and
are exempt from state and local income taxes. Their downside is
that their rate of return is generally lower than private
securities.

run for public office. It is available at various retail outlets in
Louisiana. It may be ordered, however, from Kippy Productions Inc.,
13953 Perkins Rd., Baton Rouge, LA 70810. Cost, including shipping,
is $34.95, with payment by credit card or check. Kippy Productions'
phone number is 1-225-751-9606.

   Q: How do glassmakers get the different colors in glass?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to Britannica, little is known about the actual
cause of color in glass beyond the fact that certain materials
added to and melted with certain glass mixtures will produce
various colors. The coloring agents are generally metallic oxides.
The same oxide may produce different colors with different glass
mixtures, and different oxides of the same metal may produce
different colors. Examples given by Britannica include these:
Cobalt normally provides a purple-blue color; chromium, a chrome
green or yellow; manganese, a violet; uranium, a canary; lead, a
pale yellow; copper, a peacock blue or green.

<P>
   Q: What were the identifying numbers on the hotdogs that were
recalled recently?
</P>
<P>
   A: The recall is for hotdogs and other packaged meats labled
with EST. P-261 or 6911 for Ball Park, Bill Mar, Bryan Bunsize and
Bryan 3-lb. Club Pack hotdogs, Grillmaster, Hygrade, Mr. Turkey,
Sara Lee Deli Meat and Sara Lee Home Roast brands. Call the Food
Safety and Inspection Service at 1-800-535-4555 if further
information is desired.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been using a credit card for some time that offers a 1
percent rebate on purchases, but it is discontinuing the rebate. Do
you know of any good gold or platinum cards that offer a rebate
other than Discover?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several firms that follow credit card offers and
publish information about them. One of the best-known is Cardweb
Inc. of Gettysburg, Pa. You may call 1-800-344-7714 for brief
ordering information, or contact its Internet site at
http://www.cardweb.com for more extensive information. The site
lists more than 50 rebate _ or reward _ credit cards of various
types offered around the nation. Once you reach the site, click on
Cardtrak, then on Card Surveys. Detailed information is provided
about some of the rebate cards, but you have to call others for
details of their offer. The site also provides information on other
types of credit card offers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If President Clinton is censored rather than impeached, what
does censure mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: In simple, political terms, a vote by the Senate to censure
Clinton means he remains in office. A Senate vote to convict means
he no longer is president. In legal terms, ``Black's Law
Dictionary,'' considered the standard authority, defines censure as
``the formal resolution of a legislative, administrative or other
body reprimanding a person, normally one of its own members, for
specified conduct.'' And reprimand is defined as ``to reprove
severely, especially with authority,'' the type of authority a
Senate vote for censure would carry.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was the compact disc developed, and what was the first
music issued on a compact disc?
</P>
<P>
   A: The compact disc was introduced in the United States in 1983,
according to ``Famous First Facts.'' It was manufactured by the
Japanese company Sony using technology pioneered in 1979 by the
Dutch company Philips. Information, whether it's music or computer
files, is stored on a CD, a plastic disc, as a series of digital
pulses that is read electronically. The first music _ or ``album''
_ sold on a CD was ``52nd Street'' by Billy Joel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I fairly often hear people use the expression ``gone south,''
apparently to describe someone abandoning a responsibility of some
sort. What's the meaning or orgin of the expression?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gone south is used to convey two different meanings. The
``New Dictionary of American Slang'' says it means to disappear
quickly ``as if vanishing,'' and probably comes from the ``notion
of disappearing south of the border, in particular the Mexican
border, to escape legal pursuit and responsibility,'' especially in
the days of the Old West when outlaws slipped back and forth across
the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms'' says gone south
means to deteriorate or decline, as in ``the stock market is headed
south again,'' and is thought to allude to compasses and
two-dimensional maps where north is up and south is down.'' Both
dictionaries say a third possible source of the term is the
widespread Native American belief that the soul after death
journeys to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read in the newspaper that the U.S. Census Bureau is hiring
thousands of people to help with the 2000 census. How do I apply
for one of the jobs?
</P>
<P>
   A: Call the Census Bureau toll-free at 1-888-325-7733 for
information on the jobs. The government needs to hire several
hundreds of thousands of workers to complete the census.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent newspaper article referred to ``reformulated
gasoline'' and ``low-sulfur gasoline.'' What are the differences in
the two fuels?
</P>
<P>
   A: To explain all the differences between the two gasolines
would require a chemical engineering degree but, basically, both
are gasolines designed to lower auto exhaust emissions to improve
air quality. Low-sulfur gasoline emits reduced amounts of nitrogen
oxides, which in turn lower ozone levels. Low-sulfur gasoline is
expected to cost a few cents more a gallon than regular gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Reformulated gasoline is an even cleaner burning _ and
considerably more expensive: perhaps 20 cents or more a gallon _
gasoline that reduces various exhaust emissions, including benzine,
a mixture of hydrocarbons. It already is sold in California.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is the Social Security cost-of-living increase so small
this year? Is Social Security running out of money?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 1.3 percent cost-of-living increase for 1999 is the
smallest since 1986, when it also was 1.3 percent _ but it has
nothing to do with the amount of money in the Social Security trust
funds. The Social Security increase for 1999 is based on inflation:
the increase in the Consumer Price Index from the third quarter of
1997 through the third quarter of 1998. Because of low inflation in
recent years, Social Security cost-of-living increases have been
low for the last decade. The biggest increases ever were in 1980
and 1981 when Social Security rose 14.3 percent and 11.2 percent,
because inflation was unusually high those two years.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security's trust funds, the money that underwrites Social
Security payments, are sufficient at the current time to make full
payment to retirees. There is concern, however, that the growth of
the nation's retired population will strain the ability of Social
Security to make full payments beginning early in the 2030s. To
prevent this, government and private officials are studying what to
do to ensure the long-term financial stablilty of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My favorite postage stamp ever is the Sylvester and Tweety
32-cent stamp, but with the change to 33-cent postage, I am afraid
it will be phased out. Who do I write to request that Slyvester and
Tweety be reissued as a 33-cent stamp?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not just your favorite; it seems to be everyone's.
Sylvester and Tweety's portrait was the top-selling stamp of 1998.
The Postal Service says nearly 38 million stamps featuring the
battling cat and canary were saved by collectors during the year,
beating their nearest rivals by several million.
</P>
<P>
   What U.S. postage stamps are issued is not decided by a single
agency, but the place to begin is the Citizens Stamp Advisory
Committee, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW, Room 4474EB, Washington, DC
20260. If it helps your feelings, a 33-cent Daffy Duck stamp will
be issued in 1999. First-class postage rises from 32 cents to 33
cents on Jan. 10. The first 33-cent stamp to be issued will be the
Year of the Hare, one of a series of U.S. stamps celebrating the
Chinese astrological calendar. It goes on sale Jan. 5 in Los
Angeles, and in the rest of the nation the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the regulations regarding overtime pay to employees
who don't work at least 40 hours in a week, but may be required to
work 12 hours or more on a single day?
</P>
<P>
   A: Federal law that governs overtime pay applies only to more
than 40 hours worked in a week, not to the number of hours worked
in an individual day, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. An
employee may be required to work 10 or 12 or more hours in a single
day without overtime pay so long as he or she doesn't work more
than 40 hours that week.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Considering posssible financial problems relating to Y2K,
would U.S. government securities be the safest investment haven for
a concerned retiree?
</P>
<P>
   A: There is disagreement about how much Y2K _ the potential
failure of computers to recognize ``00'' as the year 2000 rather
than 1900 _ will cause financial recordkeeping problems for the
government and private companies. In general, however, there is
little or no disagreement among investment professionals about the
safety of U.S. government securities. U.S. Treasury bills, notes
and bonds are ``the safest possible investment,'' said Grace
Weinstein, author of ``The Lifetime Book of Money Management.''
U.S. securities are direct obligations of the U.S. government and
are exempt from state and local income taxes. Their downside is
that their rate of return is generally lower than private
securities.

dubbed heroine Grace Covington ``an African-American Miss Marple,''
and DeLoach is now the author of a series of ``Mama'' mysteries.
DeLoach talks about her road to success and her new novel, ``Mama
Rocks the Cradle.'' Also, because of Epictetus' role in Tom Wolfe's

dubbed heroine Grace Covington ``an African-American Miss Marple,''
and DeLoach is now the author of a series of ``Mama'' mysteries.
DeLoach talks about her road to success and her new novel, ``Mama
Rocks the Cradle.'' Also, because of Epictetus' role in Tom Wolfe's

 When Word Changes Your Name  
 By David Einstein   
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Question: &LR;  About two months ago, Microsoft Word suddenly
decided that my name, which is Jeanne, should be spelled Jeannie.
Every time I type my name, it changes the spelling. This is making
me nuts! My daughter suggests the easiest way to fix the problem
would be to go down to the DMV and change the spelling of my first
name! Do you agree, or is there something I can do?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Have you seen the lines at the DMV? You'd be there for
hours. Besides, you can fix the problem yourself pretty easily.
First, here's what probably happened. At some point, someone typed
Jeanne and Word thought it was misspelled, because it wasn't in the
program's dictionary. The spell checker offered Jeannie as an
alternative, and the typist mistakenly clicked on AutoCorrect. From
that point on, Word figured Jeanne ought to be Jeannie.
</P>
<P>
   AutoCorrect is actually a nifty feature. It lets you assign
words that you often misspell, along with the correct spellings.
Then it automatically fixes mistakes as you type.
</P>
<P>
   In your case, however, perhaps it should be called AutoScrewup.
In any case, here's what you do: Choose AutoCorrect from Word's
Tools menu. Scroll down the list until you come to your name. Then
delete the entry. That should do it.
</P>
<P>
   My Favorite Things
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you tell me how to back up my Favorite Places and Address
Book in the new 4.0 version of America Online?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure. Both the Address Book and Favorite Places are stored in
a file that bears the same name as your screen name. The file also
contains your Personal Filing cabinet, which includes any mail or
messages you've downloaded. You'll find the file in the folder
labeled Organize inside the main AOL folder on your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   To back up the file, simply save it to another place on your
hard drive, or to a floppy or Zip disk. You can also save your
Favorite Places by clicking the Favorites icon on the toolbar,
right-clicking the Favorite Places folder and choosing Save Folder
As ...
</P>
<P>
   The Right Stuff
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are a small nonprofit which is about to move into a larger
space and will need about half a dozen new computers that can
network with one another. Everything we have is old and
incompatible. We mostly use WordPerfect and Word and we don't need
fancy programs. But we do need e-mail and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of equipment do we need, and can you suggest a
reliable, well-priced hardware system?
</P>
<P>
   A: With so few PCs involved, you don't really need a full-blown
local area network in which a ``server'' computer manages the
others. You can get by with what is called a ``peer-to-peer``
network, in which all the computers are linked to each other with
cables. They can share files, documents and messages, as well as
peripherals like printers.
</P>
<P>
   Another, increasingly popular way to go is to create a wireless
network. Several companies, such as WebGear of San Jose, make
wireless networking equipment that can have your PCs talking to
each other in a jiffy, for less than $200 per PC.
</P>
<P>
   With a simple peer-to-peer network, you can hook up all the PCs
to a single phone line and give everyone Internet access. The
drawback is that only one person at a time can be on the Web. If
more than one person must be online at the same time, you should
opt for a more traditional type of network configuration.
</P>
<P>
   That means each PC will need a network interface card (NIC).
You'll also need a small device called a hub to connect the
computers. And you'll need a high-speed leased line to provide the
Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   As for which computer system you should get, virtually any new
PC can be part of a network. And all major PC manufacturers have
lines of computers optimized for small businesses such as yours.
Check out the possibilities from Dell, Gateway, Micron, Compaq and
IBM in a copy of Windows magazine or PC World.
</P>
<P>
   The Fate of Files
</P>
<P>
   Q: On my computer when I delete anything it goes into the
Recycle Bin, which I eventually empty. When the bin is emptied,
where do the files go? Are they still stored in the computer, or is
it totally gone from the system?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's gone. Dead. Finished. Extinct, Kaput. So be careful. The
Recycle Bin is your last chance to change your mind and restore a
file after you've deleted it from the regular file system. When you
empty the bin, everything in it is erased from the hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to add an extra layer of protection, so that you can
recover erased files, you can install something like Norton
Utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there are experts who can recover files even after they're
erased from the hard drive. That's because a ``ghost'' of the file
remains on the disk. The only way to completely erase it is to
overwrite the entire disk with random information many times.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A San Leandro reader contributes this week's suggestion: For
easier Web surfing, use a ``metasearch'' engine, which
simultaneously uses a number of top search engines and returns the
best results from all of them. Three such searching powerhouses are
www.metacrawler.com, www.infind.com and www.isleuth.com.

NATIONS STRIVE TO LIMIT FREEDOM OF THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID L. MARCUS   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As promised, the Internet is turning into an
unstoppable geyser of information, a source of data, news and
opinions that flow freely around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Except in China, which blocks access to sites about Tibet,
Taiwan, democratic movements and dissident groups.
</P>
<P>
   Except in Saudi Arabia, which censors sites critical of the
royal family.
</P>
<P>
   Except in Germany, where a judge sentenced a CompuServe manager
to two years in prison for allowing access to pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Except in Cuba, which has seized laptop computers from
dissidents as ``subversive instruments.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, despite grand promises, the Internet is not yet an
unrestricted electronic village green for the world. The more
information that becomes available, the more governments try to
stanch the flow with new filtering technologies or strict limits on
who can use computers. Democracies as well as dictatorships are
cracking down on sites that are found to be too dangerous, too
lurid, or too controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The restrictions are coming fast and furious,'' said Barry
Steinhardt, chairman of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an
advocacy group based in San Francisco, and head of the American
Civil Liberties Union's task force on cyber-liberties. ``The
Internet is very frightening to many governments because it's an
inherently democratic medium, so the first reaction is to reach out
and control it.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 20 countries restrict access to Internet sites, from
Bahrain, which bans electonic versions of Playboy magazine and home
pages that the government says are pornographic, to Singapore,
where the Ministry of Information and the Arts keeps out sexually
explicit material and news critical of the government.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen other countries are considering restrictions.
The European Union, for example, is weighing proposals to ban child
pornography and xenophobic materials. In Germany, freedom-of-speech
advocates are outraged by a judge's decision in May to sentence the
CompuServe official to jail (the judge suspended the sentence).
</P>
<P>
   The United States, too, is trying to restrict the Internet. A
1996 law, the Communications Decency Act, criminalized on-line
communcations that were ``obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy or
indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass another
person.'' Under that definition, independent counsel Kenneth W.
Starr's report to Congress on President Clinton probably would have
been banned from the Net. The Supreme Court struck down the law,
but another aimed at sites harmful to children is supposed to take
effect next year.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of civil liberties groups _ such as Global
Internet Liberty Campaign, Digital Freedom Network, Internet
Freedom, OpenNet, and Britain's Cyber-Rights and Cyber-Liberties _
vehemently oppose restrictions on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But many specialists argue that the issue is more complex.
Shouldn't Germany have the right to restrict false and provocative
Nazi propaganda? Shouldn't American states have the right to stop
electronic dissemination of step-by-step instructions on assembling
a car bomb? And why should any government allow child pornography
to proliferate?
</P>
<P>
   ``In all countries, you will find people who argue that certain
things should not be available to other people,'' said David
Webster, chairman of the Transatlantic Dialogue on Broadcasting and
the Information Society, a group that includes private industry and
government. ``No politician gets up and says: `I think the
availability of pedophilia material is concomitant to liberty.'
He'll lose his seat.''
</P>
<P>
   The impulse to restrict access has been highlighted this month
in China, where the government is holding its first trial of a
``cyber-dissident.'' Lin Hai, a 30-year-old software engineer, is
charged with inciting subversion by providing 30,000 Chinese e-mail
addresses to a dissident group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Lin, who says he is innocent, faces a maximum penalty of life in
prison. Lawyers who follow China's one-sided judicial system say he
is likely to be convicted.
</P>
<P>
   In Shanghai, a physicist named Wang Youcai, who registered an
independent political party, was sentenced to 11 years in prison.
His crime: communicating with democracy activists inside and
outside of China. As President Jiang Zemin cracks down on dissent,
other cyber-sedition trials are likely in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Less dramatic but just as important, China's day-to-day
censorship of the Internet affects scores of groups. The
International Campaign for Tibet, for instance, often receives
reports that the Chinese government has blocked access to its web
site, said communications director Teresa Perrone. But she added
that enterprising scholars in China often find ways to circumvent
the censors and look at the group's information.
</P>
<P>
   Several groups report that when the government blocks sites, the
information still reaches Chinese via e-mail, bulletin boards, chat
rooms, web sites with code words that filters cannot detect and a
variety of creative ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``China may be the extreme case because they attempted to up a
pretty impervious wall around the Internet,'' said Adam Clayton
Powell III, vice president of the Freedom Forum, which advocates
unrestricted media. ``However, because China wants to be a world
economic power they need high-speed, real-time, financial
information.'' Financial reports from services such as Dow Jones or
Reuters often contain political news.
</P>
<P>
   For every new restriction on the Net, there are new ways to get
around it, said Vint Cerf, senior vice president for Internet
architecture and technology at MCI-Worldcom. ``It just isn't
possible,'' to keep things away from Net viewers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jonathan Zittrain, executive director of the Berkman Center
for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School, said improved
technology will make it easier to keep track of who is looking at
the Net and to restrict what is seen. ``China has fairly crude
tools for filtering, but my prediction is the Internet of 2000 is
one that China will have less difficulty in regulating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries that have sampled the Internet have found it
distasteful. Last year, Vietnam decided to allow the public to use
Internet services. But 10 days ago, the Communist Party decided to
set up a committee to consider restrictions as a way of
``correcting mistakes and bias,'' the Liberated Saigon newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stronger the central government, the more conservative
they are in terms of allowing political information on the
Internet,'' said Grey Burkhart, a retired communications expert
from the Navy reserve who helps international groups get access to
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Burkhart has taken a special interest in developing countries,
including Russia, Bosnia, and Syria. It isn't easy. Despite the
government's pledges to open Syria, the country still has no
Internet service provider. To access the Internet, computer users
have to make long-distance calls to Lebanon and other countries.
Syrians aren't allowed to have cellular telephones, which are
considered a security risk.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, Syria allowed computer modems to be
installed and an Internet service is promised.
</P>
<P>
   The most restrictive countries, including Iraq, North Korea and
Cuba, are those that control all forms of media, not just the
Internet. In Havana's airport, several laptops carried in by
passengers and intended for dissident groups have been seized in
the last couple of years, said Frank Calzon, executive director of
the Center for a Free Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Police even took a $150 electronic typewriter from a dissident
becaue it was ``an instrument of high-tech subversion,'' Calzon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Latin America, which has a tradition of
censorship, has been quite open to the Internet. Pedro Armendariz,
the director of Investigative Editors and Reporters in Mexico, a
non-profit group, has traveled to conferences in Brazil, Argentina,
Colombia, Peru and throughout Mexico. Outside of Cuba, he has found
no restrictions on the Net, other than the expense of service and
unreliable telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would dare to say that far from having serious restrictions
in Latin America, we have a problem with sorting through so many
things on the Net and discriminating about what is useful and what
is garbage,'' Armendariz said.

INTERNET COMPANIES PUSH ON-LINE CALENDARS AND ORGANIZERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATT BEER   
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This coming year, two San Francisco-area
Internet companies are betting that on-line customers will abandon
paper-based or hand-held electronic organizers and keep track of
their lives on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Mountain View-based Visto and Woodside-based
Magically Inc. have posted Web sites that feature personal on-line
calendars and telephone number managers a user can access from any
computer with a Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of these Web applications argue that these sites will
be a success because of the openness of the wired crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, you were a nobody if you didn't have an
unlisted phone number,'' said Rao Machirajau, chief technology
officer with Magically Inc. ``Now, everybody has a Web page where
they're spilling their guts. So keeping things like appointments
and telephone numbers on-line is no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Users of these Web-based organizational tools can store
information ranging from telephone numbers to addresses and even
events calendars on the sites by entering the data onto a
datebook-like template. Magically and Visto then store the
information on servers that are accessible on any computer logged
into the Internet. The information is protected by a password
selected by the individual user.
</P>
<P>
   Besides calendar and phone number services, sites like
Magically's MagicDesk (www.magicaldesk.com) and Visto
(www.visto.com) are trying to lure subscribers with free e-mail and
on-line data file storage areas.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that users will be so enamored of the service that
they'll eventually subscribe to the premium pay sections of these
personal information sites. These sites include larger data storage
areas and capabilities to synchronize the on-line information with
a computer's personal information manager program, hand-held
machines like the Palm Pilot and, eventually, cell phones and other
portable devices. These upgrades cost about $10.
</P>
<P>
   ``By having your information at a central point on the Web, you
can walk up to any computer and access it,'' said Steve Cox, vice
president of marketing for Visto. ``I have this saying: It's the
content, stupid. It's not the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox said these services allow workers to become more portable,
enabling them to move back and forth between home and office with
ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a service that frees people from having to not schlepp
around disks or use other devices to carry their information back
and forth from the office,'' said Cox.
</P>
<P>
   It's also an idea that has caught the attention of major Web
portal sites, like Yahoo, which has posted its own calendar and
phone service. Excite and Lycos are expected to launch their own
versions of the service early next year.
</P>
<P>
   But the success of these services may be hampered by the usual
Web complaints: Privacy and speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information software and other devices are fast,'' said
Bridget Leach of Giga Information Group, an information technology
research firm based in Cambridge, Mass. ``The Web is slow and some
people won't want to deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Leach said concerns over privacy could also hamper the growth of
the on-line personal information market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some hesitancy putting such personal information
up on the Internet,'' Leach said. ``But there were those concerns
about e-mail, and it didn't stop people.''
</P>
<P>
   Financially, both firms are banking on private capital to get
off the ground. Magically is a closely held company funded by
several venture capital firms in Hong Kong and an undisclosed
telecom company, according to Machirajau. The site went on-line
Dec. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Visto is also a closely held company, funded with Silicon Valley
venture capital, including a July infusion of $9 million from New
Enterprise Associates, a VC firm that has computer pundit Stewart
Alsop on its board, Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy O'Neill, an analyst with Dataquest, a San Jose-based
market research company, said the main beneficiary of these new
organizer sites will be the sites themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are what we call `sticky applications,''' O'Neill said.
``The Web sites want people to get dependent on them and keep
coming back. If you spend a good two hours on a Saturday entering
your phone numbers and appointments at Yahoo, you're not going to
want to do that again if you're thinking about switching your home
page. It worked with free e-mail. It'll probably work with these
new services.''

ADDRESSING ON THE TELEPHONE SYSTEM AND THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Energy
has announced it will hold hearings next month to discuss the
creation of four new area codes for eastern Massachusetts. Once
again, it seems, Massachusetts regulators are facing a difficult
question: Should they geographically split the existing area codes,
the same way that the 617 and 508 area codes were split when the
781 and 978 codes were created, or should they adopt an overlay
plan, in which the new area codes will be laid over the existing
ones?
</P>
<P>
   The big advantage of a geographical split is dialing. With a
split, Grandma can call across the street by dialing seven digits.
The big advantage of an overlay plan is that nobody has to change
area codes.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Department of Public Utilities, under
considerable pressure from the Legislature, mandated that Eastern
Massachusetts take the geographical split. Officials said nobody
would have to change phone numbers. What they didn't realize at the
time was that in today's regional and national economy, a person's
area code is just as much a part of a phone number as the last
seven digits.
</P>
<P>
   The split was supposed to create enough new telephone numbers to
last for nearly a decade. The fact that we are running out now is
the result of a number of factors. First, a few towns, such as
Watertown and Belmont, were switched from 718 into 617 as the
result of political pressure. A second problem has to do with
allocation; the telephone companies aren't using the numbers as
efficiently as they could.
</P>
<P>
   But the fundamental reason behind the need for new area codes is
that people are using more telephone numbers than they have in the
past, a direct result of the expansion in cellular telephones,
pagers, Internet access, and large corporations with direct-inward
dialing.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 20 years, the Internet has had to wrestle with
these same issue of expansion and renumbering. But unlike users of
the telephone system, Internet users have been largely isolated
from the dislocations that come with growth.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators and technologists planning the future of the
telephone system could learn much from the Internet's example.
Every computer on the Internet has its own unique number, called an
Internet Protocol address. These numbers are roughly the same size
as 10-digit phone numbers; where there are 10 billion possible
10-digit phone numbers, there are 4 billion possible 32-bit IP
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Local dialing has always been a distinctive feature of the
telephone system. If you want to call the Massachusetts State House
from Boston, you dial 727-2121; to call from California, you need
to dial 1-617-727-2121. The IP protocol, on the other hand, has
never had local dialing. No matter whether your computer is opening
up a connection to a computer on the other side of the office or
the other side of the world, it uses a 32-bit IP address.
</P>
<P>
   Like the telephone system, the Internet's 4 billion IP addresses
are split up according to geography and by provider.
</P>
<P>
   The domain name system works like a big White Pages, but with an
important difference. Whereas you might look up the number of the
Massachusetts State House just once and then write down
617-727-2121 and use that number forever, your computer looks up
the IP address of ``www.state.ma.us'' practically every time you
turn on your computer and jumps to the state's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   One of the big reasons the Internet has been so successful is
backwards compatibility. With very rare exceptions, a computer that
was on the Internet in 1983 could still function perfectly well
today, nearly 16 years later.
</P>
<P>
   The same can't be said of the telephone system. With the
splitting of area codes and changes in dialing rules, telephone
switches and paging systems require constant reprogramming.
</P>
<P>
   One way around the need to frequently reprogram systems would be
for Bell Atlantic to adopt 11-digit dialing on an optional basis.
Bell Atlantic could do this today, without the need for regulatory
approval.
</P>
<P>
   What ``11-digit'' dialing means is that any person inside
Massachusetts could dial the number 1, the area code they are
calling, and a phone number and have the call connected.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, 11-digit dialing means that the telephone system
would adopt the Internet's attitude towards addresses. Every phone
number would work equally well anywhere in the system, without the
need for special dialing rules. This dialing plan would simplify
the programming of automatic dialers, and it would make life
considerably easier for people who travel between area codes.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to handle the problem is to put a moratorium on
area-code splitting and phone-number changing. Now that we have
seen firsthand the disruption of changing several million phone
numbers, we should do everything possible to avoid having to do
that again. This means adopting an overlay plan is the way to do
that, something we should have done the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic agrees. ``We continue to favor an overlay. We
think that it is the least disruptive to customers,'' says John
Johnson, a spokesman for Bell Atlantic. ``As you continue splitting
and make the area codes smaller and smaller, they lose any
geographical identity. But the worst part is the requirement that
half the people give up their telephone numbers each time there is
a split. That is the thing that causes the most confusion and the
most cost for people.''

BLUNDERS AND BRILLIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Journalism is the first rough draft of history,'' the saying
goes. But we technology journalists write up the first rough draft
of prophecy. We wander in a wilderness of books, trade magazines,
and Web pages, listening for voices to guide us and our readers
down the True Path toward the Next Big Thing.
</P>
<P>
   I've already owned up to my most idiotic prediction of the year,
the inevitable failure of the Apple iMac. Some failure; I'm using
one of them right now.
</P>
<P>
   It's harder to grade my other judgments of the waning year,
since I don't usually make ex cathedra pronouncements of the sort
that got me in trouble with the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, I hit the bull's-eye. Back in February, I began
singing the praises of the free Linux operating system as an
alternative to Microsoft Windows. I even suggested that embattled
browser-maker Netscape Communications Corp. do a deal with a Linux
distributor to hit Microsoft where it hurts.
</P>
<P>
   From my keyboard to Jim Barksdale's brain. The Netscape CEO made
just such a deal in September with Red Hat Software Inc., the top
Linux distributor. The giant chipmaker Intel also signed on. And
now there are reports that IBM Corp. is talking to Red Hat about
providing worldwide customer support for Linux users. From geek
curiosity to major industry in less than a year; yes, I'd say I got
Linux right.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the columns that hit the target but miss the
center ring. I wrote that 1998 was to be the year of ADSL, a
dazzling technology that can download Internet data at millions of
bits per second over home telephone lines. Yet only a tiny handful
of consumers have ADSL service at home.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't exactly wrong; my calendar was just running a few
months fast. Indeed, for computer firms and phone companies, 1998
was indeed the year of ADSL. At last, there's an industrywide
technical standard, so that everybody's ADSL gear will work with
everybody else's. Major computer makers, such as Compaq, now build
ADSL chips into some of their machines, and telephone companies are
just beginning to offer the service in cities like Washington, D.C.
Boston's due to go on line with ADSL in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many in the industry doubt that consumers want high-speed
access. An October study from the Gartner Group predicted that by
the year 2003, nearly two-thirds of US consumers with Internet
access will still be using those slow telephone modems.
</P>
<P>
   I also ran way ahead of the curve in a March column in which I
sang the praises of network computers. Remember NCs? These cheap,
diskless devices, remotely controlled by powerful server computers,
were supposed to replace PCs in many corporate offices. Nearly
every tech expert in the land predicted they'd sell by the
millions. It just hasn't happened; dramatic PC price drops
eliminated a major advantage of NCs. Now most of the pundits have
turned on the NC makers with fangs bared.
</P>
<P>
   Not me. I still say they'll catch on. I can see hints that it's
happening. IBM just sold several thousand of them to a couple of
major companies. Here at the Globe, we're testing an NC from Wyse
Technology Inc. that could replace hundreds of old terminals
scattered throughout the building.
</P>
<P>
   NCs still have big advantages. Firms can save a fortune by
managing thousands of computer terminals from a central control
point. And millions of workers who merely need access to a few
basic computer functions shouldn't have to master a device as
complex and fragile as a traditional PC. The NC is an idea that's
too reasonable to die.
</P>
<P>
   So I've got a spectacularly bad prediction on the iMac, and a
Linux call that was so on-target it's spooky. Yes, my timing was
off on ADSL and network computers, but I bet those columns will
read like works of genius by next December. Of course, by then,
I'll have another year's worth of blunders to answer for.

EDITORIAL: THE LIMITS OF TECHNOLOGY  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (dal) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Jan. 3:
</P>
<P>
   Amusing as it is simply to sit back and watch the calendar of
the Western world flip over, it is reasonable to expect that 1999 _
prologue to a new millennium _ will yield some themes that ask for
real reflection. Here is one. In the blizzard of commentary already
blowing in, it is becoming apparent that we are nearly blinded by
technology. Trying to gauge the meaning of a new millennium, we
almost instinctively do so by marveling at the rate of
technological change, which we cannot help believing will only
increase. It seems like the most salient feature of human culture
during the last 200 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the rate at which technology has been changing probably
masks the underlying stability of human nature. The rate of change
in our world is simply dizzying, and it is only natural to wonder
whether humans who live in 1999 are different somehow, given the
explosion of technological innovation in their lifetime, than
humans who lived 1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Material conditions in the richest societies are certainly
different now than they were in the richest societies in the year
1000, and they are more different from 1000 than 1000 was from the
year 1. The way we explain human nature is radically different too,
thanks mostly to Darwin. Yet there is no evidence that human nature
has altered in that time or, indeed, since human history began.
Life has always been as complex as it could possibly be. Humans
have always admired their own adaptability and lamented the
peculiar complications of the times they live in. There is no
burying the past because the past _ to the extent that it was
determined by the raw potential of human nature _ is reborn in
every generation.
</P>
<P>
   We are caught, in a sense, between two kinds of evolution.
Biological evolution works on a nearly geological time scale, which
suggests that human nature, as a partial product of our genes, is
basically constant. Cultural evolution works with shocking
swiftness, and so we assume that it is mainly a propulsive,
liberating, even revolutionary force. But human culture has always
usefully constrained human behavior as well as expressed it. No
human society has ever tolerated the entire range of instinctive,
``natural'' human behavior. That selective intolerance is among the
things we mean by civilization.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the fundamental tensions we will carry into the
new millennium. For most of history humans have shaped
civilizations commensurate with the level of their material
technology. In some cases, like ancient Athens, the former far
outstripped the latter. Startling new technologies will inevitably
proliferate in the years to come. We need to remember that the
measure of a civilization is not the tools it owns but the use it
makes of them.

TECHNOLOGY: NOTES FROM CYBERCLASS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  Bruce Weber is national cultural correspondent for The New York
Times. 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adult education, the concept, has never much appealed to me.
Volunteer for more school? No thanks. I was quite pleased, more
than 20 years ago, when it was done with the first time. Every now
and then I still have that dream about being unprepared for a final
exam. (For some reason, the exam is always in French.) There's
something about entering a classroom that feels like a withdrawal
from the actual business of the world, participation in which I'd
earned by virtue of enduring two degrees' worth of pedagogy. I'm
not one of those people who get nostalgic about college: I like to
get paid for my work, not graded on it.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, augmenting one's education isn't anything you can
really be against, and I decided to go back to class, via the
Internet, spurred by an interest in exploring cyberspace and an
instinct that self-improvement wouldn't feel so burdensome if it
were a little more convenient.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, by many measures, going to school online is convenient.
You can go undressed. You can go in the middle of the night. You
can go in Kansas City. You can participate in discussions to
whatever extent you choose, sounding off overbearingly or keeping
smugly silent, without having to observe the ordinary etiquette of
classroom decorum. You can, in other words, construct your own
private experience.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, this ends up having its burdensome side. For
convenience, you pay with responsibility and accountability. Online
school is a venue for self-starters, which may be one reason that,
though 10 people enrolled in the class I took, only half were ever
heard from after the first few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The first problem any prospective student faces is simply
deciding what school to attend. The global reach of Internet
technology obviates geography and transportation as considerations
in making such a choice. From my home in Chicago I could get to
class at the University of California as easily as at the New
School for Social Research in New York, or to any of the hundreds
of places that now offer Internet classes. Any thorough perusal of
online catalogues is so time-consuming as to be daunting. I gave up
rather quickly, choosing the New School (www.dialnsa.edu) after
checking out only one or two others because it offered the class I
wanted _ a playwriting workshop _ and because it was familiar.
Until a year or so ago, I lived in New York, not far from the
campus. Call me homesick.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine other people who enrolled in the same class, all but
one were New Yorkers. The exception was Angela Davis, a federal
prosecutor in Los Angeles. Ms. Davis, whose contributions to the
class documents were as voluminous and thorough as legal briefs,
told me that she chose the New School because she was impressed by
the resume of the instructor, Robert Montgomery (particularly that
he had attended Yale Drama School and had had a play of his own
produced at the Joseph Papp Public Theater), and because she wanted
a drama class taught in New York, which is, after all, the center
of drama. ``I was delighted that I had the opportunity to take this
`New York' class from my home in Los Angeles,'' she wrote to me in
an e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   The second problem is one of access. In one way, real school is
a passive experience. You show up in class, the curriculum gets
flung at you and maybe, if you're not asleep, it sticks.
Cyberschool is a bit more active; you find your classroom and
negotiate around it. There's a facility to be learned _ the deft
burrowing of a computer mouse, not necessarily a natural thing for
a middle-aged man who is habitually behind the techno-curve. It
took me about an hour to get comfortable with the mechanics of
going to school. (OK, not as onerous as settling into a dorm room.)
</P>
<P>
   How it works at the New School is this: after online
registration _ and payment via credit card (the nine-week class
costs $450 for a non-credit student) _ I was sent a set of
passwords that granted me access to the online campus, which is
essentially a set of Web sites. A handful of them are accessible to
all students, no matter what classes they are taking. One is an
orientation site, where tips for efficient campus travel are
dispensed. One is a student lounge, where students can mingle,
posting messages either for general consumption or for individual
correspondents. (The tone of the conversation was distinctly eager
and friendly _ ``Hi everybody! This is my first online class and
I'm really psyched!'' _ much like what I remember freshman
orientation to have been so many eons ago. Some things transfer to
cyberlife undisturbed.) For some reason, there is also a room set
aside specifically to discuss movies.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is a separate site for each class for which a
student has registered, and inside that site is another set of
sites set up by the professor. In the playwriting class, Montgomery
had his own ``podium,'' as it were, from which he gave
``lectures,'' providing, about once a week, disquisitions on
elements of playwriting _ things like story, character, dialogue _
mostly tips for us students to keep in mind as we composed our own
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Each of us had our own site as well, in which we were to post
our work for the consumption of our classmates and in which
Montgomery and our classmates could post commentary. Since we all
had access to all sites, we were able to keep tabs on our mutual
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Once I got the hang of it, I found it remarkably efficient and
ingenious. There were some obvious drawbacks. Any classroom
certainly is meant to take advantage of social intercourse and the
dynamic that develops when people are in actual contact with one
another. Online this is lost, by definition, but in a playwriting
seminar what is also lost is the opportunity for the writers to
hear their work read out loud, which it is, of course, meant to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presence thing, that's what's missing,'' Montgomery, who
also teaches playwriting in ``real space'' at the New School, told
me in a phone interview after the course was over, when I announced
my intention to write about the class. ``As a playwright you have
to know how to include it, the presence of an actor, in your
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the semblance of a writing seminar became quite
persuasive; the discourse involved healthy doses of both insightful
criticism and self-serving blather, just what aspiring writers
sound like when they gather in person. And because people are
forced to write out their reactions, the communication was
relatively lean. In writing, the speaking-to-hear-yourself-speak
impulse is curtailed. There's no blurting. People take care to say
what they mean, not just what has crossed their minds, so even when
someone had something silly to say, it was clearly expressed. (For
that alone, gratitude is in order.) Writing focuses thought; I've
rarely found that illustrated so acutely as I did during this
class.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a funny way, even without the familiar interaction in a
classroom, the human dynamic asserted itself. Personalities became
evident. People were supportive mostly, testy occasionally.
Alliances were formed. And a general allegiance to Montgomery was
forged, even though none of us ever laid eyes on him. (In four
years of teaching online, he told me over the phone, ``this is the
longest conversation with a student I've ever had.'')
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery, 52, who has taught playwriting for 20 years, is the
author of several produced plays, including ``Subject to Fits,'' a
musical takeoff on Dostoyevsky's ``Idiot,'' which featured Ben
Kingsley when it was produced in London in 1972. He proved to be a
careful, diligent reader and critic, offering firm but gently
worded suggestions that were both conceptual and quite specific
(for instance, line cuts and phrasing changes). I have a terrible
time beginning things, but something Montgomery wrote early on _
that each scene is like a play in microcosm, with the characters
wrestling with conflict and moving to resolve it _ helped me decide
that my play should start with the two main characters already
angry at each other. Otherwise, I'd have had them dithering around,
trying to make each other mad, but only frustrating the audience as
they frustrated themselves.
</P>
<P>
   My classmates _ a diverse bunch and distinctly adult, with
several, like me, in their 40s _ included an
actress-turned-hospital administrator, two massage therapists, a
nurse and an executive with a finance company. They were all, at
least the ones who stuck around, serious about writing for the
stage. I had wanted to take playwriting because it is a skill I
admire, and because I write about the theater as a journalist. It
couldn't hurt to get a little closer to my subject. But it was
daunting to hear about the projects the others were working on,
most of which were more ambitious than my own, an ostensible comedy
about two old friends in a battle over a cheap Manhattan apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davis had already made considerable progress on a historical
drama set in 16th-century England. Another was adapting Dickens's
``Christmas Carol'' with gay characters in a contemporary Manhattan
setting. A third was writing about a man who, unhappy in love, was
getting nighttime visitations and advice from the ghosts of
historical figures like Lord Byron, who spoke to him in rhymed
couplets. The hospital administrator was working on a play about
Anna Mae Aquash, an American Indian activist whose 1976 murder in
South Dakota has never been solved.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, some of the writers were more polished than others,
but overall the reading was absorbing.
</P>
<P>
   That was a blessing, as there was a lot of it. Those taking the
course for credit were required to produce 15 finished pages, and
even with half the class falling by the wayside, several people
proved to be prolific revisers. (I'm a prolific procrastinator
myself, and by the end, I'd only offered an opening scene of four
pages. The verdict was that they were promising. Yeah, yeah.)
</P>
<P>
   But more than the actual scripts, what also had to be read was
the ongoing discussion, and herein lies the main difference between
real school and online school. The latter may be more user-friendly
than the former, but inattention costs more. Though there are no
occasions to show up for, that doesn't mean there are no classes;
rather, what it means is that the course is one continuous,
semesterlong session. In real school, if you cut a class, it is
gone, over, unreclaimable. Online, however, you never miss
anything. Whatever commentary is offered by the teacher or by
classmates is recorded, and whenever you sign on and check in, it
is all there, a linear record of what has gone on in your absence.
Which means that if you don't check in for a week, a week's worth
of discussion is there to be perused. Once, when I didn't sign on
for 10 days, there were nearly 200 entries waiting for me when I
returned, well over 100 pages of reading before I could begin
crafting any of my own responses to my classmates' work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting thing is that people think an online course is
going to be easier than a classroom course, but I've spent a lot
more time with this one than with the others I've taken at the New
School,'' said Joseph Carman, 42, one of the massage therapists,
who is finishing a degree at the New School, both online and in
class, that he left incomplete at Fordham University more than a
decade ago. ``It takes an awful lot of time, logging on, and then
deciding where to go first, and reading other people's work and
making a thoughtful response.''
</P>
<P>
   Carman, who said he signed into class about four times a week,
finished two long scenes during the semester and said he was going
to re-enroll so he could finish a draft of his play. His was the
one with the Byronic couplets. ``It would be interesting to get
everybody in a room without identifying ourselves,'' he said, ``to
see if we could pick out who's who.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking about re-enrolling myself. I'd only managed to sign
on for class about once a week, and I'd only managed to produce
those four pages. My classmates reacted to me accordingly. In the
end, my Web site had less activity than any of the others. The
salient point, I realized, is that whatever I got out of the class,
I earned. Which may be the ultimate definition of adult education.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
In enough free time, a Web page can be built for free 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once upon a time, you were part of the high-tech elite
if you had an e-mail address and knew Yahoo! was more than an
especially disgusting soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, of course, you need a home on the Web. Having one is
pretty easy; some Internet accounts come with the provision for
free Web space. Even if that isn't the case with your account,
there are other sites that offer free Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``free'' is the operative word for today. I'll tell you
how to find your own free home in cyberspace, then we'll talk about
some free tools and techniques that can make your Web site into a
good home.
</P>
<P>
   For today, I'm going to assume you don't have a home page on the
Web and walk you through the steps for creating one in semi-logical
order. Pay attention, because it's going to be a brisk walk.
</P>
<P>
   _ Free Web space: There are literally dozens of sites offering
Web space for free (in return, the service usually puts an ad of
some type on your page). To get a complete list, use your favorite
search engine and the terms ``free'' and ``Web.'' Or you can take
my advice and try one of these two sites:
</P>
<P>
   GeoCities at http://www.geocities.com or Angel Fire at
</P>
<P>
   http://www.angelfire.com/.
</P>
<P>
   _ Free software: Now that you have a place to stash it, you'll
need to create a home page. Don't let your favorite Web-head scare
you away with talk about HTML (the language used to create Web
pages) and Java (one of the programs used to add special features
to a page). We're going to do things the easy way with a program
(it won't cost you a dime) called AOLpress. Don't let the name fool
you, AOLpress will create a page that you can use on any service,
not just AOL. You can download it at http://www.aolpress.com/. It's
easy to use and amazingly sophisticated _ creating links to your
favorite sites, placing images and automating many tasks, including
adding color or unique typefaces. There are plenty of other free
page-creation programs out there, but this one is my personal
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   _ Free images: Don't tell your mom, but we'll do some stealing
as we go along. Many pages use public domain images and artwork,
and you're welcome to grab them right off the page. Just
right-click on the image you like, then select ``Save Image As...''
and you will be able to use the image on your own page. Also use
your search engine to find the hundreds of sites offering free clip
art. I'll list just one (but this one site has half a million free
images): Cool Graphics on the Web at
http://www.fishnet.net/(tilde)gini/cool. Once you've found the
images you like, use AOLpress to include the images on your page.
</P>
<P>
   _ (Almost) free photos: You'll probably want to use some
photographs on your page. But unless you have a scanner at home (I
recommend it, and good ones sell for less than $100 now), you'll
need another source for the electronic images. Shop around for a
photo finisher that offers free or nearly free electronic images.
Some photo labs include electronic images along with the prints at
very little additional charge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Other free stuff: We're nearly out of space, so we'll have to
move fast now. But check out these Web sites for other nifty free
stuff such as guest books and software that will keep track of the
folks who visit your page.
</P>
<P>
   Guestbooks:
http://titan.guestworld.tripod.lycos.com/registration.cfm;
Autoresponders (send out e-mail automatically):
</P>
<P>
   http://www.pagetools.com; and for a visitor-tracking program
try:
</P>
<P>
   http://www.superstats.com.
</P>
<P>
   There's one free item I can't furnish. That's the free time
you'll need to get all this done. But if you have the time, I have
the free stuff.

NEW TECHNOLOGY REVIVES OLD DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The technologies may be new, but the debate that promises to
dominate the patent industry this year dates from at least the days
of Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell.
</P>
<P>
   The debate now centers around whether methods of doing business
over the Internet, known as electronic commerce, should be
patentable.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hundred years ago, the Supreme Court struggled with the same
issues that we struggle with today _ how to make our laws
responsive to new technologies,'' said Rick Nydegger, a patent
attorney who represents Microsoft Corp. and other companies and
teaches intellectual property law at Brigham Young University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question that is being raised with e-commerce was raised
with the telegraph and telephone,'' Nydegger said. ``At the time,
no one had envisioned using electricity as a way to communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court is expected to decide in the coming weeks
whether to review a July ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit that, according to some patent experts,
represents a potential windfall for those who were among the first
to file electronic commerce patent applications. Although no
statistics are available, many experts speculate that the case,
State Street Bank vs. Signature Financial, has set off a stampede
of new electronic commerce applications to the Patent Office.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling affirmed and broadened earlier court decisions as
well as Patent Office guidelines on software patents, including
electronic commerce patents.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the mid-1980s, when I used to lecture on software patents,
I would get laughed out of the room,'' said Robert Greene Sterne, a
patent attorney in Washington. ``I'd get booed. I'd be called a
capitalist pig by software entrepreneurs who thought it should be
owned by the masses.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sterne notes, filings from companies like Microsoft, which
initially rejected the idea of software patents, are tumbling in.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Aharonian, a patent-search consultant, has long been
critical of the quality of the nation's software patents, and he is
no more sanguine about electronic commerce patents. ``The
e-commerce patents are about as valid as software patents in
general, which aren't very valid to begin with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aharonian contends that the Patent Office does not have the
proper resources to research what is known as ``prior art'' _
previous inventions that are similar to a new technology. For
example, he says, a score of software patents have been issued
recently covering solutions to the Year 2000 problem, but none of
them mention a paper on the subject produced by IBM in 1986. Such
oversights make a patent more vulnerable to legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely relevant,'' he said. ``But none of the issued
Y2K patents have cited it. That's just gross failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. Todd Dickinson, acting commissioner of the Patent and
Trademark Office, says his agency is doing an admirable job and
adds that 20 new patent examiners have been hired recently for the
division responsible for reviewing most electronic commerce
patents.
</P>
<P>
   How successful have patent-wielding companies been in licensing
their electronic commerce technologies so far? It's hard to say:
Patent licenses are not publicly recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Sterne, who represents several dozen software companies, says
patents are important for small enterprises mostly because they
help attract investment capital and provide momentum for initial
stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patents are having a major impact on financing,'' he said.
``The investment banking community, the venture capital community
and the angel investing community are becoming very interested in
intellectual property.''
</P>
<P>
   But Aharonian remains skeptical about the value of electronic
commerce patents. ``Until they end up in court, nobody's going to
know whether they're valid,'' he said.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Finally, a site for ig-pay atin-Lay 
By Mark Clothier  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bell bottoms, disco and Donnie and Marie have made
comebacks. So did John Travolta and Richard Nixon. About the only
things from the 1970s that haven't returned are TV variety shows
and pig Latin.
</P>
<P>
   With any luck, variety shows will stay gone. The world doesn't
need another weekly hour of Tony Orlando and Dawn. But the Web
could do a lot for pig Latin.
</P>
<P>
   A slew of sites offer text translators. You type in a line of
text or, in some cases, a Web address, and the application turns it
into pig Latin.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, check http:/www.rinkworks.com/dialect/ or
</P>
<P>
   http://voyager.cns.ohiou.edu/(tilde)jrantane/menu/pig.html. One
site turns the word of God into pig Latin, from Enesis-gay to the
Book of Ob-Jay,
</P>
<P>
   http://www.well.com/user/earl/Ible-bay.html.
</P>
<P>
   The rules behind the language are simple enough: You take the
first consonant of most words, put an -ay behind it and stick it at
the end of the word.
</P>
<P>
   Simple, but time consuming for chunks of text. It would take
minutes to translate the opening words of Lou Gehrig's famous
farewell speech. A Web translator can do it in seconds. ``Odaytay,
Iyay onsidercay yselfmay ethay uckiestlay anmay onyay ethay acefay
ofyay ethay earthyay.''
</P>
<P>
   There are Web translators that change text from one language to
another, like Spanish to English, but those probably have some
practical application. What good is the Web if it also can't be
used for things with no definable purpose?
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance savings available on Internet
</P>
<P>
   The Internet can cost you money: Usually, you have to buy a
computer with a modem and access fees to reach it. But once there,
some things you find actually save you money.
</P>
<P>
   A few new studies by the Telecommunications Research &AMP; Action
Center show how.
</P>
<P>
   TRAC found that in some cases long-distance customers can cut
their monthly bill in half by signing up for service over the
Internet. Internet long-distance service requires you pay your bill
with a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   TRAC publishes a study called Tele-Tips at its Web site,
</P>
<P>
   http://www.trac.org. This month's study compares rates for
dial-around phone codes. The study found dial-around access offers
some competitive rates, but some have hidden fees that can hit
hard. The report warns that, shockingly, the advertising for the
dial-around codes can be misleading.
</P>
<P>
   TRAC is a nonprofit, tax-exempt consumer group that works to
inform long-distance customers
</P>
<P>
   Test your knowledge of 'Sesame Street'
</P>
<P>
   If television is indeed wet nurse to a generation of children,
``Sesame Street'' is the good milk. The children's television
stalwart turns 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
   To commemorate the anniversary, the ``Sesame Street'' Web site,
</P>
<P>
   http://www.ctw.org/sesame/trivia/0,1736,,00.html, has put
together a trivia game.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know which ``Sesame Street'' characters were inspired by
the movie ``It's a Wonderful Life'' and the year ``Sesame Street''
made its debut? Do you know how big Big Bird really is?
</P>
<P>
   If you knew Bert and Ernie owe their existence to Frank Capra,
the morning show debuted on public television in 1969 and that Big
Bird stands 8 feet, 2 inches tall, there might be no need to play.
</P>
<P>
   The game tallies answers for everyone who plays. If you thought
Fozzy Bear, instead of Bert and Ernie, owed his creation to ``It's
a Wonderful Life,'' you could see how many others were similarly
misinformed.
</P>
<P>
   Take a sneak peek at some famous recipes
</P>
<P>
   If the year between Girl Scout cookie deliveries seems like 10
years, a Web site of copycat recipes might lessen the distance.
</P>
<P>
   http://www.copykat.com is devoted to recipes for well-known
food, like Girl Scout Thin Mint cookies; macaroni and cheese from
Boston Market; and fried chicken from KFC.
</P>
<P>
   There are also recipes for lesser-known delicacies, such as the
Pea Salad from Knott's Berry Farm and the Oyster Bar Trash from
Willie G's.
</P>
<P>
   Most online job help is for nontechies
</P>
<P>
   CareerMosaic, an online job site, released a study showing most
jobs listed on online sites are nontechnical.
</P>
<P>
   The CareerMosaic Index found three of the top 10 most popular
online job searches were related to technical jobs, engineering,
computers and computer programming.
</P>
<P>
   The index found the most popular keywords used in searches were
``manager/management,'' ``engineer,'' and ``sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Online job hunting reflects seasonal trends as well. Teaching
positions ranked 22nd in July, but fell to 28th in August and 30th
in September.
</P>
<P>
   Other job categories among the top 25 were, ``finance,'' ``human
resources,'' ``nurse'' and ``package handler.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted by CareerMosaic between July and
September. More than 14 million keyword searches were tallied.

ONLY 361 DAYS TO SOLVE THE Y2K PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By BARNABY J. FEDER  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Information technology companies are spending heavily to avoid
the chaos that could be caused around the world by computers,
software programs and electronically controlled machinery being
confused by the transition to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the spending on Y2K, as the industry calls it, will go
toward heading off the problems that could come after Jan. 1, 2000.
Some companies and government agencies may also be forced to lay
out millions of dollars toward recovering from malfunctions this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Those unplanned outlays will pop up, Year 2000 consultants
predict, because many forward-looking scheduling, purchase order
and budget programs will trip up this month, or around April 1,
July 1 and Sept. 1, dates when most companies and governments open
the books on the fiscal year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for global trouble stems from the once-common
practice of using just two digits to refer to the year in dates,
like 99 for 1999. Many computers read 00 as 1900 instead of 2000.
Others cannot process 00 in the date field at all and reset their
clocks to 1980, the dawn of the personal computer age, or some
other date. Some simply freeze.
</P>
<P>
   The year may also be marred by the rollover to 0 this summer of
the calendars used in satellites that pinpoint the location of
mobile equipment, called global positioning satellites. The
satellite network's longest time unit is a week, not a year, and
the highest number it recognizes as a valid week will be reached in
August. The transition to week 0 could disrupt industries and
military systems that use the satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 9, 1999, is another possible land mine because many
computer programs treat a data entry of 9999 as a shorthand for end
of file or date unknown. Thus, office clerks, sales representatives
and other workers innocently entering orders and other information
for Sept. 9 may end up deleting huge amounts of data or causing
programs to crash.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom-line question for anyone in the information
technology business is how much of the spending on Year 2000 and
other date problems will come at the expense of other information
technology projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not expecting the bottom to fall out, but it will be a
definite speed bump for many I.T. products,'' said Louis E.
Marcoccio, global director for Year 2000 research at the Gartner
Group, an information technology consulting firm in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of information technology spending tend to vary widely
because of differences in sampling techniques and in what is
included.
</P>
<P>
   The International Data Corp., a market research firm based in
Framingham, Mass., projects that centralized corporate spending on
information technology will decline to just under 2 percent of
revenue but that strong growth in other areas, including home
offices, will lift total worldwide spending nearly 9.4 percent, to
$720.4 billion from $658.6 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Computer Economics Inc., a smaller research firm based in
Carlsbad, Calif., which does not count home offices in its
estimates, expects just 3 percent growth, but puts the projected
total this year at $987 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner's Dataquest subsidiary estimates that information
technology spending by governments and businesses will climb more
than 14 percent from 1998, to about $1.27 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   There is general agreement, though, that the portion of the
corporate information technology budget going to solve Year 2000
problems rose rapidly last year and will peak somewhere between 20
percent and 40 percent of information technology spending this
year.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by Gartner of 65,000 companies around the world
suggests that many of them will meet Year 2000 needs by postponing
purchases of new e-mail packages, software that generates data
supporting sales programs and similar decision-support
applications, investments in new telephone service centers and
logistics applications.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner expects large servers to continue to sell well
throughout 1999, along with information storage devices, which
could benefit from a rush to back up data. Companies in the midst
of deploying large enterprise software packages to link and
automate many activities may accelerate some investments to beat
the year 2000 deadline. But the slowdown in the growth of new
orders for such software, which began last year, should continue
for at least several quarters, Gartner said.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner also expects orders for mainframe computers and desktops
to weaken, then rebound next year.
</P>
<P>
   Others foresee an even tougher spending climate. ``About the
only thing we are not seeing postponed for next year is
E-commerce,'' said Kazim S. Isfahani, an analyst at Giga
Information Group in Cambridge, Mass., referring to applications
that allow companies to do business with suppliers and customers
over the Internet. Rapid investment in such software is widely seen
as strategically essential, Isfahani said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most optimistic view for vendors popped up in a
Gallup poll for Computer Reseller News, a trade publication, which
concluded that nearly four out of five large companies planned to
increase information technology spending to deal with the Year 2000
problem rather than cut back on new investments.
</P>
<P>
   That was probably wishful thinking. Information technology
spending accounts for just 2.3 percent of corporate revenue on
average, and many companies are budgeting for an increase in that
figure. But that does not mean they want to authorize a spending
spree just when recession in Asia and other uncertainties threaten
growth and profitability. And it would take a huge jump in
information technology budgets to keep all new projects on track,
given the projections by Gartner and others of the huge share that
will go to fix Year 2000 problems.
</P>
<P>
   Cost pressures aside, companies are also reining in new
information technology investment because they do not have enough
skilled managers and technical workers to handle new projects on
top of the Year 2000 challenge and the usual load of maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Others are worried that new projects could introduce bugs that
compromise the reliability of the Year 2000 work they have
completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick for vendors will be to single out customers who are
ahead of the curve and point out which investments they can safely
go ahead with,'' Isfahani said.
</P>
<P>
   That could include the early stages of a wide variety of
enterprise and E-commerce projects that would not be deployed until
the year 2000 or later, agreed Thomas D. Oleson, chief researcher
for the corporate advisory service at International Data.
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 distortions in spending patterns actually began to
show up in 1997 in the form of surging orders for enterprise
software _ packages that coordinate major business functions. Many
customers decided to attack their Year 2000 problem by replacing as
many older programs as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, though, it became too late to get enterprise software
up and running before the year 2000. Growth in new orders _ and
stock prices _ slumped for several vendors, including Peoplesoft
and J.D. Edwards &AMP; Company.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Dell Computer, Compaq Computer and other
makers of desktop computers enjoyed stronger-than-expected orders
last year from companies upgrading their computer networks as part
of Year 2000 preparations. That trend is expected to continue, at
least until the last few months of this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Year 2000 impact will be felt most directly, of course, by
companies that have made remediation software and services a major
part of their business. Many, like Viasoft Inc. of Phoenix and the
Alydaar Software Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., saw their stock
prices tumble last fall as investors concluded that the best growth
prospects of the companies were over.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue, though, will be how successfully these companies
respond to the strategic challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Some have reconfigured the software programs they developed to
look for Year 2000 bugs into packages that can be used to verify
that repairs have been successful, a market that is likely to boom
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, companies that prospered on outsourced Year 2000
repair work are leveraging those contacts into other technical
support deals. Outsourcing mundane tasks like the maintenance of
existing programs may help pace-setting companies with the majority
of their Year 2000 investment behind them to accelerate other
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see an opportunity to get a year or two ahead of
competitors they think will have trouble with Y2K,'' said Michael
Erbschloe, director of research at Computer Economics. ``After
diverting so much attention to Y2K, management is hungry for
applications that will add to revenue.''

   MILLENNIUM-CELEBRATION (San Francisco) _ Predicting that next

<P>
   LIVING-WILLS (Albany, N.Y.) _ Despite the national debate about
death and dying sparked by Dr. Jack Kevorkian, few New Yorkers have
a living will or a health proxy, two kinds of documents that
outline the medical care someone wants, or doesn't want, at the end
of their life. By SYLVIA WOOD.
</P>
<P>
   SNOW-REMOVAL (Albany, N.Y.) _ Think plowing snow isn't an art?
Think again. Before the first flake hits the pavement, thousands of
maintenance workers with the New York state Department of
Transportation meticulously spread salt and sand on 42,000 miles of
state roads. Once the snow hits, an army of 3,200 snowplow
operators crisscross the state, pushing, loading and dumping the
stuff out of harm's way. By THEOLA S. LABBE

<P>
   CAREERS-RETENTION (San Francisco) _ I would bet the 80/20 theory
_ 20 percent of people have 80 percent of the wealth, 20 percent of
your time accounts for 80 percent of your productivity, 20 percent
of the politicians wipe out 80 percent of the ozone layer _ applies

the best 20 percent of your workers than the remaining 80 percent.

   TEPPANYAKI-CHEF (Albany, N.Y.) _ The hibachi before chef Johnny
Chen is not merely a cooking surface; it is Chen's searing
playground. There, he builds Mount Fuji from a funnel of onion
rings that billow flame and smoke; he flips shrimp tails in the
air, teasing, ``this one's for you, this one's for me,'' as one
tail lands directly under the nose of the patron, while the other
flies into his shirt pocket. By MICHAEL LOPEZ

<P>
   FBN-49ERS (Santa Clara, Calif.) _ Because your stereotypical
modern American athlete has only as much memory as he needs to get
through that day's workout, there is at least a 50-50 chance that
the Atlanta Falcons will think they are in deep clover this

SOFTWARE: TOONSVILLE TUTORS

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   Josh Barbanel specializes in computer-assisted reporting for The
New York Times. 
 By JOSH BARBANEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It used to be that I could walk past the study, see the children
huddled in front of the computer screen fighting over who would
hold the mouse and sigh with relief: At least they weren't watching
television.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, they might as well be. There is Arthur, from the
PBS program, looking guiltily at his mom, in a software version. Or
Steve, a grown man who wanders through a cartoon adventure with a
blue dog in ``Blue's Clues,'' on Nickelodeon. And there are many
other software programs like these.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the titles competing for shelf space in computer stores
seem to have sprung, fully grown, from the heads of the
merchandising staff members at television and film companies,
especially now that there is more competition in the software
market for very young children.
</P>
<P>
   Take some dazzling media characters, provide some animated
scenes, add some familiar, certifiably ``educational'' activities _
this seems to be the formula for success. The age of celebrity has
come to preschool.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there is a price. Originality is sacrificed, and
familiarity is glorified. The quality of animation on CD-ROM's has
improved so much that entertainment value is the main event. And so
I walk by the study, wondering whether playing on the computer will
soon offer no more rewards than television's offerings.
</P>
<P>
   TV'S ARTHUR, A BIT AT SEA
</P>
<P>
   ``Arthur's Computer Adventure,'' one of the many merchandising
tie-ins for Arthur, the aardvark with big ears and big glasses, is
a completely circular product. It is a CD-ROM based on a book,
popularized by a television series, about Arthur's struggles to
play a computer game, ``Deep Dark Sea,'' on his mom's computer. A
version of that game (and not a very impressive one at that) is
included.
</P>
<P>
   The book, by Marc Brown, is called ``Arthur's Computer
Disaster.'' Perhaps the marketing department thought ``computer
disaster'' would turn off novice computer users. ``Arthur's
Computer Adventure'' is in the form of a ``living book,'' with text
at the top of the screen and words highlighted as they are read by
a narrator and the character. (Wouldn't it be cozier to have mom
read it at bedtime rather than a narrator at a computer?)
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the text, Arthur and his family act out the story.
Arthur, driven by his search for sunken treasure, disobeys his mom
and seems to have broken her computer. Children can click on
various animated objects _ a helicopter that can be flown about the
page, ghosts that fly out of cabinets. Also among the five
activities are the somewhat basic ``Deep Dark Sea,'' in which
children maneuver a diver past sharks and sea creatures to find
treasure. In ``Frankenfish,'' young adventurers can click on fish
and learn a simple fact about each one, then mix and match parts of
the fish to make their own strange creatures.
</P>
<P>
   There is a word-recognition game and a counting game, both
simple, but parents will not find enough weighty educational
treasures to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arthur's Computer Adventure,'' $29.95, The Learning Company;
www.learningco.com. Windows 3.10, Windows 95 or Macintosh. Ages
3-7.
</P>
<P>
   BLUE ON HOW TO HAVE A PARTY
</P>
<P>
   The television program ``Blue's Clues'' might have been modeled
after an interactive CD-ROM. Steve, the human host, lives in an
animated-storybook environment. In each episode, Steve invites
young viewers to help him solve the day's puzzles, presented in
nonverbal clues through Blue, his puppy.
</P>
<P>
   This is the rough plot of all interactive CD-ROM's; ``Blue's
Birthday Adventure'' is no exception. In four separate episodes on
two CD-ROM's, Steve needs help planning Blue's birthday party. Blue
has left three blue paw prints around the house and yard. Children
click through the rooms, searching for the paw prints. Once found,
they can be put in notebooks, a handy place to ponder the paw
prints' meanings.
</P>
<P>
   What does Blue want to give her guests? What does Blue want to
eat at her party? What does Blue want to do at her party? What game
does Blue want to play? These are the questions that will try
children's minds.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, children make a birthday card, bake a cake and
pursue other inventive activities that integrate nicely into the
clue hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Videos of Steve against a cartoonlike background appear
throughout, just as they do on television. But there is one
significant difference. On television, each episode ends with a
solution. At home, children are in charge. Sometimes, it seems easy
to get lost: Children who miss a clue sit in silence as they try to
figure out where to go next. Steve, too, stands silent, rocking
slightly from side to side, and Blue wags her tail. Some children
may give up.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, neither Steve nor the game's creators offer enough
clues or energy to sufficiently interest young users in following
through and learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue's Birthday Adventure,'' $29.99, Humongous Entertainment;
www.humongous.com. Windows 95 or 98 or Macintosh Power PC. Ages
3-6.
</P>
<P>
   DR. SEUSS'S BUSY WORLD
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine the Cat in the Hat administering an IQ
test. But ``Dr. Seuss Kindergarten'' provides such an unusual blend
of whimsy and earnest skill-learning for studious 5-year-olds that
you can almost picture the cat pulling a Stanford Binet test out of
its hat.
</P>
<P>
   Like Arthur and Blue, the Dr. Seuss franchise is hot. ``Dr.
Seuss Kindergarten'' provides the familiar and fanciful characters,
bright music and songs and colorful Seussian scenery. A zoo is
being built in Seussville, and children must travel to far-off
locales on a colorful train in search of exotic animals to populate
it. At each stop, children are asked in rhyme to complete
skill-building exercises: There is matching, letter recognition,
addition and subtraction (Barbaloot math), phonics, measurement,
estimation, sorting _ all the essential skills children must master
to be promoted to first grade.
</P>
<P>
   The Seuss characters add charm and fun, but the drill-sergeant
nature of the material shows through. In one exercise designed to
teach basic addition, the Barbaloots and the Lorax are picking
Truffula fruits. Children are asked to drag the correct amount of
fruit into two wheelbarrows. The fruit is then combined in a third
wheelbarrow.
</P>
<P>
   But pity the poor child who doesn't know his numbers. ``Put the
Truffula fruit in the barrow,'' the narrator says repeatedly as
each mistake is made. ``Put the Truffula fruit in the barrow. Put
the Truffula fruit in the barrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Each exercise has three levels of difficulty, and parents can
monitor their offsprings' progress. Children may find this mix of
fancy and challenge appealing for a while. But I wonder if this is
software they will return to again and again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Seuss Kindergarten,'' $19.95, The Learning Company;
www.learningco.com. Windows 3.1, Windows 95 or Macintosh. Ages 4-6.
</P>
<P>
   FUTURE GIRL DRAMATISTS
</P>
<P>
   First came the dolls, then the books. Now comes the software.
The American Girls is a set of popular, if expensive, dolls that
portray girls from different periods of American history.
</P>
<P>
   But while the dolls just sit there, ``The American Girls
Premiere 2d Edition'' allows young devotees to do something with
them. It is essentially an animation program in which children add
recorded or synthesized voices, lighting, period scenery, props and
costumes. They can move characters _ ranging from Felicity, in
Colonial America, to Molly, from the World War II era _ around a
stage. Then they can play back the whole thing, or print out the
script.
</P>
<P>
   It is very high-concept, marrying a technology to a historical
concept with some success. But the animation process is complex. As
in the cartoons, a child has to create the action and overlay the
sound, then match up both elements as closely as possible. Be
prepared for some frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Girls Premiere 2d Edition,'' $34.95, The Learning
Company; www.learningco.com. Windows 3.1 or 95 or Macintosh;
microphone recommended. Ages 8-12.

MUSIC FUTURE HERE IN THE FORM OF MP3 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID HOYE   
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - I have listened to the future, and its name is MP3.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat after me: MP3. MP3. MP3.
</P>
<P>
   Got it? Don't forget it. This is going to be huge _ unless big
business kills it.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 stands for MPEG 1 Layer 3. It's technical mumbo-jumbo for a
new audio compression format that can squeeze music files down to
between one-fourth and one-twentieth their normal size _ with
little loss of quality.
</P>
<P>
   A three-minute song, for example, can be compressed into an MP3
file of less than 3 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the programs needed to make and play MP3 files,
not to mention hundreds of thousands of MP3 files themselves, are
available to anyone _ free.
</P>
<P>
   What's all this mean? Computer users the world over can now jump
on the Internet, download as many MP3 files _ songs _ as they want
and play them to their heart's content on their home or office
computer. The quality is phenomenal.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't stop with your PC or Macintosh. MP3 files can be
transferred via a parallel cable to a device like the Diamond Rio,
a palm-sized player much like a Sony Walkman, that can hold up to
an hour's worth of MP3 music in its 32-megabyte memory.
</P>
<P>
   Just plug in a set of headphones and you're off. Unlike other
portable music devices, the Rio contains no mechanical or moving
parts. So no amount of jostling can make the music skip.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio, which sells for about $200, is available for purchase
online and is expected to be in retail outlets in Phoenix and other
major U.S. cities by the time you read this.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Internet is awash in music. People are trading
songs like never before.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 isn't like previous Internet-related advancements in
technology, such as streaming audio. Remember the first time you
checked that out? Yeah, it was kinda neat, but it still sounded
like a short-wave radio dispatch from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 is different. Believe me when I say: It's really cool!
</P>
<P>
   Now, before we go on, we have to address an all-important
question: Is all this MP3 stuff legal?
</P>
<P>
   The quick answer is yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it's legal to make MP3 files for your own enjoyment
using CDs you own. It's really no different than recording some of
your favorite CD tunes on a cassette tape that you use for personal
entertainment on a long vacation.
</P>
<P>
   It's also legal to visit Web sites and download licensed MP3
files _ music the artists have agreed to make available for
distribution in the MP3 format. One good site to find such files is
MP3.com at www.mp3.com.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with MP3 files becomes illegal if you make MP3 files
from commercial CDs and put the MP3 files online or share them with
other people.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody with half a brain should know that. I mean, you should
know something is wrong when the latest CD from your favorite group
is on sale at Target for $16.99, but also is available free online
in the MP3 format.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming we all have at least half a brain, then, we'll also
assume that if you run across Web sites full of Top 40 hits in MP3
format that the person behind the site knows full well that he or
she is breaking the law and that you know you'll be breaking the
law if you download any of the files.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of this has kept pirates from opening sites all
over cyberspace to trade illegal MP3 files. Some music industry
executives have gone so far as to say they believe the majority of
MP3 files online are illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that's true, nobody knows. But, as you can imagine, the
record companies and the artists they employ are not very happy
about this MP3 business.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Associa tion of America (www.riaa.com)
views MP3 as little more than a tool for music pirates. The group
has helped close some of the more obviously illegal Web sites and
has even tried to block the sale and distribution of the Rio MP3
player.
</P>
<P>
   Where will all this end? I'm not sure, but I believe record
companies will be forced to climb aboard the MP3 bandwagon _ or
develop something better _ because MP3 works, works very well and
it's free.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, thanks to MP3, high-quality music can be
traded across the Internet quickly and with relative ease. The
implications for electronic commerce are monumental.
</P>
<P>
   While that's being sorted out, I encourage you to give MP3 a
try.
</P>
<P>
   The technology has actually been around for more than a year,
but finally has caught on thanks to the widespread availability of
Pentium-class PCs and similarly powered Macintosh computers that
can decode and play MP3 files on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com offers a wealth of information for the beginner,
including answers to frequently asked questions, links to get the
necessary software, a huge library of MP3-related articles and, of
course, hundreds of legal MP3 files you can download free.
</P>
<P>
   A few well-known artists have made songs available for
distribution via the MP3 format. (Billy Idol had two songs on
MP3.com until his record label forced both to be removed.)
</P>
<P>
   But most of the legal stuff you find online is from unknown
artists who want you to sample their work. The thinking is that
maybe you'll like what you hear and buy one of their complete CDs
somewhere down the line.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let this throw you. There's some great music out there.
MP3.com has tunes in many genres, ranging from rock to country,
from New Age to R&AMP;B. There's also folk, swing, classical,
experimental, comedy and lots more.
</P>
<P>
   I dove into the MP3 experience one evening last week. The first
thing I had to do was download and install a program to play MP3
files. I chose a shareware program called WinAmp 2.05. There's a
similar program for the Macintosh called MacAmp. MP3.com offers
links to both.
</P>
<P>
   WinAmp, which costs $10 to register for personal use (do it!),
provides a really cool interface. It looks like a small stereo rack
system, complete with an amplifier, a powerful equalizer and handy
playlist window.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I went to MP3.com's music area and started downloading
titles. By the end of the night, I'd grabbed 11 songs ranging in
size from about 1.3 megabytes to just over 4 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   The music sounded great. I couldn't believe my ears.
</P>
<P>
   Audiophiles, of course, will debate the quality of MP3 files
until they die. After all, they still haven't given up on vinyl!
But I think most people with decent sound cards and speakers on
their computers will find most MP3 files close to CD-quality.
</P>
<P>
   I also liked MP3 right off the bat because it allowed me to work
at the computer and listen to some nice music without tying up my
CD-ROM drive with CDs.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't guessed by now, I'm hooked on MP3. And I think
you might get hooked, too, if you give it a try. &QL;

FREE ACCESS TO A SOFTWARE CODE MAY COME INTO ITS OWN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By AMY HARMON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The seers of 1997 had the computing trends of 1998 pretty much
nailed down _ the Justice Department's antitrust challenge to the
Microsoft Corp., panic over the Year 2000 bug and Wall Street's
infatuation with Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Unforeseen, however, was one of the year's most striking
developments: The surging popularity of what has been called
open-source software _ probably because it had long been regarded
by the industry's most powerful players as more of a political
ideology than a way to make money.
</P>
<P>
   Open-source software provides every computer user with free
access to the software's source code, the actual lines of commands
that the programmers wrote to create the software. Publishing this
code offers users who are programmers the chance to examine it, to
fix bugs or inefficiencies or to suggest improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Once widely denigrated by commercial developers as chaotic
programming by committee, open source is now expected to come into
its own this year as a business model, with potentially
far-reaching consequences for developers and consumers of computer
software.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts predict that the growing availability of
open-source software will push industry prices down. Others
forecast higher quality by both proprietary and open-source
products, driven by a new competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the start of 1998, the question was would there be an
economic model that would sustain the success of this open-software
movement, and I think that question has been answered,'' said
Robert F. Young, chief executive of Red Hat Software, which
provides services and support for a free computer operating system
called Linux. ``The question for this year is how rapidly is this
going to deploy?''
</P>
<P>
   Open software programs like Linux, (rhymes with ``cynics'') a
variant of the Unix operating system, are not owned by any company
or individual. Instead, a global network of programmers and users
manage and upgrade them, typically without being paid directly to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   Their motivations vary. Many have built formidable reputations
with their contributions to open-source programs, and those
reputations can translate into lucrative job offers. Others profess
an almost moral commitment, arguing that open-source development
simply works better than the traditional closed, proprietary
environment of commercial programming.
</P>
<P>
   Linux, the star of the open-source movement, is seen as a
competitor to Windows NT, Microsoft's industrial-strength operating
system. Indeed, perhaps the most persuasive evidence of the
potential of open source to rattle the balance of power in the
computer industry came recently from Microsoft itself. In two
internal memorandums that found their way to the Internet, a
Microsoft engineer described Linux as a ``mind-share threat'' and
suggested ways to compete with and co-opt open-source development.
</P>
<P>
   Open-source has its roots in venerable programs like Sendmail
Inc.'s software that Internet servers around the world use to relay
e-mail to its intended destination, and Perl, the programming
language that was used to fashion many of the the World Wide Web's
interactive features.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of the Internet has fostered such projects,
broadening the universe of potential contributors and allowing for
nearly instant distribution of constant upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   Open source began to gain support last year from blue-chip
technology companies. IBM, for instance, became a major contributor
to Apache, an open-source program for creating Web pages used by
the vast majority of Internet service providers. In a new
commercial twist on the theme, Sun Microsystems Inc. agreed to make
its popular Java source code available to developers who license
it. Sun is also retaining PricewaterhouseCoopers to audit the
process of who determines which new functions can be added to the
language.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most widely publicized move in this trend was when
the Netscape Communications Corp. released the source code to its
Navigator Web browser. America Online Inc., which plans to acquire
Netscape, has pledged to support its open-source initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The moves are driven in part by a common interest in supporting
alternatives to Microsoft. But they also reflect the emergence of a
new emphasis on making money through software services and support
rather than from the software itself.
</P>
<P>
   Young of Red Hat Software, which last year received investments
from Intel and Netscape, predicts that the top 10 manufacturers of
personal computers will offer Linux by the end of this year.
Although IBM and Compaq Computer's Digital division sell operating
systems, each has announced plans to make some of their software
work with Linux. The idea is that they will make money on hardware
sales and consulting fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real challenge for open-source software is not whether it
will replace Microsoft in dominating the desktop, but rather,
whether it can craft a business model that will help it to become
the Intel Inside of the next generation of computer applications,''
wrote Tim O'Reilly, whose company publishes dozens of books about
open-source programs, in the November issue of the industry
newsletter Release 1.0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise,'' O'Reilly warned, ``the open-source pioneers will
be shouldered aside by someone who understands precisely where the
current opportunity lies.''

BUG OF THE CENTURY PUTS BITE ON WALLETS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   History is full of dramatic technology screw-ups, ranging from
building the Tower of Pisa on sodden soil in Italy to the optical
flaw that made the Hubble Space Telescope a myopic wonder.
</P>
<P>
   But few are on as grand a scale as the so-called millennium bug,
in which many computers of all types are unable to understand that
the ``00'' coming after ``99'' in the year field represents the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen to a civilization largely run on computers at
the stroke of midnight Jan. 1, 2000, is anyone's guess _ and
everyone's guessing something different.
</P>
<P>
   Extremists believe we'll be confronted with the end of modern
society as we know it. Voices of reason say there will be some
problems here and there, but nothing widespread and major. Those
with their heads in the sand say it's a big fat hoax cooked up by
greedy, unscrupulous computer consultants.
</P>
<P>
   But there's one thing everyone agrees on. As 1999 begins, the
world's attention will sharply focus on trying to fix the Y2K
problem. So will the world's resources.
</P>
<P>
   Governments, businesses and individuals will spend billions,
maybe trillions, of dollars to fix what is simply a bone-headed,
preventable mistake. That's money that could have gone into
something really useful, other than re-employing the old COBOL
programmers who are being brought in to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   This should not have happened. But it did, and now someone has
to pay for it. That will be you and me.
</P>
<P>
   We'll pay for it in higher taxes, as governments spend cash they
likely don't have to make sure crucial services remain available.
</P>
<P>
   We'll pay for it through increased costs of goods and services
as companies hike prices to make up for Y2K-related expenses.
</P>
<P>
   We know who gets the bill. Who gets the blame?
</P>
<P>
   Is it the programmers trying to scrimp on system resources, or
merely out of laziness, who chose to designate the year with only
two digits?
</P>
<P>
   Is it the managers of those programmers, who didn't foresee that
the software and hardware they were building would be used far
enough into the future to pose a hazard?
</P>
<P>
   Is it the heads of government agencies and captains of industry
who, trying to save a buck, kept ancient computers in place long
after they should have been retired?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that last note doesn't explain why, even as late as
1997, some computers and software were being sold that still could
not handle 2000 as a year.
</P>
<P>
   Oops, sorry. Better make that 1998, because Windows 98 and
Windows NT 4.0 have Y2K problems, too. They've been fixed with
patches, but the notion that any mainstream software introduced 18
months before the dawn of 2000 is not Y2K-compliant is disturbing,
at least. Bill Gates should be ashamed of himself.
</P>
<P>
   I think the blame lies with all involved. Programmers should
have known better. Their managers should have insisted that the
software and hardware be engineered to handle four-digit year
designations.
</P>
<P>
   And bureaucrats and corporate titans should have heeded the
first rule of both evolution and technology: Upgrade or die.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of attention has been paid to those on the fringe who are
panicking over the Y2K bug. The coming of a new millennium has
always attracted the attention of the less rational among us who
believe that a simple change in the calendar means the end of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K bug has given the fringies more fodder. The worst-case
Y2K scenario has embedded processors failing in airplanes and
causing jetliners to fall out of the skies; banks losing all
electronic evidence of customers' assets; computer-controlled power
plants failing; food and consumer-good distribution systems being
disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing this, some people are stocking up on a year's worth of
food; buying property high in the mountains; and brushing up on
their marksmanship so they can pick off marauding hordes of
looters.
</P>
<P>
   There's concern that Y2K hysteria may cause a run on banks late
in 1999, as people become more nervous about having access to their
funds. In fact, the federal mints will be printing more currency to
handle such an occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is that the Y2K bug is likely to cause minor
annoyances in this country. Banks are doing very well when it comes
to fixing their Y2K problems. The utility companies are
successfully replacing embedded controllers that may cause
problems. And airplanes that haven't been fixed yet don't have to
take off.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's not the end of the world _ literally or
figuratively. The Y2K bug is simply a mistake that we should not
let happen again.

CHIPS ARE HIDDEN IN WASHING MACHINES, MICROWAVES AND EVEN
RESERVOIRS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As companies and government agencies race to fix the Year 2000
computer problem, they have discovered to their chagrin that
problems lurk not only in computer rooms and personal computers.
There are also risks in billions of microchips, doing such diverse
things as mixing the fuel in automobile engines, controlling
factories and medical equipment and even automatically flushing
some toilets.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem has raised awareness of what has long been
true in the computer industry _ that hidden computers, sometimes
consisting of only a single chip, are far more numerous than the
machines on desktops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Approximately zero percent of computer chips are actually used
in computers,'' said Jim Turley, senior editor of Microprocessor
Report, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Turley's figure, surprising as it might be, is not too far off.
The market research firm Dataquest estimates that 4.6 billion of
these hidden chips, known as embedded microcomponents, were sold in
1997 alone. By contrast, only about 100 million microprocessors
were sold that year to perform computations in computers.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the personal computer microprocessors that get all the
attention. This is partly because personal computer chips like the
Pentium cost tens or hundreds of times more than the chips that
control microwave ovens or Furby, the fuzzy electronic stuffed
animal with an attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the microprocessor is an important consideration for
personal computer buyers. Embedded chips, by contrast, barely make
their presence known. ``You don't say, `I bought a new Whirlpool
washer with a Motorola processor,''' Turley said.
</P>
<P>
   The market for such hidden computer chips has long provided a
refuge for semiconductor companies that lost out to the Intel Corp.
to provide the brains of personal computers. Motorola Inc. is the
largest player in embedded processors, followed by the NEC Corp. of
Japan. Texas Instruments is the leader in one type of chip known as
a digital signal processor, which is used in cellular phones and
consumer electronics devices.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller companies like Integrated Device Technology Inc. and
Quantum Effect Design Inc., both of Santa Clara, Calif., have found
niches for their embedded processors, because such chips tend to be
more specialized than those for personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, some of these more specialized computers are
starting to pose a direct challenge to the personal computer. The
biggest attractions at the Comdex computer trade show in November
were so-called information appliances. These include electronic
organizers, digital televisions, digital audio recorders and small
Web-surfing devices.
</P>
<P>
   Some pundits are saying that the world is entering the post-PC
era. The International Data Corp., a market research firm,
estimates that sales of information appliances that can connect to
the Internet, such as video games, smart phones, hand-held
computers and digital set-top boxes, will exceed sales of consumer
personal computers in the United States by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
   There are also growing markets for such hidden computers well
beyond information appliances. Tom Starnes, an analyst at
Dataquest, estimates that the typical American home has about 63
processors, and the number could grow to 280 in five years. These
chips are found in everything from video cassette recorders and
microwave ovens to washing machines, sprinkler controllers and
auto-focus cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The figure includes the 15 or so processors the family car may
have, controlling the fuel mix in the engine, the anti-lock brakes,
the air bags, the remote keyless entry, the radio and the dashboard
displays. Some luxury automobiles have more than 60 processors,
doing such things as raising or lowering the volume of the radio as
the speed of the car varies, or adjusting the speed of the
windshield wipers automatically depending on the intensity of the
rain, Turley said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Boeing 777 jets have more than 1,000 processors, from
a mere handful in older Boeing models, according to Timothy D.
Fehr, the company's vice president for airplane systems. Most of
the processors are involved in delivering entertainment and
telephone service to each seat. And instead of having cables and
hydraulic systems running through the plane to control the flaps
and rudders, the newest planes use a fly-by-wire system, in which
digital signals are sent over wires to processors that activate
local hydraulic systems. This cuts the weight of the plane,
improving range and fuel efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   But if the proliferation of hidden computers has brought
benefits, for the coming year at least it will also bring many
headaches. That is because companies and government agencies are
now having to root out these computers to determine whether they
will malfunction because they cannot handle the transition to the
year 2000, potentially shutting down factories or harming medical
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that only a small percentage of such systems will
malfunction. But with billions in use, even a small percentage can
cause widespread problems.
</P>
<P>
   The ubiquity of these chips, and the fact that many are hidden,
makes it a challenge even to find all these systems in order to
test them.
</P>
<P>
   At the Public Service Electric &AMP; Gas Co., a unit of the Public
Service Enterprise Group and New Jersey's dominant utility, Year
2000 team members walked through 250 locations, from power plants
to substations, hunting down hidden processors, a job that took
about a year.
</P>
<P>
   Just when they thought they had everything, they realized they
had forgotten to check a reservoir the utility had built to put
water into the Delaware River for environmental purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Could it possibly contain hidden processors?
</P>
<P>
   When the team members visited, they found that a technician
walks the dam twice a day with a hand-held device to check
creepage. That device, which contains a processor, needed to be
fixed for the year 2000. At the bottom of the dam was a control
system that monitored how much water was being released. It, too,
was not ready for the year 2000.

DOWNLOADING FILES IS RATHER EASY, BUT TAKE NOTE WHERE THEY'RE
SAVED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I recently bought a new computer. The operating system is
Windows 98. I set it up yesterday and it's just great. I wanted to
download Winamp so I could play MP3 music on my computer. The only
problem is I don't know how to download things. Could you tell me
how to go about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Downloading is simple. There's just one tricky part if you
are a novice computer user, and that's knowing where you saved the
file.
</P>
<P>
   Before you do anything, open up My Computer, open on your C:
drive and create a new folder there called download. (Right-click
in an empty space in the C folder, choose New, then Folder, then
name it Download.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, use your browser to download a file you want. Find the link
on a Web page for the file, click on it, and a Save As box will
appear. (If you use Internet Explorer instead of Netscape
Communicator/Navigator, you may get an extra dialogue box asking if
you want to open or save it to disk _ always choose Save, in this
case.)
</P>
<P>
   You'll get the Save As box and at the top will be the name of
the folder in a little window, with an arrow next to it. Click on
the arrow and you'll be able to scroll through the various parts of
your computer. Find C:, click on it, then find the Download folder,
and double-click on that.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the file should already be in the Save as: field, so
click Save or OK, whatever is there. It will start saving. When
completed, the download window will go away.
</P>
<P>
   Now, go back to the download folder and find the file. If it's
an executable (with an .EXE extension), you'll just launch it like
any other program and it will start its install routine.
</P>
<P>
   It may, however, be a Zip file (.ZIP extension), which is a
compressed collection of the files used by the program. You'll need
to get a copy of an unzipping utility, like Winzip at
www.winzip.com. Of course, you'll have to download it ... but
Winzip comes as an EXE file. Run Winzip, then use it as a program
to open the other file you downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Within my 730-megabyte hard drive, 137 hidden files take up
about 19 MB of space. The main culprit is a file, W95UNDO.DAT, that
uses about 10 MB alone. What role does W95UNDO.DAT play in Windows
95's life? Will Windows 95 live if this file is deleted?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you have W95UNDO.DAT on your hard drive, then you upgraded
that system from Windows 3.1. That file is a compressed archive of
the Windows 3.1 files necessary to restore your system back to its
original, pre-Windows 95 state.
</P>
<P>
   You can delete it, but the safest way to do so is not by simply
nuking the file. Instead, look in the Add/Remove Programs module in
the Control Panel. You should see an item called ``Old Windows 3.x
and MS-DOS system files'' in the list of removable files. Choose it
and click Remove.
</P>
<P>
   With regard to other hidden files on your system _ don't remove
them if you are not absolutely certain what they are. For example,
one very large file in your Windows folder, with an extension of
SWP, is your Windows 95 swap file _ your system's virtual memory.
If you remove it, you'll be in a world of pain.
</P>
<P>
   You might be able to find out more about some files at the
Microsoft Knowledge Base at support.microsoft.com.
</P>
<P>
   I just got a new portable computer. I travel a lot, and am very
nervous about letting security guards run this laptop through the
X-ray machine. I have been told it's safe, but is it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, it's safe. An airport X-ray machine does not put out a
strong enough magnetic field to damage what's on your notebook
computer's hard disk. If you remain nervous about it, and if your
portable has a removable hard drive, pack that away separately in
luggage that you check.

INTERNET COMPANIES: THE SMALL GET BIG, THE BIG GET BIGGER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago, the choice for Lycos, then a struggling Internet
search engine, was to make acquisitions or become irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reached 14 percent of the Internet users,'' recalled Robert
Davis, chief executive of Lycos Inc. Yahoo Inc. was at 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never going to grow into a powerhouse,'' he said. ``We
had to buy our way to being a powerhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is exactly what Lycos has done. It has bought five
companies, for more than $300 million in stock, in the last year,
increasing its audience to 38 percent of Internet users and giving
itself a somewhat better chance of staving off irrelevancy.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Internet executives and investment bankers agree, the
pace of deal-making by Internet publishing and retailing companies
is likely to accelerate as more and more of the concerns that have
started in recent years realize that they need to grow in order to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Internet you have to get bigger fast,'' said Mark
Shafir, head of Merrill Lynch's technology merger practice in San
Francisco. ``It's going to be the land of the titans pretty
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward consolidation began last year, when many deals
were driven by the desire of smaller companies to end grueling
battles for market supremacy. Most notably, CD Now and N2K, the two
leading online music stores, agreed to merge in order to fight off
impending competition from Amazon.com. And Media Metrix, a
privately held company that measures the audience of Internet
sites, bought its archrival Relevant Knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The existing titans, meanwhile, moved to extend their dominance.
America Online Inc., the biggest Internet company, used
acquisitions to reach new audience groups in addition to its core
of chatty teen-agers and their technology-challenged parents. It
bought Mirabilis, the Israeli creator of the chat service called
ICQ that appeals to an international audience. And America Online
plans to acquire Netscape Communications Corp. to get Netscape's
World Wide Web site, which appeals to business users, as well as
its online server software.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Microsoft Corp. bought Hotmail, a free e-mail
service, to funnel users to its own revamped MSN portal service.
And Amazon.com bought Junglee, a service that searches for products
for sale around the Internet, as a way to transform itself from a
book and music store to a vast electronic mall.
</P>
<P>
   The surging prices of Internet stocks will help create a handful
of new Internet titans as both big traditional companies and
smaller start-ups struggle to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Take Yahoo, rated at the top among search engines, or portal
services, as they are now called because of the role they try to
play as the front doors to people's Internet journeys. Yahoo now
has a market value of $23 billion, about as big as that of CBS Inc.
That makes Yahoo simply too expensive for any company (save perhaps
Microsoft) to buy. But it's easy for Yahoo to use its highly valued
shares as currency to make acquisitions of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to use your paper while you have it,'' said David
Braunschvig, a managing director at Lazard Freres. ``It costs you
nothing to get big.''
</P>
<P>
   While Yahoo and Amazon have, so far, made relatively small
acquisitions, their market values will give them the opportunity to
make even bigger deals this year, investment bankers contend.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the rise in Internet stock values creates nothing but
headaches for traditional retailers competing with companies like
Amazon and for big media companies competing with Yahoo. These
companies cannot pay as high a price for acquisitions, nor can they
offer their employees high-flying stock bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a big company, you won't be able to keep your
engineers for a long time if they see all their buddies at small
public companies become very rich from the stock options,''
Braunschvig said.
</P>
<P>
   The solution for an existing company is to take a part-interest
in a publicly traded Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   The prototype of his arrangement is Walt Disney Co.'s purchase
of 43 percent of Infoseek, another struggling search-engine
company. But rather than paying cash, Disney exchanged Starwave, an
Internet production company it owned, and only $90 million in cash
for Infoseek stock worth $900 million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing financial benefits, such deals help the
bigger companies keep up with the frantic pace of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Merger experts predict that media companies will make alliances
this year with the remaining independent portal companies,
including Lycos, Excite, Alta Vista and maybe even Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, for all the appeal and wealth of the publicly traded
Internet startup company, and all the high-profile initial public
offerings last year, statistics show that small technology
companies are less likely to go public than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   There certainly will be more public offerings this year, like
those last year of Ebay and Broadcast.com. Coming up early this
year is the offering for Ivillage, a woman's interest Internet
service. Later, most likely, will be an offering for Buy.com, an
ambitious online store that has grown rapidly by selling computer
products at cost in hopes of making money on advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Yet statistics compiled by Broadview, an investment bank, show
that last year, for the first time, there were fewer initial public
offerings of small technology companies than there were
acquisitions of them by bigger companies.
</P>
<P>
   Stock can be sold more easily and with less notice when it's in
a larger company than when a founder bails out of his own company's
stock. Holding onto stock in one's own company after going public,
however, has not proved to be prudent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the companies that have gone public since 1991 are
trading below their IPO value,'' said Alec Ellison, a managing
director of Broadview.
</P>
<P>
   So for those companies that don't see their way to being titans,
a quick sale to a more established operation may be both easier and
more lucrative than going it alone and risking irrelevancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``By going public,'' Ellison said, ``they may not get the
strategic resources that a sale to Big Brother would provide.''

JOPS PAINTS ROSY PICTURE WITH NEW PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c..1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Once-moribund Apple Computer Inc. is on a roll,
and cofounder and interim chief executive Steve Jobs is betting a
slew of new products announced Tuesday will keep the momentum
going.
</P>
<P>
   To judge by the reaction of thousands of visitors to the
MacWorld trade show Tuesday, Jobs may well be right. The crowd
hailed a series of product announcements, including powerful new
Macintosh computers for professional users, new server software for
running networks of Macintosh computers in businesses and schools,
and a more muscular, less-expensive version of the popular iMac
home computer.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac will now be available in four additional colors _
blueberry, grape, tangerine, and strawberry _ besides the original
blue-green and white.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're beautiful,'' said Jobs, ``and we hope everybody will
want to own all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite a few people have already snapped up the iMac _ 800,000
since the product was introduced in August, Jobs said. More
impressive was Jobs's statement that 45 percent of those units were
sold to people who had never before owned a Macintosh. That means
the iMac is achieving its most vital objective _ expanding the user
base for Macintosh hardware and software. Jobs also stated that
Apple would announce its fifth straight quarterly profit when
financial data is released next week.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs is regarded as the master showman of the computer industry,
and his presentation measured up to his reputation. But there was
substance beneath the glamour. For example, the new Power Mac G3
professional machines will feature PowerPC processor chips ranging
in speed from 300 to 400 megahertz, along with 16 megabytes of
memory devoted solely to displaying graphic images, and a new
128-bit graphics chip from ATI Technologies Inc. that is presently
available only in the new Macs.
</P>
<P>
   The result, Jobs promised, is graphics performance that can't be
matched by PCs using Intel Pentium II processors and running
Microsoft's Windows 98 or Windows 2000 operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   The new Power Macs will be capable of accepting up to a gigabyte
of memory chips and up to 100 gigabytes of hard drive capacity.
They will include FireWire, a high-speed serial port system for
connecting external devices like disk drives or other computers.
FireWire allows much faster data transfers than existing
technologies like SCSI or Universal Serial Bus.
</P>
<P>
   The new Power Macs will range in price from $1,599 to $2,999,
not including monitor. By contrast, a Compaq Computer Corp. machine
with a 450-megahertz Pentium II processor, including 17-inch
monitor and a bundle of Microsoft software, sells for $1,999. But
the Compaq machine offers less video memory, a slower graphics
chip, and no support for FireWire.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analyst Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies
in Campbell, Calif., said that with their advanced features the new
Power Macs are ``more than price-competitive with anything in the
PC market.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobs also demonstrated a new version of the Mac operating system
for use on powerful network server computers. Mac OS X Server is
modeled after the advanced Unix operating system, widely used in
corporate computer networks and on the Internet. It will include
support for the BSD version of Unix, as well as a Mac version of
Apache, the world's most popular software for distributing Web
pages on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Other network operating systems, like Microsoft's Windows 2000,
are priced according to the number of desktop ``client'' computers
attached to the network. But Jobs said that when OS X Server goes
on sale in February, it will cost $995, no matter how many
computers are on the network.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a fantastic deal,'' said Louis Mazzucchelli, industry
analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison &AMP; Co. ``Anybody who's shopping
for an operating system that's not wed to Microsoft will have to
look at this.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobs also boasted that since the release of the iMac, software
companies are once again eager to write programs for the Mac. He
said that since May, developers have pledged to release more than
1,300 new or renewed software titles for the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most aggressive promoters of Mac software is Microsoft
Corp., Apple's traditional rival but also the biggest maker of
software for the Mac. Microsoft demonstrated a new version of its
Internet Explorer Web browser, with features that work only on
Macs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to pioneering features and innovations first
for the Macintosh,'' said Benjamin Waldman, who oversees
Microsoft's development of Mac software.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Microsoft launched Mactopia, a Web site devoted
entirely to information about Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of popular computer games for the Mac has long been a
sore point. But Jobs vowed: ``We are totally committed to making
the Macintosh the greatest gaming platform in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   John Carmack, president of ID Software Inc., vowed future Mac
versions of the company's popular Quake game series. And software
maker Connectix Corp. announced a $50 program that would allow Macs
to run games written for the Sony Playstation game console.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Jobs's speech, rumors abounded that he would announce
major price cuts on the iMac, to perhaps below $1,000. Instead,
Jobs said the iMac would decline in price from $1,299 to $1,199.
The new iMacs would get a faster version of the PowerPC processor,
a bigger hard drive, and the palette of new colors.
</P>
<P>
   Apple will probably sell at least one of the grape-colored iMacs
to the comedian Sinbad, a self-described ``Mac freak,'' who came to
MacWorld in search of new gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter had just said, `Daddy, if they had a purple one,
that'd be cool,'' Sinbad said. He also wanted to check out Mac OS
Server for use in the computer centers Sinbad runs in his native
Michigan to provide computer training to children.

INTERNET FIRMS TOPPED IPO LIST IN '98 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By Peter Sinton   
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was another big year for initial public offerings but no
bonanza unless you happened to be _ or buy _ an Internet star.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there were 379 IPOs last year and the average gain
was 20 percent, compared with 524 new issues in 1997 and an average
gain of 24.3 percent. As usual, the Northern California crop of
newly minted public companies did better.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, 41 companies went public in 1998 compared with 46 the
previous year. Buoyed by enthusiasm for about anything with ``e''
at the beginning of the name, the Northern California issues had an
average gain of 90 percent according to IPO Monitor of Calabasas
(Los Angeles County).
</P>
<P>
   The local and national winner was eBay. The San Jose online
auction company went public in September at $18 and closed the year
at $241.25 for a 1,240 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
   Inktomi, the San Mateo online search-engine developer was the
next best-performing U.S. IPO. Since June, it soared more than 600
percent from $18 to $129.38. The third-ranking IPO was another
online auction outfit, uBid of Elk Grove, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 U.S. IPOs all were Internet-related, including
fifth-place Exodus Communications, a Santa Clara network management
company, and seventh-place VeriSign, a Mountain View specialist in
securing secure online communications.
</P>
<P>
   The best-performing local IPO in the fourth quarter was San
Francisco's Xoom.com, which offers free services and sells products
online. It went public December 9 and zoomed from $14 to $33 in
only 16 trading days.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed last year, it helped to be high tech. But it wasn't
essential. Brisbane's Bebe Stores, which sells women's apparel at
88 of its own stores, was the 11th-best U.S. IPO, zipping from $11
to $35.38
</P>
<P>
   The top-performing IPOs and their average gains, however, don't
tell the whole story. If you missed the top eight deals but
invested an equal sum in all the others, you would have made
exactly nothing at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, investing in IPOs can be dangerous to your
wealth. Unless you catch a few top deals, you are likely to make
less money than if you had invested in stock market indexes like
the S&AMP;P 500, which gained 26 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Also keep in mind that gains are figured from the offering price
and that most individual investors don't get a chance to buy shares
at this pretrading price unless they are important clients of one
of the underwriting firms.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 25 local companies that went public gained value and 15
lost ground. The biggest losers were Aspec Technology, a Sunnyvale
chip design company that slumped from $13 to $2, and Symphonix
Devices, a San Jose maker of implantable hearing aids, which sank
from $12 to $4.12.
</P>
<P>
   Like the weather, 1998 was a hot and cold year for IPOs
nationally. It started off averaging 48 offerings per month in the
first half _ on pace to break the 1996 all-time record. Then, as
investors grew wary of smaller stocks and Asia's economic flu, the
IPO market went icy. There were only five new issues in September
and nine in November before the market began warming up again with
41 U.S. IPOs in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
   In Northern California, 26 companies went public in the first
half but only 15 since July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Hit hardest were companies backed by venture capital firms.
Across the country, only 77 of these companies went public last
year compared with 135 in 1997, according to VentureOne Corp. The
market for new issues, especially risky high-tech ventures backed
by venture capital firms and their institutional investors, is
``like the canary in the coal mine,'' said Chip Vedder, head of
corporate finance from BancBoston Robertson Stephens. ``It is the
first to expire when the air gets bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &AMP; Byers and Robertson Stephens were
the leading venture capital investors, according to Venture
Economics. Each backed six companies that went public in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies hope to keep their sizzling streak alive this
year. Fourteen U.S. Internet companies have filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to issue initial or secondary
stock offerings, according to Securities Data Corp. Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Planned IPOs include the Prodigy Communications and iVillage, as
well as several online units of publicly traded companies.
Ziff-Davis plans to spin off its ZDNet subsidiary. Barnes &AMP; Noble
plans to launch its online bookselling arm, and Hayward's Data
Broadcasting Corp. expects to sell its Marketwatch.com online
financial information service.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons Internet stocks have remained hot is that the
demand by individual investors far exceeds the slim supply of
shares. In eBay's case, the stock ended the year selling at nearly
200 times annualized revenues and more than 2,000 times earnings.
</P>
<P>
   However, the supply of eBay stock could change dramatically as
``lock up'' provisions, which prevent executives and other insiders
from selling shares for defined periods after an IPO, are removed.
Only 15 percent of eBay's 40 million shares currently are held by
the public, but starting January 24, company insiders will be able
to sell much of their stock if they so choose.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks are not the only ones that are generating
interest. ``There's a strong backlog of deals including networking
and communications, multimedia, semiconductors and the life
sciences,'' Vedder said.
</P>
<P>
   About the only area where last year exceeded 1997 was in dollars
raised. Thanks to some blockbuster deals, U.S. companies raised
$33.4 billion in their IPOs last year, compared with $29.6 billion
in 1997. Conoco raised $4.4 billion in the largest offering,
followed by Infinity Broadcasting and Fox Entertainment, which
raised $2.8 billion each.

WITH EMPHASIS ON COLORS, APPLE PRESENTS SECOND GENERATION OF IMAC
COMPUTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Unveiling a colorful array of sleek machines
that more closely resemble a pack of Life Savers than a new
computer line, Apple Computer's interim chief executive, Steven P.
Jobs, on Tuesday introduced the second generation of the company's
popular iMac computers.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs told an overflow crowd of almost 5,000 at the annual
Macworld computer exhibition here at the Moscone Convention Center
that color and fashion would increasingly become more important
than measures of megabytes and megahertz that have traditionally
attracted computer buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Color is really a big deal for consumers,'' he said. ``We
think the most important question this year is going to be: What is
your favorite color?''
</P>
<P>
   To capitalize on the momentum of the iMac, which was the
best-selling computer in the U.S. retail market in the final
quarter of 1998, the Cupertino, Calif., computer maker has dropped
the iMac's price $100 and is now offering the machine in five
translucent colors: red, orange, purple, green and the original
blue.
</P>
<P>
   However, some industry analysts said Apple's rainbow of colors
might cause logistics problems for retailers who would have to
guess which colors to stock, leaving inventory _ and perhaps
pricing of some colors _ vulnerable to fickle consumer tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a reason that computer companies have made all their
machines beige,'' said Kimball Brown, an analyst at Dataquest, a
market research company.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs said the company had shipped 800,000 iMacs, which are
marketed as Internet-ready home computers, since introducing the
machine on Aug. 15. He also said that the company later this month
would report its fifth consecutive profitable quarter since he took
over as Apple's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the success of the iMac, Apple's fortunes in 1999 may be
more closely tied to a redesigned group of business-class computers
the company began shipping on Tuesday. Priced between $1,600 and
$3,000, the new tower-shaped Power Macintosh G3 has been completely
redesigned around a new polycarbonate translucent blue and white
case notable for wildly flared carrying handles and a side door
giving access to internal components.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in his trademark jeans, complete with bleach spots and a
small hole below one front pocket, Jobs received numerous ovations
from an enthusiastic crowd of Macintosh users.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, while introducing a Microsoft executive who spoke
briefly to announce several new versions of Macintosh programs,
Jobs said that Apple's relationship with Microsoft was ``like a
marriage _ 99 percent of the time it's terrific.'' But he added,
``About 1 percent of the time we argue over stuff _ usually having
to do with multimedia.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, testifying for the government in its landmark
antitrust case, an Apple executive accused Microsoft of trying to
strong-arm Apple into abandoning its QuickTime multimedia software.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs also poked fun at his now yearlong status as Apple's
``interim'' chief executive. Playing off the company's iMac logo,
he said his new business card identified him as Apple's ``iCEO.''

IF AOL ISN'T WILLING TO SERVE YOU ... 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: America Online has $4.5 billion dollars to buy
Netscape, but it's too darned cheap to put a server in my area
code, therefore I have to go long-distance for E-mail and what
little I do on the Internet. Question: What is a server, what does
one cost, and can a group of people set up their own server? _ Fed
Up
</P>
<P>
   Dear Up: Of course people can set up their own servers. How do
you think this whole Internet thing got so out of hand?
</P>
<P>
   An Internet server is just a big computer running programs that
serve up Web pages or other stuff when you ask it to. There's
nothing special about them, except that they tend to cost an arm
and a leg and you have to hire some major Poindexter right out of
college to run them for you so you can concentrate on making your
clients pay.
</P>
<P>
   Your problem isn't that AOL is too cheap to put a server near
you. It just hasn't gotten around to putting in a local-access
modem number in your town. That would let you dial a local number
that's part of a special long-distance network and that magically
hooks you up to AOL in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Don't keep sending your money to the long-distance company. Get
a local Internet account for 20 bucks a month. You can connect to
AOL through that. You'll need to go into the AOL setup (where you'd
change the phone number) and change the connection type to TCP/IP,
which is a bunch of letters geeks like to use instead of saying
``Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Connect with the Internet provider, then start AOL and log in.
Now you can change your billing method to the
``bring-your-own-access'' plan, which is about half the regular
rate. You can send the difference to me. I really think it's the
least you can do after how much I'm saving you.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: What does it mean to format, and is it
something I should do? _ Perplexed
</P>
<P>
   Dear Perp: You know how when your kid plays his Raffi cassette
until your head explodes and then you do a Nixon to the tape in a
moment of blind rage? That's pretty much what a format will do, so
don't attempt it unless you really do want to erase everything from
your hard drive and start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Make a bootable startup disk (go to Control Panel, then
Add/Remove Programs) and make sure Format.com is on it. Boot with
the disk, then type Format c: /u /s at that old-fashioned DOS
prompt and stand back. When it's done, you'll have to re-load all
your programs. Won't that be fun?
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: Who are you? Underneath all the insults,
blather and excellent commentary, I suspect there lurks a very
intelligent, well-educated twentysomething woman, perhaps very
petite and pretty, who's afraid to reveal herself for fear she
won't be accepted. Come on _ this is the late '90s! You could be 5
foot 2, eyes of blue and still be a fearless lampooner of the
ignorant. Or are you a scaredy-cat?! _ Just Curious
</P>
<P>
   Dear Just: It's not that I don't like to wear dresses as much as
any other man. I just have a feeling you might be in for a nasty
surprise on our first date. See you tonight. I sure hope you're
open-minded!
</P>
<P>
   Noted computerologist Dr. Emilio Bombay isn't really a
cross-dresser. That was just a Halloween costume. No, really. It
was. Send complaints to drbombay(at)star-telegram.com or snail-mail
them to Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Box 1870, Fort Worth, TX 76101.

 &HT;    Estonian composer evokes ancient visions of another world
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about ``old school'': Estonian composer Arvo Part seems to
summon the stately, ethereal choruses he so adores from the very
web of time itself. It's music that evokes ``the haunts of ancient
peace'' as a fellow seeker, Van Morrison, has put it. There's such
a powerful aura to his work _ which draws on sacred texts from the
Russian Orthodox Church and the sublime austerity of Minimalism _
that it can be positively trance-like, a shimmering window into
another world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kanon Pokajanen,'' Part's latest in a series of devotional
titles, is exactly that. Based on the Canon of Repentance by the
7th Century composer St. Andrew of Crete, this 93-minute piece
features the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir in a 1997
performance at a Tallinn cathedral. At once a beseeching cry for
forgiveness and deliverance and a thoroughly haunting echo of a
distant age, it's music whose simplicity functions like a psychic
balm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kanon okajanen''
</P>
<P>
   Arvo Part ECM New Series 11 tracks/2 CDs.
</P>

   The verdict: Stirring sacred choral music is timeless,
transcendent

 &HT;    Mini reviews of recently released CDs
 &HT;    By Richard Eldredge and Sonia Murray

<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ROCK
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayflower''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Bicknell.
</P>
<P>
   Self-released. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Four years in the making, this second solo project from Atlanta
singer-songwriter Richard Bicknell was well worth the wait.
``Mayflower'' finds Bicknell, the former frontman of the Lost
Angels, in a wildly adventurous mood. He chooses his material
wisely, combining his beautifully crafted roots-rock originals with
covers of songs by musical heroes: Robin and Linda Williams, David
Olney, Eric Taylor and others. The bonus? Olney and the others
popped by the studio to lend their talents to the project. Through
it all, Bicknell's mournful vocals anchor everything with their
rich, emotional rawness. Highlights include the reflective
``Barrymore Remembers'' and the gorgeous ``Secret Remains.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  RAP
</P>
<P>
   ``400 Degreez''
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile. Cash Money Records.
</P>
<P>
   16 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   If you listen to urban radio you had to have heard Juvenile by
now, ha? Can't get the rapper's infectious single ``HA'' out of
your head, ha? Especially because every line in the single is like
this, ha? Now you're thinking his whole album might be really good,
too, ha? No, it's not. As smart and comical as ``HA'' is, the rest
of Juvenile's sophomore effort, ``400 Degreez,'' quickly withers
into your average rap album of boasts (``Flossin Season'') and
slightly more engaging keyboard-crafted beats. And while ``Back
That (Expletive) Up'' is _ ahem _ memorable, is making a catchy
song out of condescending remarks about women good use of
Juvenile's randomly spotted talent? Nah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mama Drama''
</P>
<P>
   Mia X. No Limit Records. 20 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Though she's the only woman on rapper Master P's seemingly
endless No Limit Records roster, Mia X wields more power than that
might suggest. On this one album, the distinctively Southern Mia
sounds like a fun 20-year-old partying in a club on Saturday
(``Imma Shine''), a soul-minding sister who takes her two children
to church on Sunday mornings (``Whatcha Wanna Do''), and a loud
neighbor cursing her babies' father in the apartment next door
because she came back from service and found him still on the sofa,
drunk (``Bring It On''). Mia obviously don't take no mess. And
``Mama Drama'' is proof that she doesn't make any, either.

 &HT;    Be a crusader _ take up a cause on film
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fighting the good fight isn't always a function of war movies.
Consider ``A Civil Action,'' opening here Friday, in which a
show-me-the-money lawyer (John Travolta) finds a conscience when he
takes a case involving heartless corporations, a polluted river and
at least a dozen kids dead from leukemia. Here are some other
``crusader'' movies that might interest you. Just remember: Justice
may ultimately be served, but happy endings don't usually come with
the territory.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The China Syndrome'' (1979): Best known as the movie that
benefited from some amazing reel-to-real timing. Less than two
weeks after this film about an attempted cover-up of an accident at
a nuclear power plant was released, Three Mile Island made
``meltdown'' part of our everyday vocabulary. Jane Fonda plays the
ambitious reporter who stumbles onto The Big Story; Michael
Douglas, who co-produced, is her radical (read, long-haired)
cameraman; and Jack Lemmon is the company man caught between his
conscience and his career. The arcane title, incidentally, refers
to the belief that, if the core of a nuclear reactor did melt, it
would go right through the earth to the other side of the world,
i.e., China.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Silkwood'' (1983): In 1974, Karen Silkwood, an employee of a
nuclear processing plant, was mysteriously killed in a car accident
while on her way to talk to a reporter about safety violations at
the plant. But this is not a movie about a death; it's a movie
about a life, a celebration of a working-class heroine who, when we
meet her, would rather have her breasts than her consciousness
raised. Meryl Streep is at her considerable best as Karen; Kurt
Russell plays her boyfriend; and Cher snagged her first Oscar
nomination for her role as Streep's scruffy, sad-sack roomie.
Interestingly, Jane Fonda had been trying to get the rights to the
Silkwood saga for years; she gave up just about the time ``The
China Syndrome'' came along.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Matewan'' (1987): Just about anything John Sayles does has
an element of social consciousness (if you don't count his early
scripts for ``Piranha'' and ``The Howling.'') Here, he dramatizes
the ugly war that took place in West Virginia in 1920 when coal
miners rebelled against unspeakable working conditions. Chris
Cooper _ you saw him in Sayles' ``Lone Star'' _ is the union
organizer, a passionate supporter of workers' rights but also a
pacifist; David Strathairn _ you saw him as the sleazy rich guy in
``L.A. Confidential'' _ is the decent, caught-in-the-middle
sheriff; and James Earl Jones is one of the scabs imported by the
bosses who reconsiders which side he's on.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Marie'' (1985): Sissy Spacek was on location in Nashville
filming ``Coal Miner's Daughter'' when she heard about Marie
Ragghianti. A single mother who had worked her way through school
and become the first woman to head the Tennessee Board of Pardons
and Paroles, she was abruptly fired by Gov. Ray Blanton for
allegedly ``not doing her job.'' She took him to court, contending
that the ``job'' she wasn't doing was to turn a blind eye to a
thoroughly corrupt system. Spacek's committed performance is
stronger than the film as a whole, but it has its moments. Jeff
Daniels is convincingly loathsome as Marie's boss, a slick
politico, and Fred Thompson, her real-life lawyer (and now U.S.
senator from Tennessee), plays himself in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Big One'' (1998): Michael Moore (``Roger &AMP; Me''),
professional gadfly and agent provocateur, is back to bug the fat
cats and corporate giants. He uses his book tour for ``Downsize
This!'' to make a darkly hilarious documentary about the unceasing
greed and venality of corporate America. He finds (seeks?) the same
phenomenon in almost every city he visits. Namely, profits are up;
so are layoffs and factory closings. Moore takes on everyone from
Payday to Pillsbury, but the piece de resistance is a close
encounter with Nike Chief Executive Officer Phil Knight. Moore may
be all for fair play in the workplace, but that doesn't mean he
plays fair. He arrives at Knight's plush office with a ticket to
Indonesia, so the exec can visit the 14-year-olds who make his
shoes.

 &HT;    Superb cast, on-target directing help make this film `Out of
Sight'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Out of Sight'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   Another winning adaptation of a book by Elmore Leonard, the
brain that cooked up ``Get Shorty.'' It also happens to be one of
the best movies of 1998, beautifully directed by Steven Soderbergh
(``sex, lies, &AMP; videotape''). George Clooney plays a courtly bank
robber and Jennifer Lopez is the federal marshal he kidnaps when
she catches him making a jailbreak. In outline, it sounds like a
screwball romantic comedy. It just happens to be propelled by
firepower, betrayal, bloodshed _ and the erotic gravitational pull
between the two leads. Then there's the killer supporting cast,
including Ving Rhames and Steve Zahn as Clooney's accomplices,
Albert Brooks as a white-collar criminal who becomes their target
for burglary, and an uncredited Michael Keaton, playing an FBI
agent. Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Also starring George Clooney: ``One Fine Day,'' ``Batman &AMP;
Robin.''

   &QR;  ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back'' (R) _ The screen version of
Terry McMillan's novel tries to distract us from its lack of plot
with visual opulence. Angela Bassett plays a 40-something
investment banker who takes a trip to Jamaica with her best pal
(Whoopi Goldberg), where she falls for a 20-year-old local (Taye
Diggs). Luckily, Bassett roots the picture with a glowing
performance, sharing with us Stella's unexpected moments of

   &QR;  ``Disturbing Behavior'' (R) _ Disturbingly lame. This
teens-in-peril flick is a high-concept pitch with zero
follow-through _ it's ``The Stepford Teens'' with a touch of
``Invasion of the Body Snatchers.'' James Marsden plays a newcomer
to a small-town high school who encounters a band of frighteningly
clean-cut students. With the help of the school psychiatrist (Bruce
Greenwood), these fascist Archies ``recruit'' a new classmate into
their group every few days. Grade: C-

 &HT;    Polycultural fever from Colombia
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Promiscuity is a virtue in Bloque's polycultural rock songs. The
eight-member Colombian rock band, introduced to U.S. audiences with
this debut on David Byrne's Luaka Bop label, is all about a
hothouse flowering of rhythms and idioms tangled up in a sweltering
urgency. It's a fusion that's constantly verging on meltdown as
cumbia and rumba collide with glassy shards of jazz guitar
feedback, roiling organ grooves or the staccato riffing and
heart-of-midnight pulse of reggae.
</P>
<P>
   Like tropicalismo, the 1960s Brazilian movement that combined
Beatles-inspired pop attitude with sexy polyrhythms and subversive
social commentary, the hybrid sound of Bloque has it both ways: The
music is rude and infectious, a party gone way out of bounds; the
Spanish-language lyrics, at once bemused and fatalistic, form
postmodern blues songs. They're vocalized by frontman Ivan
Benavides as a kind of manic-depressive Dadaist, a guy whose life
is crumbling yet who accepts the chaos as somehow life-affirming.
(It's something Bloque has in common with the films of Pedro
Almodovar and classic New Orleans rhythm-and-blues music.)
</P>
<P>
   Benavides, an imposing character with a bald pate and a
comedian's rubbery face, calls the band's sound psychotropical. And
he's right.
</P>
<P>
   There's a fevered, hallucinatory energy _ a sense of perilous
engagement _ that's been shamefully absent from American-made rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bloque''
</P>
<P>
   Bloque. Luaka Bop/Warner Bros. 12 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A

SAN FRANCISCO PREPARES FOR THE MILLENNIUM CELEBRATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Predicting that next New Year's Eve celebration
in San Francisco will be big as people ring in the millennium, city
officials are calling for stepped-up planning _ starting now _ to
avoid a scene like last week's rioting downtown.
</P>
<P>
   City supervisor Michael Yaki has requested that Mayor Willie
Brown convene a New Year's Eve task force that would be charged
with developing a well-orchestrated, city-sponsored celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to repeat what happened this year,'' Yaki said.
``We want something more structured, more safe and more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco police thought they had a good plan in place this
year, when 650 officers virtually closed off parts of downtown and
corralled celebrants into cordoned off ``designated standing
areas.''
</P>
<P>
   But apparently unwilling to play by the rules, a group of
several hundred rowdy revellers broke away and began vandalizing
cars, trashing newspaper racks, setting fires, smashing shop
windows and taunting cops. Police made 35 arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a scary situation in such a closed area,'' said Police
Chief Fred Lau, describing the chaos. ``We had to escort
firefighters into the area, as they were being assaulted.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the third year in a row that New Year's Eve celebrations
on the streets of San Francisco have gotten out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   While police officials this week begin to dissect what went
wrong with their crowd-control plan and map out a new scheme for
next year, The city's politicos also want action. Yaki and others
on the board said it is imperative for San Francisco officials to
start planning for next New Year's Eve, which is expected to draw
huge crowds to the city.

CHARTER PLANE CARRYING TENNESSEE FANS MAKES EMERGENCY LANDING 
</HEADLINE>
 SCARE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 and JENNIFER BARRETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It started with a glance out the window.
</P>
<P>
   Just after takeoff from Sky Harbor International Airport about
9:50 a.m. Tuesday, a passenger on a charter flight full of
Tennessee football fans noticed the cargo door was open.
</P>
<P>
   That led to cries among the passengers to turn the plane around.
</P>
<P>
   Which led to an emergency U-turn and the intentional dumping of
9,000 gallons of jet fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Which meant that a wide swath of Tempe, Scottsdale and Phoenix
got soaked with the mist. And people stopped their cars, or climbed
on roofs, to gape at the spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``My nose is burning and my wife's nose is burning,'' said Clyde
James, a maintenance supervisor at an apartment complex near
Scottsdale and Thomas roads. The smell lingered there for hours.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured in the incident, and the airplane landed
relatively smoothly 10 minutes later, after climbing to about 2,500
feet.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a harrowing experience for the 170 University of
Tennessee fans aboard the plane. One 33-year-old man was later
treated for a seizure, but it didn't appear to be related to the
incident, said Bob Khan, division commander for Phoenix Fire
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew we were goners,'' said Allan Wainscott of Jackson,
Tenn., whose window seat was above the cargo door of Flight 665.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole plane was vibrating, and that door hit the side like
a tremendous boulder 35 or 40 times,'' he said. ``I'd hate to think
what would have happened if we were any higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Two investigators from the Phoenix office of the Federal
Aviation Administration were examining the plane Tuesday and will
continue their investigation today, said Mitch Barker, an FAA
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Barker said the National Transportation Safety Board had
expressed interest in the incident but had not dispatched
investigators as of late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Fischer, president and CEO of Miami Air International, said
the plane suffered no structural or engine damage during the
ordeal. Fischer said company workers were examining whether human
error, a failed latch or some other reason caused the problems with
the 6- by 8-foot cargo door.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the door was left open, there are lights _ very glaring
lights _ that go off in the cockpit,'' Fischer said. ``It would be
hard to even taxi when those are on.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane has the same tail number as a Miami Air plane that was
involved in two cabin decompression incidents five days apart in
1992. In one of the incidents, two passengers received minor
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, numerous people who had been aboard the plane, still
celebrating Tennessee's national championship victory in Monday's
Fiesta Bowl, said a pilot announced that nothing out of the
ordinary had been recorded on the airplane's warning system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going down the runway picking up speed, and this guy
right in front of me looked out the window and said, `There's a
cargo door open,' '' said Delisa Locke of Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone moaned about that, and we got the word very quickly
to a stewardess.''
</P>
<P>
   Garnett Gardner of Nashville said, ``Just as soon as we were
airborne, everyone started yelling, `Turn around!' to the pilot.
Then it got quiet as a church inside as that door whacked the
plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner said he clutched his wife, Carolyn, and 13-year-old son,
David, in the next terror-filled minutes. ``We all let out a big
yell when we got back on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Fallati, a retired Nashville police sergeant, said he
salutes the crew for pulling off the safe landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way that door was thumping every 15 to 30 seconds,
everybody was going `whoa' on the plane,'' Fallati said. ``But they
did a nice job of bringing it down in one piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Eyewitnesses on the ground said the plane left a trail of smoke
as it circled around over Scottsdale, dropping streams of fuel from
both wings over Scottsdale and Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale spokesman Mike Phillips said one unidentified woman
called to report that fuel was coming down ``like a fine misty
rain'' on an apartment complex near Hayden Road and Palm Lane. She
also reported that two people had been ``saturated'' by the fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Rural/Metro Fire Department personnel went door to door in south
Scottsdale making sure that no one was suffering any ill effects,
said Marc Eisen, Scottsdale's emergency services director.
Officials said the dumped fuel did not pose a health risk.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix resident Traci Schumacher was driving north on
Scottsdale Road when traffic slowed and she noticed a line of
people standing along the street, pointing to the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone and their uncle were standing outside looking up,''
Schumacher said. ``I was trying to drive and see what they were
looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   What many thought they were witnessing was a plane crashing.
</P>
<P>
   James said he was working in the laundry room when he heard a
series of loud booms and ran outside. Looking up, he said, he saw a
plane flying maybe 200 to 400 feet overhead, fuel pouring out of
its wings.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was so close, he said, he could see the open cargo
hatch.
</P>
<P>
   On the south side of Thomas Road, some residents had climbed
onto their roofs to watch. James estimated there were more than 70
people outside looking up at the sky. Traffic slowed to nearly a
standstill along Thomas and Scottsdale roads as drivers strained to
get a view of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked right into the plane,'' James said. ``I didn't think
it was going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami Air International, a small charter airline based in Miami,
has been in operation since October 1991, Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   According to NTSB records, one of the company's airplanes _
which has the same tail number _ had problems with decompression
while descending into Miami in December 1992, and a side window was
blown out. One passenger received minor ear injuries. Another
passenger's arm was sucked out of the window, and he suffered minor
cuts and scrapes.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of that incident was never determined.
</P>
<P>
   The same plane was involved in another incident five days
earlier in which another passenger window was blown out during
decompression but no one was injured, according to FAA records.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's incident, however, had much more serious overtones.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're flying and the damn cargo door opens. That's unreal,''
said Brad Hutchison of Nashville, who said he was still nervous two
hours after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   He also had his bags in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm driving back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Airline officials said most passengers caught another flight and
were expected to be back in Nashville late Tuesday night. &QL;

 Color slides and black and white photos of Billy Crudup and Woody
Harrelson in ``The Hi-Lo Country.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    You could say British director Stephen Frears has a way with
women. He took an unknown American stage actress, Annette Bening,
and turned her into a tough little sex cookie in the sizzling movie
``The Grifters'' (1990), garnering her an Academy Award nomination
and the attention of Warren Beatty. Anjelica Huston in the same
film has never been better.
 &HT;    Before that he picked Michelle Pfeiffer out of her sex-symbol
straight jacket, handed her a ``real'' role as the victim of an
amorous count's seductive designs in ``Dangerous Liaisons'' (1988)
and suddenly she wasn't just a pretty face.
 &HT;    And now in his first Western ``The Hi-Lo Country'' he's given
the treatment to not one but two actresses who have never looked
more gorgeous or been more real on screen.
 &HT;    Patricia Arquette plays Mona, wife to one man and object of
desire to two more: best friends and fellow roustabouts Pete Calder
(played by newcomer Billy Crudup) and Big Boy Matson (Woody
Harrelson). Mona is trouble but so seductive that the men risk
their deep friendship and their lives to grab her for themselves.
 &HT;    Arquette is right up there in Frears' book with Bening, Huston
and Pfeiffer. ``She's working class, she's right, she's wonderful,
'' says Frears. ``I saw her in 'True Romance' (1993) and I think
she's quite extraordinary.''
 &HT;    The other actress given the Frears treatment is Spain's leading
star Penelope Cruz. She plays Josepha O' Neil, Pete's
long-suffering girlfriend. Under his direction, a great beauty
becomes an absolute life force.
 &HT;    But while the women in ``Hi-Lo Country'' are the instigators of
the action, this time Frears is telling a story about men--real
men--and the difficult land they are attempting to tame.
 &HT;    ``Woody plays John Wayne here,'' says Frears laughing, ``When I
told him that he said, 'But I'm more flawed than John Wayne.' So I
said, 'That's what this is all about. It's John Wayne with
flaws.'''
 &HT;    For Harrelson's bosom buddy, Frears selected Billy Crudup, seen
in ``Without Limits'' (1998) and still largely an unknown. Under
Frears' direction he comes across like a veteran.
 &HT;    For a Cambridge educated Englishman, making a film in a genre
American audiences know as well as they know their mothers, it was
essential he find actors who looked capable of wrangling horses and
cattle and whose faces reflected a life in the sun in an
unforgiving landscape.
 &HT;    ``When I grew up actors had lines in their faces,'' he explains.
``I looked for actors that looked lived in, who looked as though
they had some experience of life. Billy did. He didn't look like
all those young actors out of Los Angeles. What's on their face is
their life experience.''
 &HT;    As for Harrelson, with whom other directors have had their
run-ins, Frears says, ``He's absolutely wonderful. His Big Boy's a
big lug--crude and rude. He's playing a passionate man, a heroic
American who defends what he believes in. And here I'm talking
about both Woody the person and the character.''
 &HT;    The place is the Santa Fe desert heart of the American West. The
time is immediately following World War II and in the town of Hi-Lo
the two best friends are reunited after their sojourn at war. All
is well until Pete discovers that Mona, a woman he has loved, is
having a hot affair with Big Boy and his own passions are
reawakened.
 &HT;    But the real love affair in the movie is between Big Boy and
Pete. ``In a sense,'' says Frears, who directed ``My Beautiful
Launderette'' (1985) which dealt explicitly with homosexuality,
``when a man loves a man, it must by definition be homosexual. But
making it explicit here would have been to make a different film.
This isn't homosexual, but it's about a man loving a man and it's
from a time when those things weren't laughed at.''
 &HT;    An Englishman's taking on the Western genre is a risk, but risk
has been a part of Frears' career from the beginning. It was a risk
to allow himself to be seduced to come to the Hollywood big time
from England where he had made a slew of small risky films like
``Prick Up Your Ears'' (1987) and ``Sammy and Rosie Get Laid''
(1987). It was a risk to go head to head with a director of the
caliber of Milos Foreman who was making ``Valmont'' on the same
subject as Frears' ``Dangerous Liaisons'' at exactly the same time.
 &HT;    Frears' version came out first and blew Forman's away.
 &HT;    ``I was just a bloke off the street,'' says Frears modestly, ``I
had nothing to lose. Christopher Hampton's script was wonderful and
I knew Milos could never have such a good script.''
 &HT;    When the conversation returns to his success with women he
points first to one of his failures: ``Mary Reilly'' (1996) with
Julia Roberts.
 &HT;    ``I think she was wonderful--very, very good in the film. I've
thought how stupid we were to be so undemanding of her. She would
have done anything for us. She would have gone to the moon if we
had asked. But it just didn't work and the problem was right back
there in the writing. We should have stopped it much earlier.''
 &HT;    And when it comes to discussing his triumphs, here too he is
reluctant to take any credit. When Bening's name comes up he beams,
``I'm very proud of her. It makes me laugh that I was there for
this great performance.''
 &HT;    As for Huston, he says, ``I wish I could take the credit for
bringing her out. She had for many years been in the shadow of Jack
(Nicholson). But she'd already won an Oscar for 'Prizzi's Honor'
(1985). The truth is you are just standing there at the moment. I
guess you create conditions, then they suddenly let rip and you
have it in the bottle.''

FIT FOR YOUR FEET
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color graphic, available by e-mail, on what to look for in
a running shoe. Call 212-499-3342. 
 By BEN STEELMAN 
 c.1999 New York Times Regional Newspapers 
 American rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why does every other shop in the mall these days sell athletic
shoes?
</P>
<P>
   And why do half those shoes cost almost as much as a compact
car?
</P>
<P>
   It may be impossible to say, yet it's easier to answer these
questions: Do you have to spend $150 on your feet? How much of that
cost is fashion, and how much is fitness?
</P>
<P>
   Quality does come at a price, experts advise. If you try to work
out seriously with a pair of cheap imports, you might regret it.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of weekend athletes apparently agree. According to the
National Sports Goods Association, nearly $8 billion is spent each
year in the United States on athletic shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you don't have to sell your soul to get the shoes you
need.
</P>
<P>
   For example, David K. Miller, co-author of ``Fitness: A Lifetime
Commitment'' (Allyn and Bacon, 1995), never pays more than $100 for
running shoes _ and he runs between 25 and 50 miles per week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most expensive shoe is not always the best shoe,'' said
Miller. By watching for sales, he often finds the shoes he likes
for $50 to $60 per pair.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Sprecher, head coach for cross-country and track at the
University of North Carolina at Wilmington, generally spends $40 to
$60 per pair on his athletes' shoes. ``It's the most important
piece of equipment an athlete can have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with expensive shoes, Sprecher added, is that owners
might be tempted to hold onto them too long. Like tires, shoes wear
down after time; the feet lose cushioning and support. Since a
runner's stride hits the surface with a power of 2 1/2 to 3 times
his or her body weight, those feet need a lot of cushioning.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem, according to Dr. Michael D. Carter, a sports
medicine specialist in Wilmington, N.C., is that shoes still look
good long after they're effectively worn out.
</P>
<P>
   For those who exercise regularly, then, it's a good idea to buy
modestly priced shoes and replace them regularly, Sprecher said.
For his distance runners, a typical pair might last about 500
miles: ``After that, they'll start to feel a difference,'' he said
_ and that difference might be felt as aches or pains in the knees.
</P>
<P>
   If you work out in a particular sport for three or four hours or
more a week, you probably need athletic shoes, said Carter.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, you need a pair designed specifically for your
event.
</P>
<P>
   It's a mistake, for instance, to use running shoes if you play a
lot of basketball or tennis.
</P>
<P>
   A runner's shoes are designed for continuous forward motion, not
the frequent side-to-side moves under a net or on the court.
Specifically, they're built with a slight incline in the sole;
dodge too fast after a ball, and you could twist an ankle, Carter
warned.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, most footwear chains have moved beyond the days
when ill-trained clerks would push you to buy the top of the line,
said Miller. At ``name-brand'' stores, at least, chances are the
staff will include at least one specialist knowledgeable enough to
help you find what you really need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't buy shoes in the morning,'' Carter said. Your feet
expand gradually during the day, especially after a run or workout,
so it's best to shop after work or after exercising.
</P>
<P>
   And don't expect athletic shoes to ``break in.'' They should fit
well immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons offers these
suggestions for buying athletic shoes:
</P>
<P>
   When trying on a pair, wear the same type of sock you will wear
for that sport, not your dress socks or hose.
</P>
<P>
   You should be able to wiggle all your toes freely. With running
shoes, there ought to be about a thumbnail's space between the big
toe and the toe of the shoe, according to Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Walk or run a few steps in the new pair to make sure they're
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Always relace the shoes before trying them on, making sure you
have even pressure from the bottom to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the grip of your sole is firm. Your heel should not
slip as you walk or run.
</P>
<P>
   The most important factor in shopping for a running shoe, Miller
and Sprecher agreed, is adequate support, particularly for the
mid-sole area.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers will tout ``air'' soles or capsules or gel-based
cushioning, but whatever the material, what's important is whether
the cushioning works.
</P>
<P>
   Cushions generally come in two layers between the sole and foot.
The top cushion should normally be three times the thickness of the
bottom cushion.
</P>
<P>
   Canvas tops are generally not very supportive and may stretch.
Leather is strong but may not allow the feet to ``breathe''
adequately. Thus, the best top material is often nylon or a
nylon-leather combination.
</P>
<P>
   Training shoes will generally be heavier, with thicker soles and
higher heels, than shoes made for competition.
</P>
<P>
   Walking shoes should have a firm heel, good shock absorption, a
smooth tread, and a rocker sole that encourages the natural roll of
the foot.
</P>
<P>
   For longer walks on rough terrain, consider water-resistant
hiking boots. Good boots will have a firm heel, a flexible
forepart, heavily lugged soles for traction, padding around the
ankles and a high, wide toe box.
</P>
<P>
   Court sports _ tennis, basketball and volleyball _ require shoes
that are light and built to take heavy abuse. The key to these
shoes is in the sole, which should be designed specifically for the
sport you'll be playing. For example, serve-and-volley tennis
players may need extra cushioning on the balls of their feet, while
baseline players may need reinforcement on the heels and midfoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hightops'' can provide extra support for the ankles but should
not restrict ankle motion.
</P>
<P>
   For court players, a coach or physician can offer advice on
which sole style will be best.
</P>
<P>
   Aerobic dancers need shoes that are a cross between the
shock-absorbent running shoe and the court shoe with lateral
support. Flexibility in the forepart is especially important.
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance or marathon runners _ those who can cover 80 miles
or more in a typical week _ will likely require more specialized,
more reinforced and more expensive shoes than a typical jogger.
</P>
<P>
   Within these guidelines, Miller warned, each individual foot is
different. One runner's perfect fit might not work with another.
Consumers should pay particular attention to pronation, the natural
inward roll of the foot on each step, which can vary considerably
from person to person.
</P>
<P>
   Where one walks or runs might also affect decisions, Miller
added. The ideal surface would be a level dirt road or field, with
plenty of ``give.'' Paved sidewalks or roadways might require more
cushioning. A sandy beach, on the other hand, might have too much
``give,'' which could lead to a painful stretching of the Achilles'
tendons.
</P>

the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons by writing P.O. Box

BIRDERS IN PARADISE

<TEXT>
<P>
   We are 80 miles south of Fort Lauderdale, plodding through
mid-May heat down an abandoned road walled in by a green bramble of
hardwood hammock.
</P>
<P>
   Officially this is the Key Largo Hammock State Botanical Site,
but if you didn't know where to stop along Florida Interstate 905-A
you'd never find this spot. But just the day before in this very
thicket, local birders sighted a La Sagra's flycatcher, a pip of a
bird that's common in the Bahamas but extremely rare in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   We move in a hushed, collective clot, following Jan Pierson. An
affable New Englander with an easy manner, Pierson is a birder of
global experience, first on his own, then as a guide for Austin,
Texas-based Field Guides, the acclaimed bird touring company he
helped found in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Pierson's hands are cupped around his ears and he is peering
into the dense foliage. One of us has a tape recording of the La
Sagra's call. He plays it at intervals, and Pierson listens
intently for the reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``There it is!'' Pierson's voice is low and fast. ``Down low.
Halfway up the tree. There! He's hopped to the left.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierson sets up a tripod and scope and we each get our chance to
view the flycatcher, a swatch of brown feathers, nonchalantly
ruffling a white breast with a tiny beak.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the van, Pierson says there might be only one or two La
Sagra's sightings a year in South Florida, which is one to two more
sightings than any place else in North America. ``Could there be
others in there?' someone asks. Pierson eyes the wall of foliage
unreeling beside us at 50 mph. ``There could be 50 La Sagra's
flycatchers in there,'' he smiles. ``You just never know what bird
is going to show up where.''
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much sums up the fun of birding.
</P>
<P>
   Most people don't know much about birders, often portrayed as
binocular-toting obsessives who wear funny hats and dash madly
about saying things like, ``What luck! A pair of mangrove
cuckoos!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, many birders do wear funny hats, but only because most of
them have been around long enough to realize the ramifications of
skin cancer. It's also true that many birders keep lists of the
birds they've seen, and some of them are ardent about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``World lists, North American lists, country lists, county
lists, backyard lists,'' said David Pomerantz, a straightforward
New Yorker who was part of our group. ``I read about a birder who
kept a list of birds who landed on his hat.''
</P>
<P>
   But for most birders lists are merely an excuse to get outside,
to travel, to share discoveries with like-minded people and simply
take a keen look at the world around them. Birders notice things
the rest of us don't. Back at the Key Largo site, Pemerantz had
pointed to the low branch of a tree and said to me, ``Look here.''
I saw nothing, then I looked harder and there it was: a tree snail
no bigger than my fingernail, its lovely ivory-white shell wound
with intricate yellow rings.
</P>
<P>
   We rumbled out of Key West harbor the following morning in
starry darkness. By burnt-orange dawn, everybody had scrambled up
to the top deck of the 63-foot Tiburon, our rolling home for the
next three days. Binoculars at the ready, they scanned the skyline.
The Dry Tortugas are 70 miles from Key West. We would be at sea for
nearly six hours. No one wanted to miss anything.
</P>
<P>
   The Tortugas are seven tiny islands, some barely poking above
high tide, that form a fragile circle of coral and sand in the vast
blue of the Gulf of Mexico. In the spring they are the first fleck
of land that northward migrating birds encounter after a long,
open-ocean haul.
</P>
<P>
   Some birds don't make it. Four hours out of Key West, Pierson
had the Tiburon's captain swing over to a tower marking a shoal.
Light green water languidly rose and fell from the tower's legs. A
dozen birds clustered on a guano-stained platform. Among the
seabirds -- brown boobies and frigatebirds -- was a lone cattle
egret waiting stoically to die.
</P>
<P>
   The Tiburon bobbed softly under the piercing sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they put down, they don't usually get up,'' said Pierson
quietly. ``This is the last stop for that cattle egret. He's
migrating and he blew it.''
</P>
<P>
   There would be plenty of dying birds on the Tortugas too,
bedraggled things perched beneath a ceiling of sky into which they
would never again lift off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some birders like birds because they give the idea of
freedom,'' observed one of our group, Everett Knapp, a Midwesterner
with 30 years of birding experience. ``Sort of an elusive idea,
though, because they're not really free.''
</P>
<P>
   A few nights before, a storm front had lashed rain across this
part of the gulf. The storm raised the possibility of a ``fallout''
of birds searching for cover on Garden Key, which lay between us
and the Tortugas. We arrived on the key in mid-afternoon and gave
the white sand beaches nary a glimpse but made a beeline for the
entrance to the ruined fort which dominates the island, crossing
its moat a dim archway to the open-air sward at its center.
</P>
<P>
   Here we found a birder's heaven: Birds were sheltering here in
droves, lighting up the crumbling brick walls like ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was pointing and sucking in their breath. Binoculars
swung this way and that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a redstart!'' said Pierson. ``Winters in the West
Indies. Look at that! That's a primo bird.''

   For over an hour everyone moved about the sward, training
binoculars and scopes into the trees in a sort of euphoric haze.
They peered resolutely into the sky, but no one seemed to notice
the massing black clouds. Thunder rolled. The palm fronds went
still. Gnats lighted on my knuckles. The air went cool, cooler,
cooler, then fat raindrops began to plock down and everyone
returned to earth.

BE A SUCCESS AND LEAVE AT 5
</HEADLINE>
  By BETTY HOLCOMB 
 c.1999 Working Mother 
 North American rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a managing director at Merrill Lynch, Susan Scherbel knows
she has it good. She works full time, but no one clocks her hours;
in fact, no one even monitors where and when she gets her work
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since my first child was born eight years ago, I've pretty
much worked out of my home, getting the job done as I needed to or
wanted to or could,'' she says. In that time, she's had two more
kids and been promoted. She now shows up in the office only when
it's absolutely essential.
</P>
<P>
   How did she cut such a good deal? With her background as an
attorney with a wide-ranging knowledge of both corporate taxes and
the tax aspects of employee benefit plans, she brings an expertise
to many deals that virtually no one else on Wall Street has. ``I'd
like to think that I'd have this arrangement no matter what, but I
wouldn't bet the mortgage on that. The truth is the more
indispensable you are, the more you can distinguish yourself, and
the more likely it is that you can gain some flexibility and still
move ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   That's excellent advice, according to consultants and academics
who advise companies on flexible work arrangements. Though some
companies have begun to create new ways to work, most still measure
employees the old-fashioned way, by the clock. ``Many managers
still think if they can see your face, you're productive,'' says
Marcia Brumit Kropf, vice president at Catalyst, a New York City
think tank dedicated to advancing women in the workplace. ``That's
not true, of course. Just being there doesn't mean someone is
productive.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Kropf and other consultants have learned over the years,
it takes a big effort to move managers out of this old mind-set. So
what's a parent to do?
</P>
<P>
   As Scherbel's experience shows, even in the most demanding,
time-intensive careers, there are strategies for achieving success
when you work flexible hours or must leave promptly each day. We
surveyed readers and talked to the experts to come up with tactics
for not only surviving, but thriving if you work with
clock-watchers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make yourself indispensable. As Scherbel found, companies will
go the extra mile for you if you have an important skill that no
one else has. Toni Thompson, an occupational therapist and mother
of two from Lutz, Fla., accomplishes the same thing in another way.
``I take on projects that no one else wants to do. I am developing
a reputation as the one you can count on,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, many moms say that they volunteer for special
committees, especially those that mean working with other
departments. That initiative keeps you visible, buffering you from
the misconception that you're not pulling your weight because you
leave at 5 or work flextime. ``People look to you when new projects
come down the pike,'' says one mother who works in the marketing
department of a major corporation. ``Pretty soon, they see you as
someone they really need.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Showcase your productivity. Of course, it won't help to have a
talent or an expertise unless you make people aware of it. ``I
never really used to strut my stuff,'' says Thompson. ``Now I make
a point to talk up the committees I'm on and the projects I'm
doing.'' Not only that, but Thompson is also quick to praise her
co-workers' contributions as well. ``I highlight other people's
work, and that way, I show that I am contributing and also a team
player who appreciates other people's productivity.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Choose the right priorities. Productivity only counts when
you're doing the right stuff, of course. Spending hours on tasks
that don't move the firm's main agenda forward is a waste of time.
If the company's goal is to create a top-of-the-line digital camera
or to make milk the most exciting drink in the grocery store, then
that should be your priority as well, in big ways and small.
</P>
<P>
   If you aren't sure what your boss's priorities are, find out.
``It's critically important to sit down with your manager and have
clear objectives,'' says Joy Bunson, senior vice president of
organizational development at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York
City. ``Once you can focus on outcome, face time is less
important.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, having the right priorities means adapting to your
supervisor's habits and personality quirks. ``My boss is a morning
person,'' says one mom. So she does her best to make sure she's on
time in the morning. ``If I stay after 5 because I came in a bit
late, it doesn't matter to him. It's more important that I am here
on time.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep the focus on work. Make sure that everyone knows you're
committed to working hard during office hours. Many moms note that
they don't waste time socializing during office hours; many skip
lunch to make the most of their time. ``I let my co-workers know
that I do have deadlines,'' says Tanya Mahoney, a fund raiser for
the Dallas chapter of the American Red Cross. ``If there is a
project looming, I let them know that I am not to be bothered, that
my immediate project is the task of the day.'' With that kind of
clear-cut dedication to getting the job done, co-workers are less
likely to question your commitment or productivity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Speak up when you have a problem. If you have a conflict that
makes it impossible to arrive on time or forces you to leave a
little early, talk to your supervisor. Otherwise, you're likely to
be seen as someone who doesn't care about your work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to have an open conversation with your boss,''
says Kropf. Frame the issue professionally, showing that your goal
is to be more productive. ``You might say, 'I know the standard
schedule is to be here at 8:30, not 9, but that isn't working for
me. I don't want you to think I'm late because I don't care. I want
to be a good performer, and I'm hoping that we can come up with a
mutually agreeable solution.'''
</P>
<P>
   You can then suggest options, such as skipping lunch or staying
a little later.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take advantage of technology. If you leave at 5, that doesn't
mean you can't still be in touch with co-workers and your boss. Use
a cell phone, voicemail, e-mail, whatever it takes to stay on top
of business that must be done after you leave the office. ``I use
my cell phone to attend meetings after 5 p.m. or before 9 a.m.,''
says one mother. That way, her boss and co-workers don't think of
her as ``leaving early''; instead, they see that she makes every
effort to be a team player.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Scherbel is evidence that a change is already under way.
``When I first started working at home, I tried to keep the
arrangement quiet,'' she says. But now she's extremely comfortable
with it, especially since Merrill Lynch has touted the arrangement
in company newsletters and to the media. Her schedule is now
considered a model, a harbinger of the future. ``I hope that's
true,'' Scherbel says, ``because it seems to be a win-win for
everybody.''

HOW TO HELP A FORGETFUL CHILD 
 BY MARGERY D. ROSEN
</HEADLINE>
  c.1999 Child magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Matthew has always been a sunny, curious child, but in the
past few months he's been so forgetful that my husband and I are
worried,'' says Peggy Simon of Muncie, Ind., who is four months
pregnant with her third child.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy will ask 6-year-old Matthew, her oldest, to do the
simplest thing -- clear his dishes off the table or dump his dirty
socks in the hamper -- and he can't remember to do it. ``This
morning, I asked if he could please bring me the telephone book.
When I went looking for him 15 minutes later, I found him under the
hall table watching a ladybug crawl up the wallpaper. He'd
forgotten all about the phone book.''
</P>
<P>
   During his last school conference, Matt's teacher suggested that
Matt be tested for attention deficit disorder (ADD), since his mind
wanders in class and he rarely hands in a finished homework
assignment. ``Neither she nor I thinks he has ADD, but there are
lots of unanswered questions,'' Peggy continues. ``She'll give the
kids a math packet to complete, but Matt will bring home only the
first page. Or he'll leave his notebook in his cubby so he can't
copy the spelling words.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping track of his possessions is another problem. ``So far
he's lost two baseball caps, a new pair of soccer shin guards, and,
believe it or not, his backpack,'' Peggy reports. ``When we ask him
where something is, he has no clue that he's even lost the item! Or
he'll cry. I can tell he feels bad about disappointing us.''
</P>
<P>
   A few times Matt has even mumbled that he was stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy wouldn't be so frustrated if Matt's absent-mindedness were
an infrequent thing. ``But after a while, you lose your patience.
I've run out of ways to help him,'' she confesses.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy's a believer in time-outs, but they have had no impact on
Matt's forgetfulness. Neither has the system of rewards she
instituted: ``We made a chart of the things he typically forgets to
do, and I offered a sticker for each task he did without a
reminder,'' she recalls. ``After a week he could trade in the
stickers for a toy. But it didn't help.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt's father, Mark, who manages a paint supply business, thinks
Peggy is too lenient. ``He's old enough to keep track of things,''
insists Mark. ``If we didn't let him get away with so much -- Peggy
runs out to buy whatever he loses -- he'd come around. Sometimes I
think he's purposely being defiant.''
</P>
<P>
   But Peggy believes her husband is much too harsh. ``Mark's idea
of solving the problem is to yell and say, 'Shut up!' when Matt
tries to explain himself,'' she protests. As a result, Peggy is
increasingly worried. ``I can't help wondering if Matt's just not
as bright as we thought he was,'' she says. ``Isn't he old enough
to recall simple thing, the first time we ask him?''
</P>
<P>
   The Simons consulted Theresa A. Kruczek, an assistant professor
of counseling psychology at Ball State University in Muncie.
Kruczek's analysis:
</P>
<P>
   A child's forgetfulness, though exasperating, is a normal
behavior that peaks and ebbs throughout childhood. And most parents
react to their offspring's absent- mindedness like the Simons did.
They can't comprehend how a child who, for instance, understands
the computer so well can never remember anything they ask him to
do.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that forgetfulness is usually a behavioral
problem. And that means it can be corrected. But first you have to
figure out what's triggering the absent-mindedness. The Simons'
family history revealed several factors that, taken together, were
contributing to Matthew's frustrating forgetfulness.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, Peggy and Mark reported that the problem really
started only when their son entered first grade. I told them I
doubted that ADD was a factor, since children with ADD often
display signs of irritability, lack of concentration and a high
degree of distractibility from infancy. (Psychological tests had
also ruled out any other learning problems.)
</P>
<P>
   What's more, first-graders are often forgetful. The curriculum
is more demanding and the school day is more structured than it is
in kindergarten. First-graders have to recall loads of information:
the names of their new teachers and friends, school routines, even
the location of the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matthew has a lot going on in his bead,'' I pointed out, ``and
it can be hard to keep it all straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgetfulness can be unwittingly exacerbated by high parental
expectations. Yes, kids at the age of 6 can do much more than they
used to. But they are, after all, still little. And although
parents want their children to take on increased responsibility,
many never take the time to teach them how to go about it.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Matthew to draw a picture of his family, another
critical piece of the puzzle fell into place. Matthew drew a house
with his parents, his sister and the dog inside -- and he was
outside. When I asked him to tell me about his picture, he said he
felt like he was on the outside a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy and Mark were initially surprised when they learned this,
but they soon conceded that, with a new business getting off the
ground and a third child on the way, perhaps they weren't spending
as much time with Matthew as they had in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing this, the Simons set aside 30 minutes each day for
one of them to spend alone with Matt, doing whatever he wanted.
Mark also acknowledged that raising his voice and insulting his son
weren't helpful, and he vowed to keep his temper in check.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew knew he was forgetful and was comfortable talking about
it. Together we discussed a plan: Since be was a computer nut, I
suggested that he type into the computer a list of Rules for
Remembering:
</P>
<P>
   1. Ask myself, What am I supposed to do right now?
</P>
<P>
   2. Figure out how to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   3. Pick a way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   4. Just do it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when his mother makes a request or he starts to do his
chores, Matt recites the list like a mantra. This helps him to
concentrate so he's less likely to forget important things.
</P>
<P>
   I also enlisted Matt's teacher to help him stay focused. She
wrote down each day's homework assignment on an index card, which
he gave to his mother as soon as he got home. Peggy now knows
exactly what Matt has to do each night and can gently prompt him.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, homework had been a haphazard affair, so the next
step was to set aside a specific time for Matt to study. The Simons
chose 7 p.m. as the starting time. I suggested they allow Matt to
choose where he wanted to work and that either Peggy or Mark stay
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Within two months, not only did Matt seem much happier but his
track record for remembering had improved greatly. ``He is so much
more responsible now, we get less upset with the occasional memory
lapse,'' says Peggy. ``After all, he's only 6!''

DAVIS MOVES TO IMPROVE CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATION SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY and ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Teachers would judge the performance of
other teachers and influence who is hired and who is fired at
public schools under a many-layered education plan California Gov.
Gray Davis will unveil this week.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial peer review system, which is used in only a
few cities around the country, is part of a $444 million package of
education proposals the new Democratic governor has included in his
1999-2000 state budget.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also wants a new system to deal with the worst-performing
schools. Two hundred schools, randomly picked from the bottom 50
percent, would be given extra money and two years to improve.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't improve, Davis aides say, they would face serious
consequences, a vague threat that could include a takeover by the
state Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, students would be required to take a test to
graduate from high school _ a Davis campaign promise that the
influential California Teachers Association has questioned because
there appeared to be no safety net to help students who fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens if they fail and have to be kept behind?'' said
Mike Myslinski, a spokesman for the 280,000-member CTA. ``Is the
financing going to be there for schools that already are strapped
financially in California to handle these students?''
</P>
<P>
   California recently introduced a statewide assessment test,
called STAR, that measures performance for several grades but not
the senior year of high school. Many school districts require a
test to graduate, but Davis wants to raise the minimum standard for
those tests and take it statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Wade Randlett, political director for Technology Network, a Palo
Alto-based business group that advocates for education reform, said
the test would give parents of high school students a way of
knowing whether their kids' schools are failing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents are going to hold schools accountable,'' Randlett
said. ``What you have to do is show them: Your kid didn't pass the
test and only 30 percent of your kid's class did pass the test.
That says something.''
</P>
<P>
   The test would not be given until 2003, when next fall's high
school freshmen become seniors. Davis administration officials said
schools would likely have to find money in their own budgets to pay
to educate seniors who fail the test.
</P>
<P>
   Davis made education his major campaign theme, and his ideas
helped him capture the governorship with one of the largest margins
of victory in state history. Now his staff is releasing, with
limited details, some of the plans Davis will announce during his
State of the State address Wednesday evening and in the state
budget Friday.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Schools Superintendent Bill Rojas, who met with
Davis' education aides Tuesday, said he was encouraged by the tone
of the new administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have much more confidence in their ability to look at
(education reforms) holistically,'' Rojas said.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Davis administration aides said the governor's plans were
designed to encourage the best schools and the best teachers and
punish the worst performers in California's massive, 1,000-district
public school system.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the proposals that have been previewed are modest but
important to teachers, like eliminating the $60 fee for a teaching
credential.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also wants to spend an undisclosed amount to buy
literature, not just textbooks, for school libraries. Specific
proposals like that pleased teachers and principals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a lot of thinking about how to update our titles,
but our funding is very limited; it's about $3 per child,'' said
Rose Barragan, principal of Argonne Alternative Elementary School
in San Francisco. She said teachers need new literature books in
the classroom as well. ``What you want a child to do is always go
to a book. When there is nothing else to do, take out a book.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' plan for teacher peer review is a $100 million hybrid of
an already-existing teacher mentoring program. The peer review
system is slowly gaining acceptance across the country. Last year,
the 9,000-delegate National Education Association assembly voted to
embrace the concept.
</P>
<P>
   Under peer review, beginning teachers and any tenured teacher in
need of help are assigned a teacher mentor, who provides assistance
and support.
</P>
<P>
   The mentor evaluates the teacher's progress and competence,
reports back to a governing board and may ultimately suggest a
teacher be fired.
</P>
<P>
   The CTA, the powerful teacher's union, supports peer review but
believes it should be enacted by local districts in conjunction
with local unions.
</P>
<P>
   Parents are increasingly clamoring for change in public schools.
California is projected to add more than 500,000 students over the
next eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The state has about 5.6 million kindergarten through 12th-grade
students and 250,000 teachers _ 30,000 of them newly hired and
working with emergency credentials.

DOCTORS SAY PEOPLE NEED TO CONSIDER LIVING WILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Despite the national debate about death and dying
sparked by Dr. Jack Kevorkian, too few New Yorkers are having those
kind of discussions with their physicians and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent survey of 58 hospitals, only one in three
people admitted for either congestive heart failure or elective
surgery had a living will or a health proxy, two kinds of documents
that outline the medical care someone wants, or doesn't want, at
the end of their life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Congress recognized the need for more people to
undertake end-of-life planning and passed a law requiring
hospitals, nursing homes, HMOs, home health and hospice agencies to
provide information about advanced directives to their patients and
maintain those documents on file.
</P>
<P>
   But a study of 56 New York hospitals found that only 64 percent
of elective surgery patients and 63 percent of congestive heart
failure patients received any information about advanced directives
before or during admission. Of the 43 patients who died in this
study, 37 percent did not have an advanced directive documented in
their chart.
</P>
<P>
   The study is part of a statewide effort to increase awareness
about advanced directives and to encourage more providers to bring
up the topic with their patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be more routine,'' said Dr. Charles Stimler,
clinical coordinator for IPRO, the state's largest independent
health care quality review agency. ``There's still a lot of room
for improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Advanced directives, including living wills and health care
proxies, are written instructions that kick in when individuals
can't communicate their own wishes because of coma, chronic
illness, traumatic injury or brain death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a lot of people who struggle with ethical issues,''
said Jayne Prendergast, a critical care nurse at St. Peter's
Hospital near Albany. ``It's very difficult for families if things
weren't discussed beforehand and it's difficult for physicians and
nurses.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the New Jersey Supreme Court in 1976 allowed doctors to
remove Karen Ann Quinlan from a respirator after being in a coma
for years, all 50 states have recognized some form of advanced
directives to allow patients to withhold certain treatments.
</P>
<P>
   However, advocates believe that only 10 to 20 percent of
Americans have done so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously hard to talk about critical illness, death and
dying,'' said Dr. Christine K. Cassel, a medical ethicist at Mount
Sinai.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians, in particular, need to start talking more about
end-of-life issues, before a patient becomes ill, she said. IPRO
researchers also believe that hospitals need to be more aggressive
in providing patients with information about advanced directives
prior to their admission or after their discharge.
</P>

   Loretta Villari, a retired bookkeeper in Niskayuna, is
determined not to leave her end-of-life care to chance. In 1990,
the 73-year-old filled out a health care proxy, assigning her
husband or her two daughters to act on her behalf. She's told them,
as well as specified in writing, that she does not want to be kept
alive by life support if she has no chance of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't want to be in that position,'' said Villari. ``I
want my wishes written down so my relatives know my beliefs.'' She
also doesn't want her family to struggle alone with the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone not filling one out is being very selfish to their
family,'' she said. ``It's a kind thing to do. It makes it so much
easier on the family.''

SNOW PLOW OPERATORS GO BACT TO SCHOOL AT `SNOW UNIVERSITY'

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Think plowing snow isn't an art? Think again.
</P>
<P>
   Before the first flake hits the pavement, thousands of
maintenance workers with the state Department of Transportation
meticulously spread salt and sand on 42,000 miles of state roads.
Once the snow hits, an army of 3,200 snowplow operators crisscross
the state, pushing, loading and dumping the stuff out of harm's
way.
</P>
<P>
   No two storms are alike, however, and super-slick conditions,
plus changing technology in snow equipment makes frequent and
timely training a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for more ways to improve performance, more than two
dozen supervisors reported to ``Snow University'' this week, a
three-day crash course where attendees are taught how to
troubleshoot equipment, review equipment operations and learn the
finer points of proper salt-spreading techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Part pep rally and part technical review, the sessions at the
state office campus of the DOT were started five years ago by
Terrence Vennard, a DOT safety training specialist, as an offshoot
of an annual training session held for snowplow operators around
the state.
</P>
<P>
   State training officials felt that supervisors, responsible for
carrying out a snow plan and managing a crew of workers, could
benefit from the voluntary training. ``We wanted something to touch
the supervisors so they could take the technical knowledge back to
the operators,'' said Vennard.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisors spend half the time in the classroom and the other
half in a garage, testing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got prisoners, vacationers and adventurers,'' Vennard
told the class. ``The goal is to get you walking out here wanting
to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   A slide show of basic truck maintenance kicked off the morning
session. Equipment instructor Diane Quillinan solicited feedback as
she showed slides of well-maintained, and rusty snow trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many people lube all the chains?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   A few hands shot up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't lube them all the way, then run them, because the
chains get rusted up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some nodded and scribbled notes, others stared at the projector
screen.
</P>
<P>
   The next slide, a rearview of a truck, showed rusty, bent flaps,
or ``skirts,'' which help control the spread of the salt on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does that look?'' said Quillinan, who drove a snow truck
for 14 years and travels the state to teach proper equipment
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad,'' some in the crowd replied.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Roe, a Green County operator and part-time supervisor,
nodded throughout the presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm learning something,'' he said, glancing down at his notes.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Lamana, who supervises a 17-person crew in Albany County,
and has worked for the DOT for 17 years, was attending Snow
University for the second time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a refresher course for me. Anytime you can learn
something, it's good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saratoga County engineer Charles Vieny shared his personal
experiences to inspire the supervisors to strive for excellence,
and focus on serving the customer: the driving public and each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fighting a war out there; a war against snow, ice and
people,'' said Vieny. ``Be committed _ personally to each other,
and to excellence.'' The school has helped to cut down on the
number of broken vehicles and reduced accidents and salt usage,
said Vennard, who has taught at each of the seven Snow Universities
held around the state since last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get people who really want to come to work now,'' Vennard
said. ``I get verbal feedback. I know it's good.''
</P>
<P>
   After a final exam, students will receive a degree of Associate
of Snow and Ice Control.

IN PRESIDENTIAL HOPES, IT'S A NEW ERA FOR WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dole and Clinton could be the big campaign names of
2000, just as they were in 1996. The significant difference,
however, would be watching Bob and Bill play the supporting-spouse
roles to their star-candidate wives.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Elizabeth Dole said this week she is considering a
run for president in 2000, the same job her husband pursued in
1996. First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has not hushed _ nor has
she confirmed _ rumors that she will seek the Senate seat of
retiring New York Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of think he feels he'd make a great first spouse,''
Mrs. Dole, the retiring head of the American Red Cross, said of her
husband on the ``Today'' show Tuesday. As for President Clinton,
many believe his character and behavior have created opportunities
for credentialed and disciplined women candidates like Mrs. Dole
and even his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Wilson, president of the White House Project, an
eight-month-old effort aimed at electing a woman president by 2008,
says a year of scandal in, and frustration with, Washington has
changed the political climate so that being different _ in voice,
vision, leadership style, and gender _ is a plus and a reason for
excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women who ran for president or vice president before _
Margaret Chase Smith, Shirley Chisholm, Geraldine Ferraro, and
Patricia Schroeder _ stepped into a climate where people laughed
and said, `You're different,' '' said Wilson, who heads the Ms.
Foundation for Women in Manhattan. ``Nobody was snickering Tuesday
at Mrs. Dole because today voters are dying for someone who is
different.''
</P>
<P>
   In a poll done for the White House Project, 76 percent of
Americans said they would vote for a woman president. But there
would be high hurdles for Mrs. Dole in a national race and Mrs.
Clinton in a statewide contest. Neither of them has ever run for
public office, and Dole was not tested on policy issues during her
Red Cross tenure. Clinton could turn out to be as polarizing as
candidate as she once was in the White House, and she has never
been a resident of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Still, both Dole and Clinton are taken as serious contenders
because they are, in their own right, nationally known, tireless
campaigners, excellent fund-raisers, articulate speakers, and
experienced public policy advocates. Dole has been a Cabinet
secretary in two administrations and is credited, in her eight-year
tenure, with performing a rescue operation on the faltering Red
Cross. Clinton came off the 1998 congressional campaigns as the
Democratic Party's most effective spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   They also are spouses admired for standing by their husbands in
their darkest days. Mrs. Dole was viewed as a better campaigner
than her husband during his bid for the White House in 1996. Mrs.
Clinton's popularity has soared this year as she took a traditional
role of defending the president and enduring the most withering
public humiliations of a sex scandal and impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Vanity Fair magazine article, Mrs. Clinton and Mrs.
Dole, along with Tipper Gore, topped the list of female `Legends,
Leaders, and Trailblazers.'' A USA Today poll in June found that
Mrs. Dole would soundly defeat the first lady in a presidential
matchup and be tied with Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, wives of politicians came to power over their
dead husbands' bodies,'' said Debbie Walsh, associate director of
the Center for the American Woman and Politics at Rutgers
University. ``What we're experiencing here is a historic moment
when a different kind of political wife moves ahead on her own to
forge an independent career.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, whose center tracks the progress of women in public
office, said both Dole and Clinton are potentially very viable
candidates. ``We know that when women are competitive, they do
win,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about her being vice president,'' said Linda
DiVall, a Republican pollster. ``This is about a woman with class,
stature, and impeccable professional and personal credentials
making a serious commitment to a presidential campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Timing is everything in politics, and Dole is expected to take
cues from an electorate that says it is more interested in issues
like education, health care, and Social Security than in balancing
the budget or commanding the military. ``The issues in ascendency
are ones where women are seen as having expertise and
credibility,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who highlighted her compassion, Christianity, and
conservatism in a farewell address at the Red Cross on Monday, also
has the potential to unite the often warring Republican factions
behind a presidential candidacy, analysts say. Because of her
personal accomplishments, she also could attract Democratic and
independent women voters and close the gender gap that hurts
Republicans in national and statewide races, GOP activist Ann Stone
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Dole is obviously not on our side of the fence, but she
is not a kook, either,'' said Stone, national chairwoman of
Republicans for Choice, a political action committee that backs GOP
candidates who support abortion rights. ``We see her as a bridge,
an advocate for common ground on abortion. We believe we could work
with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmen Pate, president of Concerned Women for America, a
conservative group, said ``a woman is capable of being president''
as long as her ideology is conservative and she demonstrates
character and integrity. Pate said it was too early to address
Dole's positions on issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, just being a woman isn't going to be enough to
succeed,'' said Charles Cook, a political commentator, noting that
female candidates need to ``perform very, very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole will have a chance to perform in New Hampshire on Feb. 8,
when the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce honors her as its
citizen of the year. With an expected audience of 800, the event
might be a prime moment for her to announce a presidential
candidacy in the first-primary state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she would be received quite well, and she would be
considered a serious candidate,'' said Thomas Schwieger, the
chamber president. New Hampshire has a woman governor, Democrat
Jeanne Shaheen, and a woman House speaker, Republican Donna Sytek.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Dole is keeping her own counsel, as is Clinton. Senator
Robert Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat and the head of the
party's Senate campaign committee, is promoting the first lady for
the New York seat that Robert F. Kennedy once held. The White House
called it speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, The New York Times published an editorial Tuesday warning
the first lady that winning in New York would be no cakewalk, while
welcoming her in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more the merrier,'' the Times wrote, ``including those who
move to New York to find work.''

HEARTSTRINGS IN CINDERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   PETERBOROUGH, N.H. _ Thick sheets of ice coated the plush red
seats where audiences once watched performances, icicles hung from
rails and rafters, and broken glass and charred debris littered the
sooty stage.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Leach stood amid the rubble of the New England Marionette
Opera, which was destroyed by a New Year's Day electrical fire, and
wondered what would be next for himself and the theater he founded
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   All he managed to save were some books on puppetry, a sewing
machine, a few marionette parts, and one badly burned marionette _
Escamillo, the bullfighter in the opera, ``Carmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Leach and his troupe of puppeteers are trying to tally their
losses, assess the significance of what they created, and decide
where they go from here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I had was in this theater,'' said Leach, 56,
fingering a velvet stage curtain that broke like ribbon candy in
his hand. ``Everything I made, I put back into it . . . Where do I
start again?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get over losing 200 kids,'' said Roger DuPen 32,
the theater's artistic director, referring to the more than 200
marionette characters that burned in the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a lot of time making and molding them, and the
puppeteers brought them to life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you work with marionettes long enough, they become little
humans with their own personalities,'' DuPen said. ``This is like
multiple deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the theater was the only one of its kind in the
Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say they believe the fire began in the theater
basement sometime New Year's Day morning. Leach was in the control
room on an upper balcony, editing video footage from a recent
production of ``Porgy and Bess.'' He smelled smoke but kept
editing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the smoke became more pervasive, Leach left the control room
and made his way through the blackened theater and out a fire door.
Then he ran to Roy's, a small grocery store nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call 911,'' he yelled to a startled clerk shortly after noon.
``I'm on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   It took firefighters 28 hours to contain the three-alarm blaze,
which continued to burn in the theater's trap doors, hollow walls,
and innumerable crevices. A small fire erupted in the attic Tuesday
morning, but it was quickly extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   The building was insured, ``but we'll take a big hit,'' Leach
said, because so many of the losses are incalculable. It took at
least 10 days to make each of the more than 200 marionettes used in
the nine operas that the company performed, and a year to develop
each different show, Leach said.
</P>
<P>
   Leach launched the New England Marionette Opera after being
captivated by the marionette opera in Salzburg, Austria. He had
never seen a puppet show before, but he liked opera and thought the
combination made opera accessible to a wider audience and also
provided an unusual creative edge.
</P>
<P>
   As DuPen explained, with marionettes performing to recorded
music, ``audiences didn't have to deal with the persona on stage,
they could get straight into the characters and the story line. It
wasn't Pavarotti, it was Lt. Pinkerton or Rudolfo.''
</P>
<P>
   Using a scale model designed by DuPen, they constructed a
theater scaled to puppet proportions in a converted Baptist Church
on Peterborough's Main Street. They made their own sets and props
and marionettes, with costuming help from designers like Masako
Hayashi, who had worked for the Boston Opera Company and the New
York City Opera.
</P>
<P>
   They found puppeteers among teachers, musicians, writers,
editors, and circus performers, united by a love of theater.
</P>
<P>
   And they gave 80 to 100 performances a year to audiences,
primarily adult, that typically filled about 85 percent of the
theater, Leach said.
</P>
<P>
   Marionette opera has been popular for ages in Europe, but it was
a hard sell in the United States. ``Opera is not an acquired
American taste, and people think marionettes are for kids,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   To make opera more appealing, Leach used surtitles _ English
translations projected above the stage _ and shortened the
productions to two hours.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly four years, the theater has made a profit. In 1996,
the company embarked on its first international tour. In 1998, it
performed for three weeks at the Emerson Majestic Theater in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exhilarating,'' said Karen Carter, 40, a puppeteer from
Lyndeborough, N.H., whose parts included the lead character in
``Tosca,'' and Rosina in ``The Barber of Seville.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really nothing else like this in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too soon to say what they'll do next, Leach and DuPen said.
Followers have sent many messages of support, saying they hope the
opera will rebuild in Peterborough or perhaps find a new base in
Boston. But for now, the company is still grieving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still riding something, maybe denial,'' Leach said. ``I'm
moving ahead. I just don't know where I'm headed.''

THE EURO'S SPLASHY DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are a lot of things you wouldn't give two cents for. But
hard-eyed currency traders on Monday voted with their computer
mouses, and bid up the brand new euro by two cents before it
settled back a penny to $1.18 against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The 6 percent gains rung up Monday on the stock markets of
Germany, France, and Italy ratified the currency traders'
instincts. It was a ``go'' for the euro in Euroland. And the mighty
buck now has a strapping young challenger prowling the planet's
currency markets. While Congress remains besotted by the bizarre
and self-destructive impeachment process, the rest of the world
reels into the last year of the 20th century. The right-wing
Republicans fiddle furiously while they try to burn Emperor Bill's
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   A shooting conflict with perennial troublemaker Saddam Hussein
didn't stop the House Republicans from impeaching Clinton. So the
successful launch of the biggest threat to the US dollar this
century may not be enough to yank the Senate Republicans back to
the reality of global economic strife.
</P>
<P>
   The euro already has all the muscle it needs to horn in on
America's currency as the world's most-coveted medium of exchange.
There are 290 million Europeans living in the 11 countries
(Germany, France, and Italy being the largest three) that left the
British dithering in the dust and plowed ahead on New Year's Day
with the most far-reaching currency innovation of this long and
bloody century.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar's place as the currency of choice for people who want
to save and invest is now at stake. A decade ago we thought it
would be the Japanese yen that might displace the greenback as the
world's premier reserve currency, the place to have your pile when
famine, flood, war, recession or the asteroid hits. But Japan's
creaky, jerry-built governmental system, imposed on that devastated
island nation after World War II, never took proper root.
</P>
<P>
   The economists and the business types rail about Japan's
bloated, top-heavy, artificially propped-up commercial banks and
financial houses. And it is true that the big Japanese banks are
probably all bankrupt, in that they went along with the
government's shortsighted dictates. Japan's banks are where the US
savings and loans were a decade ago _ overextended,
undercapitalized, and led down a blind alley by a government system
that feasted on corrupt campaign contributions and backhanded
off-the-books favors.
</P>
<P>
   The true cause of Japan's impotence in the current economic
crisis, which sees deflation eroding the innards of the world's
second-largest national economy, is the paralysis of the Japanese
political system.
</P>
<P>
   There is a hard lesson here for Americans. And it is rammed home
by the remarkable _ but not unexpected _ successful launch of the
euro. In this interdependent world economy, where capital flows at
the flick of a computer mouse, there is no sympathy for a nation
whose political system begs for a timeout.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as a heavyweight free-for-all. Does the fighter with
the tide running in his direction suddenly stop punching because
the other guy is weakened? Of course not. That's when you move in
for the kill.
</P>
<P>
   That's why George Soros broke the Bank of England, when
Britain's foolhardy gamble on maintaining the pound against
inexorable market pressures gave currency speculators a fantastic
payoff. And that is why Japan's feckless politicians are unable to
make any substantial reversal of the deflation that is threatening
Japan's economic security.
</P>
<P>
   There is no such thing as a ``timeout'' in the rough game of
economic supremacy. Which is why these fools in Congress risk much
more than their own seats, or the Republican Party's prospects in
the next election. They are playing with your 401 (k) money, your
pension, your Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   While they fiddle with Monica's underwear and Bill's cigar, the
euro is creeping up on the dollar. Two years from now, it is not
impossible to see the euro sucking money out of the US. The dollar
is not gold, it is paper. It is only as good as foreigners think it
is. And they now have a spanking new currency, backed by the
economies of a Europe united as never before, with an incredible
array of bargains and efficiencies built-in.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy chocolates, perfume, airline tickets, and automobile
factories now denominated in euros, so you don't have to fuss with
conversion rates in marks, francs. lira, pesetas, etc. As of
Monday, you can buy European stocks and bonds and commercial paper
in one clean, simple, cheaper deal.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, the euro made Europe more competitive, eliminated
currency calculations and commissions, and opened up a market
bigger than ours to the latest computer-aided techniques in
investments and speculation. The rest of the world thinks we are
loony to go after Clinton in this way, at this juncture. Our
Congress behaves like the Bank of England, just before Soros hit
the pound below the water line.
</P>
<P>
   Trent Lott, the Mississippi mis-manager of our Solons on Parade,
probably doesn't know the euro from a eucalyptus tree. Because if
he did, he wouldn't be screwing around with this dump-Clinton
effort at this juncture.

NFL FUMBLES BY NOT HIRING AFRICAN-AMERICAN HEAD COACHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A &UR;  &LR; sports headline in Sunday's New York Times said, ``Green's
success lifts black coaches' stature.''
</P>
<P>
   A caption under an accompanying photograph said, ``If Dennis
Green's Vikings win the Super Bowl, having a black head coach may
become quite fashionable.''
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying column by Dave Anderson began: ``Dennis Green
doesn't deserve the burden of being a beacon. But the more games
that Green and his Minnesota Vikings win in the Super Bowl XXXIII
playoffs, the more visible other black candidates should be in the
fog that seems to surround most National Football League club
owners when searching for a new head coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Let us cut through the fog to see what is really being said. A
brother has to go 15-1 before other brothers can get ``stature.'' A
brother has to win the Super Bowl before other brothers can become
``fashionable.''
</P>
<P>
   A brother has to be nearly perfect to convince owners in the
National Football League that brothers can coach.
</P>
<P>
   The column was well intentioned to the point that Anderson said
it was ``embarrassing'' that the last 18 _ now 19 _ head coaching
jobs in the 30-team National Football League have gone to white
men. But the headline, the caption, and the notion that the
aspirations of other African-American coaches are tied to Green's
performance are maddening reminders of the racist double standard
that surrounds the hiring of coaches.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of the players in the National Football League
are African-American. But at the beginning of the 1998 season, only
10 percent of the head coaches were African-American, and that
percentage could drop to 6 percent with the recent firing of Ray
Rhodes of the Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the modern NFL with two current African-American
head coaches _ Green and Tony Dungy of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers _
and two former African-American head coaches _ Rhodes and Art
Shell, who coached the Los Angeles Raiders from 1989-'94. All four
coaches made the playoffs at least once. Their combined record in
the regular season is 178-137-1.
</P>
<P>
   Shell's regular-season record with the Raiders was 54-38, a
winning percentage of 59 percent. He made the playoffs three times.
He will be interviewed for the head coaching job in Cleveland next
week.
</P>
<P>
   That does not get around the fact that he has not had a serious
head coaching offer since his departure from the Raiders. When the
1998 season began, 13 of the teams had coaches who were retreads,
men who had been head coaches of another NFL team. Only three of
those 13 retreads had a regular-season winning percentage higher
than Shell's. The NFL has only nine white coaches _ one out of
every three _ who can claim Shell's achievement of three playoff
appearances in his first five full years.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL says it is curing itself of racism by bolstering the
lower ranks of coaches. But bolstering is not the same as
advancement. Head coaches usually come from the ranks of offensive
or defensive coordinators. It took Tony Dungy 12 years to go from
coordinator to head coach, longer than it took for any white
coordinator to become a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Among white head coaches, the average time from coordinator to
the head job is six years. Fifteen of the league's 20 white coaches
advanced from coordinator to head coach in six years or less. While
it can be said that Rhodes advanced from coordinator to head coach
in four years, it took him until his 15th season of NFL coaching to
become head coach. No other white head coach had to wait as long
once they entered the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   No one is so obviously waiting as Sherman Lewis. Lewis, 56, has
coached in the NFL for 16 seasons. He has been offensive
coordinator for the Green Bay Packers for seven.
</P>
<P>
   His team won a Super Bowl. Two men under his command are now
head coaches. Steve Mariucci (no years as a coordinator and five
years of NFL experience) was hired two seasons ago by the San
Francisco 49ers. Jon Gruden (three years as a coordinator and seven
as an NFL coach) was hired last year by the Oakland Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lewis still waits for his own head coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   The focus on Dennis Green ignores the fact that no white coach's
performance lifts or sinks the stature of white coaches. While the
African-American coaches have won 57 percent of their games, the
NFL was content to begin this season with nine white coaches whose
winning percentage was 45 percent. Of the 13 retreads, nine were
hired by a new team after failing to post a winning record in their
final year with their previous team.
</P>
<P>
   It is disgusting for anyone to intimate that an African-American
coach must post a 15-1 record for black coaches to become
``fashionable.'' We are not talking about a mysterious talent pool.
Every NFL coach in 1998 was a former college or pro player. There
should be no more stories about black coaches rising on the
fortunes of Dennis Green. It is about how the NFL crushes
African-American coaches despite having the biggest talent pool for
black leadership than any other business in the nation save for
professional basketball.

A NEW ERA IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SACRAMENTO, Calif. --- As pompous rancor racked the capital of
the largest government in the country, cheerful civility marked the
passage of power in the capital of the second-largest government.
In the calm of a foggy winter Monday, neither partisan screeching
nor feckless strategizing greeted Gray Davis as he took the oath to
become the 37th governor of California.
</P>
<P>
   The first Democrat elected governor in 16 years, Davis, 56,
succeeded Republican Pete Wilson, ineligible for reelection because
of term limits. He invited Wilson to the inaugural, then saluted
him: ``As we pass the torch, I could not have asked for more
cooperation or a better attitude during our transition, and I thank
you for more than 30 years of service to California and America.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis then proceeded to bash Wilson's programs: ``The era of
wedge-issue politics in California is over. . . . You can finally
ring down the curtain on the politics of division. . . . Blaming
teachers, as some have done, is no solution. . . . My
administration will not flinch in the face of the gun lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   These candid criticisms ignited cheers in the partisan crowd,
but at the end of his inaugural speech, Davis invited Wilson and
Vice President Gore and their wives to raise hands together on the
stage. The message was: We can disagree and still be civil. How
mature, how mellow, how Californian, how un-Washingtonian.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is a Clintonesque ``new Democrat'' without Clinton's
excess of charm. After he took the oath, a three-minute standing
ovation rattled the 1920s-Moorish rafters of Memorial Auditorium,
punctuating an end to the Democrats' exile. Justice Stanley Mosk
told the crowd how long such droughts can be. ``It was 60 years ago
that I participated in the inauguration of Governor Culbert Olson,
the first Democratic governor of this century,'' Mosk said. ``I
later became his chief of staff. Now we have high expectations as
we inaugurate Gray Davis.''
</P>
<P>
   The only Democratic governors between Olson and Davis were the
Edmund G. Browns, Senior and Junior. Pat Brown personified the
big-spending optimism of the late 1950s, building highways, water
projects, and universities. Jerry, elected in 1974, called his time
``an era of limits.'' (The younger Brown has returned to politics,
becoming mayor of Oakland at the same hour Davis, his former chief
of staff, became governor.)
</P>
<P>
   California Democrats have often lurched leftward, and
Republicans predict that Davis will do likewise. But his inaugural
speech shunned what he called ``rigid ideologies'' to say: ``I am a
moderate and a pragmatist by nature. That is how I campaigned. And
that is how I will lead this state into the future. I will govern
neither from the right nor from the left but from the center.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis baptized his first term ``the era of higher
expectations,'' saying his primary mission as governor will be ``to
restore California's schools to greatness.'' The state ranks first
in the number of students, 5.6 million, but 41st in annual spending
per pupil. The Silicon Valley state ranks 47th in students per
computer.
</P>
<P>
   The state budget is $150 billion, but mandated programs will
force Davis to honor his inaugural promise to be ``tight with your
tax dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis has another role model in Gore, who visits California's 54
electoral votes the way other people visit the grocery store. Davis
once called Gore ``my charisma tutor,'' but compared with the new
governor, the vice president could be Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Is Davis ambitious for higher office? Nearly every politician
is. Michael Dukakis, here to congratulate the new state treasurer,
Phil Angelides, had one piece of advice for Davis: ``Don't run for
president.''
</P>
<P>
   In his serviceable speech, Davis shunned editorial advice to
become inspirational. ``We are among the most fortunate people ever
to inhabit planet Earth,'' he told Californians. For an apolitical
electorate, that may be inspiration enough.

IT TOOK A TEAM FOR `CIVIL' ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the record, there were three partners in the Boston law firm
that represented the Woburn, Mass. families in ``A Civil Action.''
Jan Schlichtmann was only one of them.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the narcissistic trial lawyer who favored
hand-tailored suits and Hermes ties, who embodied both '60s
idealism and '80s greed, was central to the 1986 courtroom drama
that comes to the big screen this week in its much-anticipated
Boston premiere.
</P>
<P>
   It was Schlichtmann who convinced his more cautious partners,
Kevin Conway and Bill Crowley, that an upstart, three-man personal
injury firm could prove that two Fortune 500 companies had poisoned
Woburn's well water with chemical solvents and caused the cancer
deaths of five children and one adult.
</P>
<P>
   It is not those deaths, but the David and Goliath matchup
between the tiny firm of Schlichtmann, Conway &AMP; Crowley and the
corporate giants of Beatrice Foods and W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. that forms
the narrative core of ``A Civil Action,'' Jonathan Harr's riveting,
disheartening account of the realities of civil litigation in our
time.
</P>
<P>
   As inevitable as it was that Schlichtmann would be portrayed in
the film version by an actor with the star quality of John
Travolta, it was just as certain that Kevin Conway and Bill Crowley
would be played by actors with names like Tony Shalhoub and Zeljko
Ivanek.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just those kind of guys,'' smiles Conway, who stepped
out of character to buy, rather than rent, the tuxedo he'll wear to
the movie gala at the Wang Center. ``Flashy isn't a word that comes
immediately to mind when you think of me or Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   It took more than style, however, to mount one of the most
complicated medical liability and environmental pollution cases in
US history. Schlichtmann was the undisputed star in the well of
Judge Walter J. Skinner's federal courtroom, but he was propped up
on those Bally shoes by an office staff that swelled to 18 at the
height of the case. They called their softball team The Kooks.
</P>
<P>
   Conway conducted many of the depositions in the case. Crowley
assembled most of the exhibits. Sylvia Chin-Caplan, the office's
attorney-nurse practitioner, examined all of the medical records of
the Woburn families. Ron Homer, then a paralegal and now junior
partner in the reconfigured firm of Conway, Crowley &AMP; Homer, ran
errands and polished Schlichtmann's Porsche and the conference room
table of bird's-eye maple that Schlichtmann ordered from a man who
had designed a similar one for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a team in the best sense of the word,'' recalls
Crowley, who poured the proceeds of every other case he settled
during those years back into the Woburn litigation. ``We were in it
together. We were on a crusade.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every crusade ends in triumph, however. The Woburn case
ended with a token $8 million settlement from W.R. Grace, and no
admission of guilt on the part of either corporation. Schlichtmann,
Conway &AMP; Crowley was broke after years of doing battle with the
likes of Hale and Dorr and Foley, Hoag &AMP; Eliot.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers themselves were nearly broken. Schlichtmann declared
bankruptcy and ran off to Hawaii to nurse his psychic wounds.
Conway and Crowley were no less disillusioned with the law, but
Hawaii was not an option. They had families to support. Both men
rejected bankruptcy as an out. They hunkered down, scrambling to
salvage the firm they had almost lost.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years later, they have yet to put all the financial
burdens of Woburn behind them. That's why Conway's wife, Ginny,
still hasn't read ``A Civil Action.'' Why would she? Wednesday's
night's hoopla notwithstanding, there is not a lot she wants to
remember.
</P>
<P>
   The deeds to the Conway and Crowley homes were collateral for
all the loans the firm had secured to finance the Woburn case. ``I
remember reading the papers from the IRS. They said I would be able
to keep my clothes and my books, but everything else would be
auctioned off to settle our tax debt,'' Ginny Conway recalls. ``I
thought, `That's not too bad. My children are healthy, and I get to
keep my books.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, it never came to that. ``It was a nightmare. We
were all scared,'' says Michele Crowley, ``but we never lost sight
of who the real victims were in this case. We got to tuck our
children in at night.''
</P>
<P>
   The three remain friends. Schlichtmann is gone, in practice in
Beverly, Mass., but Conway and Crowley fought their way back. The
centerpiece of their firm's new office, on Congress Street in
downtown Boston, is that bird's-eye maple conference table.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Slipping forward in her chair at the dining room
table of her condo, Margie Levine is so natural, so ``what you see
is what you get,'' that she puts you at ease with the long line of
scars from stitches on her body, as if she were showing a cat's
scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Want to see my scar? It goes from my midriff to my torso,''
she says of the track left there when a surgeon cut a cancerous
tumor from her left lung.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Levine, 52, has outlived the trauma and is free of
cancer, no small feat given that, nine years ago, four doctors gave
her the same diagnosis: less than a year to live.
</P>
<P>
   But what makes her tale all the more riveting, especially this
time of year, is Levine's message that the cancer led her to
reorder her life's priorities. She became more centered and even,
in the end, happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I vowed that if I lived, I would dedicate the rest of my life
empowering other cancer patients who feel desperate to harness
their coping skills,'' Levine says.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, she spoke last spring at the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute, telling her story to 150 physicians. Last fall, she
spoke before 200 health professionals at a convention of the
American Lung Cancer Association. Last month, she spoke at Lesley
College.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous when I spoke at Dana-Farber because my story is
traumatic and I had never shared it publicly,'' Levine recalls.
``But they cheered me when I finished,'' and applauded loud and
long. Some listeners bought her book, ``Embracing Challenge,'' a
self-published 41-step guide to wellness. ``Even my doctor stood in
line to shake my hand.''
</P>
<P>
   That doctor, David Sugarbaker, is chief of thoracic surgery at
Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Hospital. And he says he's all too
happy to celebrate Levine's life. ``She is the one who during her
treatment constantly coached others in a thumbs-up, positive way,''
says Sugarbaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the longest-known cancer-free survivor in the world of
pleural-mesothelioma, or asbestos cancer,'' Levine says. She still
has 100 metal clips around her heart. But except for an old back
injury, she is healthy, a marvel whose case is studied at Harvard
Medical School and whose longevity is turning heads in the medical
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her living this long says something went right. Her case is
very encouraging,'' says Sugarbaker.
</P>
<P>
   Now she counsels others with cancer, like the people she met
last summer at Polly's Place, a support group on Cape Cod. ``We had
to turn people away for space,'' says Karen Rudman, who leads the
group. ``Margie is so inspiring because she is an ordinary lady who
has done remarkable things.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what one woman, diagnosed with incurable cancer at 43,
did to put CAT scans and hospitals behind her. Much of her advice
might apply, too, to anyone who'd like a more fulfilling life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to rush through my meals and eat helter-skelter, and
now, before each meal, I stop and appreciate for a moment where my
food comes from, and I savor every bite,'' Levine says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to get upset if I spilled red wine on a white couch.
Now I realize it's a thing that can be fixed,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to save money for a rainy day. Now I indulge myself,
even frivilously, on clothing or furnishings for my home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be a human doing, and now I strive to be a human
being,'' she says, a broad smiling breaking across her face like a
TV game show contestant who has just won the jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our culture most of us are human doings _ doing, going,
going. It's a status symbol to say to a friend, `I'm fine, I'm
great, oh yes, I've been very, very busy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1986, Levine was one of those people.
</P>
<P>
   A public school health education coordinator who taught some
college on the side, she was newly married to Ralph, her husband of
14 years, was playing in tennis tournaments and was running six
miles a day. She liked to design greeting cards and travel, to
Asia, Europe, and the Caribbean. Then one day Levine fell at work,
giving rise to the lumbar disc problem that sent her into bed for
two years. ``That's when I learned the coping skills, the survival
skills that helped me face the cancer,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Keys to coping with the back injury included tuning in to her
body, undergoing treatment, and taking charge of her healing, as
well as gathering friends for support. ``She has an incredible zest
for life. She cultivates friends as one cultivates flowers,'' says
Margie Stein, a friend of 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the cancer. Levine says she cried all night after her
diagnosis, and passed through the darkness repeating the mantra,
``Let go and let God, let go and let God.''
</P>
<P>
   Pity, she knew, would have gotten her nowhere, but neither would
passivity. ``Of course, there were times when I said, `why me?' but
the answer always came back `why not?' '' she says.
</P>
<P>
   So Levine got to work wrestling the grapefruit-sized tumor
growing inside her. She traveled from Boston to New York to discuss
her options with oncology specialists. The more she learned, the
more she became less of a victim and more of an advocate for her
own treatment and recovery. It was then, Ralph Levine says, that
the couple learned ``the fine line between being assertive and
aggressive with the medical community.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine says she worked with her doctors at Dana-Farber and
Brigham and Women's to design her own protocol, ``modeled from a
procedure developed at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the most resourceful person I know,'' says Ralph, ``and
she doesn't take no for an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Before surgery, Levine prepared to die. She telephoned old
friends to say goodbye. She hired a lawyer to prepare a will. She
threw away diaries, gave away a treasured doll. ``But I never gave
up hope,'' says Levine.
</P>
<P>
   After surgery, Levine learned she was the first patient in
Boston to have had interpleural chemo drugs poured into her chest
during lung surgery. It was the kind of aggressive treatment many
would not survive.
</P>
<P>
   Levine not only survived, she thrived. By combining aggressive
medical treatment with holistic techniques like acupuncture, diet,
meditation, and visualization tapes made using her voice, Levine
convalesced and eventually recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very aware that I am one in a million. Sometimes, I'll be
walking along the beach and I ask myself, `Why am I alive?' The
answer is `because I haven't fulfilled my purpose yet, spreading
the light and the healing to others,' '' she says.
</P>
<P>
   How does Levine live these days? ``Striving for balance between
work and play, joy and pain, service to others and giving to
oneself, movement and rest,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She splits her time living between her city apartment and a
house on Cape Cod, whose backyard gardens lead to the marshes of
Weir Creek in West Dennis. The Cape house is very important to her,
she says, because she and Ralph, an accountant, love to garden. ``I
need a balance of water, skies, trees, and fresh air,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Levine credits part of her recovery to being able to
return to Cape Cod and the ocean during her illness. After every
cancer treatment, Levine picnicked by the sea. If weather made that
impossible, she ate at a restaurant with an ocean view. Levine and
Stein laugh as they recall the day six months after Levine got out
of the hospital when they picnicked on the snowcapped dunes of a
Cape beach. ``It was five below zero, but we brought our beach
chairs,'' says Levine. ``We laughed and laughed,'' says Stein.
</P>
<P>
   Levine chairs the Boston chapter of the worldwide Institute of
Noetic Sciences. Founded by astronaut Edgar Mitchell after a
mystical experience on the way back to Earth from the moon, Levine
says the institute studies scientifically documented research and
education on human consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Hepner Brody has been a friend for 20 years. She says
the illness changed Levine because it made her more vulnerable to
others. Whether it was allowing friends to help clean her house or
sharing such traumas as losing her hair during chemotherapy, Levine
was forced to accept the unconditional love of friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone knows they are accepted totally for themselves
and as they are, it reshapes them,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Levine's doctors are delighted with her health and outlook.
``The most important thing you can do for cancer patients is to let
them know appropriately that there is hope. When you have a Margie
Levine around, who's had the problem and faced it, you can say to
the next patient, `There is hope,' '' says Sugarbaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``She defied the odds,'' says Dr. Karen Chayte-Marcus, a
radiology oncologist at Dana-Farber. ``It's wonderful that she
offers hope to others. For a cancer patient, having someone who has
been through it is an incredible inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Levine, ``There is a divine plan for each of us. I believe
I am alive because I am supposed to be doing this work.''

JONATHAN HARR: STILL GETTING USED TO FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHAMPTON, Mass. _ Several months ago, Jonathan Harr was
channel-surfing one afternoon when who should pop up on his
television screen but actor Robert Duvall.
</P>
<P>
   Duvall, whose film ``The Apostle'' had just come out, was being
asked by interviewer Charlie Rose about current projects. Duvall
replied that he was filming a legal melodrama based on the
bestselling book ``A Civil Action.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Oh,' says Rose, `you mean that one about the cancer cases
written by. . . . by . . . ' '' Harr recalls. ``And Duvall goes,
`Yeah, right, the book by . . . by . . . geez, I can't think of the
writer's name.' They're both fumbling around while I'm sitting
there screaming at the set, `The name, guys. What's my name?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the sweet anonymity of authorship, Hollywood-style. Harr of
course lost much of his professional anonymity back in 1995, when,
after nine years of monkish labor and financial uncertainty, his
book about the Woburn, Mass. toxic-waste case was published by
Random House, to near universal acclaim. At the time, Harr was
hoping to earn back his $80,000 advance and maybe enough extra cash
to fix a leak in his roof.
</P>
<P>
   Two years of runaway hardcover sales and more than a million
paperback copies later, the 50-year-old Harr is instead living out
a dream that would strike most first-time authors as pure fantasy.
The flip side of a chemical-spill nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to describe the sensation,'' he acknowledges,
sitting recently in the living room of his rambling Victorian-style
house, a few blocks from downtown Northampton.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the frenzied bidding for the film rights to his
book, Harr observes, ``This has not all been unalloyed joy. It's
scary. I've felt exposed by all the publicity. I've asked myself,
what does all this mean? What will the fallout be?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had done a pretty good job on the book, but being
suddenly in the spotlight made me wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaning forward in a leather chair, Harr says with quiet
intensity, ``I'm actually glad I did not have this kind of success
in my 20s or 30s. I never could have handled it. It still doesn't
feel quite real.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgive him for pinching himself, but this is one dream that
won't seem to quit. Harr, who needed a speech coach to make it
through his first transcontinental book tour, is now on speaking
terms with literati and glitterati on both coasts, from Tina Brown
to John Travolta.
</P>
<P>
   Film rights to his book sold to Robert Redford's production
company for a cool $1.25 million. A major motion picture version of
``A Civil Action'' is now in release, generating Oscar-friendly
reviews. Harr parted ways with his former agent and signed on with
superagent Andrew Wylie, whom he impishly refers to as ``the
barbarian at the gate.''
</P>
<P>
   Investment specialists call the Harr house day and night (Harr
refuses to unlist his phone number _ on principle, he says). He and
his wife, Diane, a part-time teacher at Smith College, recently
completed house renovations so lavish that the $300,000 makeover
was featured in the House &AMP; Home section of The New York Times.
Both Harrs are avid cooks, by the way, and now have a kitchen
worthy of their enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Still working on a three-piece contract he signed with the New
Yorker in 1994, Harr is also shopping around for a new book
project, which he plans to have finalized by early spring. He says
he is leaning away from covering another legal case _ been there,
done that _ and toward an area like cutting-edge medical research.
Whatever subject he chooses next, two things seem certain. One,
Harr will demand total access to the real-life players involved.
And two, bidding on the book will start at an ample six figures and
skew upward from there.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, to the author's delight, ``A Civil Action'' has
become a standard textbook at law schools across the country, where
Harr, who never formally studied legal theory, is suddenly hotter
than William Rehnquist and John Grisham combined.
</P>
<P>
   Each new twist to what Harr describes as a ``once-in-a lifetime
experience'' compounds the amazement of a once-struggling writer
who managed to produce one of the big nonfiction books of the
1990s. If the Woburn case were Mount Everest (in many ways an apt
analogy), then Harr would be its Jon Krakauer, climbing into thin
air against difficult odds and ultimately to the pinnacle of his
profession.
</P>
<P>
   How dizzying has the ascent been? Harr recalls a pre-publication
lunch in Manhattan with Harry Evans, then the top man at Random
House. Evans predicted that Harr's book would sell 400,000 copies,
a jaw-dropping number for any publisher to throw around. He then
asked Harr what else he was working on (apparently Evans had no
trouble remembering his author's name). Harr replied that he was
writing a New Yorker piece about the National Transportation and
Safety Board. The only hitch, said Harr, was that while editor Tina
Brown (who happens to be Evans's wife) wanted 5,000 words, he had
already written 15,000 words _ and was not finished yet.
</P>
<P>
   Evans summoned for a telephone and, according to Harr, promised
to ``take care of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Harr with a laugh, ``The next day I get a call from my
editor at the magazine saying, `Listen Jon, is there some problem
here?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB piece, needless to say, ran at triple the assigned
length. Harr is currently 16,000 words into another New Yorker
piece, this one a profile of a black lawyer from Florida who has
risen from humble beginnings (his parents were migrant farm
workers) to become one of the country's most successful
personal-injury attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``My last lawyer story,'' promises Harr, who despite Brown's
departure has been assured by New Yorker editor David Remnick that
his deal with the magazine is alive and well.
</P>
<P>
   So too is Harr's admiration for Steve Zaillian's film. Unlike
crusading attorney Jan Schlictmann (portrayed by Travolta), Harr
was not a paid consultant on the project. Nevertheless, Harr says,
he developed a close relationship with Zaillian, who wrote the
screenplay and sought Harr's advice on the arc of the story. Like
the book, the film faced a formidable task in boiling down years of
complex legal maneuvering into a compelling and coherent story
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Steve cut out of earlier versions was mostly confusion,''
says Harr, who has seen at least three versions during the final
editing stages of the film. ``I was prepared to say all the right
and diplomatic things about the movie, but after the first couple
of minutes I forgot about the story and my book and was completely
hooked by the performances.''
</P>
<P>
   His warm feelings notwithstanding, this week's (Jan. 6) release
of ``A Civil Action'' thrusts Harr back into a spotlight that has
often made him uncomfortable. News accounts of million-dollar film
deals and squabbles over rights to the Woburn families' stories
have pained Harr, who has maintained close ties to many of the
families. At one point he told the film's producers that he would
not involve himself in negotiations with the families. Years ago he
took a similar stance with Schlictmann and his law partners,
informing them that he would only do the book if he had full access
to, and control over, the Woburn story.
</P>
<P>
   As Harr explains it, drawing the line at who could profit from
the book was not only just, given the years he labored on it
without promise of much reward, and because his reporting depended
on that arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, say, the Woburn families had an interest in it,'' says
Harr, ``how would Jerry Facher'' _ the Beatrice Foods attorney
portrayed by Duvall _ ``feel about sitting down and talking to
me?'' Harr adds that he makes a distinction between the book and
movie (for which the Woburn families were paid an undisclosed
rights fee by Disney) because ``although the movie arises from my
book, it is not my thing. I've already done my thing.''
</P>
<P>
   What most amazed Harr about watching ``A Civil Action'' being
filmed, he continues, was seeing the Woburn case come full circle
in a sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was this thing that had once employed dozens, maybe
hundreds of people,'' says Harr, ``and then gotten to the point
where only one person was interested in it _ me _ suddenly, after
going into the dustbin of history, started employing hundreds of
people again. I found that quite extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, ``being the author of a bestseller is not
like being a movie star,'' says Harr. ``I can walk down the streets
of my hometown and nobody recognizes me.''
</P>
<P>
   Harr seems grateful for, as well as protective of, whatever
anonymity he has left. For successful writers in this
show-me-the-money culture, that's may be the hardest act of all.
Even harder than laboring for nine years on a book that could have
bombed at the box office and left Harr working at Burger King.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I never try to talk to writer friends about is
money,'' says Harr. ``Money is not what's important anyway. What's
important is the work. I believe that. I really do.''

IT'S MEETING TIME FOR THE PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Evaluation week is upon us, and a few
sessions between Bobby Grier, Robert Kraft, and certain Patriots
coaches and players may not be flattering to head coach Pete
Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Tackle Bruce Armstrong left the Foxboro Stadium parking lot
Monday without speaking to reporters, but he did have a sitdown
with Grier, the team's vice president of player personnel, and
Kraft, the owner. The subject was Armstrong's take on the season,
including Carroll's handling of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who was returning to his home in Alpharetta, Ga., is
one of the key veterans who has the ear of the front office and he
is not said to be one of Carroll's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran has a strong relationship with Kraft and Grier, and
his opinions are valued. Armstrong was one of the Patriots who
joined Kraft at a Connecticut rally to celebrate the move to
Hartford. He also does appearances and functions on behalf of the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong and quarterback Drew Bledsoe were the two veteran
players who addressed the team immediately following last Sunday's
25-10 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars that ended New England's
season.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, who is a Carroll supporter, also has met with the front
office, and strength and conditioning coach Johnny Parker is due in
shortly to discuss, he said, ``a number of things involving a lot
of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker, who ran the Patriots' program under Bill Parcells for
four years in which the team had the fewest injuries in the league,
is trying to pick up the pieces of a season in which 16 starters
missed game time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to do a better job,'' said Parker. ``This is a
bottom-line league. All anyone wants to know on Monday is, `Did you
win or did you lose? ''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the rash of injuries might have been just bad
luck, Parker said, ``I don't believe in luck. You mean, we had a
four-year run of luck? If that's the case, some of that luck is
down the road in Long Island.''
</P>
<P>
   According to one player, Parker hasn't had the complete
authority under Carroll that he did under Parcells. Parker chose to
stay in Foxborough when Parcells left because he wanted to keep
living in the area. He signed a mulityear deal, believed to be for
about seven years, and in fact was under contract before the
Patriots named Carroll coach.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, who is as tough as a drill sergeant, blames himself for
not getting a total commitment from the players to his offseason
program. Asked whether the Patriots were a well-conditioned team,
he said, ``Any team that has this many injuries couldn't be a
well-conditioned team.''
</P>
<P>
   While the team does a lot of conditioning work during the
season, Parker said, ``If you don't pay the price in the offseason,
it's too late by the start of training camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker said the core of his program has remained intact, though
he adds new wrinkles every year. Last winter, he introduced
sandbags into the routines, which helped players with the shifting
of weight they experience in games. Parker has more new wrinkles
planned for this offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a number of ideas that I'll discuss with Coach Grier
and the head coach,'' said Parker.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he was dissatisfied with the conditioning of
players such as Terry Glenn, Parker said, ``First of all, people
shouldn't point fingers at Terry. It's our job to get him here.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker is certainly open to players seeking their own
conditioning routines. Ty Law, for example, worked in the offseason
in St. Louis with Bob Kersee on his speed and running. He got
himself into track shape and became one of the best corners in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said of Armstrong, ``He's never shown up but he's been to
six Pro Bowls. I know that he's working out today.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker wouldn't say exactly when he would meet with the front
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will come shortly,'' he said. ``Right now they have bigger
fish to fry.''

GROWTH SHOULD SLOW, BUT THE FUTURE IS UNCLEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For all their cool rationality, most economists
trying to divine where America is headed in 1999 rely on a
thoroughly unscientific proposition in their latest forecasts _ the
nation can't possibly continue to spiral upward without hitting
some kind of substantial glitch.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, both the economy and the stock market managed such
skyward climbs in 1998. And true enough, the policymaker most
responsible for maintaining their rising trajectories, Federal
Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, still has plenty of maneuvering
room to keep the good times going.
</P>
<P>
   But for another whole year?
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy has gotten so good it can't possibly stay this
way,'' said David A. Wyss, chief economist with Standard &AMP; Poor's
DRI in Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   So why don't forecasters simply declare that the good times will
finally come to a close in 1999? The reason is that the traditional
killer of expansions, inflation, is nowhere to be found. And the
country has survived a string of other ailments over the last year
_ from Monicagate to a near- meltdown in financial markets _ that
in any other time would have snuffed out growth.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, the lesson of 1998 seems to be that the US
economy can take a licking and keep on ticking _ perhaps
indefinitely. That has seemed especially so in recent weeks when a
combination of President Clinton's impeachment and a
US-orchestrated attack on Iraq led many to predict that the stock
market would tumble while oil prices leaped. The very opposite
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the economy's top-line numbers, they look
spectacular,'' said Mark M. Zandi, chief economist with Regional
Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. ``It's only when you look
below the surface that you begin to see the cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   The cracks in this case are slowing corporate profits, consumer
spending that outstrips income, a downturn among the nation's
manufacturers and continued instability overseas. Most analysts
agree that these trends spell slower growth in 1999 and a greater
risk than at any time in recent years of something worse occurring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm truly in awe of the economy's performance'' in 1998, said
Maureen F. Allyn, chief economist of Scudder Kemper Investments
Inc. in New York, ``but there is a lot of potential for getting
whipsawed'' this year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, a dozen economists interviewed in recent weeks
predicted that the nation will grow about 2 percent from the fourth
quarter of 1998 through the fourth quarter of this year. That is
considerably slower than the approximately 3.7 percent rate at
which the economy expanded last year. Still, it is growth, not
contraction, and would push the 1990s boom to within shouting
distance of becoming the longest expansion in US history.
</P>
<P>
   But what a wild ride the last year has been! And what a wild
ride this one could be!
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts began 1998 convinced that the Asian crisis would
finally slow America's sunny economy by damaging the markets for
its exports. But the crisis also directed a flood of foreign
capital into this country, driving interest rates down, consumer
spending up, and US stocks through the roof. The resulting
headiness lasted until mid-summer, when Russia abruptly devalued it
currency and defaulted on its foreign debt. By all rights, the
Russian debt default should have been a minor event. In economic
terms, the country was no bigger than the Netherlands, and by the
time of its implosion, most of the developed world had weathered
worse and still prospered.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the US stock market chugged upward throughout the first
half of the year despite riots in the Far East and rising warnings
about corporate profits. And even when it faltered in mid-July, its
long-anticipated correction was extremely well-tempered. The Dow
Jones industrial average, which had risen more than 25 percent from
mid-January, gave back less than half that gain by mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia became the first of two economic cotter pins for
1998, pivots around which other events turned. The Russian crisis
played on Americans' fear they had paid too much for their US
stocks and had come to rely too heavily on the rest of the world
remaking itself in America's economic image.
</P>
<P>
   In short order, economic euphoria gave way to fear. The Dow and
other major market measures fell sharply enough to meet the
definition of a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   The panic reached a crescendo in mid-September, when the
goverment revealed it had orchestrated the bailout of an obscure
firm called Long-Term Capital Management out of fear that collapse
of the Greenwich, Conn.-based investment fund might bring down the
entire global financial system.
</P>
<P>
   At this juncture, the second of the year's cotter-pin events
occurred _ Greenspan and the Fed began cutting interest rates .
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the chairman's finest hour,'' said David M. Jones,
chief economist of Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed will do whatever it takes to keep this economy on
track,'' predicted Richard D. Rippe, chief economist of Prudential
Securities, also in New York.
</P>
<P>
   To understand how unusual the Fed's fall rate cuts were, it is
necessary to remember that, until their announcement, the central
bank had been single-mindedly dedicated to fighting inflation. And
although prices have barely budged in recent years, the
unemployment rate has dropped to an almost 30-year low, a move that
until recently would have been considered the first step toward
higher wages and prices.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of how difficult the Fed's job of managing the economy
is likely to be in the coming year, one need only notice two
results of its rate cuts _ a stock market recovery that has sent
share prices back above levels that Greenspan had suggested were
insupportable and the continuation of a consumer
borrowing-and-buying binge that had previously worried the central
bank.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the most debated statistic of the holiday season may
have been a Commerce Department finding that US household savings
have dropped from a vaguely-acceptable 6 percent of income in 1993
to negative territory. Some analysts dismiss the figure as a
statistical aberration. But others say it illustrates how
vulnerable the economy is to trouble, especially given that
consumer spending has been the mainstay of growth for more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system has taken on a degree of leverage that's
worrisome,'' said Scudder Kemper's Allyn. ``It's like walking
across a sidewalk crack in platform shoes: A little tip can turn
into a very big tilt.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, pessimistic forecasters predict that the economy will
slow to a crawl this year as profit-squeezed companies trim capital
spending and lay off workers, and as tapped-out consumers finally
put away their wallets.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, optimists believe that the nation is in for more
growth, and they discount the danger of serious trouble. ``This
economy is so strong it can absorb all but the most dramatic
shocks,'' said Conference Board chief economist Gail D. Fosler,
whose 3 percent-plus growth forecast for the year is among the most
bullish of any mainstream analyst.
</P>
<P>
   But even Fosler agreed that with an impeachment trial of
President Clinton, the risk of another Russia-like financial
catastrophe, and perhaps even mounting worries about the year-end
Y2K computer problem , 1999 may serve up as many shocks as 1998
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certainly some candidates out there for the kind of
event that causes people to say `Whoa, the world is a very
different place than I thought it was,' '' she conceded. Different
enough, indeed, that they stop spending and investing as much as
they have, steps that could make 1999 a very different _ and
considerly darker _ year than the one just ended.

TAINTED BLOOD MAY HAVE INFECTED THOUSANDS WITH HEPATITIS C 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Tainted blood may have infected thousands of
people in Texas with hepatitis C, according to the medical director
of the South Texas Blood and Tissue Center, which distributed the
blood.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 3,000 people who got blood or blood-related products
from the center from 1988 to 1992 are being notified by letter that
they may have been contaminated with hepatitis C and should be
tested for the virus, said Dr. Norman Kalmin, the center's
president and medical director.
</P>
<P>
   Since symptoms can take 20 years to surface, people infected
with the virus are often unaware until years later.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 4 million people in the United States are infected with
hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say that the disease can be managed with medication and
lifestyle changes.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Congress ordered U.S. blood banks to notify people who
received blood transfusions before 1992, when reliable tests became
available to detect hepatitis C, which was first identified in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis C is considered the most serious of the hepatitis
viruses, which include A, B and D.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis C is most often spread by contact with blood through
such means as intravenous drug use, blood transfusions,
self-inflicted tattoos and body piercing, and sex with multiple
partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easily transmitted,'' said Dr. Fernando Guerra, the
health director for the city of San Antonio. He added that people
who live with a person who has hepatitis C can avoid infection by
taking measures such as not sharing razors or toothbrushes.
</P>
<P>
   Guerra also assured the public San Antonio's current blood
supply is safe.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Victor Ostrower, who served on a hepatitis C working group,
said anyone diagnosed with the virus shouldn't drink alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two really don't mix very well,'' Ostrower said,
explaining that hepatitis C can damage the liver seriously over
time without alcohol. ``Alcohol is not just an additive. It's more
like an accelerant.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalmin revealed Tuesday afternoon during a news conference at a
health district clinic that the local blood supply may have been
partially tainted as recently as 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Before that year, blood, plasma and platelets from donors
couldn't be screened effectively for hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   Since that time, some of the center's previous donors have
tested positive for the virus, Kalmin said, adding that residents
who got blood or blood-related products from those donors may have
been infected.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the implication,'' said Kalmin, part of a 15-member
team of public and private medical professionals that's worked for
the past six months to forge a local plan to halt the problem.

DRINKING: A BORING STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you know that awful feeling, when a drunk sits down next to
you at dinner and just won't shut up? Or worse yet, when a
recovering alcoholic plants himself and starts expatiating on the
virtues of Virgin Marys? Now you know what it's like to read ``Note
Found in a Bottle: My Life as a Drinker,'' the despicable, wooden
memoir just out from Susan Cheever.
</P>
<P>
   There's money in these loser/boozer screeds, as Pete (``A
Drinking Life'') Hamill and Caroline (``Drinking: A Love Story'')
Knapp can attest. But will there be any money left for John
Cheever's little girl? Or has the reading public sobered up on this
woozy category?
</P>
<P>
   What's hateful about this book? Where to begin? The entire
premise, that alcohol prompted Cheever to become a depressive,
serial adulteress who unsurprisingly failed at three marriages,
rings false. The inescapable conclusion of ``Note'' is that Cheever
is a horrible person, engorged with self-regard, who has been
masticating the corpse of her dead, successful father for fun and
profit. Not much fun perhaps; then mainly for profit.
</P>
<P>
   Her 1984 tome, ``Home Before Dark,'' juicily aired out her
family's dirty laundry, including Daddy's homosexual flings,
drunkenness, and feelings of social inadequacy. Her father had been
dead just two years; how odd that some family members, including
her mother, voiced reservations. (``My mother is no one,'' Cheever
said in a 1994 Globe interview. ``She's not a mother, and she's not
a writer. I'm everyone.'') In ``Note,'' the third memoir of her
brief life, the 50-something Cheever invokes Papa John both at
random and at length. A generous excerpt from one of her father's
stories proves to be the best writing in this book.
</P>
<P>
   OK, drunks do bad things, but why does Cheever, supposedly now
sober, drag otherwise unsullied reputations through her miasma of
boozy licentiousness? I wonder how biographer Robert Massie, New
Yorker writer Calvin Tomkins, and Ramparts founder Warren Hinckle
feel about being named as the three men Ms. Cheever bedded on one
particular day way back when? Here's another hilarious anecdote:
Cheever and a pal once sent William Styron a box of dog feces after
he published a displeasing review.
</P>
<P>
   Name-dropping abounds, and it is sickening to see Julia Child,
Joan Didion, Francis Coppola, and about a dozen others sucked into
the sewer of Cheever's existence. At least Knapp humiliated her
friends privately, by disguising their names. ``Where the ethics of
life and the ethics of art converge,'' Cheever once said, ``That's
where I live.'' Well, there goes the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In a book swollen with narcissism, ``Note'' introduces
meta-narcissisms that redefine the genre. Like every tiresome
boomer hack, Cheever wants you to know she really, really loves her
children. Indeed, on Page 163, she tells us she ``would have died
for Sarah,'' her newborn daughter. Yet on the next page she's
skipping off to Havana for a week with her lover, leaving Sarah,
afflicted with chicken pox, in the care of her father. ``In my
heart I was reenacting a separation of mother and daughter that
resonated from before I could remember,'' Cheever writes. Does
anyone know what she's talking about?
</P>
<P>
   Cheever keeps telling you how pretty she is, a subject on which
reasonable people can disagree. (I used to work in the same office
as she.) Then she tells you, more than once, how she's mastered the
craft of writing. But there's plenty of evidence to the contrary.
In my borrowed copy of ``Note,'' Cheever blathers on about the
French mistral ``turning the leaves of the poplar over and
flattening the mimosa against the rich Provencal earth.'' This is
where the previous owner of my book scrawled in the margin: ``Look,
Ma! I'm writing.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst part of it is _ and you knew this was coming _ that
Cheever has found God. I have never felt so sorry for God in my
life. Gilbey's; God; what's the next enthusiasm? Gorgonzola? In her
final chapter, Cheever writes, ``It seems as though my belief in
God should take up more space in this book, but it is intensely
private and truly beyond my ability to describe.'' And the reader
thinks: If only she felt this way about sex, or about drinking, or
about her father, the world would be a less ugly place.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The great thing about ``A Civil Action'' is that it plays like
real life, with all its messiness and complication, and not like
the Hollywood movie it is. Packing nine years of legal battling
into two hours, it recounts the tortuous chronicle of eight
working-class families in Woburn, Mass. who hired a flashy
personal-injury lawyer to take on two giant corporations they
accused of dumping carcinogenic chemicals into their well water,
causing leukemias that killed their children. One reason it's the
most compelling legal thriller of the decade is its avoidance of
the cliched courtroom heroics, the clear-cut events and the ringing
triumphs of the usual Hollywood legal excursion.
</P>
<P>
   In short, writer-director Steven Zaillian has respected the real
events grippingly described in Jonathan Harr's landmark book. In
turn, the real-life story imparts to ``A Civil Action'' an impact
that few films in any genre can come anywhere near. Filmed with
grave clarity, somber and monochromatic, unafraid of assuming a
mournful tone, it's built around something of an antihero. As
played by John Travolta, attorney Jan Schlichtmann is arrogant and
materialistic. When finally prodded into a response by the
importuning Woburn families he had put off for months, he's about
to write them off forever when his Porsche is stopped for speeding
on a bridge and he notices lots of foam on the river flowing under
it.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued enough to soil his Bally shoes, he traces the
effluents back to an old tannery. Where the anguished Woburn
families see the contaminated river as a toxic swamp, Travolta's
Schlichtmann sees it as a gold mine when he notices the W. R. Grace
name on a dumpster. Flush from lucrative personal injury
settlements, he can't resist taking on a couple of deep-pockets
antagonists he blames for the mess, Grace and Beatrice Foods. In
short, he goes into it for the money, beginning with a speech about
how much better a job he can do if he remains emotionally
uninvolved. Before it's over, of course, he's involved to the max.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in ``A Civil Action'' is simple, including
Schlichtmann's motivations. Even when he decides to go the distance
no matter what, even when he finds himself outgunned, we feel him
at least as much driven by hubris as idealism. He may be on the
side of the angels, but it isn't angelic behavior that gets him
there. In the end, he gambles everything he owns on taking the case
to the limit, and it isn't an easy case. He must first prove that
the companies dumped the toxins, then prove the toxins entered the
drinking water by seeping into and contaminating nearby wells, then
prove they caused the fatal illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to learn that workers at the tannery used to call
the site in question ``the swimming pool.'' It's another to find
witnesses willing to testify, especially when the families realize
that the case has taken on a life of its own and that legal
procedures can take precedence over a search for truth. As
Schlichtmann, Travolta is mesmerizingly chameleon-like, never
glossing over the flaws, exposing character weaknesses, sometimes
even making them seem sympathetic and humanizing, as when we feel
him squirm inside when some high-powered adversaries remind him
what a small-time ambulance chaser he is in their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   A large part of his well-heeled opponents' tactics consists of
wearing him down, throwing up procedural roadblocks in court,
finding ways to exclude evidence and witnesses unfavorable to them,
and using Schlichtmann's impatience against him, especially when it
becomes apparent that John Lithgow's vinegary and imperious
presiding judge doesn't like his style. Zaillianand his cast allow
a pall of desperation and despair to settle over Travolta's
Schlichtmann and his law partners and their panicky accountant,
played with unexpected humor by William H. Macy.
</P>
<P>
   The acting is keenly incisive, starting with Travolta's superbly
shaded Schlichtmann, in whose gradual and subtle transformation
from cockiness to compassion we believe. Between ``Primary Colors''
and now this film, it becomes indisputably clear that Travolta has
moved from being one kind of movie star _ pop culture icon _ to
another _ mature character actor. As the wiliest and deftest of his
courtrooom opponents, Jerome Facher, Robert Duvall delivers what in
most cases would be a film-stealing performance, playing on
Facher's eccentricities with delicious virtuosity. Tony Shalhoub
and Zeljko Ivanek are convincing as law partners caught up in
Schlichtmann's increasingly erratic gravitational pull. And Sydney
Pollack is droll as an opponent expert at reminding Schlichtmann of
his social shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Civil Action'' (filmed at several Boston-area sites, but
not, ironically, Woburn, which had changed too much to be used)
also reproduces _ perhaps too realistically for some _ the sense of
fearful drift felt by professionals who feel their case is slipping
beyond their control. But the film is admirable precisely because
it flies in the face of what's considered conventionally commercial
in a courtroom drama. Almost all of the interesting things here
take place outside the courtroom, and they register as
intelligently and as incisively as we would expect from the writer
of ``Schindler's List,'' ``Awakenings,'' and ``Searching for Bobby
Fischer.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaillian realizes that the strength of his film ultimately
derives from the weight of decency and rightness conveyed by the
presence of the Woburn residents. These portrayals, especially
those of Kathleen Quinlan as Anne Anderson, instrumental in
initiating the suit; David Thornton as Richard Aufiero, muffling
his grief at the loss of his son; and James Gandolfini, as the
worker who finds the courage to go public, are, ultimately, the
source of the film's authority. ``A Civil Action'' is a film that
matters.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL WAS A GO THIS TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Somehow it all worked out. After a season's worth
of fretting and grumbling about the way things were done and the
way things weren't done, college football got it right.
</P>
<P>
   The best team is the national champion. No questions. No
controversy. Clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I'm sure you'll hear some muttering in Columbus, Ohio, and
maybe out in Madison, Wis., or down the road in Tucson, from the
people who felt their teams _ Ohio State, Wisconsin, Arizona _
deserved consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Sure they do. And perhaps one of those teams would have emerged
as national champion in a traditional playoff format. Maybe they
deserved the chance to compete for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the system that is in place. What happened Monday
night in the Fiesta Bowl _ when No. 1 Tennessee beat No. 2 Florida
State, 23-16 _ was college football the way it is in 1999 and the
way it will be in the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers won a game that was much better in the second
half than in the first, for those of you who bailed out midway
through the nearly four-hour marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Was it a classic? Hardly. Too many penalties (12 by Florida
State, 9 by Tennessee). Too sloppy. Too many false starts, fumbles.
It looked more like a game from early September than early January.
</P>
<P>
   Both Tennessee coach Phil Fulmer and Florida State coach Bobby
Bowden conceded that the layoff _ 45 days for FSU _ was probably
too long. But that's the way the system works.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that college football staged its first
unified national championship game, and it worked.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee finished 13-0, the best record in the school's long
and storied football history. It won its first national
championship in 47 years.
</P>
<P>
   Are the Vols the nation's best team? Probably. But who really
knows? As Fulmer said at Tuesday's final Fiesta Bowl press
conference, ``All we had to be was the best team on 13 different
game days. And we were.''
</P>
<P>
   So they were. They overcame injuries. They handled the
competition from teams such as Florida and Georgia in their own
conference. They had some luck. They also had some toughness.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State, which finished off another superb season at 10-2,
was a 5-point favorite in the Fiesta Bowl and took the Vols to the
final minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in here as underdogs,'' said Fulmer. ``And that's the
way we liked it. It was a challenge to us, and this team has met
every challenge presented to it since spring practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's championship should not come as a stunner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectations at Tennessee are always high,'' said Fulmer.
``And they should be. You should be able to win at Tennessee.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vols' problem is that they have had a tough time winning
their own division in the Southeastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we would have gotten out of the East a few times in the
past couple of years, we might have had a chance to win two or
three more of these,'' said Fulmer.
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, Fulmer added that he still favors a playoff
system. He knows that the fates turned his way and allowed him to
compete for the national championship in a 1-vs.-2 game. He easily
could have been in the position of an Ohio State or Arizona _ with
only one narrow loss keeping him from the opportunity of playing
for the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd still like to see a playoff,'' said Fulmer. ``I don't have
the answers to how it could work, but I'd like to see something
work out.''
</P>
<P>
   But having seen the intensity Monday night, seeing bodies
wheeled and helped off the field in the most pressure-filled
setting, you wonder whether a playoff at this level makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   There seems little chance that either Tennessee or Florida State
could have come back in a week or even two weeks and played someone
else for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   They were too banged up, too emotionally spent.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Bowl Championship Series has done its job. It
produced a national championship game in a setting that drew
national attention.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from perfect, and it may not even be fair. But the
best team won.
</P>
<P>
   And no one can really make a strong argument against that.

A `TASTE OF JUDAISM' WHETS AN APPETITE FOR RELIGIOUS INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWTON, Mass. _ Inside a basement lecture room at Temple Beth
Shalom here, Rabbi Rifat Sonsino was leading a discussion on a
passage from Deuteronomy focusing on the ethical demands God makes
of Jews.
</P>
<P>
   As Sonsino described the different ways to interpret a passage
that talks about obligations to the poor, someone in the audience
chimes in: ``It always seems like the chapter is never closed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah,'' Sonsino replies. ``That is the story of Judaism . . .
Nothing is black and white. We are always dealing in grays. If it
were black and white I could just e-mail you the information and
you could read it at your leisure.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, some of the roughly 25 students have come to Sonsino's
class after a long day at work precisely because they find appeal
in a religion that does not necessarily offer clear-cut answers to
complex theological questions.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Judaism places a high premium on wrestling with the many
meanings that can be gleaned from the Torah. It is this kind of
rich intellectual inquiry that forms a cornerstone of Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the messages Sonsino is trying to convey during a
two-hour introductory lecture on Jewish ethics. His class is part
of a highly popular introductory program to Judaism offered at
synagogues nationwide that has helped ignite a renaissance in
Jewish religious life.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 14,000 people around the nation have taken ``A Taste of
Judaism'' since the program was started about 4 1/2 years ago by
the Reform branch of American Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've certainly been very pleased with the response,'' said
Kathy Kahn, associate national director for outreach for the Union
of American Hebrew Congregations, the New York group that
represents the country's Reform congregations.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of the first 2,000 people who took the three-week
program showed that two-thirds of the students went on to take more
Jewish educational programs. And nearly 1 out of 5 of those
surveyed ended up joining a synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to reach those Jews who, for whatever reason,
because of negative experiences in their childhood, or because they
are in interfaith relationships, feel they might not be welcome in
a synagogue,'' said Kahn, who helped develop the course, which was
first offered in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to give people a taste and, hopefully, they would be
hungry enough to want the whole meal,'' Kahn added.
</P>
<P>
   At the classes at Temple Beth Shalom, Ruth and Harvey Miller and
Kim Neger represent the two groups of people who are typical of
most students enrolling in ``A Taste of Judaism'' courses across
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Millers, who live in Newton, are Jewish but were never fully
exposed to their faith, were not very active in a synagogue, and
did not practice Judaism at home in any significant way.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Neger, a Natick resident, is not Jewish but her husband is
and they have decided to raise their children as Jews. So Neger
said she felt she needed to start learning about Judaism so she can
help her children.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kahn, ``A Taste of Judaism'' is split about 50-50
between Jews and non-Jews. ``We assumed it would be primarily
people in interfaith relationships but we got a lot of people born
Jews saying, `I feel so ashamed. I have no Jewish education and I
was never brought up with anything formal,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Miller, 78, said she would often attend synagogue services,
but found herself ``just reading the words and realizing that I
wasn't learning anything.'' An advertisement for ``A Taste of
Judaism'' in a weekly community newspaper caught her eye and she
decided to enroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was particularly interested in learning more about the
religion so I could speak more intelligently,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After taking the course, Neger, 41, said she wants to learn more
and plans to enroll in a much more comprehensive introductory class
to Judaism that runs for 18 weeks. ``There is still so much to
learn,'' Neger said, adding that she and her husband are deciding
on which synagogue to join. ``This has been really great.''

<P>
   On Dec. 20, Jews lighted candles in a public space in Girona,

A MASTER OF UNMAWKISH REALISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One long-ago summer day, sculptor Walker Hancock was swimming in
his Gloucester, Mass. quarry with his friend Andrew Wyeth when
Wyeth began to giggle. Why? Hancock wanted to know. ``I was just
thinking that if we were both to drown,'' Wyeth replied, ``it would
be the end of realistic art!''
</P>
<P>
   Hancock, who died at his home Dec. 30, remained a realist
throughout his long career, an heir to the tradition of Augustus
Saint-Gaudens and Daniel Chester French. Arguably the last heir:
Hancock worked in an academic, figurative style now sadly debased.
He kept it alive nearly as long as he lived, swimming against the
tide of abstraction, the dominant current of 20th-century
sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   He was 97 when he passed away, just one year younger than the
century whose great personages, events, and institutions he
translated into bronze or stone. He designed his last great public
monument, a ``Flight Memorial'' for the US Military Academy at West
Point, N.Y., when he was 90. The memorial's lone figure seems on
the verge of ascending to heaven, rising from a base of flames,
arms opening like a flower welcoming the sun. His thigh is
discreetly attached to the base, leaving his feet free, which adds
to the sense that he's airborne. Like those Renaissance depictions
of a St. Sebastian utterly serene despite being shot through with
arrows, Hancock's figure has shed earthly pain.
</P>
<P>
   He has also shed his uniform, a metaphor for leaving life
behind. The generals who descended on Hancock's studio to watch the
work in progress were at first bothered by the nudity, Hancock
later recalled. The artist triumphed in the end, though; anyone who
ever met Hancock could see why. His was a radiant spirit, tactful
yet tenacious, as sculptors who work in the public realm must be in
order to hold their own among architects and bureaucrats. Had
Hancock felt like it, he probably could have persuaded those
generals to lay down their arms and become pacifists.
</P>
<P>
   Prodigies in sculpture are rare; there aren't many Mozart
equivalents. Hancock, who made a model of the Parthenon at age 9
and sculpted little figures to fit its pediment, qualifies. At 18,
he was awarded his first public commission _ for a World War I
memorial for Central High in St. Louis, where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   What brought Hancock to Gloucester in 1920 was Charles Grafly, a
portrait sculptor and the young artist's idol. An attack of shyness
led Hancock to bolt from Grafly's doorstep, but he plucked up his
courage and enrolled in Grafly's class at the Pennsylvania Academy
of Fine Arts shortly after. Eventually, he taught at the school,
even when that meant commuting to Philadelphia from Gloucester.
He'd fallen in love with Cape Ann, with its Finnish community, and
with one Finn in particular, Saima Natti, whom he married.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's head of a Finnish orphan, Toivo Helberg, won the
artist the prestigious Prix de Rome. The somber, solitary child is
``a portrait of innocence alone in the world,'' wrote Timothy
Crouse in the fine catalog of a 1989 Hancock exhibition at the Cape
Ann Historical Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Neither in the head of Toivo, nor in his commissioned monuments,
nor in the many sculptures he made of his own daughter, Deane, does
Hancock display any of the treacly sentimentality that mars so much
other figurative work nowadays. ``There's a tremendous revival of
interest in figurative sculpture,'' Hancock said last summer, ``so
tremendous that there is a lot of extremely poor work being
produced by people who don't know how to do anything but copy what
they see. But you have to design sculpture, compose it. And you
have to avoid mawkishness.''
</P>
<P>
   He did all the above, brilliantly. Perhaps his most majestic
design was for the 36-foot-tall ``Pennsylvania Railroad War
Memorial'' at the 30th Street Station in Philadelphia _ an angel
lifting a fallen soldier out of the flames of war, a perfect
marriage of form and feeling, in perfect sympathy with its
architectural setting. The long vertical feathers of the angel's
wings echo the fluting of the great columns that flank the piece.
Hancock, who worked both in a rounded, naturalistic style and in a
patterned Art Deco mode, began by making the angel's hands flat
horizontals, but eventually gave them an eloquent softness that
presses into the soldier's flesh, giving you a sense of his weight.
</P>
<P>
   The little boy who had sculpted figures for the pediment of his
model of the Parthenon grew up to sculpt the figures for the
pediment of the Postal Service Building in Washington, D.C.,
creating an elaborate allegory of mail by air and sea. Hancock's
public commissions _ including the monumental rhytons standing
guard at Girard College in Philadelphia, the Stone Mountain
Memorial outside Atlanta, figures of presidents and poets _ were
complemented by the many informal, intimately scaled studies he
made, sketches in bronze. While his public pieces often favor
stasis, these smaller figures _ wrestlers, swimmers, basketball
players _ lunge, dive, or whirl nimbly. He let the neighborhood
kids swim in his quarry, and he built them a basketball court on
his property, so he could study their motions. He found, and
captured, the truth in their gestures.
</P>
<P>
   He viewed art as problem-solving, taking on the challenges of
suggesting the ephemeral or even the invisible in bronze and
marble. A highly literate man _ fluent in three languages and an
opera buff _ he consulted Shakespeare when commissioned to create a
depiction of ``Air.'' He chose a line in ``Hamlet'' _ ``This most
excellent canopy, the air . . . this brave o'erhanging firmament''
_ and made a figure that hovers like a canopy over earth.
</P>
<P>
   A fellow Gloucester artist of a younger generation, Ken Hruby,
was a second-year sculpture student when he helped Hancock decide
how best to make a bust of Chief Justice Warren Burger meet its
base. Hancock ``wanted to engage me in the effort and coach me to
the solution,'' Hruby recalls. ``He gave an enormous boost to my
developing skills of observation. He had a generous spirit, a
gentle nature, and great talent. And, above all, there was about
him an aura of grace.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, while there are small works by Hancock sprinkled around
New England, the Boston area has no major public piece by him. The
Cape Ann Historical Museum has on view a group of small Hancock
bronzes. Judith McCulloch, the museum's director and longtime
Hancock friend, praises him for being ``one of those people who was
entirely genuine in his person and in his work. He wasn't just
good; he was whole and consistent.''
</P>

   Hancock works including a model for the ``Pennsylvania Railroad
War Memorial,'' one-third the size of the real thing, are in a show
called ``America's Sculptural Heritage'' at Gloucester City Hall.
The show has been extended through May. The Boston Museum of Fine
Arts owns several small Hancocks, which it plans to put on view in
its study center by early this month. MFA curator Jonathan
Fairbanks, who first met Hancock in 1953, remembers him as ``a shy
person with no chitchat, a profound person.'' Fairbanks recalls
Hancock's calling a Calder mobile a new art form _ but not
sculpture. ``It was admirable,'' Fairbanks feels, ``that in the
face of change he didn't lose his sense of personal direction. He
was a master of classical realism, and he wasn't going to be
diverted by new inventions.''
</P>
<P>
   I met Hancock only once, last summer. Enchanted by a plaster
model I'd seen of the West Point ``Flight Memorial,'' I called to
ask him for an interview. He called back and said, very gently,
that he wasn't sufficiently interesting for me to bother with.
Others intervened on my behalf, and he relented.
</P>
<P>
   So I made the pilgrimage down the dirt road that leads to his
fairytale house with its medieval-looking turret, arbor supported
by slim columns, and massive stone fireplace, a home as elegant as
its occupant. Just steps from the house is the quarry, whose still
waters suggest those in the paintings of an earlier Gloucester
artist, Fitz Hugh Lane.
</P>
<P>
   We spent what was, for me at least, a magical hour: Hancock's
radiance spilled over to those in his presence. He was pale and
slim and wore a beatific smile. He had that translucence that some
people acquire in great old age, like a candle burning itself away
before your eyes _ or like the flames that were a signature in his
sculpture. That's how I think of him _ as one of his own noble
figures, silently rising.

EXAMINING EVIL; ANIMAL MAGNETISM; BRET LOTT'S LOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The romanticization of evil has become an increasingly
disturbing feature of American culture.
</P>
<P>
   What began as a commendable attempt to see the world in all its
gray complexity and ambiguity has gone, in the wrong hands, to
indefensible extremes. Too many filmmakers or writers have applied
a patina of glamour to monstrous crimes, and too many academics
have championed ``wrongly convicted'' sociopaths, secure in the
belief they will never have to live with the consequences of their
words and images.
</P>
<P>
   The evil-is-cool crowd might find it instructive to read the
January issue of The Atlantic Monthly, in which Roger Shattuck
lucidly deconstructs the moral implications of a ``blindness to
history'' that has ``spawned overwhelming state terrorism'' twice
during this century.
</P>
<P>
   Shattuck does so in an intriguing way. Since we absorb our ideas
about evil from what we read and see, he enunciates four categories
of evil and examines the ways they have been filtered into our
consciousness by such authors as Baudelaire, Hawthorne, Pascal,
Emerson, and Nietzsche, along with (vastly) lesser figures like
Quentin Tarantino.
</P>
<P>
   Shattuck is enlightening on the very different ways Dostoevski
and Chekhov wrestled with the concept of evil, and persuasive when
he argues that the movie ``Pulp Fiction'' is ``complicit with the
criminal violence it depicts.'' He argues that Clarence Darrow, in
defending Leopold and Loeb, advanced a line of reasoning devoid of
``any guiding principles of good and evil, sanity and madness,
innocence and guilt.'' Shattuck does not say, because he does not
have to, how that kind of reasoning has corroded our judicial
system today.

<P>
   Birds do it, bees do it, even scorpion flies do it: flirting.
</P>
<P>
   Psychology Today reports that the come-hither glances and body
language of flirtation evolved from our evolutionary ancestors'
need to ``quickly and safely (judge) the value of potential mates''
by gauging their health and reproductive fitness.
</P>
<P>
   Flirting, says writer Joann Ellison Rodgers, is ``wired into
us.'' Like pheasant spurs and lion manes, it is designed ``to
advertise ourselves to the opposite sex.'' It turns out that the
human male's approach to flirting _ studied by psychologists who
``spent months in dimly lit lounges documenting these flirtation
rituals'' _ closely resembles that of a baboon.
</P>
<P>
   That information may not come as news to many women. In fact, as
with a lot of psychological research, some of the findings Rodgers
writes about are not exactly jaw-droppers. For instance, we might
have been able to guess that attractive people have more sex
partners. But there are some intriguing tidbits here. Who knew that
the across-a-crowded-room moment of attraction ``mimics a kind of
brain damage''? And who would have imagined that lookism flourishes
even in the insect world, where scorpion flies choose mates
according to how symmetrical their prospective partners' wings are?
</P>

   Bret Lott enjoyed early success as a writer, publishing two
novels and a short story collection by the time he was 30. Then
Lott began to encounter systematic rejection from publishers _ one
book was turned down 12 times _ and his faith in his ability began
slipping away. Like many another novelist, he began asking himself
the big question: ``Why write at all?''
</P>
<P>
   In Poets &AMP; Writers magazine, Lott describes his journey through
authorial limbo and back to publication. His story may have a happy
ending, but he makes clear exactly why constant rejection can be a
career-ender for writers: because it shakes ``the confidence
necessary to make language new, to step into the void of the blank
page and create.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott writes that ``this deadening of one's gift by learning not
to believe in it is the most dangerous time in the life of the
artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Also worth reading in Poets &AMP; Writers is Dan Wakefield's warm
and perceptive reminiscence of James Baldwin, whom he got to know
in the Greenwich Village of the '50s. Wakefield's assessment of
Baldwin as a writer is enriched by his knowledge of Baldwin as a
man. Baldwin apparently had a lasting effect on those he met: Lott,
too, cites a Baldwin remark as an influence on his writing life.

   Wired takes a close look at Salon, which was launched three
years ago as an on-line magazine focusing on literary culture but
has recently waded into the Washington political wars with gusto.
</P>
<P>
   Salon has been rewarded for its saturation coverage of the
Clinton/Lewinsky story with massive increases in page views. The
Webzine even got denounced by Republican congressmen as a tool of
the Clinton White House when it published the story of the
three-decade-old infidelities of Judiciary Committee chairman Henry
Hyde. Now, luxuriating in the resulting notoriety and limelight,
Salon editor and CEO David Talbot is trying to turn Salon into what
Wired writer Warren St. John calls a ``global media giant.''
</P>
<P>
   St. John paints an intriguing portrait of Talbot as
half-idealist, half-opportunist, a new-media entrepreneur who may
become the William Randolph Hearst of the on-line world, or may
fall victim to the contradictory goals he has established. ``Salon
. . . has become a confusion of impulses _ a high-minded tabloid
that wants respect but needs buzz,'' writes Talbot.

NO GOOD ANSWERS IN THE NBA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Please note players vote was Wednesday, Jan. 6)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You awakened Wednesday on a historic sports morning. Don't waste
your time looking in an almanac for this date's historical
significance. We are talking about current events. We are talking
about history that made in New York City. And we could be asking
ourselves: Where were you the day the NBA killed itself?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but maybe I have been presumptuous. You do remember the NBA,
right? It is the most successful corporate league in the country.
It's the only place you can talk the game without having to prove
you have game. It's where they talk basketball during
teleconferences and in hotel conference rooms while never referring
to an orange sphere, a rim, and a hardwood court.
</P>
<P>
   But I am not here to vent. I am here to answer questions on this
historic date, the day of NBA elections. I am here to tell you how
we got to the point that we are now hearing NBA news from the king
of political scoops, Larry King. I am here to tell you what the
significance is of players going to New York and voting. I am here
to be the Lockout and Beyond Answer Man. Have a seat. Relax. Get
yourself into an NBA state of mind. And hand over the questions . .
.
</P>
<P>
   It's about time. You're too wordy. Enough with all that noise
you're making. I want to know this: Are they going to play
basketball this season or not?
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   Would you care to elaborate on that?
</P>
<P>
   Yes.
</P>
<P>
   OK. Elaborate. Basketball this season?
</P>
<P>
   Heck no.
</P>
<P>
   Why is that?
</P>
<P>
   I am constantly amazed that one side thinks the other is
bluffing. I don't know anybody who bluffs for six months. The
players say the owners are bluffing about canceling the season; the
owners say the players are bluffing about being unified and sitting
out an entire year rather than snatching a piece of a $2 billion
(and growing) pie. In the meantime, the sides continue to stare at
each other. It's like two friends in a restaurant arguing about who
is going to pay the bill. Both figure that somebody will pay it, so
they keep sitting there hoping the other will give in.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA players voted on their future. How do you think the
Celtics voted, assuming most of them made the trip to New York?
</P>
<P>
   I bet it was nearly unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   For or against playing?
</P>
<P>
   For.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics are the youngest team in pro basketball. With the
exception of Pervis Ellison and Dana Barros, those guys have not
been drawing NBA paychecks for a long time. There has been a lot of
talk about union solidarity, but young guys who haven't gotten into
a habit of saving their money tend to feel the pressure of those
bills.
</P>
<P>
   My point exactly. Young guys aren't the only ones. You don't
have to be young to hate missing a paycheck. Don't you think most
of the players will vote in the affirmative?
</P>
<P>
   Yep.
</P>
<P>
   Cool. So I should hook up my DirecTV for the games, right?
</P>
<P>
   Nope. I'm not saying the vote is fixed, but I don't think it has
power. I can't get over the six-month thing: If the feelings of the
little guys in the union were so important, Billy Hunter and
Patrick Ewing could have called for a vote six months ago. Not one
day before the league's ``drop-dead'' date. If the majority votes
to play, that doesn't mean the lockout is lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Why is ``drop dead'' in quotes?
</P>
<P>
   Because it's not a genuine phrase. The league's first so-called
drop-dead date was Thanksgiving. And then there was Christmas. Now
it's Jan. 7. If they say there will be no basketball, they can
still play.
</P>
<P>
   NBA killing itself? Don't you think that's a bit overstated?
</P>
<P>
   Nope. If the owners cancel the season, the NBA will never
recover. Not in five years. Not in 10 years. Not in 20 years. It
will be a league for our subconscious. Guaranteed. The NBA is not
part of American sports ritual like baseball or football. Those
sports are made for television. The NBA exploded into a television
sport only because it was marketed that way. How do you market a
lockout and no Michael Jordan? Many of the league's most loyal
supporters watch tons of games without spending a dime, which is
also to say they watch at home.
</P>
<P>
   You're crazy. David Stern said there will be basketball in
1999-2000, no matter what. And there are always great players to
see. What about that?
</P>
<P>
   Yep. There were great players in the 1960s and 1970s, too. But
ask the great Bill Russell how many people watched his
non-marketed, non-gimmicked games.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about the '99-00 season. What about that?
</P>
<P>
   I heard the commissioner mention replacement players.
</P>
<P>
   So?
</P>
<P>
   So maybe I should quit this job, go to Merrimac Street, and try
to become the next Tyus Edney. Scab Celtics? Please. It's amazing
how people are for the commoner in their own lives but take a
pro-management view when it comes to pro sports.
</P>
<P>
   Hey. Do you think Rick Pitino would call you his best point
guard and then waive you the next week?
</P>
<P>
   I don't know. But I do know that if a team of replacement
Celtics won a championship and a banner was raised next to the
other 16, I would go on a hunger strike outside the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to think about that. You're already too skinny. If
they do play basketball again, whom will the Celtics sign as a free
agent?
</P>
<P>
   They really like Matt Geiger.
</P>
<P>
   Nooo! Why?
</P>
<P>
   As one member of the team said, are the Celtics a better team
with Andrew DeClercq at center or Matt Geiger?
</P>
<P>
   I'm psyched. So we'll have basketball in about a month?
</P>
<P>
   No. Not until October.
</P>
<P>
   I don't agree with anything you say. But whom do you blame for
the lockout?
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll. He's being blamed for everything else, so why not
this?
</P>

EXPORTERS HAIL THE ARRIVAL OF THE EURO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aided by Europe's new single currency, Quaker Fabric Corp.'s
brocades, twills, and chenilles may one day cover as many couches
on the continent as they now do in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Exports to European furniture makers currently represent a
sliver of the sales of upholstery fabrics woven at the company's
Fall River mill, which supplies Broyhill, Ethan Allen, and other
American furniture makers.
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Liebenow views conversion to a single currency, the
euro, as a boon to Quaker Fabric's ability to compete aggressively
with European textile companies on their turf. With a common
currency upon which to value products, the company will be able to
zero in on competitive local prices for its wares, whether selling
in Austria or Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The bustle surrounding the biggest currency conversion ever
seems to have barely rippled on US shores. In truth, American
exporters like Quaker Fabric have been grappling for months with
how to respond to the currency conversion _ one that was years in
the making, often seemed near failure and then, on Jan. 1, suddenly
came into existence.
</P>
<P>
   With the euro barely in place, exporters say that they already
see far more advantages than disadvantages to a single-currency
continent.
</P>
<P>
   Euro-pricing ``may accelerate sales,'' said Quaker's Liebenow,
who is chief executive. ``If we're able to price in the euro, that
will in essence make us almost the same as if we were manufactured
in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Euro coins and bills won't be issued until Jan. 1, 2002, after a
three-year transition. Business is a different matter: Transactions
in euros are now permitted, including credit card purchases.
Traveler's checks denominated in euros are also available.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the 11 countries _ Austria, Belgium, Finland, France,
Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, and
Portugal _ agreed to unify their monetary systems, US companies are
under pressure to unify European operations to stay abreast of
European competitors that do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you can expect is increased competition for a lot of
products in Europe, because it's going to be much more a one-market
(system) than it is now,'' said Michiel van der Lof, a senior
manager for Ernst &AMP; Young in New York and member of the firm's euro
group that consults to clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``No compulsion, no prohibition'' is the unofficial guideline
heard throughout Europe to describe the transition. Essentially,
this means businesses are not required to use euros _ nor can they
refuse payment in euro terms.
</P>
<P>
   Some American companies view being ``euro-ready'' as a marketing
tool. Some as a survival strategy. If, for example, a European
customer wants to pay prices based on euro values, the business may
comply _ or lose a customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a legal perspective they have until 2002. But from a
client perspective they don't have until 2002 at all,'' van der Lof
said.
</P>
<P>
   The exception is banks, which are required to offer customers'
bank balances in both local currency and the euro. They must also
offer euro checking accounts.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for a day when all transactions are in euros, Bud
Robertson, chief financial officer of Bedford-based Progress
Software Corp., set up a ``dual system'' for billing customers in
euro and local currency terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to be in business in Europe, you have to have
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But increased cross-border competition worries some businesses,
because it will make comparison shopping easier for buyers. These
businesses have used currency differences to disguise higher prices
for their products in some countries.
</P>
<P>
   A new car may cost 17,000 euros in Spain (about $20,000 based on
an exchange rate of 1.17 euros per dollar) and 19,000 euros
($22,230) in Germany. In that case, a Berliner might be willing to
travel to Spain to save 2000 euros. That, in turn, would force
Berlin _ and all German _ car dealers to lower their prices.
</P>
<P>
   Similiar pressures are expected, over time, to level prices of
everything from Gillette razors to Polaroid film or The Economist
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The Economist ``is twice as much in Austria as it is in
Portugal. Austrians are wealthier and they're willing to pay
more,'' said David Currie, a professor of economics at the London
Business School. With euro-pricing, it will ``be harder to sustain
those price differences, and that means a hit on the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   But exporters in Massachusetts, which shipped nearly $4 billion
in goods to the 11 countries embracing the euro, welcome the
conversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The euro is going to be fantastic,'' predicted Robert
Giegerich, vice president of worldwide marketing for Cynosure Inc.
Nearly one-third of the Chelmsford company's $37 million in annual
sales of lasers, which are used in cosmetic surgery, are in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Since lasers are listed in dollars, Cynosure translates each
sale to the customer's local currency. The euro will be much
simpler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, I had to remember pesetas. I had to remember francs
and marks and lira. What was bad is the customer wants to pay 1.7
million lira. It means $120,000 on some days _ it means $110,000 on
others,'' Giegerich said. With the euro, on any given day, ``I can
now compare Spain to Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, the old system allowed customers to use exchange rate
moves to their advantage, he said. If the local currency
depreciated against the dollar, causing the buyers' effective price
to rise, customers might bargain for a better deal before buying.
Rarely would they offer to pay more if their currency strengthened,
increasing their buying power.
</P>
<P>
   The euro is expected to be far more stable than individual
currencies, thus reducing Cynosure's exchange-rate risk.
Large-volume currencies are typically more stable. The volume of
trading in the euro is expected to eventually be second only to the
US dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Such firms as Quaker Fabric believe it will be easier to
undercut competitors' prices if they all are working in euros.
</P>
<P>
   With an eye to raising its profile in Europe _ which accounts
for only 4 percent of annual sales of $220 million _ Quaker Fabric
opened a distribution center two years ago outside of Rotterdam,
the Netherlands, to house Massachusetts-made fabrics for fast
delivery to customers on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that over the next several years our highest growth
rate will come from the international markets, including Europe,''
Liebenow said. The euro ``will be helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   For American or European retailers and manufacturers, increased
competition could also mean lower prices for supplies and raw
materials purchased on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kuna, vice president of finance for Staples International
in London, which operates stores in the United Kingdom and Germany,
said it will be easier for Staples to comparison shop for the best
price of, say, pens. If a Dutch pen supplier isn't willing to meet
his price, a German one might.
</P>
<P>
   Although Staples plans a slow conversion to the euro, Kuna said,
the ``challenge will confront us in the not-too-distant future.''

ECONOMIC STORMS BATTER SOME NATIONS; OTHERS SEE RAINBOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Economics has been called the dismal science, but
the past year has been a study in downright cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter of the world slipped into recession, and yet the US
economy continued its long-running expansion. Collapsing commodity
prices hurt a range of developing nations, while keeping prices low
for gleeful US consumers. Renewed poverty brought riots to
Indonesia and mayhem to Russia, while Europe set aside its
divisions to embrace a common currency and to pave the way for new
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely has the distance between the world's haves and have-nots
been so starkly demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   Now analysts are forecasting a modest improvement in some of the
economic trouble spots of the world, but they warn that
unpredictable forces could arise. ``We continue to see significant
risks, risks that are overall for the world economy predominantly
on the downside,'' Flemming Larsen of the International Monetary
Fund's research department said recently.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF, which has orchestrated massive bailouts for five
nations, last month said the world economy would grow 2.2 percent
in 1999, a downgrade from the 2.5 percent growth it forecast in
September. Growth last year was also 2.2 percent, the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank has been even less optimistic, predicting growth
of 1.9 percent this year.. It said 1998 growth was 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Key to the predictions will be political developments in two
troubled nations: Japan, the world's second-largest economy, and
Brazil, the largest economy in South America. But there are
troubles elsewhere, as well. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Japan &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The economy declined by between 2 percent and 2.5 percent last
year, the second full year of recession in Japan. But a midyear
election prompted government leaders to take several steps toward
improvement, at least in name.
</P>
<P>
   They approved a spending package of about $200 billion to spur
economic activity, on top of previous packages of nearly equal
size. They also set aside about $500 billion to clean up the
troubled banking sector.
</P>
<P>
   But many doubt that the government will follow through on these
plans or that the money will be used well.
</P>
<P>
   The $200 billion spending plan is actually worth about half that
amount, because of various accounting maneuvers, said Rick Katz, an
economist and author of ``Japan: The System that Soured.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there is the question about which public works will
really take place,'' Katz said, noting that the cooperation of
financially-pressed local governments is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, many analysts say that Japan's banking solution is
inadequate. They say it merely gives money to banks to write off
the bad loans they made on half-used factories, over-valued
apartment buildings and the like. Instead, the critics say, the
government should force banks to sell off these over-valued assets
at their true value.
</P>
<P>
   Under a worst-case scenario, Japan could watch its reforms
stumble and a major bank fail. That would kill consumer confidence
and prompt banks to cut back on loans, further slowing economic
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Many forecasters predict the economy will contract by 0.5
percent in 1999, but Nariman Behravesh, chief international
economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI in Lexington, said the decline
could be as high as 2.5 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Asia &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a horrendous year, the signs look good for three nations
that agreed to IMF rescue packages: Thailand, South Korea, and the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   In Korea, a banking cleanup has met some success. As a result,
investors have stopped dumping currency, allowing banks to lower
the interest rates that had been raised sky-high to keep currency
in the country. And exports to the United States from all three
nations are rising, partly because prices are low as a result of
their battered currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand's economy will grow 1 percent this year, after
shrinking 8 percent last year. The Philippines will grow 2.5
percent, after contracting by 0.6 percent, the IMF predicts.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF says South Korea will still contract this year, by 1
percent, but its performance will be better than the 7 percent
decline of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia, which has seen rioting in recent months that led to a
change in political leadership, and Malaysia, which moved to limit
the role of foreign investors in its economy, face deeper problems.
Indonesia will contract 3.4 percent in 1999, after a devastating 15
percent fall in economic output last year, the IMF says.
</P>
<P>
   The economies of India and China have been relatively isolated
from the worst effects of the Asian financial crisis. The IMF
predicts solid growth for both countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asia is not out of the tunnel yet,'' said Behravesh. ``But it
looks like the light at the end of the tunnel is really the end of
the tunnel, and not a train.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Latin America &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's problems continue. Despite reaching agreement on a $42
billion IMF bailout, the Brazilian government has at times shown
itself unwilling to approve tough austerity measures.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF is forecasting a 1 percent fall in economic activity.
But Michael Mussa, the IMF chief economist, recently said that he
would not be surprised if the agency revises that number downward
in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil accounts for half of economic activity in Latin America,
excluding Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the region are expected to post solid growth next year.
Behravesh says Mexico will grow by 2.5 percent after 4.4 percent
growth in 1998. The IMF sees even greater growth for Mexico, and it
says most economies in the region will continue to expand. One
possible exception is Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Commodity prices could force economists to revise the estimates.
Falling oil prices have hurt Venezuela, Mexico, and Ecuador, but
they have helped Argentina, an oil importer. Chile has been hit
hard by falling copper prices. Continued price decreases would hurt
the exporting nations even more. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Russia &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Falling oil prices have crippled Russia, where the financial
meltdown could well get worse. The IMF predicts that economic
output will shrink 8.3 percent this year, worse than the crippling
5.7 percent drop of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation could surge to 56 percent, more than double the 26
percent forecast for 1998. Analysts believe it is likely that
investors will pull even more money from Russian banks and
businesses, further hurting the economy. Many say the government
has done little to improve the banks or fix the notoriously lax
tax-collection system. These problems, combined with a currency
devaluation last year and a government default on some debts, have
stripped investor confidence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Europe &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With Britain refusing to join, 11 European nations launch the
euro this year, which over time could provide an economic boost. A
single currency is expected to make transactions more efficient and
ease trade. It might also force companies to compete squarely on
costs, as comparisons among goods will no longer be complicated by
exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that might be more wishful thinking on the part of the
Europeans,'' Behravesh said. ``And the effect may not be felt for
several years.''
</P>
<P>
   The European Union countries are expected to grow by 2.2 percent
this year. Even Central and Eastern Europe are forecast to do well,
excluding Russia and Ukraine.

PATRIOTS' STRATEGY IS A REAL DRAG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amateur Night continues at Foxboro.
</P>
<P>
   There is no better way to describe the events unfolding within
the Patriots organization, events that are consistent with what has
gone on with the team since Bill Parcells left town.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: They say they are going to take three weeks to
decide whether Pete Carroll should be head coach next year.
</P>
<P>
   They've known the guy for two years, have seen him in operation,
and they still don't know whether he should coach the team?
</P>
<P>
   Carroll and his assistants are being held hostage, while Bob and
Jonathan Kraft, with recommendations from team vice presidents
Bobby Grier and Andy Wasynczuk, write up reports.
</P>
<P>
   This might be the way things are done at Harvard Business
School, but not in the National Football League, where great head
coaches, like Hall of Fame quarterbacks, are a rare commodity.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the man with the best winning percentage in NFL
history, George Seifert, signed on with Carolina. That means,
obviously, that he is not available to New England, should the plug
be pulled on Carroll. Seifert reportedly was the man the Patriots
wanted instead of Carroll when Parcells opted for the New York Jets
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most people in the league would say that the two most
outstanding coaches available this offseason were Seifert and Mike
Holmgren. Holmgren said Tuesday that he will decide within a week
whether to leave Green Bay. He has plans to visit Seattle _ where
many think he will end up _ Baltimore, and Philadelphia. One friend
of Holmgren's said Tuesday, ``He and his family are headed for
Seattle. They are going to offer him something like $4.5 million a
year, and he will probably sign the deal right away.''
</P>
<P>
   So while the Patriots are busy writing those important (give me
a break) reports, they will have missed the chance to go after the
two best coaching prospects out there.
</P>
<P>
   While the study class is in session in Foxborough, Holmgren will
be shopping, and the teams looking for head coaches _ San Diego,
Seattle, Baltimore, Philly, Chicago, and Cleveland _ also will be
talking to the rest of the so-called ``candidates'': Brian Billick
of Minnesota, Jim Haslett of Pittsburgh, Terry Donahue of UCLA, and
two recently fired coaches, Dom Capers of Carolina and Dave
Wannstedt of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The guessing at the moment is that Holmgren goes to Seattle;
Steve Mariucci leaves San Francisco and goes to Cleveland when the
49ers' season ends; Billick winds up in San Francisco to fill that
vacancy; and the rest of the teams with openings get to pick over
the remains.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it is grossly unfair to keep around an assistant coach for
three weeks if he is eventually going to get fired. Last year
offensive coordinator Larry Kennan would have had two chances to
get another job before he learned that Ernie Zampese was being
brought in to replace him. By the time he left Foxborough, there
were no other jobs open.
</P>
<P>
   To quote one AFC general manager on the Patriots' strategy:
``What they are doing is the dumbest (expletive) thing I have ever
heard of.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tom Coughlin knows his Jaguars face an uphill battle against the
Jets in New Jersey Sunday. ``They have great execution,'' said the
Jacksonville coach. ``Over the last six games, they have played
extremely well. This looks like a Bill Parcells team. Penalties are
limited. No turnovers. Everything is done with efficiency.
Offensively, they are difficult to deal with because they have so
many weapons and Vinny Testaverde is on a roll. You look at their
defense and you don't see any holes. Nothing stands out that you
can really exploit. And their kicking game is excellent. The
addition of Dave Meggett is a plus for them. Any team that can beat
its toughest three division opponents the final three games of the
season, and two of them on the road, is playing at a high level.''
. . . Parcells on Jacksonville, after viewing film: ``Their offense
will be very hard to deal with. This kid (Fred) Taylor is some kind
of runner. Two hundred and thirty pounds, with blazing speed. He
can make plays every time he touches the ball. The two wide
receivers (Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell) are outstanding, and
(Pete) Mitchell, the tight end, is a good receiver. The two tackles
(Tony Boselli and Leon Searcy) are special, two of the best in the
league. Defensively, they have played very well the last two games,
shutting down New England and Pittsburgh in two games they needed
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Miami coach Jimmy Johnson wrote a letter to Doug Flutie Tuesday
apologizing for jumping on a box of Flutie Flakes in the
celebration last Saturday after the Dolphins beat the Buffalo Bills
in an AFC playoff game. ``Jimmy didn't mean any harm,'' said
Dolphins public relations director Harvey Greene. ``It was just
done for fun. There is no way he wanted to demean anyone. He knew
it was being filmed for NFL Films, so he just went along with it.
Jimmy has a great deal of respect for Flutie and would never do
anything to hurt him in any way.''

<P>
   WALPOLE, Mass. _ Most of the time, the skaters remind you of the
Rockettes on ice, all grace and smiles and locked arms. But then
the 20 young women will suddenly break into two groups and hurtle
themselves toward each other at what seems like warp speed and you
cringe the way you did when Ulf Samuelsson slammed into Cam Neely.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no collision, no crunch. Instead, one group splices
itself through the other, never slowing and showing no fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very skilled at this level,'' said coach Lynn Benson.
``They know where they need to be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They'' are the Haydenettes, a synchronized skating team named
after their home rink in Lexington, Mass. and long considered
perhaps the best precision squad in the nation. Winners of nine
national championships and often placing in the top three in
international competition, the team will be among 17 in three
divisions competing Thursday through Saturday at the Citizens Bank
Snowflake International Synchronized Skating Competition in Warwick
and Providence, R.I., hosted by the Warwick Figure Skaters.
</P>
<P>
   Benson founded the Haydenettes in 1979 after watching many of
the singles skaters she coached leave the sport at 14 or 15 when
they started to realize the odds against becoming the next Dorothy
Hamill. Now 49, Benson was once a national-level competitor and
later skated with the Ice Capades. ``I remembered just loving
skating for the precision team,'' she said after leading a
four-hour practice the morning of New Year's Eve. ``I thought, this
is a way of getting those kids at Hayden to keep skating. It's such
a shame to quit. This is another area where they can keep skating
at a high international level.''
</P>
<P>
   Although still in the publicity shadows of singles and pairs
skating and not yet in the Olympics, the synchronized version of
the sport is the fastest-growing of the five disciplines under the
auspices of the United States Figure Skating Association, with more
than 400 teams and 7,200 athletes in this country alone. In
competition, teams of 12 to 20 skaters perform complex programs at
up to 25 miles per hour, sometimes with their legs outstretched and
skate blades aimed directly at each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would never give those maneuvers to kids who aren't strong
skaters,'' said Benson. ``They'd kill themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some synchronized skaters are quite strong individually
but, either because of body type (there aren't many 5-foot, 1-inch
jumping beans among the 25 members rehearsing this day at Iorio
Arena), personality type, or both, gravitate toward team
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good opportunity to share everything with everybody
else and to succeed personally,'' said 17-year-old Sharon Liff, who
began skating when she was 4 and moved up through the ranks to the
Haydenettes after she turned 14, the minimum age. ``You want to do
well for yourself, but also for your coaches and the other people
on your team.''
</P>
<P>
   That camaraderie, said Benson, is the biggest difference between
singles and synchronized. ``It was almost isolated, in a way,''
said Benson of her singles career. ``I had friends, but I never had
anybody who wanted me to win as much as they wanted to win. We have
24 people who want you to skate your very best out there.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you don't? After all, a mistake by one skater during a
20-person routine affects the other 19; a fall sends the judges'
scores plummeting for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never have thought this,'' said Benson, of the
reaction. ``Usually, she is surrounded by the other girls saying,
oh, that's OK, don't worry about it. Every girl knows how easy it
is to catch an edge, or that the girl who falls isn't always the
one who causes the fall. I would never have guessed that. I would
have thought, boy, whoever falls are they going to get it in the
locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   But the amount of consoling is in direct proportion to the
overall diligence of the unfortunate performer. ``If the skater who
fell is one who hasn't shown up for rehearsals,'' said Benson,
''then it doesn't go like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not something that happens often on the Haydenettes, which
last year finished fifth out of 19 teams at the World Challenge Cup
in France, the top international tournament in the sport. In 1996
and 1997, they placed fourth. The group also skates frequently in
exhibitions, such as Harvard's annual ``An Evening With
Champions,'' and has often performed on television, including a
segment last week on the ``Today Show'' from the outdoor rink at
Rockefeller Center.
</P>
<P>
   After the competition in Providence this week, the team will
travel next month to Rouen for the French Cup, which they won in
1997, and hopes to again represent the United States at the World
Cup in April in Goteborg, Sweden. The first official World
Championship in the sport will be held in 2000, in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is pretty amazing to Benson, who 20 years ago had
to scratch for 45 minutes a week of ice time to practice for a
sport that had few rules and less structure. ``If anybody had ever
told me it was going to be an international sport, I would never
have guessed,'' she said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   How the team has lasted long enough to see the evolution may
have something to do with Benson's attitude: the process is more
important than the result, the only realistic goals are those that
can be met, the idea is to work hard but enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   All three philosophies helped the Haydenettes through their
first competition two decades ago, just months after they were
formed. Benson didn't want the girls to be disappointed, so she
announced that their goal was not to come in last.
</P>
<P>
   When they finished seventh out of nine teams, Benson recalled,
``you saw all the girls and myself jumping up and down, we were so
happy. Someone came up and said, they were seventh. I think they
thought we read it wrong.''

 &HT;    CHINA ADMITS ITS ECONOMY IS IN TROUBLE, WARNS OF 'NO ROOM FOR
OPTIMISM'
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China, the world's fastest-growing economy, stopped
boasting about its two-decade-long ``economic miracle'' on
Wednesday and instead warned of hard times ahead as the Asian
economic crisis finally hits home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The internal and external economic situations in 1999 leave no
room for optimism,'' Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng said.
``Affected by the Asian financial crisis, the growth rate of
China's exports this year is predicted to be low and even
negative.''
</P>
<P>
   This unabashedly bleak economic outlook for 1999 helps explain
why President Jiang Zemin issued dire warnings last month about the
need to guarantee social stability, saying any attempt to
``undermine'' order must be ``nipped in the bud.''
</P>
<P>
   It also helps account for a security crackdown, launched in
November, that has sent at least 10 pro-democracy dissidents to
prisons and labor camps for alleged attempts to challenge the
monopoly rule of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   China already has 30 million laid-off or unemployed workers, and
even graduates of prestigious universities are having trouble
finding jobs. If China's long-running export-fueled boom runs out
of energy this year, the jobless ranks will swell -- and may grow
angrier.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as four days ago, state-controlled media were
predicting that this year -- the 50th anniversary of communist rule
in China -- would bring further rapid growth amounting to 7 to 9
percent in the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few days, China's propaganda organs have begun
making uncommonly frank disclosures of trouble throughout the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of lowering expectations and preparing the people
for some kinds of austerity,'' said China scholar Steven M.
Goldstein, a Smith College government professor now visiting
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the official Xinhua news agency said the government
is working on a plan to rescue ``staggering amounts of bad loans''
that are ``sapping the strength'' of state-owned commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, the official China Daily reported that
insurance companies in Beijing are suffering a ``flood of
cancellations'' from people who bought policies a year ago and can
no longer pay the premiums. ``Some experts attribute this to the
increase in laid-off workers,'' the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday afternoon, China's powerful vice president, Hu
Jintao, warned that ``problems within China's financial sector are
rife and must be tackled,'' the official Xinhua news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Hu said the Asian financial crisis was by no means over and was
beginning to affect China. Safeguarding financial security has a
direct bearing on social stability, the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Wednesday's statement by the finance ministry, which
warned that China's domestic economy will be weighed down in 1999
by poor performance of state enterprises and anemic consumer
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conventional consumer goods have lost much of their glamour
and the demand for new ones has yet to come,'' the finance ministry
said. ``Consumer prices remain low, but people tend toward saving
more than usual.''
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, most Chinese families had moved into a
comfortable lifestyle by purchasing a refrigerator, a color
television, an air-conditioner, perhaps a cellular phone. But with
the threat of unemployment on the horizon, typical Chinese would
rather save their money than strive for the next stage of consumer
affluence -- buying their own apartment and a car.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent a collapse of economic growth in 1999, the finance
ministry said it plans further increases in public spending on
highways, telecommunications and water works. China also plans to
float about $38 billion in domestic bonds, and may attempt to raise
money overseas by selling bonds, the ministry said.

   PETERBOROUGH, N.H. _ Thick sheets of ice coated the plush red
seats where audiences once watched performances, icicles hung from
rails and rafters, and broken glass and charred debris littered the
sooty stage.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Leach stood amid the rubble of the New England Marionette
Opera, which was destroyed by a New Year's Day electrical fire, and
wondered what would be next for himself and the theater he founded
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   All he managed to save were some books on puppetry, a sewing
machine, a few marionette parts, and one badly burned marionette _
Escamillo, the bullfighter in the opera, ``Carmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Leach and his troupe of puppeteers are trying to tally their
losses, assess the significance of what they created, and decide
where they go from here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I had was in this theater,'' said Leach, 56,
fingering a velvet stage curtain that broke like ribbon candy in
his hand. ``Everything I made, I put back into it . . . Where do I
start again?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get over losing 200 kids,'' said Roger DuPen 32,
the theater's artistic director, referring to the more than 200
marionette characters that burned in the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a lot of time making and molding them, and the
puppeteers brought them to life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you work with marionettes long enough, they become little
humans with their own personalities,'' DuPen said. ``This is like
multiple deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the theater was the only one of its kind in the
Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say they believe the fire began in the theater
basement sometime New Year's Day morning. Leach was in the control
room on an upper balcony, editing video footage from a recent
production of ``Porgy and Bess.'' He smelled smoke but kept
editing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the smoke became more pervasive, Leach left the control room
and made his way through the blackened theater and out a fire door.
Then he ran to Roy's, a small grocery store nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call 911,'' he yelled to a startled clerk shortly after noon.
``I'm on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   It took firefighters 28 hours to contain the three-alarm blaze,
which continued to burn in the theater's trap doors, hollow walls,
and innumerable crevices. A small fire erupted in the attic Tuesday
morning, but it was quickly extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   The building was insured, ``but we'll take a big hit,'' Leach
said, because so many of the losses are incalculable. It took at
least 10 days to make each of the more than 200 marionettes used in
the nine operas that the company performed, and a year to develop
each different show, Leach said.
</P>
<P>
   Leach launched the New England Marionette Opera after being
captivated by the marionette opera in Salzburg, Austria. He had
never seen a puppet show before, but he liked opera and thought the
combination made opera accessible to a wider audience and also
provided an unusual creative edge.
</P>
<P>
   As DuPen explained, with marionettes performing to recorded
music, ``audiences didn't have to deal with the persona on stage,
they could get straight into the characters and the story line. It
wasn't Pavarotti, it was Lt. Pinkerton or Rudolfo.''
</P>
<P>
   Using a scale model designed by DuPen, they constructed a
theater scaled to puppet proportions in a converted Baptist Church
on Peterborough's Main Street. They made their own sets and props
and marionettes, with costuming help from designers like Masako
Hayashi, who had worked for the Boston Opera Company and the New
York City Opera.
</P>
<P>
   They found puppeteers among teachers, musicians, writers,
editors, and circus performers, united by a love of theater.
</P>
<P>
   And they gave 80 to 100 performances a year to audiences,
primarily adult, that typically filled about 85 percent of the
theater, Leach said.
</P>
<P>
   Marionette opera has been popular for ages in Europe, but it was
a hard sell in the United States. ``Opera is not an acquired
American taste, and people think marionettes are for kids,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   To make opera more appealing, Leach used surtitles _ English
translations projected above the stage _ and shortened the
productions to two hours.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly four years, the theater has made a profit. In 1996,
the company embarked on its first international tour. In 1998, it
performed for three weeks at the Emerson Majestic Theater in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exhilarating,'' said Karen Carter, 40, a puppeteer from
Lyndeborough, N.H., whose parts included the lead character in
``Tosca,'' and Rosina in ``The Barber of Seville.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really nothing else like this in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too soon to say what they'll do next, Leach and DuPen said.
Followers have sent many messages of support, saying they hope the
opera will rebuild in Peterborough or perhaps find a new base in
Boston. But for now, the company is still grieving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still riding something, maybe denial,'' Leach said. ``I'm
moving ahead. I just don't know where I'm headed.''

 &HT;    CHINA ADMITS ITS ECONOMY IS IN TROUBLE, WARNS OF 'NO ROOM FOR
OPTIMISM'
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China, the world's fastest-growing economy, stopped
boasting about its two-decade-long ``economic miracle'' on
Wednesday and instead warned of hard times ahead as the Asian
economic crisis finally hits home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The internal and external economic situations in 1999 leave no
room for optimism,'' Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng said.
``Affected by the Asian financial crisis, the growth rate of
China's exports this year is predicted to be low and even
negative.''
</P>
<P>
   This unabashedly bleak economic outlook for 1999 helps explain
why President Jiang Zemin issued dire warnings last month about the
need to guarantee social stability, saying any attempt to
``undermine'' order must be ``nipped in the bud.''
</P>
<P>
   It also helps account for a security crackdown, launched in
November, that has sent at least 10 pro-democracy dissidents to
prisons and labor camps for alleged attempts to challenge the
monopoly rule of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   China already has 30 million laid-off or unemployed workers, and
even graduates of prestigious universities are having trouble
finding jobs. If China's long-running export-fueled boom runs out
of energy this year, the jobless ranks will swell -- and may grow
angrier.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as four days ago, state-controlled media were
predicting that this year -- the 50th anniversary of communist rule
in China -- would bring further rapid growth amounting to 7 to 9
percent in the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few days, China's propaganda organs have begun
making uncommonly frank disclosures of trouble throughout the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of lowering expectations and preparing the people
for some kinds of austerity,'' said China scholar Steven M.
Goldstein, a Smith College government professor now visiting
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the official Xinhua news agency said the government
is working on a plan to rescue ``staggering amounts of bad loans''
that are ``sapping the strength'' of state-owned commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, the official China Daily reported that
insurance companies in Beijing are suffering a ``flood of
cancellations'' from people who bought policies a year ago and can
no longer pay the premiums. ``Some experts attribute this to the
increase in laid-off workers,'' the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday afternoon, China's powerful vice president, Hu
Jintao, warned that ``problems within China's financial sector are
rife and must be tackled,'' the official Xinhua news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Hu said the Asian financial crisis was by no means over and was
beginning to affect China. Safeguarding financial security has a
direct bearing on social stability, the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Wednesday's statement by the finance ministry, which
warned that China's domestic economy will be weighed down in 1999
by poor performance of state enterprises and anemic consumer
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conventional consumer goods have lost much of their glamour
and the demand for new ones has yet to come,'' the finance ministry
said. ``Consumer prices remain low, but people tend toward saving
more than usual.''
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, most Chinese families had moved into a
comfortable lifestyle by purchasing a refrigerator, a color
television, an air-conditioner, perhaps a cellular phone. But with
the threat of unemployment on the horizon, typical Chinese would

affluence -- buying their own apartment and a car.
</P>

highways, telecommunications and water works. China also plans to
float about $38 billion in domestic bonds, and may attempt to raise
money overseas by selling bonds, the ministry said.

MAKE THE WORLD YOUR OYSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Many workers deprive themselves of success
because they're too skeptical to set goals and lack the confidence
to move up, says a CEO and author of a new book on career planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times when you hear that talk about specific plans and
specific goals, you say, `That's for the business world. That's for
the professional world. That's not for me,''' said Eleanor Jacobs,
president and CEO of the United Way of Santa Clara County and
author of the recently published ``Ten Pearls of Wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said her life changed after she read a self-help book in
1971 and realized how much control she had over her life _ once she
started setting goals and taking action to achieve them. In her
book, she tells people to set the goals and then spend at least 15
minutes a day thinking about the goals and her 10 pearls:
</P>
<P>
   _ Believe. Have the attitude that you can do whatever you set
your mind to.
</P>
<P>
   _ Remember. Write a list of your achievements.
</P>
<P>
   _ Decide. Choose a specific goal you want to work on first.
</P>
<P>
   _ Plan. Determine what specific steps you need to take to
achieve that goal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Actuate. Get moving. Start taking the steps you've identified.
</P>
<P>
   _ Habituate. Take at least one action on your plan each day.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pretend. Imagine how you will be once you achieve your goal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Refine. Using the image of yourself as you're achieving your
goal, smooth out any bumps that might be in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   _ Claim. Have the deep-down feeling that you deserve the
success.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expand. Once you have achieved your smaller goals, aim at
bigger ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Start with something small,'' Jacobs said in an interview.
``Start with something fun.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jacobs' case, she always had trouble finding any affordable
clothes she liked in her size, but she found that she was very good
at following hunches. So she went into the Stix, Baer &AMP; Fuller
store near St. Louis, where she grew up, with the goal that she
would find the right dress. She did.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that,'' she wrote, ``day by day, week by week, month by
month and year by year, I continued to set a goal, pay attention to
my instincts and gut feelings, follow that guidance, achieve the
goal, and move on to the next one. I began to see myself
differently, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``No longer did I feel at the mercy of circumstance or fate. I
began to realize that I could mold and shape circumstances to my
own personal desires.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of her challenge was going back to college, even though she
was in her 20s and older than most students. The whole idea of
going for a bachelor's degree and then a master's in social work
from St. Louis University sounded intimidating for someone who had
gone out into the working world after just one year of college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Underneath all of that,'' she said in the interview, ``there
was that tiny internal voice that I allowed to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   She recommends writing your goals _ ``The action of writing
makes it stick with you'' _ and, for career-related goals, paying
particular attention to the pearls of believe and claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep down within yourself, feel that you deserve that job,''
Jacobs said. ``Feel that you can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   If you can't see yourself deserving that job, she said, think
about what is blocking you. Is there some skill you're lacking that
the job demands? ``The specifics will bubble up _ the specifics
that you feel you need to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   With career goals more than with most others, Jacobs said it is
crucial to do research, whether by reading or asking others. People
often find that the career they're aiming at might not really be
the one best suited for them, she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs realizes there are roadblocks to success within society,
but those aren't the biggest hurdles for people to overcome. ``I
think we stop ourselves a lot more than something stops us.''

   ``I didn't have any rich uncle,'' she said. ``I didn't have an
`in' with the academic people who helped me. What I had was belief
and action.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you get yourself headed in the right direction, however,
you will find there is help, Jacobs added. ``People will begin to
give you advice. They will mentor you. Then it opens up.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that people will experience setbacks along the way, but
urges them to reduce the ``wallowing time'' when something goes
wrong. ``It's so easy to succumb to the negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said that whenever you make goal-setting or something
else _ good or bad _ a habit, it becomes easy for you to follow
that pattern. That can happen when people become hopeless and begin
constantly complaining about their career and life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't hold yourself away,'' she warned. ``Don't automatically
exclude yourself from getting promoted.''

   UNDATED _ The misuse of antibiotics and the associated increase
in drug-resistant bacteria has been a hotly debated topic in the
medical community for 10 years, but the answer has always been to
develop newer, stronger antibiotics. Now, some doctors say, it's
time to find alternatives. (Accompanied by ANTIBIOTICS-TOP 10 and

extending a six-year trend of improvement in the decline of

 &HT;    MindSpring joins Net giantswith $245 million acquisition
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MindSpring Enterprises joined the ranks of the giants of the
Internet today when it announced the planned purchase of the
domestic consumer base of Netcom from ICG Communications.
MindSpring will pay $215 million in cash as well as $30 million in
MindSpring stock in a deal worth $245 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call today, MindSpring Chairman Charles Brewer
and President Michael McQuary, the Atlanta-based Internet
provider's chief operating officer, talked about the challenges and
opportunities that now face the company.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would give MindSpring about 400,000 individual customer
accounts as well as 3,000 commercial Internet accounts and 18,000
Web hosting customers. The acquisition of San Jose, Calif.-based
Netcom would more than double MindSpring's subscriber base and
place the company on a par in size with Internet giants such as
Earthlink, AT&AMP;T WorldNet and the Microsoft Network, which all claim
more than a million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   America Online is the nation's largest provider with 15 million
paid subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is
expected to be completed during the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this acquisition will put MindSpring over the one
million dial-up subscriber mark,'' said Brewer, the company's
founder. ``It also makes us a larger and more credible spokesperson
and will help the company in its negotiations with cable and phone
companies for last-mile high-speed access as well as a more
attractive potential partner. ...This acquisition is consistent
with our mission to become a major player in the telecommunications
industry of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer also said MindSpring will benefit from having a presence
in Silicon Valley and cited increased marketing opportunities and
affiliations the company could now take advantage of, but he did
not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Netcom was the first Internet provider to cross the half-million
mark. It was founded in 1988. McQuary said the challenge is to
infuse Netcom, an Internet pioneer with flat subscriber growth,
into a growing company with the reputation for service and support
MindSpring is known for.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring stock was up 4 3/4 to 71 5/16 late this morning. ICG
was down 15/16 to 22 3/16.

 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever else happens, the difficulties the Senate had in
setting up a simple impeachment trial are troubling. Events seem
headed toward a straight partisan vote. Hard-core Republicans would
like to see Bill Clinton hanged. Some senators virtually slaver to
play a role in a trial. House Republicans broadcast in plain
language the desire to see the Senate do their dirty work _ or
else.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd seems a special case. He has
re-emerged to assert the Senate's dubious dignity, quoting from
obscure and ancient Romans to make his point. (Flatulantus Maximus:
The Ethics of the Solons.)
</P>
<P>
   Two ideas keep emerging as irritants. The first is the What Will
We Tell Our Children Factor. What we tell our children, it seems to
me, is none of the Senate's, or House's, business. I can mislead my
heirs without the help of some congressional windbag.
</P>
<P>
   The second is the repeated assertion that ``The Senate is the
greatest deliberative body in the world.'' Who says? Now that we've
seen the Senate actually deliberate on the tube, we know its
opinions are every bit as various and as lame-brained as any of the
rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Spare us the self-congratulations. Keep government out of our
lives.

   CHINA-ECONOMY _ BEIJING _ China, the world's fastest-growing
economy, stopped boasting about its two-decade-long ``economic
miracle'' on Wednesday and instead warned of hard times ahead as
the Asian economic crisis finally hits home. This unabashedly bleak
economic outlook for 1999 helps explain why President Jiang Zemin
issued dire warnings last month about the need to guarantee social
stability, saying any attempt to ``undermine'' order must be
``nipped in the bud.'' It also helps account for a security
crackdown, launched in November, that has sent at least 10
pro-democracy dissidents into prisons and labor camps for alleged
attempts to challenge the monopoly rule of the Communist Party.

references to Nazi treatment of homosexuals during the Holocaust be
deleted in a teacher guide on the Holocaust that a law firm
provided to several states. The two paragraphs were removed in only

descriptions of Nazi treatment of homosexuals that the Georgia
Holocaust Commission said were too sexually explicit for middle
schoolers. Steve Uhlfelder, manager of the law firm's Tallahasee,
Fla., office, said the firm, Holland &AMP; Knight, did not agree that
the paragraphs needed to be removed, but deferred to the Georgia
commission in a spirit of cooperation. The Georgia version still

   Restaurant fave: Deep-fried onion appetizers are a big draw at
several restaurant chains. Here's a recipe for the home kitchen.
But beware, it is a tricky procedure, and you won't get quite the
professional results that the restaurants get. (Their secrets are
an expensive machine to cut the onions, and fry baskets that evenly
cook the onions.) Please note, the amount of cornstarch is correct.
The batter is sort of a tempura recipe.

   ONION CHRYSANTHEMUMS
</P>
<P>
   Serves 12
</P>
<P>
   6 onions, at least 4 inches in diameter
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable oil, for deep frying
</P>
<P>
   Seasoned flour:
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons paprika
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons garlic powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   Batter:
</P>
<P>
   3 cups cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons garlic salt
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons paprika
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon pepper
</P>
<P>
   24 ounces beer
</P>
<P>
   Dipping sauce:
</P>
<P>
   2 cups mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   2 cups sour cream
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chili sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   Combine seasoned flour ingredients in a bowl. In another bowl,
combine batter ingredients, stirring frequently. Cut about 3/4 inch
from the top of each onion. Then cut onions into 12 to 16 vertical
wedges, but don't cut through the root end. Dip the cut onions in
seasoned flour and shake to remove excess flour. Separate petals
and coat well with batter. Deep fry in vegetable oil at 375 to 400
degrees for 1 1/2 minutes, then turn over and fry 1 1/2 minutes
longer, or until golden brown all over. Serve in shallow bowl, with
center onion cores removed.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the sauce ingredients and slowly warm over low heat,
stirring with a whisk. Serve dipping sauce with the onions.

THIS IS A `STEPMOM' A GIRL COULD LOVE

By JUNE NAYLOR RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't care if my colleagues, the movie critics, and my best
friend dismiss ``Stepmom'' as a cheap, manipulative tear-jerker of
a film. I still understand why it's packin' em in to theaters.
After all, what movie title better characterizes American families
in the '90s?
</P>
<P>
   We can blame ``Cinderella'' for the bad rap placed upon
stepmoms. The storybook stepmonster is everything from annoying to
wicked, a characterization that is not only unfair but untrue. The
stats prove it: With one out of three Americans a stepparent,
stepchild, stepsibling or stepsomething, the state of stepness is,
like it or not, almost average.
</P>
<P>
   Stepmoms, on the average, are, well, pretty normal. That means
they come in good versions and bad, just like real moms.
</P>
<P>
   And I know from stepmoms; I've had three.
</P>
<P>
   I got my first stepmom when I was 8. She was 19, so it was a
tricky proposition for both of us. How she knew what to do to win
me over is still a mystery, because I was hugely unlovable at that
age _ and remained so, perhaps predictably, for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Although the little girl in the movie ``Stepmom'' is much
nastier to Julia Roberts than I ever was to my stepmom No. 1 _ a
fact that even she admitted after we saw the movie together last
week _ my stepmother still had to find a well of patience to put up
with me. She continues, as one of my greatest friends now, to tell
the story of the time I was so bored that I took the funny papers
into my bubble bath. (Who knew the ink would stain the bathtub?)
</P>
<P>
   Like the Julia Roberts character, my stepmom was young, hip and
cool. She let me wear a little lip gloss and fixed my hair into a
sassy flip. It was with her that I first experienced eating
McDonald's french fries, shopping for no reason at all and making a
pallet on the floor to watch bad TV, late into the night, with
squealing girlfriends. She taught me how to laugh to the point of
tears over stupid things such as buying the ugliest Christmas tree
on the lot because it was the cheapest, and how we could use the
money we saved for other fun stuff _ like a new purse!
</P>
<P>
   My own Mom adored this stepmom because she made my dad happy
again; Mom was rational enough to know Daddy deserved that. She
also found it wonderfully amusing that my stepmom made fun of my
dad's dark moods. When Mom loaned all her ski clothes to my
stepmom, my friends thought the whole thing was way too weird, but
I loved it. In my family, it made perfect sense.
</P>
<P>
   But statistics show that 60 percent of marriages end in divorce,
and second marriages are not immune. My first wonderful stepmom
quit that job when I was 16, leaving me with two terrific siblings,
but also, in time, with Stepmom No. 2, about whom it is best to say
nothing, except perhaps that her arrival shot the stepmom pendulum
back toward the evil end. Fortunately, she eventually unblended
from our family, opening the doors for Stepmom No. 3 _
statistically speaking, yet another happy confirmation that 75
percent of divorced people eventually do marry again.
</P>
<P>
   Now, my personal stepmom-o-meter reels again to the positive
side. She and my dad seem to listen to each other as married people
should. They make each other laugh long and hard, and she's a
rocket scientist, which I find very, very cool.
</P>
<P>
   So kill me if I cry real, not manipulated, tears as Julia
Roberts stitches together a relationship with her stepkids on the
big screen, showing that stepmoms can be good. I know perhaps
better than anyone that stepmoms can indeed be fabulous _ but it's
a tough, tough job, and one that is mostly thankless.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I'm not surprised, and I'm even thrilled, that
``Stepmom'' is the first film endorsed by the Lincoln, Neb.-based
Stepfamily Association of America. OK, so the film is heavy-handed,
but isn't it time society finally smashed that stepmonster myth?
Because life after remarriage, while often complicated, can be a
decent, even very happy, place.

COMPANIES MUST WORK TO KEEP THEIR `BEST' WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I would bet the 80/20 theory _ 20 percent of
people have 80 percent of the wealth, 20 percent of your time
accounts for 80 percent of your productivity, 20 percent of the
politicians wipe out 80 percent of the ozone layer _ applies to
hiring as well. In other words, it would be harder to replace the
best 20 percent of your workers than the remaining 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't think so, let your mind drift back to when
professional basketball games were played at this time of year. If
you ran the Chicago Bulls, would you rather start with Michael
Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Phil Jackson, or the other 10 players
and any two assistant coaches?
</P>
<P>
   That's more of a no-brainer than Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   The workplace game is changing, and employers who are slow to
react will end up losing. Workers aren't as loyal as they used to
be, and baby boomers are getting to the age when they can think
about retiring early or starting their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
   And guess what? Those who can do that are usually your best
workers, the ones you'll have a hard time replacing.
</P>
<P>
   So how can you keep your top people? Here are four suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Think outside the ``bread'' box.
</P>
<P>
   Competitive salaries and good health and retirement packages are
great cornerstones, but they've become routine. What can you do to
stand out?
</P>
<P>
   Are your health benefits useless to someone who is covered
through a spouse? Worth magazine reports that USAA, the insurance
and financial services company, lets its workers who opt out of the
health care program take the money it would have spent on premiums
and use it however they wish.
</P>
<P>
   At a lot of companies, the main form of exercise is shaking the
vending machine. Yet many that end up paying those superfluous
health insurance premiums wouldn't think of using that money to
reimburse workers who join a health club or buy a treadmill.
</P>
<P>
   Is your sick leave policy basically useless to dedicated
workers? More companies are offering ``personal'' days, letting
people take the time off for whatever reason they wish, or offering
bonuses to those who don't call in sick for three months or a year.
</P>
<P>
   You need to be more creative, even if you can't spend extra
money. If you have a shorter workweek than your competitors for the
same pay, that's a huge recruiting advantage. If you offer job
sharing or other part-time work, you can attract and keep people
who might otherwise retire early.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Little'' things aren't.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune magazine's Jan. 11 issue has its annual list of ``The
100 Best Companies To Work For,'' and one of the things that stands
out is that the companies do more than offer nice frills. They
offer humanity. They make employees feel as if their opinions
count, and they have things like mentoring and career counseling.
</P>
<P>
   How about this for a ``little'' thing: Studies have shown that
many people function better after a 15-minute nap. Yet how many
bosses would roll their eyes if you asked them to set aside a quiet
room with a couch? Or have a break room with video games or
exercise equipment to relieve stress?
</P>
<P>
   _ Think of commute hours as work time.
</P>
<P>
   Your employees do. If you had to pay people for the time and
money they spend commuting, would you do things differently? If
people commute an hour each way, changing their workweek from five
eight-hour days to four 10-hour days saves them two hours, plus one
day's transportation costs. Letting them telecommute one day
accomplishes the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   In his excellent book, ``Managing Telework,'' Jack M. Nilles
reports that telecommuters' productivity generally increases 10 to
20 percent over working in the office, according to their
supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of insecure managers, though, are as frightened by
telecommuting as they are by couches and video games. Companies are
so concerned with making sure that their worst workers don't
exploit the system that they don't do enough to encourage their
best people.
</P>
<P>
   If telecommuting and the compressed workweek are impractical for
your company, could you give workers cell phones or training tapes
so they could make productive use out of their commute and spend
less time at the office?
</P>
<P>
   _ Make it easier for employees to do their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Companies pressure workers to continue learning and keep up with
technology, yet management can be awfully slow when it comes to
updating equipment.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take a high-priced consultant to tell you that people
work better when they aren't constantly interrupted, yet workers
are bombarded by e-mails and phone calls. Can your employees check
their e-mail once or twice a day without worrying about missing
something urgent? Can they screen phone calls to distinguish the
crucial from the routine?
</P>
<P>
   When so much is going on, sometimes you don't appreciate the
urgency of a message until it's too late. Unambitious workers have
learned that the hard way. Unambitious employers will, too.
</P>

   ZUMTHOR-ARCHITECTURE (Haldenstein, Switzerland) _ The image of
the mountain mystic clings to Peter Zumthor, the former
cabinetmaker and surveyor who is a leader of the new Swiss
architecture. A visit to Zumthor is not unlike a pilgrimage. It can
take all day to traverse the mountain valleys from Zurich to
Haldenstein, a farming hamlet of 700 inhabitants in the
southeastern corner of Switzerland. Here, among the music of
cowbells and barnyard smells, is Zumthor's studio. By Diana
Ketcham.

<P>
   NY-FIRE-PREVENTION (New York) _ Tuesday was a busy day at the
Banco Popular in East Harlem, but Joyce Lynes wasn't lining up for
the teller or ATM machines. She was in a throng surrounding the
table arrayed with fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, a circuit
breaker, coloring books with a fire-safety theme, and stacks of
brochures. As part of an accelerated outreach program in the city's
neighborhoods, the New York City Fire Department was out in force,
trying to turn tragedy into an opportunity to teach a few lessons
about fire prevention. By Julie Iovine.

   FLINTSTONE-HOUSE (Lamy, N.M.) _ Home design can be fraught with
anxiety. In Norah Pierson's case, it was a real cliff-hanger. Known
locally as ``the Flintstone house,'' Ms. Pierson's wondrous
polyurethane-foam creation, which she scales occasionally, might be
thought of as design on the rocks with a twist. Encased in a rocky
shell, the 2300-square-foot home, which the 58-year-old jeweler and
artist designed for herself in this rugged speck of a railroad town
about 20 miles southeast of Santa Fe, may be the only house in
America whose exterior was architecturally inspired by a
50-foot-long, 14-foot-high polyurethane brontosaurus.

   EURO-GLYPH (Undated) _ Trading in the euro _ the first common
European currency since the Roman empire _ began on Monday, and
financial institutions had spent millions getting ready. Even in
Great Britain, not one of the 11 nations using the euro, some
30,000 computer experts worked through the weekend adapting
programs for the new exchange rates, and the Belgian government is
handing out calculators specially designed for the process. So far,
Europe seems to have proven it can smoothly draw on euro bank
accounts, but drawing the euro symbol on yellow pad or computer
screen is another matter. By Phil Patton.

<P>
   URBAN-GARDENS (Paris) _ Zooming up the Champs-Elysees in her
Saab, Kathryn Gustafson, an American landscape architect, stopped
to admire bouquets of roses tightly arrayed in the rear window of a
florist's truck. ``That's a garden, too,'' she said, and she drove
on. New Yorkers had better prepare themselves for such judgments.
Ms. Gustafson, 47, has been handed her first American project, the

CAUGHT IN A POLITICAL TIME LOOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it deja vu, or has time stood still for two weeks? Here I am,
back from a year-end vacation, and the headlines are exactly the
same as they were in mid-December 1998: presidential impeachment,
America vs. Iraq, the usual suspects gearing up for the 2000
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Has the Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky sex scandal really been
around for a year? Is the greatest nation on Earth locked in some
sort of time warp that makes every day just like the day before?
Has real life, as some quipsters have suggested, turned into the
movie ``Groundhog Day,'' with all of us playing the role of the
frustrated weather forecaster who wakes up every morning to
discover that the calendar is stuck on Feb. 2?
</P>
<P>
   The American people _ most of them, anyway _ have been begging
the media and the politicians to let go of the scandal, to deal
with Clinton's misdeeds in some appropriate and proportional manner
and then get on with the business of the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the media love the story too much to let it die _ and
Clinton's political enemies hate him too much to let Monicagate
assume its rightful place on the trash heap of history.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton thus confronts each day as the second U.S. president to
be impeached and the one who could become the first to be removed
from office through the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have repeatedly stated the public's wish that Clinton
remain in office. But the Clinton-haters and their congressional
minions are convinced that if only they can prolong the pursuit,
they can eventually persuade the people to demand the president's
head on a platter _ or at least demand that he turn in his keys to
the White House and crawl back to Arkansas in disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   There can be no other explanation for opposition to Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott's proposal to short-circuit a long and
tedious Senate trial on the articles of impeachment voted by the
House. Figuring that the anti-Clinton forces will never muster the
two-thirds vote needed to convict the president, Lott recommended
disposing of the matter quickly _ without calling witnesses _ and
then taking up the more appropriate alternative of censure.
</P>
<P>
   No way, the Clinton-haters screamed. We need to get Monica into
that Senate chamber to describe every disgusting moment of her
tawdry encounters with Bill. We need to get Linda Tripp to tell the
country under oath what she already told a federal grand jury about
her secondhand perception of the Lewinsky-Clinton affair.
</P>
<P>
   Reasonable citizens might wonder: What possible purpose could
such testimony serve? Doesn't just about every American who hasn't
spent the past 12 months in outer space or in a groundhog burrow
already know every slimy, salacious detail of this scandal?
</P>
<P>
   Don't the American people know that Clinton lied about the
affair _ to us, to Paula Jones' lawyers and even to the grand jury?
</P>
<P>
   Of course we know.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans nevertheless believe that Clinton should be
allowed to finish the term of office to which he was duly elected.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress wants to rebuke him for his pathological lying and
compulsive philandering, fine. Rebuke him till the cows come home.
</P>
<P>
   If archenemy Ken Starr wants to prosecute Clinton, then by all
means the independent counsel should wait by the White House gates
and slap the cuffs on the ex-president when he leaves office in
January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Even folks who believe that Clinton has done a good job as
president concede that he should pay some price for what he did.
</P>
<P>
   But ``some price'' is just not enough for the Clinton-haters.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the makeup of the Senate _ 55 Republicans, 45
Democrats _ suggests that conviction is impossible, the
head-on-a-platter devotees can't stop believing that some way,
somehow, they might prevail.
</P>
<P>
   So they clamor for an all-out Senate trial, clinging to the
desperate hope that one more rehash of the scandal that never ends
will finally cause the rest of us to realize how wrong we've been.

49ERS MUST REPEAT THE RIGHT HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Because your stereotypical modern American
athlete has only as much memory as he needs to get through that
day's workout, there is at least a 50-50 chance that the Atlanta
Falcons will think they are in deep clover this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   For one, they beat the San Francisco 49ers the last time the two
teams played, 31-19, although the tenor of play suggested a wider
margin. For two, they are playing in the unsightly but thoroughly
friendly Georgia Dome where they have won their last 10 games
(after losing 11 of their previous 14), while the 49ers lost their
four road games against playoff opponents this season. And for
three, they have Jamal Anderson, happy, healthy and honking himself
for the MVP trophy.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Falcons are acting the part the 49ers have played
since almost forever.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers, though, have all the memory they could ever use for
the NFC divisional playoff game, which they fully intend to use in
hope of breaking the wills of their upstart betters this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   They have won 11 of their last 14 games with Atlanta, by an
average score of way too much to not even close (36-17, if you're
looking for exactitude). They have held Atlanta at arm's (and
leg's) length for almost the entirety of the last two decades. And
they've been the most persistent postseason entrants in NFL
history, while Atlanta's participation has been not quite sporadic.
</P>
<P>
   Taken another way, the Falcons have 20 players with playoff
experience totaling 76 games. The 49ers have four (Jerry Rice,
Steve Young, Ken Norton and Charles Haley) totaling 78 games, and
still have 198 more left over for the rest of the roster. Smart
folks hired by large networks owned by Australians call that an
intangible.
</P>
<P>
   If only it mattered at the time.
</P>
<P>
   See, the 49ers have all that history at their backs, and it is
handy to know ahead of time and helpful to use during the postgame
show, but that pesky three-hour block between those two stretches
is the part that's unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear about it, but you know once the game starts, you have
no idea,'' safety Tim McDonald said. ``Not to the point where
you'll ever see it in the game. You might see something in the
films the next day where you could say, `Oh, that might have
mattered,' but nothing at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, history breaks at odd points, usually to the benefit of
the lecturer. Why else does nobody measure 49er history in the
pre-1981 period? Because it isn't relevant to playoff discussions,
that's why. But why couldn't you start counting history after their
last Super Bowl, just for the hell of it? Because they turn into
the Kansas City Chiefs, that's why.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, whatever value all that experience and pedigree has, it
loses its meaning once it leaves the broadcast booth, the rec room
or the third stool at Dexter's Midnight Lounge. Fact is,
intangibles here or intangibles there, the Falcons hold most of the
tangibles, from the home-field advantage to the second-ranked
defense to the offense that holds the ball longer and more
efficiently than any other in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``To their credit,'' quarterback Steve Young said, summarizing
the one thing that may negate the Falcons' relative lack of
pressurized living, ``we chased them for two months and never
caught them. They never balked. You have to give them a lot of
credit, they won the division, and rightfully so.''
</P>
<P>
   If you think about it, considering all the history the 49ers can
bring to bear, the Falcons have already beaten back the ghosts of
the past. If the specters of those bad old days didn't crush the
Falcons' spirits as frontrunners in November and December, there is
no sensible reason to think that they'll work now, when all the
measurable advantages are Atlanta's.
</P>
<P>
   No, the 49ers are going to have to work this one strength
against strength, man against man, fist against knee and helmet
against ribs _ without benefit of their long and proud history to
bluff them through the tough spots. They'll have to take an early
lead to force the Falcons to work from behind, and they'll have to
avoid contributing to Atlanta's preposterous plus-20 turnover
ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as head coach Steve Mariucci said when asked how the 49ers
can overcome their struggles on the road: ``You win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, to win, you have to win. Now that's history even
older than the 49ers'.

SPANISH-LANGUAGE RADIO A POPULAR VOICE

By DIANE SMITH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>

   EULESS, Texas _ When Rosalba Medina needs to brush up on events
in her native Mexico, she turns to the same place that keeps her
informed about her home in Euless: Spanish radio.
</P>
<P>
   Medina can tune in to at least nine radio stations in the
Metroplex that broadcast in Spanish. She can learn not only about
the political climate back home but about the latest chapter in
President Clinton's impeachment saga.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to know what's going on,'' said Medina, who
does not speak English fluently.
</P>
<P>
   Across the region, 266,602 Hispanics speak primarily Spanish,
according to federal census data. As the number of Hispanics in
Texas grows, Spanish-language radio helps keep them informed about
everything from the Cowboys to the reconstruction of Honduras in
the wake of Hurricane Mitch to whether Elizabeth Dole could become
the first female U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone listens to the radio,'' said Cesar Ramirez of Euless,
a popular news anchor and reporter on three Spanish-language radio
stations. ``In all parts of the Metroplex, there are Hispanics.
People want to be informed about what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez said his goal is make sure that listeners are not only
up-to-date on what's happening at the local, state and national
levels but to ensure that Hispanics know how events effect them.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas radio market, which includes Tarrant County, ranks
ninth in the United States in the number of Hispanic residents. It
ranks seventh in the number of people who speak primarily Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The area Spanish-language radio industry has gone from
mom-and-pop-type businesses with block programming to
corporate-owned stations that cater to every market niche: sports
talk, religion, news and music. It's a nationwide trend.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, 213 Spanish-language radio stations broadcast in the
United States. Now there are 520, according to Katz Hispanic Media,
a radio sales firm.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics are attracted to the Metroplex by its healthy economy.
Most come from Mexico, but many come from El Salvador, Guatemala
and Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas is growing,'' Ramirez said. ``Immigrants are looking for
a state with opportunity and job potential and money.''
</P>
<P>
   They also long for news of home. So when tragedy strikes in
Mexico or in Central America, Spanish-language radio programs
become valuable information sources to immigrants, said Ramirez,
who started in radio at age 10 in his native Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   When Hurricane Mitch tore through Honduras, Ramirez called a
radio station in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa to get the
news at the source. The result was Honduras La Fabulosa Esta
Contigo, an effort that raised more $80,000, plus food and medical
supplies, for the Central American country.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Day, Ramirez called the Honduran radio station to
wish Hondurans a merry Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch is perhaps the best example of how vital
Spanish-language radio is to Hispanics across Texas, said Dax
Venegas, a consul agent for the Honduran Consulate in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of Hondurans who are here can't speak English,'' Venegas
said. ``The radio is what helps us. We use the radio. It's easier.
All the Hondurans listen to the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation is the same for the estimated 60,000 Salvadorans
who live in the Metroplex. Salvadoran immigrants learned whether
the hurricane damaged their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful to count on that medium,'' said Rosanna
Gutierrez, consul general for El Salvador in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The stations do more than report about tragedies. Hispanic think
tanks were called this week to comment on Elizabeth Dole's chances
of becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that has to do with our people, we send our reporters
to cover those problems _ from abuses to discrimination,'' Ramirez
said.

BOREDOM IS SHELVED WITH COOKBOOKS UNTIL KIDS GROWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people think that our lives change like the seasons:
spring, summer, fall and winter. Others say that we go through
stages from infancy to infantile. I kind of like to think of life
as one long line with a point of origin that swerves and curves
until it extends to areas beyond our sight. That's my philosophical
view. But practically speaking, my life has been divided into two
distinct halves: B.K. and A.K. That's before kids and after kids.
</P>
<P>
   Before kids, I could define the word ``boredom.'' I had many
days, in fact, entire weeks when I had nothing in particular to do
but eat and pay taxes on my purchases. (Keep in mind that I was
young and not gainfully employed.) I did not make lists or own a
day planner. I had a calendar that my insurance agent gave me, and
I would jot down important events like parties and dinner dates. I
didn't really need the calendar, though, because at that time I
could actually remember where I was supposed to be and when. Before
kids, I wore silk and really sheer pantyhose. My car was never
dirty for more than 24 hours. I even prepared food with exotic
spices and sauteed onions from my library of cookbooks.
</P>
<P>
   That was then.
</P>
<P>
   I managed to keep most of my sanity and frilly clothing after
the first child. But since the second one came, well, just stick a
fork in me, 'cause I'm done.
</P>
<P>
   Two parents are no equal for two or more children. My little
emperors just took over the place! Before they could even speak,
they dictated when we slept, if we slept. They decided where we
went and how long we stayed. They changed my wardrobe from Donna
Karan to Don't Kare. Stain on the blouse? Before kids, I changed
blouses. After kids, Don't Kare. Run in the hose? Don't Kare.
Zipper broken? Glue it together and don't drink anything. Places to
go, teachers to see.
</P>
<P>
   I have three wall calendars, a day planner and lists of my
lists, but I still forget that they changed basketball practice
from 5 p.m. to 4 p.m. And cooking is a snap. My mashed potatoes
have potatoes, milk and butter in them _ nothing else. I cannot use
any ingredient that has a different color or texture; they won't
eat it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, what is this stuff?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I just left the skin on some of the potatoes. It's good;
just try it.''
</P>
<P>
   After merely sniffing the potatoes, my kids declare: ``I hate
it. It's nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   My cookbooks are in the attic. For meatloaf, I just take the
ground beef out of the package, lay it on a cookie sheet and bake
it. It's dry and it looks like a cow patty, but that's the only way
they'll eat it. Sometimes I slice the meat, put it on a bun and
call it hamburgers. Come to think of it, that meatloaf and my car
are about the same color. I really need to wash it. I think it was
blue when we bought it.
</P>
<P>
   After kids, I can define the word ``frenetic.'' Did I spell that
right? Actually, what does that mean? I can't remember where the
dictionary is. Maybe it's with those cookbooks in the attic. See
what I mean? I've got to go drink some water now, and wash
yesterday's meatloaf down my throat. Today we're having canned-tuna
souffle.

breaker, coloring books with a fire-safety theme, and stacks of

   FLINTSTONE-HOUSE (Lamy, N.M.) _ Home design can be fraught with
anxiety. In Norah Pierson's case, it was a real cliff-hanger. Known
locally as ``the Flintstone house,'' Ms. Pierson's wondrous
polyurethane-foam creation, which she scales occasionally, might be
thought of as design on the rocks with a twist. Encased in a rocky
shell, the 2300-square-foot home, which the 58-year-old jeweler and
artist designed for herself in this rugged speck of a railroad town
about 20 miles southeast of Santa Fe, may be the only house in
America whose exterior was architecturally inspired by a
50-foot-long, 14-foot-high polyurethane brontosaurus.

30,000 computer experts worked through the weekend adapting
programs for the new exchange rates, and the Belgian government is

Europe seems to have proven it can smoothly draw on euro bank

   BKN-NBA-SETTLE (New York) _ Ledeall on the 11th-hour deal,
reached late Tuesday night, between the players union and the
N.B.A. that will salvage what remains of the 1998-99 season. The

 &HT;    Pyramid power: Eating from the four food groups
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If last month's gorging has given way to this month's cabbage
soup diet, by now you are hungry.
</P>
<P>
   I know. You resolved to lose that five pounds of Christmas
candy, turkey stuffing and eggnog by the end of the month. Or maybe
you've set out to starve off that 20 pounds you picked up last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But tell that to the grumbling gremlin in your stomach. Starving
is no better than bingeing. Balance is the fulcrum of a healthy
diet, a healthy life.
</P>
<P>
   We don't want to stop you from examining or experimenting with
any of the diets out there. But distinguishing between the numbing
number of plans can be difficult, especially if your concept of a
healthy diet is still framed by the ``basic'' four food groups.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows the basic four have been out for a while and that
little pyramid that appears on so many food labels now is in. But
just how much do you know about that pyramid and how much do you or
should you follow it?
</P>
<P>
   ``The pyramid gives a much better visual depiction of what a
healthy diet should look like,'' says Marietta nutritionist
Kathleen Zelman, who developed for us seven daily menus based on
the food guide. Her plan and recipes are inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pyramid shows that the base of your diet should be
primarily vegetarian, with grains, fruits and vegetables,''
explains Zelman. ``The four basic food groups seem to suggest we
should eat equally from all types of food. That isn't the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The pyramid, adopted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in
1992, was the result of a broad effort of nutrition experts across
the country, who relied heavily on research to create a tool that
would be useful to the widest possible audience.
</P>
<P>
   Some nutrition and diet experts have criticized the pyramid for
being too broad; some argue that it's too heavy on carbohydrates or
too vague on fats and oils.
</P>
<P>
   Zelman explains that the pyramid is a tool for building a diet
plan, but that individuals should modify it according to their
health needs.
</P>
<P>
   Some diabetics, for example, may be advised by doctors to pay
careful attention to the types of carbohydrates they consume. And
the pyramid is based on about 2,000 calories a day. Those trying to
lose weight need to choose the lower number of suggested servings
when a range is given and especially limit fats, oils and sweets.
</P>
<P>
   Other pyramids have been created to help address specific
populations, such as vegetarians. In 1993, the World Health
Organization, Harvard School of Public Health and the Oldways
Preservation and Exchange Trust promoted a Mediterranean diet
pyramid that emphasizes grains but distinguishes between types of
meat and fats and allows for wine. Others have been created to
reflect how certain ethnic cuisines, such as Mexican, would work on
the pyramid model.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing all pyramid guides have in common is an emphasis
on what you can eat. ``You can have lots of food. This is not about
deprivation, but rather abundance,'' Zelman said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, six to 11 servings a day of grains and bread are
recommended, along with two to four servings of fruit and three to
five servings of vegetables. Meats are part of the plan but have a
smaller role than we are accustomed to. Servings are small,
totaling only about 5 ounces a day, which moves meat to the side of
the plate rather than the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lot of food. Once you adopt this style, you will
ultimately prefer it,'' Zelman said. ``You will feel full, but you
will feel lighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Take steps toward healthy eating with the diet that's not about
deprivation

<P>
   Chicken Brassica
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings Preparation time: 45 minutes Cooking time: 1
hour
</P>
<P>
   This spicy, sassy preparation of chicken is anything but
ordinary, proving low-fat doesn't mean no-flavor. Greens and things
make this dish hearty and healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Seasoning mix:
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon paprika
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon dried basil
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons onion
</P>
<P>
   powder
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons dried
</P>
<P>
   oregano
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon garlic
</P>
<P>
   powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dry mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon white pepper
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon thyme
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground
</P>
<P>
   coriander
</P>
<P>
   Chicken:
</P>
<P>
   1 chicken (3 pounds), skin and fat removed, cut into 8 pieces
</P>
<P>
   4 cups chopped onion, divided
</P>
<P>
   2 cups chopped green pepper, divided
</P>
<P>
   2 cups sliced mushrooms, divided
</P>
<P>
   3 cups chopped collard greens, divided
</P>
<P>
   3 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 cups defatted chicken stock, divided
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   2 (14 1/2 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl, combine the paprika, basil, salt, onion powder,
oregano, garlic powder, mustard, white pepper, thyme, black pepper
and coriander. Preheat a heavy 5-quart pot, preferably nonstick,
over high heat about 4 minutes. Sprinkle all surfaces of the
chicken evenly with 5 teaspoons of the seasoning mix and rub it in
well. Place the chicken in the pot and cook, turning once, until
browned on all sides, about 10 minutes in all. You may have to cook
the chicken in batches. When the chicken is brown, remove it from
the pot and set it aside.
</P>
<P>
   To the pot, add 2 cups of the onion, 1 cup of the pepper, 1 cup
of the mushrooms, 1 cup of the greens, the bay leaves and the
remaining seasoning mix. Cook, scraping the bottom of the pot
frequently, until the vegetables begin to stick, turn brown and
seem in danger of burning, about 5 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of the
stock, scrape the bottom of the pot clear, and cook, scraping
occasionally, until the stock is almost absorbed, about 6 minutes.
Blend in the flour and cook until it starts to brown, about 3
minutes. Add the tomatoes with their liquid and the remaining
onion, green pepper, mushrooms and collards and bring to a boil.
Add the chicken and any juices that have accumulated.
</P>
<P>
   Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, until done,
approximately 20 minutes. Serve over rice. _ From Paul Prudhomme's

   Pear Cranberry Crisp
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 20 minutes Cooking time:
30-35 minutes
</P>
<P>
   3 very ripe pears, peeled, cored and cut into chunks
</P>
<P>
   1 cup whole cranberries
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup maple syrup
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup oatmeal
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon flour
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup vanilla frozen yogurt
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a medium bowl, combine the
pears, cranberries, maple syrup and lemon juice and toss. Set
aside. In another bowl combine the oatmeal, brown sugar and flour.
Cut in the butter until the consistency resembles coarse crumbs and
the dough just barely holds together. Spoon the cranberry mixture
into an 8-by-8-inch baking dish and spoon the dry mixture over it.
Bake for 10 minutes, or until the topping is brown and crisp.
Reduce the heat to 350 degrees and bake for 20 to 25 minutes more
or until the fruit is bubbling. Serve with vanilla frozen yogurt. _

   Pan Seared Pork Chops
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 5-10 minutes Cooking time:
18-20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Trimmed of its fat, pork is a good lean choice. The key here is
portion size, with each pork chop weighing about 4 ounces. So put
the extra-thick cut away and let the flavor of the wine sauce
satisfy.
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   4 pork chops, trimmed of fat (about 1 pound)
</P>
<P>
   4 sprigs of fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chicken stock or low-sodium canned
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup marsala wine
</P>
<P>
   Combine the salt and pepper and dried thyme and rub on the pork
chops. Press a sprig of thyme into each chop. Heat the olive oil in
a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat and add the pork chops,
thyme side down. Sear 5 to 7 minutes per side, or until just
browned and the interior is no longer bright pink. Transfer to a
warm plate. Pour off the fat from the skillet, return pan to the
heat, add the stock and wine, and bring to a boil. Cook until
slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Spoon the sauce over the pork
chops and serve. _ From Martha Stewart's ``Healthy Quick Cook,''

   Makes 12 muffins Preparation time: 15-20 minutes Cooking time:

</P>
<P>
   Those extra-large muffins from the local bakery you so love to
munch on for breakfast are loaded with fat and sugar. Try to make
smaller and healthier muffins at home, starting with these, which
deliver texture and taste without all the calories. Fresh or frozen
blueberries can be used.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable oil spray
</P>
<P>
   1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup yellow cornmeal
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1 cup blueberries
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup honey
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup skim milk
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Lightly coat 12 muffin cups
with vegetable oil spray or line with paper liners.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, baking
powder, salt and cinnamon. Add the blueberries and toss to coat
with the flour mixture. In a small bowl, whisk the egg with the oil
until smooth. Whisk in the honey and milk.
</P>
<P>
   Add the milk mixture to the flour mixture and stir gently just
until blended, trying not to break the blueberries. Spoon into the
prepared muffin tins and sprinkle the tops with the sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Bake until the muffins are golden and well-risen and a tester
inserted in the center comes out clean, 18 to 22 minutes. Serve
warm, or cool the muffins on a rack and serve at room temperature.
(Freeze for up to 2 weeks.)
</P>
<P>
   Note: If using frozen blueberries, do not thaw them. Simply
rinse off any ice crystals and pat dry gently on paper towels. Toss
separately with about 2 tablespoons of the flour, then stir them in
after adding the liquid to the batter. _ From the American Medical

   Cooking by the pyramid doesn't need to be difficult or dull.
</P>
<P>
   We think one of the best ways to jump-start an eating regimen is
to invigorate your routine with some new dishes. And we know the
best way to control what goes in your mouth is to cook it in your
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, we offer these additions to your recipe file. How
about starting the day with Blueberry Corn Muffins? Leftover lunch
sounds better when it's Lemon, Tuna and White Bean Salad. And what
better way to get your greens than with spicy Chicken Brassica?

   Lemon, Tuna and White Bean Salad
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 25 minutes Standing time: 10
minutes to 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   This makes a light dinner or a satisfying replacement for the
mayonnaise-laden version of tuna salad at lunch. It's easy,
requiring assembly rather than cooking.
</P>
<P>
   2 cans (16 ounces each) cannellini beans or other white beans,
rinsed and drained, or 4 cups cooked cannellini beans
</P>
<P>
   1 medium red onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons bottled clam juice
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons chopped fresh
</P>
<P>
   thyme or 1/2 teaspoon dried
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano or 1/2 teaspoon dried
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon grated lemon peel
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 can (6 ounces) water-packed tuna
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch arugula, rinsed and dried
</P>
<P>
   2 tomatoes, cut into wedges
</P>
<P>
   In a mixing bowl, combine the beans and onion. In a separate
bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, clam juice, oil, thyme,
oregano, lemon peel and pepper. Add the dressing to the beans and
onion, and toss to mix. Add the tuna and parsley and stir gently to
combine, just enough to break the tuna into clumps. Taste and add
the salt if desired. Let the salad stand for 10 minutes to blend
the flavors or refrigerate up to 1 hour before serving. To serve,
spoon over a bed of arugula and garnish with tomato wedges. _ From

</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings Preparation time: 25 minutes Cooking time:
50-60 minutes
</P>
<P>
   When slowly roasted, vegetables caramelize and become sweet,
while garlic softens. You can substitute other firm vegetables,
such as white or sweet potatoes, fennel bulbs or pearl onions.
</P>
<P>
   1 pound carrots (about 8 slender carrots), peeled and cut in
2-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 pound white turnips (about 4 small to medium turnips), peeled
and cut in 2-inch chunks
</P>
<P>
   1 pound winter squash such as Hubbard or butternut, peeled and
cut in 2-inchchunks
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried thyme or 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 whole head of garlic
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a large, shallow roasting pan,
combine the carrots, turnips and squash. Drizzle with the olive oil
and sprinkle with the dried thyme (if using fresh thyme, add later
in recipe), salt and pepper and toss until the vegetables are
well-coated with oil. Break the garlic into individual cloves,
removing and discarding as much of the excess papery outer skin as
possible. Add to the roasting pan and toss with the vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Roast the vegetables, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to
350 degrees and continue to cook, stirring once or twice until the
vegetables are tender and lightly caramelized, 40 to 50 minutes. If
using fresh thyme, sprinkle it over the vegetables during the last
5 minutes of cooking. Season to taste with additional salt and
pepper before serving. Squeeze the garlic out of its skin and
combine it with the other vegetables. _ From the American Medical

   Part soup, part stew, gumbo is a wonderful winter warmer. This

lengthwise. With a melon baller or small, sharp spoon, carefully
scoop out the flesh without tearing the skin. Reserve the skins
(but not the slices).
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, mash the potato with the warm milk. Combine it
well with the ricotta, garlic, salt, pepper, broccoli or spinach
and 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan. Stuff the potato mixture into

 &HT;    Corn and ham team for cool, hot soup
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After she lost her only copy, Mary Beth Reed of
Lithonia (Ga.) requested a repeat of this spicy corn and ham soup
published 10 years ago. The recipe won Edith Shiver of Leary a trip
to the Bahamas back then in the Georgia Farm Bureau Souper Dairy
Recipe Contest in Macon (Ga.). Good hot or cold, this soup even
takes to calorie-cutting: Substitute 4 cups skim milk for the milk
and half-and-half.

 &HT;    Don't overlook Web for weighty matters
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether it's coming from Washington or your bathroom scale,
retribution is in the air. 'Tis the season to pay the piper for all
those lusty holiday indulgences. The candy, the cakes, the cookies,
the nuts, the stuffing, the sweet potato pie, the ham and turkey
sandwiches right before bedtime when you weren't even hungry. It's
time to redress, rehab, re-evaluate, repent and reduce.
</P>
<P>
   It's been estimated that the average person gains 7 or more
pounds over the holidays. That's 7 pounds you don't need as you set
out on the countdown to the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, when slack seems so hard to come by, the prospect of
shaping up may be too daunting. Groveling, sniveling and making
excuses may seem the easy way out. But before you succumb to this
quagmire of shame and despair, check out the Internet, which can be
gentle and forgiving even for the most recalcitrant among us.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, five minutes spent browsing ``The Body Beautiful:
Your Complete Diet and Fitness Center'' at
http://homearts.com/depts
</P>
<P>
   /health/00dietc1.htm and you can't help but pick up at least a
bit of information to put you on the right track. For example,
under ``Restaurant Rx'' there are generic restaurant menus
representing many types of cuisines. Click on something that you
might want to order, then look to the bottom of the page. A
sentence of friendly advice will appear, encouraging you to
``enjoy'' the appetizer of grilled calamari over radicchio but
gently warning you that the excess fat in an entree featuring
broccoli and garlic sauteed in olive oil may undo some of the
health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Next click on the ``Burn Barometer.'' You will find a list of
more than 100 activities from aerobics to golf, housework to yoga
and yes, sex. Enter the amount of time that you spend doing any of
the activities and find out how many calories you have burned.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a wonderfully simple-to-use calorie and nutrition
calculator. Ditto a body mass index calculator. Then there is the
``Fitness Finder.'' Here they ask you to answer some personal
questions to get an idea of your personality and how you feel about
exercise in general. With this information and a click of the
mouse, they come up with an exercise program personally suited to
you.
</P>
<P>
   There are several other departments, including a section on how
to take the fat out of your favorite recipes and lots of great
recipes (like the one below).
</P>
<P>
   Other sites are brimming with fabulous-sounding low-fat recipes
to keep you from feeling deprived. We especially liked
http://www.healthychoice.com/kitchen/html/Kitchen.cfx, which
proclaims: ``To get the most out of life, they say you should seize
the day, or, if that doesn't work, seize the fork.'' Find more
scrumptious low-fat recipes at
http://www.countryliving.com/gh/food/0197lff1.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is http://lyra.simplenet.com/recipes/lowfat.html,
which besides a treasure-trove of low-fat and no-fat recipes offers
an opportunity to chat with others on the same quest.
</P>

   We know misery loves company, but this is turning out to be fun.

<P>
   The Cuban Revolution is now 40 years old, and its anniversary is
all the more remarkable in view of the relative shambles the
country is in.
</P>
<P>
   When Fidel Castro, Che Guevara and the other 1,500-odd members
of the Rebel Army and the 26th of July Movement overthrew Fulgencio
Batista and entered Havana in January 1959, no one could have
predicted that events on the small island would be so far-reaching
and significant.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they led to the Cuban missile crisis, the most severe
confrontation of the Cold War; to daring revolutionary escapades
throughout Latin America and part of Africa; to a four-decade
animosity on the part of the United States; to Castro's outlasting
the attempts of nine U.S. presidents to get rid of him, one way or
another.
</P>
<P>
   It is truly an exceptional feat to have survived, and the
authors of the revolution can at least take solace in that. Not in
much else, at this stage, which is why perhaps a reassessment of
the Cuban epic's true legacy and impact, at least in Latin America,
is relevant today.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, for a movement that prided itself on being truly
political, and on radiating its political influence throughout the
hemisphere, Cuba today exists in Latin America through its cultural
influence.
</P>
<P>
   The revolution's political impact now is mostly limited to the
displays of small crowds that congregate outside the hotels where
Castro chooses to rest on his sporadic forays into the region. If
Cuba once ignited passions of hatred and mistrust, or inspired
thousands to give their lives for an ideal, today it can barely
cajole Latin American governments to half-heartedly condemn the
U.S. embargo.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s nearly everyone _ from Mexican national hero Lazaro
Cardenas to Jean-Paul Sartre and Stokely Carmichael _ made the
pilgrimage to Havana. Today the swarms of revolutionaries,
intellectuals and advisers from the golden age of glory are nowhere
in sight. What you see instead are middle-age Spanish, Italian and
Mexican tourists who come to take advantage of Cuba's beautiful
beaches, cheap prices and readily available sex.
</P>
<P>
   While the Cuban cultural presence is far less than it was 30
years ago, or even as recently as the 1980s, the island's sway
among writers, singers, painters, academics, poets, actors and TV
and movie directors is still disproportionate to its tiny size and
meager resources.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the paradox: the Cuban Revolution has left a much more
lasting imprint among novelists than political ideologues, among
painters than student activists, among musicians than labor
organizers _ in short, among cultural than political figures.
</P>
<P>
   Having once wielded enormous influence over the politics of
Latin America and to an extent the world, today Cuba's strategic
value is highly reduced: Russia prefers IMF dollars to
nuclear-tipped missiles pointed at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   And yet hundreds of graduates from Gabriel Garcia Marquez's
School of Cinema and Television in San Antonio de los Banos are
scattered across the influential cities of Latin America. At the
University of Buenos Aires, a Che Guevara rotating chair
inaugurated in early 1997 still attracts hundreds of attentive
students. In Mexico, La Jornada, the mass-circulation daily where
Carlos Fuentes and Octavio Paz published their columns and
commentaries on current events as recently as five years ago,
continues to flaunt its enthusiasm for everything Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller than ever, but nonetheless impressive number of Latin
America's most distinguished cultural icons remain fast and true
friends of Cuba _ from Garcia Marquez to Chilean playwright Ariel
Dorfman, from Ecuadorian painter Guayasamin to Uruguayan
teeny-bopper idol and best-selling novelist Mario Benedetti, from
Brazilian songwriter and folk hero Chico Buarque to the dean of
Latin American sociologists, Mexico's Pablo Gonzalez Casanova.
</P>
<P>
   The continued loyalty to Cuba of these and many other major
figures on the Latin American cultural scene stems in part from the
status and activities of the region's intelligentsia. During the
long night of authoritarian rule in Latin America, intellectuals
frequently spoke out at home and abroad against abuses and
atrocities, and helped to replace banned or weakened political
parties. When democratization finally arrived, that role greatly
diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Cuban regime is now so discredited in Latin
American politics that the most a fellow traveler to Cuba can get
away with is to call for an end to the U.S. embargo and harassment
from Miami; but in the field of culture there is greater leeway.
Artists are less accountable to the public than politicians, who
have to face the media and the voters. Artists and performers face
only their audience and youthful, radical fans, most of whom tend
to share their political views. Few openly pro-Cuban politicians
are left in Latin America, but there are still many pro-Cuban
cultural figures.
</P>
<P>
   The festive times of the Cuban Revolution ended many years ago,
as did the heyday of its influence _ political, cultural and
otherwise. What remain are memories and regrets, as well as
vestiges of a singular experience in Latin America history: the way
in which a small island with no particular claim to fame was
transformed into a cultural beacon and haven for many of the
greatest writers the region has ever known, and for some of its
finest thinkers, musicians and painters.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it is perhaps a fitting tribute to Cuba and to Che
Guevara that they both made a greater mark in the shining field of
Latin culture than in the mundane, mediocre world of politics.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a new, emerging left in Latin America, it is largely
because the Cubans have been banished from political life in the
hemisphere. But if the region's cultural realm maintains its
marvelous vitality, it is partly because of Cuba's contribution to
it.

scientist, is the author of the best-selling ``Companero: The Life
and Death of Che Guevara.'' Castaneda lives in New York and Mexico

   Even so, the Cuban regime is now so discredited in Latin
American politics that the most a fellow traveler to Cuba can get
away with is to call for an end to the U.S. embargo and harassment
from Miami; but in the field of culture there is greater leeway.
Artists are less accountable to the public than politicians, who
have to face the media and the voters. Artists and performers face
only their audience and youthful, radical fans, most of whom tend
to share their political views. Few openly pro-Cuban politicians
are left in Latin America, but there are still many pro-Cuban
cultural figures.
</P>
<P>
   The festive times of the Cuban Revolution ended many years ago,
as did the heyday of its influence _ political, cultural and
otherwise. What remain are memories and regrets, as well as
vestiges of a singular experience in Latin America history: the way
in which a small island with no particular claim to fame was
transformed into a cultural beacon and haven for many of the
greatest writers the region has ever known, and for some of its
finest thinkers, musicians and painters.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it is perhaps a fitting tribute to Cuba and to Che
Guevara that they both made a greater mark in the shining field of
Latin culture than in the mundane, mediocre world of politics.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a new, emerging left in Latin America, it is largely
because the Cubans have been banished from political life in the
hemisphere. But if the region's cultural realm maintains its
marvelous vitality, it is partly because of Cuba's contribution to
it.

NET PRESENCE: IF NO ONE SEES A WEB SITE, IS IT REALLY THERE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Homesteading on the World Wide Web can be a lonely proposition.
</P>
<P>
   I learned this the hard way, when a book I wrote caught the
attention of a stranger named Greg O'Brien. First, O'Brien sent me
fan e-mail. One thing led to another, and before long, O'Brien, a
software consultant in Marlborough, Mass., who is well versed in
the Web, was volunteering to build a Web site for the book.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't have been more pleased. The book _ ``The House at the
Bridge'' (Scribner, 1995), a nonfiction work about Germany in the
wake of reunification _ had long since disappeared from Books in
Print. A Web site might be just the way to give it new life.
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, not long after O'Brien entered my life, the
online retailer Amazon.com started a new program for out-of-print
books in which an author or small publisher, armed with cartons of
unsold copies, could become the distributor, shipping books in
batches as small as two or three for Amazon to sell when ordered.
The Web site, O'Brien and I decided, would feature a link to
Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   After a month or so of working in his spare time, O'Brien
created a rich, visually engaging Web site, complete with sketches,
photographs, prose from the book, a bibliography and links to other
sites. I expected that dozens of scholars, students and anyone with
a more than casual interest in modern Germany would come to the
site every day, using it as an efficient source of information and
perhaps even buying the book through Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   That is not what happened.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with erecting a virtual shrine to your out-of-print
book, unpublished novel, love of border collies or anything at all
is that the mere existence of the site does not mean anyone will go
there.
</P>
<P>
   If Yahoo, with more than a million visits daily, is as visible a
destination as the Eiffel Tower, then home-brewed sites like mine
are like so many identical trees in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, don't count on people stumbling across your
site. They will find it only if they are looking for it.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing exactly how many people were visiting the site was easy.
Soon after the site went up, in May 1998, O'Brien devised a way to
monitor traffic, through a service called Nedstat
(usa.nedstat.net). Nedstat not only tells you how many visitors, or
page views, your site gets each day; it also breaks down the
statistics into page views per hour and page views per week and
presents the results in colorful bar charts.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien pointed me to the Nedstat link on a day last fall. When
I went there, I found a prediction for the day's traffic.
``Forecast for today: nine page views.''
</P>
<P>
   That was sobering news, especially considering that several of
the page views came from O'Brien himself as he walked the virtual
grounds of his creation. The high point came on Nov. 9, the
anniversary of the fall of the Berlin wall: 25 visits.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic on www.thehouseatthebridge.com needed a boost.
</P>
<P>
   For months I had been receiving junk e-mail from various
companies offering to increase Web site traffic. The most
persistent entreaty came from an outfit called Traffic Accelerator.
The offer was difficult to refuse: for $39.95 my site would be
submitted to 900 search engines and directories. I perused the site
(which is no longer functioning under that URL) _ and began to
surrender my credit card information.
</P>
<P>
   As I clicked through the sign-up process, the service tried to
goad me into buying the far more expensive $159.95 option, which
promised to resubmit the site repeatedly over several months. I
resisted, and stuck with the $39.95 one-time service.
</P>
<P>
   I asked O'Brien to help me monitor the results. Yes, he had
heard of these submission services, he told me. I wondered aloud if
the server he used for the site would be able to withstand the
increase in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, a taciturn man to begin with, went dead silent.
Finally, he said gently, ``Don't be disappointed if it doesn't
amount to much.'' He said he had already submitted the site to
several of the major search sites and directories, like Yahoo, Alta
Vista, Lycos and Infoseek.
</P>
<P>
   But surely the 896 others would yield some new traffic. A few
days after buying the service, I called up the Nedstat page.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic had not risen that day. In fact, it had reached an
all-time low of six visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The traffic that did increase was my e-mail. A few messages came
from sites that must have received my submission because they were
writing to invite me to visit the link they had created. But when I
went to look for it, I found nothing. Further, the sites I visited
_ devoted to direct marketing and country music _ had no
discernible connection to Germany, modern or medieval.
</P>
<P>
   More unsettling, many of the sites looked unsavory. Still worse,
for the next couple of weeks, I was spammed with e-mail from dozens
of other submission services.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic on my site, in the meantime, held steady at about 10
visits a day. Despondent, I called my friend Nate Saal, who runs a
Web-based software updating service in Palo Alto, Calif. When I
explained my problem, Saal told me, almost apologetically, that his
site got tens of thousands of visitors each day.
</P>
<P>
   He offered this advice: ``You need to narrow down the market so
that people who might be interested in your topic find out about
your site.'' He suggested that I find other sites devoted to the
Berlin wall and offer to create a reciprocal link.
</P>
<P>
   Saal also stressed word-of-mouth advertising. ``Create a means
and a reason for people to tell others,'' he said. Saal, for
instance, had created a ``tell a friend'' page on his site, making
it easy for people to tell friends about the site and giving them a
chance to win a T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   I rejected the T-shirt idea but took his advice about reciprocal
links and sent e-mail to people whose Germany and Berlin wall pages
were prominently featured in search engines, offering to link to
them in exchange for a link to me. I heard nothing in reply.
</P>
<P>
   I continued, compulsively you might say, to call up the Nedstat
page, thinking there might be a delayed effect from the submission
service. No such luck.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I called Evan I. Schwartz, a writer whose book,
``Webonomics'' (Broadway Books, 1997), is closely tied to his Web
site, Webonomics.com. If anyone could give me tips for
cross-promoting a Web site and a book, Schwartz could.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do people know about your Web site?'' I asked. Schwartz
replied: ``The URL is on the book. It's in big red fluorescent
letters on the back.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of my book, published a good year before URLs
started showing up on dust jackets, that was a moot point. Schwartz
also offered his opinion about search engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a firm believer that people don't find things through
search engines,'' he said. He explained that tens of thousands of
sites contained any of my key words and phrases _ Berlin wall,
modern Germany, Potsdam, World War II. ``You're a needle in a
haystack,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While I was on the phone with Schwartz, an e-mail message
arrived with ``Link Request'' in the subject line: ``Hi. I am Larry
Steele and I just visited your site at
http://vancouver-webpages.com/global-URL-list.html and thought we
might help each other. Your prospect is similar to mine; someone
interested in his or her appearance. Would you consider putting a
link on your site to mine at http://www.logsdons.com/hair? We have
a very special video called `No More Bad Hair Days.' Here is copy
of our advertisement to help you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure. Why not?

FOR HELP WITH A BENEFITS PACKAGE, HELP YOURSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., Md., N.Y., Fla., Conn., Calif., Mass.)   (af)  
 By SUSAN J. WELLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At many companies and government agencies, open-enrollment
season _ that annual ritual in which workers choose or change their
employer-sponsored benefits for the coming year _ has just ended.
Some employees may leaf through plan summaries or peruse
health-care provider directories to make their choices, but at an
increasing number of companies, employees are doing things
differently.
</P>
<P>
   These tasks are, or soon will be, completed electronically, from
the desktop at the click of a mouse, and by the people getting the
benefits, not by human resource departments.
</P>
<P>
   At the Oracle Corp., the Boeing Co. and Charles Schwab &AMP; Co.,
for example, workers surf internal corporate computer networks and
Web sites set up by benefit providers to check their 401(k) account
balances, switch health-care plans or update W-4 forms, all tasks
that were once exclusively the job of human resources employees.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies, like the Marriott Corp. and Anheuser-Busch
Companies, are using self-service call-in centers that link
employees with benefits data; many of these systems present
employees with a series of menus that enable them to make benefit
choices.
</P>
<P>
   Known in the industry as employee self-service, this self-help
notion is quickly sweeping the workplace, as companies use
technology to shift the responsibility for many benefits-related
tasks directly to employees.
</P>
<P>
   Employers embrace the notion as a way to automate their human
resources departments, cutting costs and increasing efficiency.
Employees either like it or hate it. Some find it empowering to be
able to see their files and change their choices. But others find
it frustrating to be left to sort out the merits of an insurance
plan on their own, trying to decipher the coverage limits described
on an insurer's Web site without the benefit of a human being to
help explain them.
</P>
<P>
   That inherent tension leads some observers to question whether
low-tech human assistance is better than high-tech self-help in the
area of employee benefits, or in at least some parts of the
benefits process. And experts and users seem divided on whether
these self-service systems guarantee employees the depth of
information they need to make timely benefits decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen corporations try to replace the human touch with
technology, and it doesn't always work,'' said Donna Malinak,
president and chief executive of Forward Mobility, a management
consulting company in Bernardsville, N.J. ``I don't believe that
one can completely replace the other.''
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is certain: companies are quickly moving in that
direction. Automating benefits through Web-based technology, called
virtual HR (for human resources), is growing fast. Fifty percent of
466 companies surveyed now conduct at least some human resources
transactions over the Web, nearly double the rate in 1997,
according to a survey conducted last year by Watson Wyatt
Worldwide, a consulting company in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The use of Web-based applications outpaces other methods like
interactive voice-response systems and free-standing kiosks that
offer workers access to their files, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very clear that this is where companies are
going,'' said Steve McCormick, the virtual HR consultant at Watson
Wyatt. ``To the extent that it has a network and PCs, I think every
company intends to move toward some type of self-service of its HR
functions.''
</P>
<P>
   Cost savings are driving the trend. McCormick cited a large
pharmaceutical company that had moved parts of its benefits
information on line through a local corporate network after
figuring that it spent $16.40 each time it had to process an
address change filed on paper. When the company multiplied that
times its estimated 100,000 address changes a year, ``the cost
savings become just so obvious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moving data on line can also give employees easier access to
their benefits files so they do not have to wait for a paper
statement. Schlumberger Limited, an oil-field services company
based in New York, offers its 16,000 employees in the United States
24-hour access to personal benefits information through its
interactive Web-based system. Employees can conduct investment
research, change 401(k) contribution rates or send e-mail to their
benefits administrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest gain is that employees can have access when they
need to make a decision,'' said Lillian Petty, Schlumberger's
benefits manager for North America. ``There's a difference between
pushing information to employees or letting them pull out what they
want.''
</P>
<P>
   The site, called the Schlumberger Automated Benefits Link, has
received an average of 320 visits per day since it opened in May.
Next up: full benefits enrollment on line this year. ``Our goal is
to have paperless benefits administration,'' Ms. Petty said.
</P>
<P>
   That is an attractive goal for any business, but can it work for
every employee at every company, even those who do not have daily
access to personal computers or phones at work?
</P>
<P>
   Such a shift can present a classic divide between haves and
have-nots, people who have studied the trend say: employees with
computers have access to information that those on the shop floor
do not. In that case, companies must take a different approach. At
Schlumberger, for example, 52 self-service kiosks at its
manufacturing centers give employees without computers access to
the information that is available to other workers on line.
</P>
<P>
   A similar approach is being taken by Hard Rock Cafe
International, a restaurant chain based in Orlando, Fla. It plans
to introduce an interactive CD this month that will carry
information on all company benefits, including its 401(k) and
health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The CDs will be sent to its 45 restaurants and played at
publicly available monitors at kiosks in break rooms. Kitchen
training is already conducted via interactive CDs at all the
restaurants. The videos are interactive; by using touch screens,
Hard Rock employees will be able to learn about their benefits
programs and monitor the growth of their retirement-plan
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told ourselves that we could continue to do it with our
current method _ shipping at least 6,000 benefits kits to
employees, holding two to three meetings a year with each
restaurant and traveling to and from _ or we could look at our own
motto, `Save the Planet,' and put a stop to all this paper,'' said
Anthony Amato, director of compensation and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Amato estimated that the company used six tons of paper, at a
cost of 20 cents per page, to inform employees about benefits each
year. ``When we added up how much we were spending, it was clear
what we needed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees will be able to watch the CD at their leisure and get
answers to benefits questions by entering a personal identification
number and password, Amato said. ``Our goal is a real self-service
center with consistent and consolidated information that employees
can rely on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of self-service benefits for employees is not new,
but its acceptance has been slowed somewhat by a persistent image
problem, Year 2000 compliance problems and by the need for
companies to invest in Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more than enough technology to bring this about,''
said Joel Lapointe, vice president for management consulting at the
Hunter Group in Baltimore. He said he coined the self-service
phrase and developed the concept in the 1980s, and many of his
peers in the industry agree with that. ``The roadblock continues to
be a culture-acceptance problem,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, employees who are comfortable with technology enjoy
having access to their own information and control over it, and
they want more of it, Lapointe said. ``Employees know that
companies have these sets of data about them,'' he said, ``but the
source of the data is always the employee _ it all belongs to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some workers may think that the trend shifts
to the employee an unwanted chore that used to be management's job,
say consultants who have worked on the new systems.
</P>
<P>
   One person who has studied management and employee benefits is
Richard Hadden, president of Corporate Education Systems in
Jacksonville, Fla., and co-author of ``Contented Cows Give Better
Milk: The Plain Truth About Employee Relations and Your Bottom
Line'' (Saltillo Press, 1998). Employees tend to see this newfound
empowerment as either ``enablement or abandonment,'' Hadden said.
``If it enables them to do better things, that's good. If it leaves
them feeling abandoned, that can be detrimental. If employees can't
use or perceive they can't get what they need, which is so often
the case with benefits issues, they'll be frustrated, and
abandonment sets in.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have tried to take steps to address that problem.
In 1995, Marriott, based in Bethesda, Md., began a telephone
benefits-enrollment system called Marriott Telephone Information
and Enrollments, or Martie. Marriott's 100,000 employees can enroll
in a health plan or change their choices by using touch-tone
phones.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's system also lets workers bypass the
voice-response system and reach a person at any time during the
call, said Maureen Brookbank, vice president for benefits planning
at Marriott.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to know that a person is available if I need one,
but it's also nice not to have to go through them as a required
part of getting the job done,'' said Laura Paugh, 44, vice
president for investor relations at Marriott, who joined the
company in 1980, when benefits enrollment was handled on paper by
the human resources department.
</P>
<P>
   Once employees have chosen benefits through Martie, a written
confirmation of what they have signed up for is sent to them for
their approval.
</P>
<P>
   Being user-friendly also helps. Employees asked Marriott to
simplify the language explaining the new system by substituting
phrases like ``the people at Martie'' for ``Martie customer service
representatives'' and ``push-button steps'' rather than
``touch-tone telephone instructions.''
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining the privacy of the data is also an issue of concern.
At Schlumberger, for instance, an automatic password security check
is done each time an employee logs on to retrieve personal
information. If the check determines that the password can be
easily broken, a message appears warning the employee that the code
is weak and suggesting that a more secure one be devised.
</P>
<P>
   Experts acknowledge that the concept of self-service employee
benefits is still in its early stages and that managers are still
grappling with how to make employees feel at ease with the idea and
master the technology.
</P>
<P>
   And the technology itself is still evolving, said Susan
Obijiski, an analyst with the Gartner Group, technology consultants
in Stamford, Conn. Many companies do not have the technology to
support self-service systems based on the Web or are relying on the
decades-old technology of voice-response systems _ which Lapointe
said could become ``voice-mail jail'' as callers got trapped in a
seemingly endless maze of menu choices and button-pressing.
</P>
<P>
   The companies offering software packages that give workers
access to their own records via Web browsers include the Edify
Corp. in Santa Clara, Calif., Seeker Software in Oakland, Calif.,
and Foundation Technologies in Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A survey made public last month by Benefits Access, a benefits
administration company in Hartford that is a subsidiary of the
Cigna Corp. of Philadelphia, found that 60 percent of 906 benefits
managers of companies with 1,000 to 10,000 employees wished that
they could provide workers with enough information to make and
manage their own benefits decisions. Only 42 percent of the
respondents said their employees were fully satisfied with the
service they received from their benefits departments.
</P>
<P>
   Does that suggest that automating the process would improve
things? Maybe, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   ``On-line benefits has a lot of potential, but not if you lose
the end user in the process,'' said Ms. Malinak, of Forward
Mobility. ``It's important for employers to be able to provide both
low-tech and high-tech options for getting employees the
information they need to make decisions.''

FILMMAKING, MINUS THE CAMERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You enter a musty-looking building that looks as if it is about
to fall down around you and continue down a dark hallway until you
see an aged security guard snoozing at his desk. Dread and
anticipation fill the air as he wakes up and looks you over. Is he
going to whip out a rifle and blast you?
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Instead, he invites you to look around the building _ a
run-down film school that is closed for the summer _ and learn the
art of filmmaking. So goes an early scene in How to Make Your
Movie: An Interactive Film School, a CD-ROM set with a clever new
multimedia approach to learning how movies are put together.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is clearly educational, the program, from Electronic
Vision, has made the rounds of the film festivals and was
demonstrated at the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado and the San
Francisco International Film Festival last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rajko Grlic, a filmmaker who also holds the title of Eminent
Scholar in Film at Ohio University, worked with Tom Erlewine, a
program designer at Electronic Vision, to create the software.
</P>
<P>
   The Interactive Film School set, created with a filmmaker's eye,
is spread over four ``floors'' of the building in 12 ``rooms.''
Different rooms are devoted to learning about research,
screenwriting and pre-production. The equipment room demonstrates
different kinds of lighting, like a key light and fill light.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a virtual light meter that the user can position
on different parts of the screen to test a variety of camera
settings. Students at this school also learn the vocabulary of
film, including those movie-credit favorites ``gaffer'' and ``best
boy.'' Throughout the course, the program shows the progress and
various elements that go into the making of a sample student film,
``Pasta Paolo.''
</P>
<P>
   The story behind the software is almost as interesting as the
actual program. The gritty, rambling building used as the interior
of the Film School is actually an abandoned 19th-century mental
institution near Athens, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs were taken of the building's rooms and hallways,
with the Film School's materials digitally added to the pictures.
Inventive text displays like sticky notes, typed sheets and
hand-scrawled notes pop up on the walls and doors. There is even a
grimy bathroom with a paper towel dispenser that doles out
film-history trivia questions on the towels. In addition, 2,000
graphics and 100 Quicktime digital movies were created for program.
</P>
<P>
   How to Make Your Movie sells for $89.95 and can be purchased
from Electronic Vision at (800) 516-9361 or at
www.interactivefilmschool.com. The program runs on Windows 95 and
Power Macintosh. The kit has three CD-ROMs and a spiral-bound
production notebook for users to keep track of their course
progress.
</P>
<P>
   The notebook serves as a checklist for the course and also
provides training exercises for the student to practice with a
video camera. One CD has film clips and sound files for the student
to practice editing together.
</P>
<P>
   The program is not intended as a substitute for film school
(several film schools do advertise within the program) but as a
primer, albeit an extensive one. The creators say that on average,
How to Make Your Movie should take a year to complete. And after
that final wrap, you can even print out your own diploma.

WHEN THE BAD AREN'T PREYING ON THE GOOD
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Hark, the heralds are singing good news about decreasing crime
in America.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI reported last month that serious crime dropped 5 percent
in the first half of 1998, extending a six-year trend of declining
criminal activity. Using preliminary figures from police
departments nationwide, the FBI showed drops in all seven major
crime categories.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious question to follow such remarkable news is: ``Why?
What are we doing that is contributing to this decline?''
</P>
<P>
   Academic experts, law enforcement authorities and elected
officials are quick to cite a litany of reasons that contributed to
the decline, without pointing specifically to one factor. The aging
of the baby boomers beyond their crime-prone years; community
policing programs; zero-tolerance efforts and stiffer sentences,
particularly for young offenders; a strong economy; and a reduction
in crack cocaine use and the gang wars that occurred between groups
selling the stuff _ all are listed as reasons for turning the
corner on criminal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously absent, however, from the tune being sung by
officials trumpeting the good news is the increase in the number of
states that allow law-abiding citizens to carry concealed guns.
</P>
<P>
   It makes perfect sense that people bent on doing harm will think
twice before attacking others who might efficiently and effectively
defend themselves. Shouldn't that consideration be included in any
explanation for why serious, violent crime may be dropping in this
country?
</P>
<P>
   Heaven forbid that someone in officialdom should present a
possibly unbiased account of what personal gun ownership might mean
in the grand scheme of the better America.
</P>
<P>
   The removal of personal firearms was sure-as-shooting part of
the reason why the crime rate in Australia is rising. In 1997, the
Australian government enacted a law that forced gun owners to
surrender personal firearms. According to the Australian Institute
of Criminology, more than 640,000 guns (including .22-caliber
rifles and shotguns) were destroyed in a program that cost the
government more than $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since the ban went into effect, criminal activity
Down Under has increased dramatically. On Oct. 28, the ``Sydney
Morning Herald'' reported that homicides were up 3.2 percent,
assaults were up 8.6 percent and armed robberies were up a whopping
44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It does not take a Y2K computer reprogrammer to calculate the
correlation between an armed citizenry and crime rates. Italian
jurist and criminologist Cesare Beccaria figured it out more than
two centuries ago when he wrote ``On Crimes and Punishments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real
advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would
take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may
drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction,''
Beccaria wrote in 1764.
</P>
<P>
   ``The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a
nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor
determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have
the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most
important of the code, will respect the less important and
arbitrary ones .... Such laws make things worse for the assaulted
and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than
to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with
greater confidence than an armed man.''
</P>
<P>
   Beccaria was highly respected by his American contemporaries,
men who would go on to play significant roles in the development of
this nation's ideas of personal rights, liberties and defining
laws. John Adams quoted from his text; Thomas Jefferson kept a
written copy of it, in the original Italian, in his ``Commonplace
Book,'' according to Les Adams, author of the Second Amendment
Primer.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits who contend that the Second Amendment of the
Constitution has nothing to do with personal firearm ownership need
to go back and read the works of the historical figures who
influenced the thinking and philosophies of this nation's Founding
Fathers. The only governments that prefer their citizens to be
unarmed are tyrannies and despotisms.
</P>
<P>
   The next time a government report is issued citing reasons for a
downturn in crime, remember this basic, ages-old reality: Bad
people are reluctant to prey on good people who are likely to
strike back.

<P>
   In a house the electrical wires run from the main service panel
to receptacles, switches and fixtures. The National Electrical Code
specifies that the wires must be protected with either heavy-duty
plastic vinyl sheathing, flexible armored sheathing or metal
conduit.
</P>
<P>
   Few circuits run from the panel to a receptacle without an
in-line wiring connection. The code also specifies that these
connections must be contained in an approved galvanized steel or
plastic box. Similar boxes are available for switches and
receptacles.
</P>
<P>
   The code requires that the boxes be mounted on framing members
and that they remain accessible. Therefore they should never be
covered with drywall, paneling or any wall covering.
</P>
<P>
   Electrical boxes are available in different shapes (rectangular,
square and octagonal) and in several depths. Each box must be large
enough to accommodate the receptacle and all the wires without
crimping or damaging the connections. Undersized boxes should be
upgraded with larger boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Since exposed connections pose a fire hazard, homeowners should
check the wiring in their houses to make sure that there are no
open splices. Generally this is not a problem in newer homes --
although electricians sometimes leave an exposed splice in
unfinished basements or utility rooms. The problem is more acute in
older homes, because the wiring may have been installed before many
building codes were in effect.
</P>
<P>
   Installing an electrical box is not difficult. The first step
whenever working on any electrical circuit is to make sure the
power is turned off. Do this by flipping the appropriate circuit
breaker or removing the correct fuse. Avoid touching any bare wires
until you have tested the circuit to make sure that it is indeed
cold.
</P>
<P>
   You can test the circuit with a circuit tester. Carefully remove
any electrical tape or solderless nuts to expose the wire
connections, then touch one probe of the circuit tester to the
black connection, the other probe to the white connection. The
tester light should not glow. If it does, return to the service
panel and try another breaker. After making certain that the
electricity is off, uncouple all the splices.
</P>
<P>
   Steel boxes have ''knockouts'' _ disks that are not completely
cut loose from the sides of the box. These can be punched or
knocked out with a steel punch to make an opening for the incoming
wires. Punch out one opening for each cable entering the box; leave
the other knockouts in place.
</P>
<P>
   Anchor the box to a nearby framing member (Junction boxes have
small holes so you can nail or screw them to a stud or joist).
Thread a cable clamp onto each cable, then tighten the clamps with
a screwdriver. Be careful not to overtighten the clamp or you could
damage the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Push the wire into the box so the threaded end of the clamp
protrudes inside. Each cable clamp has a locknut that must be
screwed on from inside the box. Tighten the locknuts pushing
against the lugs on the sides of the nut with a screwdriver.
</P>
<P>
   When all the cables are securely in place, make the connections
inside the box. Use solderless connectors (also called wire nuts)
to join the wires together. First twist the wires together, using
needlenose pliers, then screw the connector onto the twisted wires.
When the connector is in place, it should completely cover the bare
wire ends.
</P>
<P>
   If the circuit has ground wires _ usually these are bare copper
wires _ connect them together and add a short length of wire to run
from the connection to the green grounding screw on the back of the
junction box. Carefully push all the wires inside the box and
attach a cover plate. Return to the service panel and turn on the
power.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to protecting the connections inside, junction boxes
also provide mounting points to attach light fixtures. Actually,
modern electrical codes now prohibit mounting a fixture directly to
the junction box. Instead, it should be bolted to a mounted strap
that is anchored to the box.
</P>
<P>
   To install a low-voltage thermostat or a doorbell system, you
will need to connect a step-down transformer to an existing
circuit. You can tap the transformer into a power circuit through a
junction box. First turn off the power, then remove a knockout from
the box. Thread the transformer wires through the hole and connect
them to the appropriate circuit wires. When the connections are
made, replace the cover and restore power.

<P>
   The camera glides in on a tableau, Jesus and his apostles
gathered solemnly at a long table, each frozen in painterly poses
familiar from ``The Last Supper.'' Then Jesus suddenly comes to
life, and in a flurry of special effects that owes more to Dali
than da Vinci, he miraculously provides a banquet of breads,
crackers and grapes from thin air and transforms water into a
blood-red wine cooler called New Testament. Along the way, he
transforms himself into a robed pitch man for the new bottled
beverage.
</P>
<P>
   This scene was not created by a major Hollywood studio or a
costly special effects company like Industrial Light and Magic.
Instead, this sequence, part of a five-minute, award-winning parody
of American advertising excess called ``New Testament,'' is the
work of a two-person production house called Swankytown.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a tide of new digital technology for filmmakers,
Swankytown's founders say, they were able to complete the entire
project with an ordinary 16-millimeter camera, two Power Macs and
some off-the-shelf software at a cost of $1,700.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing new these days about digital technology's
marriage with the movies. Moviegoers have been getting an eyeful of
digital wonders on the big screen, from ``Titanic'' to ``A Bug's
Life.'' But those displays of digital wizardry were managed by
filmmakers with tens of millions of dollars at their disposal for
the tedious tasks involved.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side of the digital revolution, one that is just
starting to make its presence felt, is the democratizing effect
that cheaper and easier-to-use technology is having on control over
the moving image.
</P>
<P>
   In living rooms, basements and makeshift studios, people are
taking advantage of powerful home computers stuffed with extra RAM
and pumped up with gigabytes of hard drive memory to add sound and
motion to digital images. Some are transferring film to video,
where images, once digitized, can be cut with editing software and
enhanced with easy-to-use animation programs.
</P>
<P>
   Others use digital video camcorders _ small, relatively
inexpensive cameras that can load their already digitized images
into computer hard drives _ to breathe cinematic life into what had
once flickered only in their imaginations, then transfer the
results to film. Some movie makers have given up on film
altogether, choosing instead to shoot, edit and, in some cases,
distribute their work digitally.
</P>
<P>
   Digital technology has led to a new, decentralized approach to
making movies: desktop filmmaking. Computer technology can
transform a process that has been mostly mechanical and chemical,
labor-intensive and very expensive, into a mostly electronic
process. So cinematic visions can now be achieved by manipulating
digital code, lines of ones and zeros.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of years ago, with the same talent we have now, we
didn't have these kinds of tools available to us,'' said Philip
Pelletier, who with his partner, Verne Lindner, created Swankytown
Productions in Hollywood in 1997. ``Back then, `New Testament'
would have been impossible.'' Pelletier, a composer by training,
and Ms. Lindner, an illustrator who taught herself computer
animation and special effects, estimate that with traditional
filming, editing and special effects techniques, their movie would
have cost closer to $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Pelletier said he had decided to make this particularly
irreverent film because he wanted to raise an issue: ``Is
everything up for sale?'' So far, Pelletier said, ``New Testament''
has drawn little protest.
</P>
<P>
   It was recently shown at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los
Angeles in a program that examined alternative depictions of Jesus
in media. And it was a winner at numerous film festivals last year,
including the New York Funny Shorts Fest. It has brought Swankytown
loads of work and a Hollywood agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Testament,'' which continues to be seen at film festivals,
is also on the Internet (www.swankytown.com). Other digitally
produced independent films are being shown on television and in
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Ascher and Michael Garon, who bill themselves as Rodney
and Syd, made ``Somebody Goofed'' by amassing images taken from
drawings, magazines, encyclopedias, record covers and personal
photographs. The result, done with After Effects software on a home
computer, is a surreal blending of comic strip-like characters
moving like line-drawn shadow puppets against a fluid, filmed
backdrop of actual places and people.
</P>
<P>
   The movie had its premiere in 1997 at the D.FILM Digital Film
Festival. Ascher and Garon have since been asked to make high-tech
film shorts for NBC's ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   More films made either fully or in part with low-cost digital
technology are also finding their way to theater screens. ``The
Cruise,'' a biting documentary about a tour bus guide in New York,
was shot entirely in low-budget but high-resolution digital video
by the film's director, Bennett Miller. The 76-minute feature
earned a theatrical release last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Edginton shot the haunting ``Anna In The Sky'' on 16-mm
film but, when faced with budget problems, transferred his movie to
video and edited it in his living room on his home computer, using
Adobe Premiere software. When he finished, he had developed a
blueprint for how 16-mm film should be cut, saving enormous time
and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The filmmaker of the future,'' said Chris Gore, publisher of
File Threat Weekly, a magazine that tracks underground filmmaking,
``is the person holding a computer mouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Struggling filmmakers once talked about film stock and
developing costs. Now it is hardly unusual to hear them excitedly
discussing the finer points of DCR-PC1 digital video cameras from
Sony or Pandemonium 2.8 from Xaos Tools, or exchanging insights
into morphing and creating convincing shadow passes on their
Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``What is exciting about it is that a lot of the software to
produce these effects can be literally bought off the shelf,'' said
Gore, noting that many of the programs cost $400 to $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Small-budget productions can loom large on screen by using
digital technology to drop vast cityscapes into the background,
populate ancient battlefields with thousands of soldiers in period
costumes, sweeten a night scene with shooting stars or add an
autumnal sunset. And some say newer digital camcorders are
beginning to capture some of the richness and depth that is the
hallmark of film (especially when the camcorder images are
transferred to film).
</P>
<P>
   Devin Crowley, 31, a filmmaker with a master's degree in film
direction from Columbia University, said buying a Sony DCR-VX1000
digital camcorder for $3,300 (the same kind Miller used to make
``The Cruise'') had been a breakthrough in realizing his project,
which is tentatively entitled ``Show Me The Aliens,'' a full-length
send-up of people who believe that they have been abducted by
aliens from outer space.
</P>
<P>
   The chief advantages of digital video, Crowley said, are a
deeper and sharper image _ much closer to film than standard analog
video _ and its low cost. For example, it cost Crowley about $13 to
shoot an hour's worth of tape, which does not have to be processed,
and $650 to purchase and develop 15 minutes of 16-mm film, which he
used in a small portion of the project. Crowley said he could also
afford to let two video cameras run (he borrowed a second one)
while he and his actors improvised a scene. He said that ``would be
insane'' with a film camera, which cranks away money as it runs.
</P>
<P>
   Standard videotape is also a very unstable medium to edit, many
filmmakers say; it rapidly degrades with each edit. Digitized video
does not. After it is shot, Crowley's footage will be transferred
to digital tape of higher quality for editing with Avid software.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley, like many digital filmmakers, is making movies first
and then shopping them around to distributors and investors in the
hope of having them put on film for theater releases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing is that you don't have to be rich or fortunate
or have great connections to have a fully finished project,''
Crowley said. If his film does not find a distributor, he added, he
will try to raise the money to transfer it to 35-mm film. That
would require at least $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Jafa, a veteran cinematographer who likes to call himself
a ``visual artist,'' said he had been working on a movie shot with
a digital video camera. He also agrees that digital's lower
production costs are opening up the medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the America cinema essentially is that it is
cost-prohibitive for people to participate in it,'' said Jafa, who
was the cinematographer for the widely acclaimed independent film
``Daughters of the Dust.'' With the significantly lowered cost of
digital technology, he said, comes ``room to play, and with room to
play comes room to innovate.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology is making it possible for filmmakers to operate
more like painters and other artists, first producing their works
and then presenting them to the marketplaces of the world. In
Hollywood, filmmakers must first present their ideas and then try
to secure financing.
</P>
<P>
   Digital technology means another change as well. ``You would own
your film,'' Jafa said. ``Very few in Hollywood ever do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bart Cheever, the executive producer and co-founder of the
D.FILM Digital Film Festival, a five-year-old global showcase of
films made with digital technology, said computers were opening up
possibilities. ``A lot of new stories are going to be told,'' he
said, ``and new perspectives are going to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Some black and Hispanic filmmakers are looking at computers and
software as an alternative means of producing their work. Stanley
Nelson, a black filmmaker whose documentary about black
journalists, ``The Black Press: Soldiers Without Swords,'' which
will be broadcast next month on PBS, said he had used film for
interviews and digital video for documents, like newspapers and
photographs. He said he planned to do more with digital.
</P>
<P>
   ``This technology offers a real opportunity for filmmakers who
currently have been very marginalized by the industry to create
their own footholds in cinema,'' said Kay Shaw, founder and owner
of Amber Images, a company based in New York that distributes,
markets and promotes films for blacks, Hispanics and American
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   More new filmmakers should consider using emerging technologies
while they are in their infancy, she said, ``instead of tagging
along after it has been monopolized and controlled.''

<P>
   Q. My Web browser crashes when I try to look at a certain page.
Every other page I want to look at loads fine, so is something
wrong with the page?
</P>
<P>
   A. A number of things could be causing the problem, so try to
eliminate some possibilities. Try to call up that Web page on
another computer (or ask a friend to try) and see if it will load
properly. If the page won't load on different computers, it's very
likely that something is wrong with the page file.
</P>
<P>
   If the page loads for someone else, check your own system. Make
sure you have enough RAM to meet the minimal system requirements
for the browser program.
</P>
<P>
   Many Web pages are designed with more than just the basic HTML
(hypertext markup language) coding. Java applets and browser
plug-ins like Flash are some of the newer technology used to
animate and spice up Web pages. Older browsers _ early versions of
Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Explorer or America Online's browser
_ can't support some of these newer features.
</P>
<P>
   If possible, upgrade your browser to the most current version
and make sure that you have all the popular plug-ins. If your
computer can't handle the newer, more RAM-hungry browsers, consider
switching to a low-cost, low-RAM alternative like the Opera browser
(www.operasoftware.com), which can run on even a 386 processor.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Octavo, a company that puts rare books onto CD-ROMs, avoids the
sound and fury of quick-time movies, computer animation and musical
scores. Instead, lush printed pages are the bells and whistles of
Octavo's elegant, searchable, printable, magnifiable renderings of
first editions by Milton, Shakespeare, Copernicus and other masters
of the printed medium.
</P>
<P>
   With those kinds of authors, Octavo CD-ROMs don't need any
multimedia gewgaws to capture the interest of their readers, said
Patrick Ames, chief executive of the Palo Alto, Calif., company.
And the format is practical, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can play with it, print it out, spill coffee on it, print
it out again,'' Ames noted. ``With a real rare book, you have to be
extremely careful. It's fragile. You can't really read it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Octavo's founding in late 1997 by John E. Warnock,
chairman and chief executive of Adobe Systems Inc., and by Ames
(who formerly headed Adobe's publishing arm), the company has built
a catalog of a dozen titles straddling popular and scholarly
markets. These range from the collected works of Geoffrey Chaucer's
to Robert Hooke's ``Micrographia,'' the lavishly illustrated
17th-century entomological text. They are priced from $20 to $75.
</P>
<P>
   The company takes its name from a printing term that refers to a
size of paper or a book whose leaves are one-eighth the size of a
standard printing sheet.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of octavo books in the mid-15th Century, Ames
said, ``Information wasn't locked in the monasteries or the
churches anymore. You could carry it around. Everybody could read
it. That's how the Renaissance came.''
</P>
<P>
   Ames admits that Octavo's sales so far have been meager: He
estimates that the company sold fewer than 2,000 CD-ROMs last year.
Yet he said that revenues have doubled every month since February
1998, which marked the arrival in the market of Octavo's first
product, a first edition of Shakespeare's Sonnets, from Warnock's
personal collection of rare books.
</P>
<P>
   And the company (octavo.com) scored a public relations coup last
fall by having its books chosen to be among Salon magazine's staple
giveaway goodies, given to new subscribers, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Public Library recently granted Octavo exclusive
digital rights to its entire collection (an Octavo edition of Alice
in Wonderland, with original drawings by Sir John Tenniel, is
planned); the Library of Congress, the Library Company of
Philadelphia, the Bridwell Library at Southern Methodist University
and the National Academy of Sciences have all signed similar
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Octavo recruits scholars to contribute introductory essays and
commentary for each title, and in some cases commissions new
translations.
</P>
<P>
   Octavo's technical production process is laborious. Each book is
laid in a custom-built cradle, then painstakingly lit to capture
all details of the binding, paper texture, ink spread and
impressions left by printing apparatus. The books are photographed
using a Better Light digital camera, also used by NASA for
technical analysis and by metropolitan police departments for
criminal forensics work.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting images have a resolution of 8,000 by 10,000
pixels, and use about 750 megabytes of memory per page. The
standard television screen is 640 by 480 pixels. The images are
compressed to about 10 megabytes each, and then processed and
formatted into PDF's (portable document files) by a bank of Apple
G3 computers running round-the-clock. At this point, the entire
book may be set in live text, so it will be completely searchable.
</P>
<P>
   Most Octavo editions have around 1,000 bookmarks to help readers
navigate them. Browsing the books with Adobe Reader software
(included on each disk), users can magnify any part of any page by
up to 800 percent without compromising the sharpness of the images.
</P>
<P>
   The executive editor of Octavo, E.M. Ginger, said such
fastidious processing is necessary. ``You get just as much
information from the type and the paper and the way it's laid out
as you get from the text itself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then she described in detail the trail of a bookworm that
burrowed through Octavo's version of Copernicus, which led her in
turn to an even more passionate narration about foxing (marks made
left by fungus or moisture, named for their resemblance to the
color of the animal's coat) that marks Octavo's edition of Benjamin
Franklin's ``Experiments and Observations on Electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   The only subject on which Octavo officials are less than
articulate is marketing. Nobody at the company really knows who's
going to buy the books. Ames said the disks, which are available at
www.amazon.com, barnesandnoble.com, a few independent bookstores
and directly from Octavo's Web site, are selling to ``bibliophiles,
librarians, academics and students, professionals and digerati.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   But whether this will translate into profits remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows what the desires in this market are, because
there is no market,'' Ms. Gringer said. ``It's a very difficult
position for a company to be in. This is not books, this is not
software, this is something else entirely, and that's the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not anybody buys this, or whether it becomes a
sensation, or whether we're even going to get into the black is
anybody's guess. We don't know.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One reason they don't know is that the company does not have a
full-time marketing person. For now, Octavo does its marketing
research mostly by surfing the Internet. A Stanford University
graduate student in English who works part-time at Octavo spends
her days looking, for instance, for Episcopal groups who might buy
the company's first-edition ``Book of Common Praier'' in bulk, or
for Latter-Day Saints who might snap up Joseph Smith's original
``Book of Mormon,''
</P>
<P>
   None of this should be too surprising, given the origins of
Octavo. Although the company hopes to turn a profit, it was created
by Warnock, an avid collector of old manuscripts, as more or less a
labor of love. Of course, it is easier to let labor be ruled by
love when one is head of a major, if somewhat embattled, software
company.
</P>
<P>
   Octavo's second funding cycle begins early this year, and
although Ames said he and Warnock were courting a variety of
venture capitalists, he's hoping for an investor who will provide a
no-strings cash infusion. Octavo is also considering partnerships
with conventional publishers, but Ames said he's not making serious
overtures to the incipient electronic book market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our core charter is accessibility and affordability, it's
not very smart for us to put a lot of our efforts into that,'' he
said, citing the high prices of the electronic books and what he
calls the ``pitiful'' screen resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   The company's strategy, at this point, is clearly scattershot,
driven primarily by the employees' own enthusiasms. ``I'm choosing
things that I think are fascinating,'' Ms. Ginger said.
</P>
<P>
   At an Octavo marketing meeting not long ago, Ames and Octavo's
seven employees gathered in the company conference room to hear Ms.
Ginger's sales pitch for a new Octavo edition: the 1524 Tory Book
of Hours.
</P>
<P>
   She began by explaining the genre. Between the late 13th century
and the early 16th century, wealthy Christians in Europe
commissioned the illustrated prayer books. They were the ultimate
status symbols in Christendom, so prized that noble families
sometimes went broke to get them.
</P>
<P>
   Seven times in half an hour, Ms. Ginger used the word
``incredible'' to describe the ``Book of Hours'' (produced by
Geoffrey Tory, the first royal printer in France), which she'd just
seen at the Library of Congress. Showing a reproduction of the
book's elaborate illuminations, she exclaimed, ``The bugs! The
twigs! The sheer beauty of this piece just overwhelmed me!''
</P>
<P>
   An employee mentioned merchandising possibilities: ``Could we
make posters with some of these pictures? Screen savers? Mouse
pads?'' But mostly, the conversation was limited to a discussion of
the book itself.
</P>
<P>
   When someone asked exactly how the book's first readers used the
texts, Ms. Ginger said: ``It's a certain kind of day, so you'd go
to the book to find out what prayer you should say.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like, `How can I get past the marketing meeting?''' offered
one employee.
</P>
<P>
   Ames looked him in the eye, not missing a beat. ``Exactly,'' he
said. &QL;

IN AND OUT ... THAT`S WHAT FASHION IS ALL ABOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; It seems like a distant memory _ those
``Titanic'' necklaces sporting giant blue rhinestones, sexy dresses
bearing religious icons, Zegna ties just like the president's.
</P>
<P>
   Those ``it'' items that seemed so fashion forward in 1998 now
are sooo last year. But thanks to a healthier economy, some
nostalgia-driven films and a political scandal or two, the last 12
months offered fads galore _ even a few that may survive the
finicky fashion front and live well into 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Chanel No. 5 perfume, capri pants, mules, flannel pajamas,
twinsets, swing dancing and black-and-white movies all made a
comeback even before we visited ``Pleasantville.''
</P>
<P>
   Feathers and faux-fur trim showed up on everything from tank
tops to ball gowns, accompanied by a gradual return of real fur
after spending a decade on fashion's black list.
</P>
<P>
   If you bought into any of it, keep it. 1950s mania, including
the Hollywood glam of that era, will be with us throughout 1999,
predict fashion experts, including Tommy Hilfiger and L.A. designer
Judy Rabineau. The designer for Mica dresses, Rabineau has included
several ``Pleasantville'' housedresses in her spring collection,
and she thinks full skirts hemmed below the knee will be the next
big trend.
</P>
<P>
   The Vogue pattern company has also gone retro, reintroducing
some of its best post-World War II suit patterns, which may
introduce Gen Xers to home sewing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Neiman Marcus spokeswoman Beverly Morgan says
everyone is looking forward to the return of color in our
wardrobes, and L.A.'s Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising
spokeswoman Maggie Murray agrees, especially in the shoe
department. The curator of the school's annual exhibit of
Oscar-nominated costumes, Murray says pastel-colored flats and
high-heeled sandals will be hot tickets in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   And the city's rising young designer Eduardo Lucero claims hot
pink and olive green will be the color combo of the year. Or at
least spring.
</P>
<P>
   The continuation of classic American sportswear is what Saks
Fifth Avenue fashion director Kelly Bevan Spirer predicts we'll be
seeing and wearing. She added that it's everywhere, even on
European runways.
</P>
<P>
   Among the styles associated with American sportswear is the
drawstring waist, which Lucero put on ball-gown skirts two years
ago but found the public wasn't ready for it. Now they are, and
you'll be seeing that waist style on men's and women's clothing by
a number of designers, even though it's very unflattering to all
but Kate Moss and Calista Flockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of menswear details, Fashion Association spokesman Leon
Hall says the long-sleeved polo shirt will be the next big trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year it was shiny shirts and matching ties that made men
feel special about the way they looked, but now it's a
silk-and-cashmere blend polo shirt in cherry red, rust or camel
worn under a blazer or suit,'' says Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Denim is in again. Not just the newer dark denim Levis with the
'50s-inspired cuff, but denim prairie skirts with white cotton
petticoats and denim motocross jackets teamed with peasant blouses
that look like the kind sold on Olvera Street in downtown Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Ethereal fabrics are still hot, especially if they're in a Maid
Marian dress, but gingham, eyelet and wrinkle-free linen are
fresher.
</P>
<P>
   Knits remain strong, so St. John suits will still reign as the
lunch-bunch uniform, but as spring approaches you may want to
consider a girlish dress like the kind Donna Reed wore when she
served cookies and milk to the kids. Or a ``Sabrina'' dress with a
full skirt and spaghetti straps.
</P>
<P>
   Dressing up in general, and the etiquette that goes with
black-tie galas, continues to be hot, although you're going to see
more invitations with ``cocktail attire'' as the suggested dress
code.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the office, there's a backlash to the casual Friday
dress code, so expect to see men wearing dress shirts with French
cuffs more often than last year.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, it may be a challenge for history's hemline
watchers since the economy is up, but hemlines are down, hovering
between the bottom of the knee and the top of the ankle. However,
women's pants are getting shorter.
</P>
<P>
   On the must-have list for '99 are all lengths of capri pants and
clam diggers designed to expose a well-turned ankle, much like the
skirts worn at the turn of the last century. &QL;

OAKLAND BREATHES DEEPLY AS BROWN BEGINS TERM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM WONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Oakland's first day with Jerry Brown as mayor
began in stereotypical Jerry Brown fashion _ with a meditation at
his industrial-sized live-work space near Jack London Square.
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, a meditation is pure Jerry Brown, who was dubbed
``Governor Moonbeam'' when he was California's top elected official
25 years ago. But as someone at the early Monday morning session
pointed out, it isn't all that different from the prayer breakfast
held 22 years ago when Lionel Wilson became Oakland's first African
American _ and rare Democratic _ mayor, breaking the political grip
of conservative white Republican men.
</P>
<P>
   To Zach Wasserman, an attorney who has advised past Oakland
mayors, Brown's election is comparable to that of Wilson in 1977.
``People voted for change,'' Wasserman said. ``There is now a sense
of new hope, of renewal, just as there was when Lionel was
elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's mayoralty ushers in yet another, ill-defined turning
point for the East Bay's largest city, overshadowed as it is by San
Francisco. Brown moved from San Francisco five years ago to
continue an eclectic political journey that has included several
presidential runs.
</P>
<P>
   Symbolic of Oakland's new phase was the meditation led by Sharon
Salzberg for about 200 people of different races and faiths.
Salzberg began by pointing out the virtues of breathing deeply,
relaxing and allowing one's mind to conjure up images and inner
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   One meditates to ``check to see what assumptions we hold'' and
to learn to ``take care of what's right in front of us, which sets
the stage for what comes next,'' Salzberg said. ``We are all
interconnected ... No one is really isolated ... We meditate to
recognize a vast web of interconnectedness.''
</P>
<P>
   She then led the group in a ``friendship'' meditation that
lasted 20 minutes, a ``practice to honor our sense of community, (a
practice that tells us) no one can make it alone and that we can
inspire one another.''
</P>
<P>
   That message meshed with what the Brown said later in his
inaugural address in the newly refurbished City Hall Plaza before
an attentive and enthusiastic crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I make a solemn promise to be a catalyst for change.
But I cannot work for change alone. I need each of you to commit
yourselves with me to work change for the common good. ... We must
change and move beyond inwardly turning self interest to interest
in the common good. We must see one another as brothers and
sisters,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I am only one person with flaws, and in my 60 years
I have made mistakes, but I commit to each of you that I will
strive to my utmost to continually change within myself. I do not
pretend to know all the right questions, much less have all the
right answers. And even if I did, it wouldn't make much difference
unless the government I propose becomes an ongoing dynamic process
in which all of you are not only heard, but truly engaged. Only
then can a consensus of action emerge which speaks the will of the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Spiritual inspiration is one thing. Connecting to the gritty
secular world of urban problems of which Oakland has an abundance
is quite another. So Brown pledged a fourfold agenda: Reduce crime,
bring 10,000 people to live downtown, help parents establish public
charter schools, encourage arts and cultural expressions.
</P>
<P>
   Inaugural day ended with a rousing festival of performing arts
and neighborhood information booths. Public Oakland was upbeat on
Jerry Brown's first day as mayor. He has instilled hope and
excitement in a city that has more often than not sulked in the
wake of negative perceptions. All in all, a noteworthy start of a
new political era.

GARDENING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   &UR; Nurturing Lantanas &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. This fall I saw a collection of beautiful lantana trees at
Planting Fields Arboretum in Oyster Bay, N.Y. I thought lantana was
an annual flower plant and was stunned to see the trees. Where can
I purchase one? Do they have any special requirements? Are they
hardy?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The common lantana, L. camara, is a woody shrub in warm
climates, an annual anywhere it encounters freezing temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Though lantanas are not difficult to grow (in the tropics,
they're weeds), considerable training is required to turn them into
the seven-foot trees you saw at Planting Fields, which are known in
the trade as standards.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Dose, the greenhouse manager at Planting Fields, says it is
easy enough to do the training, but it is tough to winter the
plants in a home setting. They drop their leaves and go almost
dormant, but they cannot be stored in a basement because some light
is still needed. At Planting Fields, they are crowded into a cool
greenhouse. You could use a north-facing room that stayed at about
50 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In case you do have a place to store them _ or want to try the
technique on a fuchsia, hibiscus or heliotrope, to name three other
common tropicals that take well to standardization _ here is how:
start with a small plant that has a long central stem. Supply it
with a stake that can act as a guide and anchor until the standard
can stand up straight on its own (somewhere between three years and
never).
</P>
<P>
   Take off the side branches, and as the plant grows, pinch out
all of the side shoots. Tie the stem to the stake frequently, so it
doesn't sag. Keep it up until the stem is about three-fourths of
the height you want. Be sure there are at least 8 or 10 growth
nodes below the top, then pinch off the tip to encourage branching.
Pinch the branches of the plants once they get going to make them
branch again.
</P>
<P>
   You will have something presentable in two or three years.
Alternatively, you can buy one ready-made, and though it will not
be as magnificent as the 20- and 30-year-old specimens at Planting
Fields, it will still look pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   Standard lantanas are not a mail-order item, but are widely
offered in spring by large garden-supply stores, like Frank's,
which buy from wholesale suppliers of patio plants.
</P>
<P>
   Look for a straight, undamaged trunk (with no signs of trouble
around the graft), and main branches that are evenly distributed
around the top.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Terrace Wintering &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I recently relocated my potted trees and shrubs from a
terrace open to the elements to a covered terrace with wind, some
sun and no rain. Should my trees and shrubs be watered over the
winter? Is it necessary to wrap the pots with burlap?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Wind can be very hard on plants, but unless the former
location was unusually well protected, yours should be used to it.
Same story with the sun; it doesn't sound as though too much is
going to be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing to watch out for is a narrowly southern exposure.
Trunks and branches that get strong heat on one side while the
other side stays cold can develop cracks.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be on watering duty big time next summer, but during the
winter, be careful not to overdo. Your plants should be dormant _
or close to it _ by now, and although they still need some water,
too much will lead to rot. All that's necessary is enough to keep
the roots moist.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Christo question, the thing you would want to wrap
with burlap would be the plants, not the pots.
</P>
<P>
   Burlap is an overcoat that shields trees from drying wind,
scorching sun and branch-breaking ice and snow. But I wouldn't use
it unless I absolutely had to. Burlap's sun-block aspect means
plants can bleach or starve if you don't take it off soon enough.
The dank environment it creates can lead to fungus problems. And
you have to look at it.
</P>
<P>
   As long as your new terrace isn't absolutely arctic, you can
just group the plants away from the wind, near an inside wall, and
let them wait out the winter relatively undisturbed.
</P>
<P>

VIRTUAL GARDENING: LOSE MORE THAN CALLUSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Katherine Whiteside is a gardening writer. A book she wrote with
Madison Cox on garden design will be published by Henry Holt this
year.  
 By KATHERINE WHITESIDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Make no mistake: making a garden is outdoor work. So I was a bit
skeptical of garden design software promising that ``you can create
an outdoor paradise without leaving your chair.''
</P>
<P>
   I have been a garden writer for 16 years and, for the last 6
have been wrestling a one-acre plot into some sort of garden that
makes design sense. So I know that I can write about gardens
without leaving my chair, but creating an outdoor paradise means I
have to get up and get out there.
</P>
<P>
   But checking out a few brand-new tools is always appealing. I am
redesigning the stone entryway into our garden, and maybe one of
these programs could streamline my usual technique of hauling stuff
around the yard until it looks right. I have some pictures ripped
out of magazines, and I've scribbled down some ideas on paper, but
it could be a terrific time saver to have a garden design program
that shows me how the new entrance will look before I start lugging
those big rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, as the first snows start falling, a design program might
hold some appeal for the many garden enthusiasts who are already
thinking ahead to next spring and want to get a jump on their
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Because I know a lot more about gardening than I do about
computers, I examined these programs with Paul Heuston, a
consultant in software development for training and education who
has extensive experience with computer-driven interactive teaching.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Paul has a lovely old house and a three-acre
undeveloped garden that he has been bugging me about for two years.
Other great helpers in these reviews were Brian Higley, a landscape
architect; Madison Cox, a principal in Madison Cox Designs, an
international garden design firm, and Anne Symmes, a garden
designer who is a graduate of the New York Botanical Garden
Landscape Design Program.
</P>
<P>
   Our review team was large, and each of us had real reasons for
wanting these design programs to work. But in the end, all the
programs had at least one major area of underdevelopment that
canceled out any hopes for usefulness, even though various programs
handled some aspects of gardening fairly well.
</P>
<P>
   Higley summed up our joint frustration by saying, ``You can hand
a person all the hammers, files and nails that a blacksmith uses,
but unless that person knows horses, the shoe is just not going to
go on that hoof.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, gardening people are eternally optimistic. At the end of
the review process, we brainstormed on what sort of software would
truly be helpful for both amateur and professional garden makers.
We agreed that one would be a good plant encyclopedia, compiled by
a botanical garden or some other reliable source.
</P>
<P>
   Cox found the CD-ROM of Michael A. Dirr's Photo-Library of Woody
Landscape Plants (Plant America; $149.95) to be useful. Ms. Symmes
agreed and said she was considering buying it. She mentioned that
she had looked at the Plant Master 5.0 CD-ROM (Acacia Software,
$350), a database intended for landscape professionals that
includes a catalog of more than 5,000 North American plants, at a
New York Botanical Garden symposium on gardening software and liked
the fact that Plant Master could be tailored to the needs of the
user.
</P>
<P>
   We tacked on a wish for a CD-ROM on garden history _ perhaps a
combination of The Oxford Companion to Gardens, Thacker's History
of Gardens and other classic references. With that, the three
professionals left _ one to inspect 20 antique apple trees, another
to conduct a site visit and the last to finish a watercolor for a
client presentation.
</P>
<P>
   I went home and lugged rocks around the garden. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PRO LANDSCAPE 5.0  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Autodesk; $795.95; Windows 95 and NT.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If, like some gardeners, you have inherited a gene for always
picking out the most expensive thing in the store, your first
choice for garden-design software would be Autodesk's Pro
Landscape, an $800 program designed for professionals in the garden
business.
</P>
<P>
   It made me a little nervous that the box said the software was
for landscape architects, designers and contractors, with ``no
previous drawing experience necessary,'' because it seemed as
though all those people really needed to know how to draw. Also
``SHOW AND SELL!'' was written in big red letters right over a
photograph of a really hideous front yard with a pink tree, a white
shrub and six little blobs plopped in what appeared to be
neon-green Astroturf. But if the hype was off-putting, the
installation was straightforward _ until we decided to plug in the
tutorial. Then it crashed two times.
</P>
<P>
   Only after we succeeded in getting Pro Landscape running did we
begin to realize that its problems might not be limited to the
technical aspects of the program. Take plant hardiness zones, the
information every potential garden maker needs to know before
planning a landscape. The hardiness zone system is simple, with 10
zones (10 being really hot and 1 really cold) that cover the entire
United States. Zone maps are widely available in every garden book.
</P>
<P>
   Garrison, N.Y., where Paul Heuston has his garden, is on the
border of Zones 5 and 6. The Autodesk program, however,
categorically stated that he was in zone 6, failing to take into
account that elevation and exposure makes some areas a bit colder.
Given that, he would be much safer starting out with Zone 5
material instead of the riskier plants suitable for the warmer
temperatures of Zone 6. Important information had been
oversimplified.
</P>
<P>
   Next we scanned in a photograph of Heuston's house so we could
begin messing around with the design. The house popped up on the
screen, but there was no room to design a garden around it, and
there was very little depth of field. Heuston has three acres, but
the only room given for plant placement was right against the
house.
</P>
<P>
   But Heuston was still optimistic about getting his place fixed
up, so we moved on to the plant choice section of the program. When
he typed in ``trees, Zone 5'' I was dismayed to see only three
types of cherry trees listed and confused to see false aralia
listed. False aralia (Dizygotheca) is native to New Caledonia and
Polynesia and would croak outside a steamy Zone 10.
</P>
<P>
   We went back and picked out one of the program's house images to
try to play designer again. Even with an image supplied by the
program (and I can't figure out what help it is to create a garden
for a nonexistent house), the field of design was so narrow that we
ended up, in a rather childish fashion, obscuring the house with
three giant, garish evergreens, one enormous cotton-candy blob of a
cherry tree and a harvest-gold carpet of ground cover.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In all fairness to the Autodesk product, I also asked Brian
Higley about his professional experience with Autodesk's Auto Cad,
and he said that such muscular design programs required a lot of
time, perhaps a year, to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Software can be a great tool for repetitious drawing, some
imaging and sharing information,'' Higley said, ``but it cannot
design.
</P>
<P>
   ``The programs can do cool things like move from
one-quarter-scale all the way up to full scale. But, frankly, I do
not use any software at all for design purposes. It takes me too
far from real design.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   COMPLETE LAND DESIGNER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Sierra; $49.95; Windows 95 and 98.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Complete Land Designer was the only box that had a
nice-looking garden and, because it came with four features _ 3-D
Landscape, Photo Land Designer, Garden Encyclopedia and 3-D Deck _
this computer amateur was hopeful about getting some help with that
stone entryway.
</P>
<P>
   As with the Autodesk program, scanning photos was not helpful.
There was no way that this program could help me imagine the
possibilities of my walkway because there was no depth of field, so
we gave up and looked at the images the program offered. (Once
again, I cannot figure out how using a picture of another house
would be helpful. It's like trying to make an apple pie using only
oranges.)
</P>
<P>
   The design process was confusing. Even after choosing Zone 5,
the program allowed Paul Heuston to select and plant the following
up against the brick wall of a generic house: a datura (the one
that showed up was definitely a tropical species), a bonsai (by
definition, a potted dwarf plant), an impossibly huge pink begonia
(brown mush by the first frost), and a nice Liquidambar tree that
totally obscured two windows. We looked for some ornamental grasses
but were shown only seven, each one identically labeled
``ornamental grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Heuston picked one and accidentally ``grew it'' (by hitting the
wrong button) to a giant size. As a joke, we then moved the
impossibly large clump to the roof of the house and found that we
couldn't get it off again. There were not enough Undo choices, and
there just wasn't enough control over the program.
</P>
<P>
   We installed the separate Garden Encyclopedia, but the scarcity
of material was far too evident. We printed out the selections for
``Zone 5, partial sun, white flowers, vine growing to 15 feet,''
but I only got two choices. The printout on one choice, Rosa
wichuraiana, said it was 6 inches tall and 25 feet wide. I wondered
where all this would lead a gardening novice: the program seemed to
require an experienced gardener on hand to correct such
misinformation.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Heuston spent more hours than he would tell me in
the 3-D section of the software, drawing a top view of his house.
The next day, he showed me how he could also rotate this into a 3-D
front view and how we could move around (to the sound of footsteps)
_ although nothing on the screen reminded me even a litle of
Heuston's house or the land around it.
</P>
<P>
   He also designed a rudimentary garden (a few trees and shrubs)
with several features like front steps and an arbor, and he even
treated himself to a backyard hot tub. The program then provided
him with an astonishing and highly unlikely piece of information:
His garden would cost exactly $17,141.04.
</P>
<P>
   In the end we decided that Sierra's program was user-friendly
over all, but not useful. Heuston summed it up as ``a combination
screwdriver, wrench, pole vault.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Higley, a landscape architect, agreed. ``The software
doesn't know much about lay of the land or sun orientation,'' he
said. ``An unsuspecting person could design a bed of sun-loving
herbs right underneath a huge shady canopy of oak. The program does
not support good or even sensible design.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Softkey; $19.95; Windows 95 and 3.1 or higher.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The title of the third choice _ Landscape Architect _ might make
landscape architects bristle. ``A landscape architect has
university degrees and board certifications,'' said Brian Higley,
who is one. ``Would you buy software called Pediatrician for
$19.95?''
</P>
<P>
   After he calmed down, we found that installation was painless,
but once again the ``photo-realistic'' renderings were more than
painful. The images supplied had a rather offputting cartoonish
aspect. Higley soldiered on, but he stopped after one hour and
said: ``I can't even figure out how to make a line. This is the
most fundamental reflex in beginning a drawing, but I can't get
this to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The icons were not helpful, either. I looked in the booklet for
help, and the first item under Design Concepts read, ``Every object
in Landscape Architect knows what objects it contains and what
object contains it.'' Sure enough, there are bunches of little
bridges and fences, but design is not just dropping objects into a
garden.
</P>
<P>
   But we pressed on and looked into other Landscape Architect
features. I wanted to check out the plant database but was confused
by the information under General Deciduous Shrubs. For example, it
listed: ``Botanical name _ oval mound blue; maximum height _ 1.8;
age _ 8; height _ 1.2; Dormant _ not applicable.'' I'm familiar
with plant shorthand, but I couldn't decipher the code.
</P>
<P>
   The Deciduous Trees section was just as confounding. I looked up
the familiar weeping willow and was told: ``Maximum Height _ 10;
age _ 6; height _ 3; width _ 3.3; visible and growing _ all
seasons; dormant _ not applicable.'' Once again, the offering was
very confusing. Weeping willows grow to more than 10 feet tall, so
I wondered if the numbers referred to meters. But other parts of
the problem were in acres, not hectares, so that remained a
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   A final foray into the program's ``see your garden in different
seasons and through the years'' was weird. As I moved through
spring, summer, fall and winter, fake trees around the generic
house changed from pink to green to red to gray. When I moved
through the years, the trees just suddenly shot up and hid the
house. Trust me: This is not how Mother Nature and Father Time act
in your garden. &QL;

 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO CITY _ In Mexico, NAFTA stands for change. Five years
after it took effect, NAFTA has become the leading impetus for the
far-reaching transformations sweeping the world of Mexican
business. Open markets and competition have obliged executives to
rethink their companies, pushing them to face up to the challenge
of free trade. And, during the economic crisis of 1995, NAFTA threw
a life-line to hundreds of Mexican companies, even as unfettered
foreign competition helped push weaker firms out of business.
 &HT;    The North American Free Trade Agreement has given a turbo boost
to commerce between Mexico and the United States, and turned Canada
into Mexico's second-largest trade partner, with interregional
trade growing at double-digit rates and causing huge traffic jams
at border highway crossings and rail yards. ``NAFTA constitutes one
of Mexico's greatest competitive advantages,'' says Luis Rubio, a
noted economist who is director of Mexico's Center for Development.
``It is an exceptional tool for the development of the Mexican
economy, attracting much foreign investment that translates into
jobs, technology transfer, indirect export opportunities through
supply chains, and training for workers and executives. In
addition, it generates secure access to the U.S. market.''
 &HT;    The effects on companies in the United States and Canada have
been positive as well, though more modest in scope. In many ways,
the trade accord simply ratified and codified trends in
manufacturing sectors such as textiles and automotive trades. But
for companies in other industries, and for smaller companies that
had not previously considered exporting, NAFTA has provided a
window of opportunity to increase sales and rationalize costs.
While the macroeconomic effect on the two larger countries has been
minimal, for companies that have directly benefited from the new
markets, NAFTA is exciting and successful.
 &HT;    Indeed, on a company-by-company level, some patterns are
emerging as to how NAFTA is affecting the way companies do business
in North America. The last five years have seen a major increase in
cross-border joint ventures and foreign direct investment,
especially in Mexico. Relocation of labor-intensive manufacturing
processes to Mexico _ not only from Canada and the United States,
but from Central America, the Caribbean region and even as far away
as Asia _ has occurred, especially in automotive, electronic and
textile work, the three leading trade segments under NAFTA. ``NAFTA
has made it possible for manufacturing companies to make decisions
based purely on manufacturing costs,'' says Chris Padilla, director
of international trade relations for U.S. imaging company Eastman
Kodak, which recently announced that it hopes to save US$1 billion
over two years by shifting production of its X-ray film processors
to Mexico, to add to assembly operations of one-use cameras and
printed circuit boards. Film production, a capital-intense process,
has been centralized at one U.S. plant for all North American
sales.
 &HT;    Any Mexican consumer with money to buy U.S. imports profits from
low tariffs. But most Mexicans, many of whom have seen their
purchasing power decline just as free trade rose in influence, are
not celebrating NAFTA. To millions of Mexicans, direct benefits
from the accord have been scarce.
 &HT;    Even from a corporate viewpoint, the benefits of open borders
are concentrated in several hundred world-class large companies and
a limited number of smaller ones with the pluck, luck and know-how
to crack export markets.
 &HT;    Mexico's overall exports have doubled since 1994, from US$60
billion annually to an expected $120 billion for 1998. Exports to
the U.S. have grown to nearly $100 billion, making Mexico the third
largest supplier of goods and services to the U.S. market after
Canada and Japan. With U.S. exports to Mexico at about the same
level, Mexico is the second-largest market in the world for U.S.
products.
 &HT;    Big Mexican companies have been clear winners. Grupo Alfa, a
$3.9 billion conglomerate, exports a quarter of its sales. Grupo
Desc and San Luis Corporaci have become major autoparts suppliers
to the U.S. market. Grupo Industrial Bimbo, a breadmaker, and Isaac
Saba, a textile magnate, both made multimillion-dollar acquisitions
in the United States in their respective fields during 1998.
 &HT;    Most small companies that make up the backbone of Mexico's
employment, if not its production, have been left out of the party,
lacking the resources to mount the market research and seek foreign
buyers, or _ due to diverse factors _ simply fail to compete in
global markets. Take Alejandro Hernandez, a metal stamper in Mexico
City. Back in the early 1990s, he was one of thousands who believed
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's pledge that free trade would
vault Mexico out of chronic poverty. So he took action, borrowing
about $90,000 in bank loans. With the money, he opened a small
metal-stamping shop to supply large industrial companies. But
Hernandez's dream turned sour. ``The competition was tough, really
tough. Little by little, we just couldn't keep up, even before the
peso devaluation,'' says Hernandez, who closed the shop in 1995 and
released 35 employees. ``Once the crisis struck, our interest
payments doubled and there was nothing to do but close. The loans
were too expensive and the market was too difficult. Our mistake
was believing the line that only by investing would we develop.''
Economists say that NAFTA is just one of many factors _ the Tequila
Crisis and the relentless pace of globalization among others _ that
have affected Mexico. Nonetheless, countless others found
themselves in similar situations, and as their companies turned
into the losers of free trade, they blamed NAFTA. Some free-trade
critics blamed the Mexican government's liberalization policies for
undermining the country's industrial base and paving the way for a
severe crisis. But others see things a bit differently. ``I think
NAFTA saved the Mexican economy during the crisis,'' says Alberto
Covarrubias, the director general of Walmi Transformer, a
450-employee company in the northern city of Saltillo that exports
air filters for automobile engines and specialty applications. ``I
don't know what the country would look like now without NAFTA.''
 &HT;    Walmi Transformer is one of an elite group of small and
medium-sized companies who saw free trade as inevitable and decided
to do something about it. The company once served the domestic
market from a plant in Lermo, an industrial town in central Mexico.
But several years before NAFTA was signed, Walmi executives decided
their future was in exports, so they moved to Saltillo, a day's
drive from the Texas border. And they launched a massive makeover
of the company's production techniques, management methods and
sales practices. ``It's a long process and you have to involve all
your people,'' says Covarrubias. ``But now, the companies that
transformed themselves can take advantage of all these changes,
while the companies that believed that things would never really
change are paying the price.''
 &HT;    Today, Walmi sells air filters to several automakers and the
auto aftermarket, as well as specialty filters to companies like
Ingersoll Rand. It won Mexico's National Export Prize in 1997 for
its market performance in the United States and Canada, and
recently signed a contract with a German company after attending a
trade fair in Hamburg. Covarrubias even closed the company's
warehouse in Laredo, Texas, realizing that with NAFTA, regular
bureaucratic delays at customs were a thing of the past.
 &HT;    A few large companies were able to turn operations geared to the
domestic market into export production in a short time: Goodyear de
Mexico and most automakers did so by 1995. But Walmi is typical of
smaller companies that needed several years to do it.
 &HT;    Techtube de Mexico, an independent, cutting-edge steel company
in Mexico City with 150 employees, was founded in 1990, and started
to export in 1995. But that was two years after it first decided to
buy several million dollars' worth of capital equipment from
specialized suppliers in France, Italy and Germany to produce the
technology to make top-grade stainless-steel pipes and joints.
``NAFTA was a detonator for our entire investment, because we saw a
big opportunity to export to the United States and we were able to
recalculate our return on investment because of the treaty,'' says
Sergio Espinoza, the company's export manager. ``We wanted to
compete against the big guys. You find out what you know, and you
learn faster.''
 &HT;    Today, Techtube sells about half its production in Mexico,
supplying tons of steel pipes for beer giant Grupo Modelo's new
plant in Zacatecas, and other large companies. It exports the other
half to the United States and Canada, and to the rest of Latin
America.
 &HT;    NAFTA has also attracted foreign firms interested not just in
serving the Mexican market, but also in using Mexico as an export
platform to the United States. Mexico received $12 billion in
foreign direct investment in 1997, more than any Latin American
country after Brazil, which is still in the process of selling off
huge state-owned companies.
 &HT;    Mexico overtook China as the single-largest supplier of textiles
to the United States in 1998, spearheaded by foreign firms'
maquiladora assembly-for-export plants. U.S. automobile maker
General Motors and Bombardier, the Canadian transportation and
finance giant, have joined forces to assemble locomotives in
Mexico. Major parts will be shipped from GM plants in the United
States to Bombardier's Mexico facility for assembly and then sold
throughout Latin America. GM's Delphi parts subsidiary is already
the largest private employer in Mexico, with over 27,000 workers.
``We believe that Mexico will continue to get stronger and
stronger,'' says Tom Glaser, an executive at U.S. trucking firm
Contract Freighters, Inc. ``More U.S. manufacturing plants will
relocate there and more parts and components will need to be hauled
from the U.S.''
 &HT;    Sara Lee, the giant U.S. apparel company, while not adding new
plant capacity to its existing Mexico operations, has seen a shift
in production as duty free goods under NAFTA reduce overall costs.
``We have not been as dependent on the Far East for our sourcing
needs,'' says Sara Lee spokeswoman Peggy Carter, who added that
Mexican plants have increased their competitiveness under NAFTA.
 &HT;    Textiles are a prime example of how the complementary aspects of
Mexico's economy with those of Canada and the United States fit
together and benefit companies' bottom lines and their ability to
compete in other markets. Before the trade accord took effect,
Quaker Fabric Corp., a U.S. textile company with $200 million in
annual sales, was unsuccessful in gaining a license to import its
products into Mexico. But since NAFTA, the company has opened
offices in Mexico City and Guadalajara, while 150 of the company's
2,300 U.S.-based workers owe their jobs to the new export revenue
stream.
 &HT;    ``What you are finding is a natural partnership,'' says Quaker
Fabric CEO Larry Liebenow. ``More sophisticated products like yarns
and upholstery, are being made in the United States.
Apparel-cutting and sewing is moving to Mexico. For years that is a
business that has moved out of the United States. But with NAFTA,
apparel is moving to Mexico from Asia, and that is important
because Mexican apparel makers buy a lot of U.S. fabric as raw
materials.''
 &HT;    In addition to NAFTA and Mexico's location, Canadian companies
have been drawn to set up manufacturing operations in Mexico due to
a highly qualified and productive workforce, says Andres Darvasi,
president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Mexico and
director of marketing and sales for the Mexico operations of
Bombardier.
 &HT;    At the same time, NAFTA has helped increase awareness in Canada
for the opportunities in Mexico, he says.
 &HT;    ``NAFTA has brought considerable benefits to Canadian
companies,'' adds Katherine Funtek, commercial secretary at the
Canadian Embassy in Mexico. ``Among the many positive aspects are
better access to the Mexican market, particularly in areas that
were previously highly protected, including automotive parts,
transportation equipment and services, natural gas [and textiles.''
 &HT;    Other benefits include the creation of effective trade dispute
settlement mechanisms and greater transparency in, and access to,
government procurement, she says. And, Canada's economy itself has
also benefited by the increased competitiveness, according to
Funtek. As a result of all this NAFTA-spurred change, foreign
investment from U.S. and Canadian companies far outstrips funds
coming from other parts of the world and is growing in importance.
Indeed, the perceived stability that a multilateral treaty provides
has persuaded companies to divert investment from other traditional
manufacturing centers to Mexico.
 &HT;    And companies expect to leverage their Mexican investment far
beyond the NAFTA region. The Mexican plants of automakers like
General Motors, Ford and Chrysler (all from the United States),
Nissan (Japan) and Volkswagen (Germany) have increased their
presence, and in 1997, shipped nearly a million vehicles around the
world. Samsung (Korea), Sony (Japan) and other electronics firms
have turned Tijuana into the world capital of television
production. ``NAFTA is fueling all this growth,'' says Horacio
Ojeda, the director of business planning at the fibers department
of the Mexico operations of U.S.-based energy and chemicals company
DuPont. ``But it's broader than that. We also want to export to
Europe, Latin America and Asia.''
 &HT;    Other indirect effects from NAFTA are still being played out.
Demand for top-quality real estate is rising in Mexico City, in
large part from foreign firms looking for expanded space. And with
industrial companies flocking here, law firms, accountants,
consultants and other service companies are racing to compete for
new business. Behind the success, though, skeptics worry that
Mexico is not doing enough to take advantage of NAFTA. After all,
its competitive advantage of privileged access to the U.S. market
will disappear if the U.S. signs similar trade agreements _ such as
the Free Trade Area of the Americas _ in the future with other
developing countries in Latin America or elsewhere. ``In practice,
we're leaving the country's development to the initiative of each
individual,'' says Rubio, the economist. ``There's nothing wrong
with that, but it's insufficient. The fact is that those who reap
the rewards of NAFTA are a small portion of Mexicans.'' Mexico
still needs to make internal improvements to cement its
competitiveness, particularly in education and financial services.
To consolidate Mexico's advantage and spread the gains among larger
segments of the population, says Rubio, Mexico must address these
pressing weaknesses.
 &HT;    Public and private sector officials are already seeking ways to
upgrade labor-intensive industries. True, Mexico needed and needs
the low-tech jobs, but as the trade accord enters into its second
five-year period, they hope to raise wages and earnings by
producing more complex products. NAFTA has already made U.S.-Mexico
commerce into one of the world's fastest-growing trade zones,
speeding trends that were already underway in the 1980s. But in
Mexico, NAFTA means change, and the ongoing change of NAFTA is best
thought of as evolution.

<P>
   LAMY, N.M. _ Designing a home can be fraught with anxiety. In
Norah Pierson's case, it was a real cliffhanger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be on the cliffs, in the drama,'' Ms. Pierson said
of the simulated rock house she designed to blend in with the
sandstone cliffs of Lamy. ``I guess I'm a drama queen.''
</P>
<P>
   Known locally as the Flintstone house, Ms. Pierson's wondrous
polyurethane-foam creation, which she scales occasionally, might be
called design on the rocks with a twist.
</P>
<P>
   Encased in a rocky shell, the 2,300-square-foot home, which Ms.
Pierson, 58, a jeweler and artist, designed for herself in this
rugged speck of a railroad town about 20 miles southeast of Santa
Fe, may be the only house in America architecturally inspired by a
40-foot-long, 14-foot-high polyurethane stegosaurus.
</P>
<P>
   But we digress.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pierson describes herself as a ``compulsive doer'' who, if
stuck on a desert island, would probably ``color-code the sand.''
In the early 1980s, she began camping out in the valley below these
stark, white Dakota sandstone cliffs at the edge of the Galisteo
basin. She knew she wanted to build a house but worried that it
would be ``a minus for the land.'' So she began exploring ways to
build a house and disguise it, to make a statement that ``nature is
more important than man.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the legacy of cliff dwelling in New Mexico dates back
nearly 1,000 years, Ms. Pierson did not actually want to live in a
cave. ``I wasn't ready,'' she said, somewhat apologetically. ``I
didn't want a free-form interior where you can't own a book or hang
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Pierson, a daughter of the late Yale historian Charles
Wilson Pierson, is a professional jewelry designer, accustomed to
shaping abstract forms out of solid blocks of wax. It was doubtless
this conceptual ability that allowed her to see the sculptural
possibilities suggested by a nearby family of polyurethane-foam
dinosaurs _ nearly life size and gloriously visible from Interstate
25 _ that Larry Wilson, the president of a Santa Fe insulation
company, had built for his granddaughters in his front yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know anything technically,'' Ms. Pierson recalled.
``But I had a fantasy about these dinosaurs, so I called him.''
</P>
<P>
   Her concept was to design a conventional frame-and-cinder-block
house on the cliff top and then camouflage it with foam _ about
10,000 pounds of it, as it turned out. Although Wilson's company,
Thermal Coatings and Insulation, had done only one house, a
geodesic dome, he saw no technical reason why Ms. Pierson's
spray-as-you-go design project couldn't be built.
</P>
<P>
   The material itself hardens to a tough shell and is typically
used to insulate roofs and walls.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Greg Ohlsen, a local builder, Ms. Pierson
designed and constructed a relatively straightforward house, on
five levels, with 20-foot ceilings and three fireplaces. She lived
in it for more than a year, studying the cliff forms below, before
covering the entire surface in wire lath and two-by-fours molded
into boulder outlines. They formed an armature for the foam
exoskeleton, applied with spray guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot more difficult than I anticipated,'' she recently
said of pseudo-cliff design. ``It was seat-of-the-pants. I hadn't
made a model.'' To make the lath into true-to-life shapes and
angles mimicking the rock face, complete with realistic overhangs,
she recalled, ``I would run down the cliff, look at the house and
say tilt!'' Essentially, she created a giant pinata.
</P>
<P>
   The house-spraying was not just artistically challenging, but
also an expensive and time-consuming task that lasted almost two
years (Ms. Pierson estimates that her foam rock shell wound up
costing three to four times more than a conventional surface). At
high altitudes, spraying is not for the impatient, since it
requires days of at least 50 degrees. In windy conditions, it is
also, in Ms. Pierson's words, ``a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to dedicate a full set of clothing and a pair of
glasses to it,'' she said. ``It gets all over everything, including
your eyelashes.''
</P>
<P>
   Although historic Santa Fe has some of the strictest zoning in
the country, houses in Lamy, which is in Santa Fe County, are not
subject to architectural guidelines, said Rudy Garcia, the county's
land-use coordinator. Since Ms. Pierson's house was conventional in
structure, it conformed to local building codes, he said. Ms.
Pierson had no mortgage, but underwent what she calls
``unbelievable contortions'' to get insurance: she said the
unconventional surfacing material tripled her rates.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pierson heightened the realism by painting the foam with a
tinted sealer, adding dark shadows in places to imitate lichen.
</P>
<P>
   Local birds knew better. Cavity-nesting red-shafted flickers,
who like synthetic materials, pecked through the fake sandstone to
roost. The noise was deafening, recalls Deborah Newberg, a painter
who housesits frequently. ``It was like living inside a tree,'' she
said. (Much to Ms. Pierson's delight, a pair of falcons recently
took up residence.)
</P>
<P>
   Today, from certain angles, the Flintstone house is indeed
inconspicuous _ though from a distance, both it and the cliffs
glint in the New Mexico sun like the mythical kingdom of El Dorado.
Closer, it resembles a moonscape.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Inside, Ms. Pierson's home feels light, cozy and not the least
bit surreal, except for a few foam crags visible through the
windows. A long staircase descends steeply from the entrance into
the bermed interior. One side contains the living room, bedroom and
kitchen; the other, her studio, where she designs pieces in a style
she calls ``ancient futurism,'' many of them vaguely Etruscan. Both
her jewelry and the house _ shared with two cats, a dog, three
turtles and assorted fish and frogs _ are informed by a passion for
animals, archeology and bones.
</P>
<P>
   She has filled the house with stones, African goddesses and
other objects that reflect a girlhood in which Yale's Peabody
Museum was, as she said, her ``baby sitter.'' A love of jewelry was
born in the Egyptian galleries of the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
where said she left ``fingerprints and nose prints'' all over the
glass.
</P>
<P>
   After art school, Ms. Pierson lived in Rome, where she started
her career. In 1981, she opened her store in Santa Fe, the Golden
Eye. Before long, she was planning her house. ``Jewelry is one inch
by one inch,'' she said. ``To do something on this scale was so
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The product of a singular imagination, her house fits into a
grand New Mexican tradition of alternative architecture, from
stage-set plaster pueblos to Route 66 curio shops. Chris Wilson,
author of ``The Myth of Santa Fe'' (University of New Mexico Press,
1997), links Taos communes and houses made from straw bale, tires
and beer cans _ even the ubiquitous adobe revival style itself _ to
the romantic ideal of New Mexico as a place that is ``wind-swept
and water-shaped, an exotic, aboriginal landscape that lends itself
to the idea of growing out of the soil.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Flintstone house has itself become a
roadside attraction. It is a landmark on the Santa Fe Southern
Railway, a tourist and freight train that has revived the 18-mile
spur line between Lamy and Santa Fe, laid out in 1880 for the
Atchison, Topeka &AMP; Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get so immersed in the process you forget that what you're
doing is unusual,'' Ms. Pierson.
</P>
<P>
   At night you can sometimes find her up on the roof, listening to
coyotes and communing with the moon, surrounded by a landscape both
real and unreal.

   A person can live blissfully for 37 years without a coffee
table, then one day suddenly look at the big empty area in the
center of the living-room rug and realize: it's all wrong.
</P>
<P>
   This epiphany occurred at a party recently, as I watched my
guests awkwardly balancing plates of food on their knees. Soon
after, I embarked on a search for the perfect coffee table with the
sort of zealous fervor usually associated with a religious convert.
</P>
<P>
   I dragged home two tables from a secondhand furniture store, but
one proved too small, the other too red. I returned them. From an
antiques store, I borrowed a table with a more expensive price tag
of $350; it was rickety. For a while, a round one with a glass top
was promising. But the baby crawled under it, got stuck and flailed
on her back like a specimen in a petri dish.
</P>
<P>
   The universe of available coffee tables suddenly seemed small.
Luckily, the Internet can provide a Big Bang. While questions may
remain about the original cosmic explosion, I can attest that the
online version has more than once expanded my choices miraculously.
So I went to  &UR; www.hotbot.com &LR;  to search for Art Deco furniture.
</P>
<P>
   This is how I ended up at  &UR; www.modernism.com &LR; , belonging to a
furniture dealer in Coral Gables, Fla. On the site, I saw a
snapshot of, well, the most beautiful coffee table in existence.
Not too big, not too small, not red at all. Eagerly, I sent a
polite e-mail inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The prompt response came on Nov. 25. ``Dear Michelle, the price
is $4,500, which includes packing, insurance and shipping within
the continental United States.''
</P>
<P>
   I read that repeatedly, trying to process the fact that a piece
of wooden furniture, 44 inches in diameter, cost roughly as much as
my first car. Quickly I replied, declaring the table to be beyond
my budget.
</P>
<P>
   But over the next few days, as I hauled home and later returned
a sharp-cornered, orangish $50 table on which the baby managed to
cut her lip, I kept returning to my computer to stare at the very,
 &UR; very &LR;  expensive coffee table. Have I mentioned that it was
constructed of African rosewood (whatever that is)?
</P>
<P>
   The impulse that led me to the Internet in the first place _ the
fact that I hate to be thwarted _ had now planted a dangerous idea
in my head: I had to get that table.
</P>
<P>
   On a practical level, I realized that even toying with the idea
of throwing away my children's college funds was a severe
indictment of my character. But I no longer cared. They can get
scholarships, I thought. Meanwhile, I will entertain beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   But first, I needed to rationalize the purchase. So I went to
Moneyminded  &UR; (www.moneyminded.com) &LR; , a Web site whose goal is to
help women get control of their finances. My covert goal:
persuading this Web site to convince me that my finances were in
better shape than they appeared to my accountant.
</P>
<P>
   The site has a nice selection of quizzes that allow you to plug
in figures like household income and projected investment returns
to determine if you are headed for retirement-on-a-yacht
commercials or for a broken, penniless old age.
</P>
<P>
   I was taken aback when a quick scan of the site yielded no
``Should you buy that expensive coffee table?'' quiz. However, I
lingered for a while on the amusing ``How Much Should That Home
Repair Cost?'' calculator. There I learned that a plumber charges,
on average, $72 to fix an overflowing toilet. In the New York area,
add 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Amusing, yes, but not what I needed. It occurred to me then that
a house without the perfect coffee table could be considered a
broken house, in need of repair. If one applied the plumbing
equation to a broken house, it would be necessary to factor in an
hourly labor rate for time spent fretting over a coffee table. (I
think $100 an hour would be fair, $150 if it occurs when you should
be asleep.) Figuring, conservatively, that there was one hour of
fretting, that's $150 right there. And this is to say nothing of
the cost of cleaning up spilled party food ($3.99 for carpet
fluid), the broken plate ($6), plus a modest $1,000 settlement for
pain and suffering endured by the owner of the broken home. This
would bring the average cost to $1,159.99, plus a 32 percent
differential in the New York area: a grand total of $1,531.19.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this method of calculation was flawed, because the
total came nowhere near the cost of the rosewood coffee table. But
elsewhere on the Moneyminded site, I could ascertain the general
state of my household's financial health. To see if I was saving
enough for retirement, I entered annual income, number of years
until retirement, savings and investments, and then pressed the
key.
</P>
<P>
   I had anticipated the response: ``Wow, you've been diligent. So
go out and treat yourself to that coffee table.'' Instead, I got:
``Caution! You need to get serious about saving for retirement and
simply can't afford to wait any longer.'' The Web site advised me
to increase my retirement savings by $8,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Panicky, I reviewed my answers, and then hit on a solution: What
if I changed them? What if I projected a 15 percent annual return
on retirement investments? And increased the number of years left
until retirement from 30 to, say, 50? After all, my husband and I
are writers, not professional athletes. Why would we ever have to
retire?
</P>
<P>
   It worked. The new response: ``Take it easy! You may be saving
for retirement too aggressively.'' It recommended saving $0 a year
for the rest of our lives _ instantly freeing up valuable coffee
table funds.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I fully understood the state of my household finances,
I realized I was a rich woman. I could afford the coffee table. I
peeked at its image again and realized ... I no longer wanted it.
But I do have my eye on a $9,800 mirror-paneled night table that
recently caught my eye.

 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO, D.F. _ En Mexico, el Tratado de Libre Comercio (NAFTA)
significa cambio. Cinco anos despues de entrar en vigor, el TLC se
ha convertido en el motor de grandes transformaciones en el sector
empresarial. Los mercados abiertos y la libre competencia han
obligado a los ejecutivos a transformar sus companias para
enfrentar los retos del comercio libre. Y durante la crisis
economica de 1995, el TLC fue un salvavidas para cientos de
empresas mexicanas, aunque la competencia extranjera saco del
negocio a las mas debiles.
 &HT;    El TLC dio un gran impulso al comercio entre Mexico y Estados
Unidos, y convirtio a Canada en el segundo socio comercial de
Mexico. El comercio interregional crecio en mas del 10 por ciento y
causo enormes embotellamientos de trafico en los cruces
fronterizos. ``El TLC es una de las mayores ventajas competitivas
de Mexico,'' dice Luis Rubio, destacado economista y director del
Centro de Desarrollo de Mexico. ``Es una herramienta excepcional
para el desarrollo de la economia mexicana porque atrae un gran
volumen de inversion extranjera que genera empleos, transferencia
de tecnologia, oportunidades indirectas de exportacion a traves de
cadenas de suministro, y capacitacion para trabajadores y
ejecutivos. Ademas, genera un acceso seguro al mercado
estadounidense.''
 &HT;    El efecto sobre las companias en Estados Unidos y Canada tambien
ha sido positivo, aunque su alcance ha sido mas modesto. En muchos
sentidos, el pacto comercial simplemente ratifico y codifico
tendencias en sectores manufactureros como el textil y el
automotriz. Pero a las companias de otros sectores, y a las
empresas menores que antes no consideraban la posibilidad de
exportar, el TLC allano el camino al hacer aumentar las ventas y
racionalizar los costos. Aunque el efecto macroeconomico en los dos
paises mayores ha sido minimo, para las empresas que se han
beneficiado directamente de los nuevos mercados el TLC es
emocionante y exitoso.
 &HT;    De hecho,ya se observan nuevas tendencias en como las empresas
funcionan en Norteamerica. En los cinco ultimos anos ha habido un
gran aumento en el numero de empresas conjuntas y la inversion
extranjera directa, sobre todo en Mexico. Numerosas operaciones
fabriles con gran volumen de mano de obra se han desplazado hacia
Mexico, especialmente en los sectores textil, automotriz y la
electronica, los tres principales segmentos comerciales bajo el
pacto regional. ``El TLC ha posibilitado que las empresas
manufactureras tomen decisiones basandose solamente en los costos
de manufactura,'' explica Chris Padilla, director de relaciones
comerciales internacionales de la empresa estadounidense Eastman
Kodak, que anuncio recientemente que espera ahorrar US$1.000
millones en dos anos trasladando la produccion de sus procesadores
de peliculas radiograficas a Mexico, donde ya tiene operaciones de
ensamblaje de camaras desechables y tarjetas de circuitos impresos.
La produccion de pelicula para toda Norteamerica, proceso que
requiere un gran volumen de capital, se ha centralizado en una
planta en Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    Cualquier consumidor mexicano con dinero para comprar productos
importados de Estados Unidos tiene la ventaja de los bajos
aranceles. Para millones de mexicanos, los beneficios directos del
pacto han sido escasos.
 &HT;    Incluso desde el punto de vista empresarial, las ventajas de las
fronteras abiertas se concentran en unos centenares de grandes
empresas internacionales y en una cantidad limitada de empresas
menores con el valor, la suerte y el conocimiento para aprovechar
los mercados de exportacion.
 &HT;    Las exportaciones de Mexico se han duplicado desde 1994, de
US$60.000 millones al ano a una cifra esperada de US$120.000
millones en 1998. Las exportaciones a Estados Unidos han crecido a
casi US$100.000 millones, convirtiendo a Mexico en el tercer
suministrador de productos y servicios al mercado estadounidense,
despues de Canada y Japon. Con las exportaciones estadounidenses a
Mexico mas o menos al mismo nivel, el vecino del sur es el segundo
mercado del mundo para los productos de Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    Las grandes empresas mexicanas han sido, evidentemente, los
ganadores. El Grupo Alfa, un conglomerado de US$3.900 millones,
exporta la cuarta parte de sus ventas. El Grupo Desc y San Luis
Corporacion se han convertido en importantes suministradores de
piezas para automoviles al mercado estadounidense. El Grupo
Industrial Bimbo, fabricante de pan, e Isaac Saba, magnate del
sector textil, hicieron adquisiciones multimillonarias en Estados
Unidos en sus respectivos giros en 1998.
 &HT;    La mayoria de las empresas pequenas, que constituyen el grueso
de los empleos en Mexico, cuando no tambien su produccion, han
quedado fuera de la fiesta al carecer de los recursos para realizar
investigaciones de mercado y buscar compradores extranjeros, o
sencillamente porque debido a diversos factores no lograron
competir en el mercado internacional.
 &HT;    Alejandro Hernandez, tecnico en estampado de metales de la
capital mexicana, es un ejemplo. A principios de los anos 90, fue
uno de los muchos que creyeron al presidente Carlos Salinas de
Gortari cuando prometio que el libre comercio libraria a Mexico de
la pobreza cronica. Asi las cosas, tomo US$90.000 en prestamos y
abrio un taller de estampado para abastecer a grandes empresas
industriales. Pero el sueno de Hernandez se convirtio en una
pesadilla. ``La competencia fue muy dura. Poco a poco nos fuimos
quedando atras, incluso antes de la devaluacion del peso,'' relata
Hernandez, que cerro el taller en 1995 y dejo en la calle a 35
empleados. ``Cuando la crisis llego, los pagos de los intereses se
duplicaron y no hubo mas remedio que cerrar. Los prestamos eran
demasiado caros y el mercado estaba muy dificil. Nos equivocamos al
creer que solo invirtiendo podiamos desarrollarnos.''
 &HT;    Los economistas dicen que el TLC es solo uno de muchos factores
(el efecto tequila y el ritmo inexorable de la globalizacion, entre
otros) que han afectado a Mexico. Sin embargo, muchos otros se
hallaron en situaciones similares, y cuando sus companias salieron
perdiendo culparon al TLC. Algunos criticos del libre comercio
afirman que la politica de liberalizacion del gobierno mexicano
socava la base industrial del pais y allana el camino hacia una
crisis aguda. Pero otros tienen una opinion distinta. ``Creo que el
TLC salvo la economia mexicana durante la crisis,'' dice Alberto
Covarrubias, director general de Walmi Transformer, una compania de
450 empleados en la ciudad nortena de Saltillo, que exporta filtros
de aire para motores de automoviles y otros usos. ``No me imagino
como estaria ahora el pais sin el TLC.''
 &HT;    Walmi Transformer forma parte de un grupo exclusivo de empresas
pequenas y medianas que consideraron que el libre comercio era
inevitable y decidieron actuar en consecuencia. La compania
abastecia al mercado nacional desde una planta en Lermo, un pueblo
industrial en el centro de Mexico. Pero varios anos antes de
firmarse el TLC, los ejecutivos de Walmi decidieron que el futuro
estaba en las exportaciones y se trasladaron a Saltillo, a un dia
en auto de la frontera con Texas, donde modernizaron sus tecnicas
de produccion, los metodos administrativos y las practicas de
ventas. ``Es un proceso largo y todos tienen que participar,'' dice
Covarrubias. ``Las companias que se modernizaron pueden aprovechar
todos esos cambios, pero las que creyeron que las cosas en realidad
nunca cambiarian lo pagan caro.''
 &HT;    Hoy, Walmi vende filtros de aire tanto a fabricantes de autos
como al mercado de piezas de repuestos, asi como filtros especiales
a companias como Ingersoll Rand. La empresa gano el Premio Nacional
de Exportacion de Mexico en 1997 por su desempeno en los mercados
en Estados Unidos y Canada, y recientemente firmo un contrato con
una compania alemana tras asistir a una feria comercial en
Hamburgo. Covarrubias cerro el almacen de la empresa en Laredo,
Texas, al darse cuenta de que con el TLC, las habituales demoras
burocraticas en la aduana eran c osa del pasado.
 &HT;    Algunas empresas grandes lograron convertir rapidamente sus
operaciones dirigidas al mercado interno en operaciones
exportadoras: Goodyear de Mexico y la mayor parte de los
fabricantes de autos asi lo hicieron en 1995. Pero Walmi es un caso
tipico de las companias pequenas que necesitaron varios anos para
dar ese paso.
 &HT;    Techtube de Mexico, una aceria independiente de alta tecnologia
de Mexico D.F., con 150 empleados, se fundo en 1990 y comenzo a
exportar en 1995. Pero eso ocurrio dos anos despues que la empresa
decidio comprar equipos por varios millones de dolares a
suministradores especializados de Francia, Italia y Alemania para
producir tubos y juntas de acero inoxidable de gran calidad. ``El
TLC fue un detonador de toda nuestra inversion, porque vimos una
gran oportunidad de exportar a Estados Unidos y logramos calcular
el rendimiento de nuestras inversiones debido al tratado,'' dice
Sergio Espinoza, gerente de exportaciones de la compania.
``Queriamos competir contra los grandes. Es ahi cuando uno descubre
lo que sabe, y aprende mas rapido.''
 &HT;    Hoy, Techtube vende aproximadamente la mitad de su produccion en
Mexico: suministra tubos de acero para la nueva planta del coloso
cervecero Grupo Modelo en Zacatecas y para otras grandes empresas.
Exporta la otra mitad a Estados Unidos y Canada, y el resto a
America Latina.
 &HT;    El TLC tambien ha atraido a firmas extranjeras interesadas no
solo en atender el mercado mexicano, sino tambien en utilizar a
Mexico como plataforma de exportaciones a Estados Unidos. Mexico
recibio US$12 millones en inversion extranjera directa en 1997, mas
que cualquier pais latinoamericano excepto Brasil, que todavia no
ha terminado de privatizar enormes empresas estatales.
 &HT;    Mexico supero a China como mayor exportador de productos
textiles a Estados Unidos en 1998, impulsado por el auge de las
maquiladoras. General Motors y el gigante canadiense del transporte
y las finanzas Bombardier unieron fuerzas para ensamblar
locomotoras en Mexico. Las piezas grandes se envian desde las
plantas de GM en Estados Unidos a la instalacion de Bombardier en
Mexico para el ensamblaje, y luego se venden en toda Latinoamerica.
Delphi, filial de piezas de repuesto de GM, ya es la mayor fuente
privada de empleos en Mexico, con mas de 27.000 trabajadores.
``Creemos que Mexico se fortalecera cada vez mas,'' dice Tom
Glaser, ejecutivo de la firma norteamericana de camiones Contract
Freighters, Inc. ``Mas fabricas estadounidenses se trasladaran a
Mexico y hara falta llevar mas piezas y componentes de Estados
Unidos.''
 &HT;    Sara Lee, la gran empresa norteamericana diversificada, aunque
no ha abierto nuevas plantas en Mexico, ha visto un cambio en la
produccion al reducirse los costos generales de los productos
libres de aranceles bajo el TLC. ``No hemos dependido tanto del
Lejano Oriente para nuestras necesidades de abastecimiento,'' dice
Peggy Carter, portavoz de Sara Lee. Carter agrego que las plantas
mexicanas han aumentado su capacidad de competencia bajo el TLC.
 &HT;    Los productos textiles son un buen ejemplo de la correspondencia
entre los aspectos complementarios de la economia de Mexico con los
de Canada y Estados Unidos y como han beneficiado a las companias y
su capacidad de competir en otros mercados. Antes de que el pacto
comercial entrara en vigor, Quaker Fabric Corp., una empresa textil
estadounidense con ventas anuales de US$200 millones, no consiguio
una licencia para exportar sus productos a Mexico. Pero desde que
se implemento el TLC, la compania ha abierto oficinas en Mexico
D.F. y en Guadalajara, donde 150 de los 2.300 empleados de la
compania en Estados Unidos deben sus trabajos a la nueva corriente
de ingresos por concepto de exportacion.
 &HT;    ``Es una asociacion natural,'' dice Larry Liebenow, presidente
ejecutivo de Quaker Fabric. ``En Estados Unidos se hacen productos
mas complejos, como hilazas y telas para tapizado. Las operaciones
de corte y costura se trasladan a Mexico. Ya hace varios anos que
ese negocio se saca de Estados Unidos. Pero con el TLC, la ropa se
mueve de Asia a Mexico, y eso es importante porque los fabricantes
mexicanos de ropa compran mucha tela estadounidense como materia
prima.''
 &HT;    Ademas del TLC y la ubicacion en Mexico, las companias
canadienses han establecido operaciones de manufactura en Mexico
debido a la fuerza laboral productiva y calificada, explica Andres
Darvasi, presidente de la Camara Canadiense de Comercio en Mexico y
director de mercadeo y ventas de las operaciones de Bombardier en
Mexico.
 &HT;    Al mismo tiempo, el TLC ha divulgado en Canada las oportunidades
existentes en Mexico, agrega.
 &HT;    ``El TLC ha aportado beneficios considerables a las empresas
canadienses,'' dice Katherine Funtek, secretaria comercial de la
embajada de Canada en Mexico. ``Entre los numerosos aspectos
positivos estan un mejor acceso al mercado mexicano, especialmente
en areas que antes tenian un gran proteccionismo, como las piezas
automotrices, los equipos y los servicios de transporte, el gas
natural y los productos textiles.''
 &HT;    Otras ventajas son la creacion de mecanismos eficaces para
solucionar disputas y una mayor transparencia y acceso a las
adquisiciones gubernamentales, dice Funtek.
 &HT;    La economia canadiense tambien se ha beneficiado de un
incremento de su capacidad competitiva, agrega.
 &HT;    Como resultado de todos estos cambios causados por el TLC, la
inversion extrajera de empresas de Estados Unidos y Canada supera
con creces los fondos que provienen de otras partes del mundo y su
importancia crece. En efecto, la estabilidad que da un tratado
multilateral ha persuadido a las empresas a desviar la inversion
destinada a otros centros manufactureros tradicionales hacia
Mexico.
 &HT;    Las empresas esperan aprovechar sus inversiones en Mexico mas
alla de las fronteras del TLC. Las plantas mexicanas de fabricantes
de autos como General Motors, Ford y Chrysler, Nissan (Japon) y
Volkswagen (Alemania) han aumentado su presencia, y en 1997,
enviaron casi un millon de vehiculos a distintas partes del
planeta. Samsung (Corea), Sony (Japon) y otras empresas de
electronica han convertido a Tijuana en la capital mundial de la
produccion de televisores. ``El TLC es el motor de todo este
crecimiento,'' dice Horacio Ojeda, director de planeamiento de
negocios en el departamento de fibras de las operaciones mexicanas
de DuPont. ``Pero es mas que eso. Tambien queremos exportar a
Europa, America Latina y Asia.''
 &HT;    Aun no se han determinado con exactitud otros efectos indirectos
del TLC. En Mexico D.F. crece la demanda de buenos inmuebles por
parte de firmas extranjeras. Y con la invasion de empresas
industriales, hay una gran competencia entre bufetes, contables,
consultores y otras firmas de servicios.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, al margen de este exito, a los escepticos les
preocupa que Mexico no este haciendo lo suficiente para aprovechar
el TLC. Despues de todo, la ventaja competitiva que le da el acceso
privilegiado al mercado estadounidense desaparecera si Estados
Unidos firma pactos comerciales similares (como el ALCA) con otros
paises de America Latina o en otras regiones. ``En la practica,
dejamos el desarrollo del pais a la iniciativa de cada individuo,''
comenta el economista Rubio. ``No hay nada malo en eso, pero no es
suficiente. La realidad es que solo una pequena parte de los
mexicanos recogen los frutos del TLC.''
 &HT;    Mexico aun necesita mejoras internas para cimentar su capacidad
de competencia, sobre todo en la educacion y los servicios
financieros. Para consolidar su ventaja y distribuir las ganancias
entre segmentos mayores de la poblacion, Mexico debe resolver estas
apremiantes debilidades, senala Rubio.
 &HT;    Es cierto que Mexico necesitaba y necesita empleos de bajo
nivel, pero al entrar el TLC en su segundo quinquenio, esperan
aumentar los salarios y las ganancias con productos mas complejos.
El TLC ya ha creado una de las zonas comerciales de crecimiento mas
rapido de todo el mundo con el comercio entre Mexico y EU. Pero en
Mexico, el TLC significa cambio, y el cambio que tiene lugar bajo
el TLC debe verse mas bien como una evolucion.

APPLE SHOWS ITS COLORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a barrage of introductions that blended
technological prowess with a delightful sense of style and fun,
Apple Computer this week introduced a powerful new line of desktop
computer systems in a color scheme it calls translucent blueberry
and ice, as well as an array of improved iMac computers that come
in an assortment of colors including blueberry, grape, lime,
tangerine and strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   Although translucent blueberry is its major color theme, Apple
is clearly not singing the blues any more. At the Macworld Expo
trade show here, Apple disclosed that it is in the black for the
fifth consecutive quarter after a disastrous two-year stretch that
nearly pushed the fabled Silicon Valley company into irrelevance.
</P>
<P>
   PC Data, a market research company, recently calculated that
Apple had doubled its share of the domestic computer market in
1998, to 10 percent, in large part because of the sale of 800,000
iMac computers since the model was introduced less than five months
ago. According to Apple, 32 percent of those iMacs went to people
who had never bought a personal computer before, and 13 percent to
people who were switching from Windows systems.
</P>
<P>
   Added up, all those numbers confirm momentum for Apple. Even
people who use computers based on Microsoft Windows should be
cheered, because Apple is doing a better job than any other PC
company today at bringing excitement and innovation back to an
industry that has often been boring and beige.
</P>
<P>
   Apple still does not have a computer that competes in the
under-$1,000 price category, which has been a magic level for PC
companies, although it did cut the price of the iMac this week by
$100, to $1,199. And there were no signs here of the
much-anticipated ``consumer portable,'' a low-cost Mac laptop that
Apple promises will be ready in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those modest disappointments, Apple's new blueberry
Power Macintosh G3 desktop computers, which start at $1,599, are
very likely to turn Mac users, and even some Windows PC users,
green with envy. It is too soon for a formal evaluation _ the
machines were closely guarded until Tuesday's introduction _ but
first impressions appear to bear out Apple's claims that the G3s
match or exceed any other PCs, whether used for work or play.
</P>
<P>
   Just as with the original iMacs, the first thing you notice
about the G3s is the distinctive blue-and-white design. From the
side, they resemble a big pillow, with peaked but rounded corners
that conveniently and cleverly serve as handles. The side opens
easily from the top, folding down to display, in relatively
uncluttered fashion, all of the expansion slots and bays that most
users will want to fool with.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, no other personal computer on the market makes it so
easy to get inside the box to add more memory or extra storage
devices. The open-door design is so elegant that some of us will
probably leave it open all the time, just to admire the components
and circuitry laid out like a scale model of a silicon city's
buildings and streets.
</P>
<P>
   On the G3's pretty blue backside is an array of high-speed
connection ports, including two Universal Serial Bus outlets (for
connecting the new generation of USB-compliant monitors, printers,
keyboards, mice, scanners and other common peripherals) and,
looking to the future, two very fast Firewire connection ports that
some day soon will be useful for connecting digital video cameras,
high-speed storage devices and other high-end peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   USB represents a significant improvement in performance and ease
of use over older connection schemes like the Apple Desktop Bus
(ADB). Apple has retained one ADB port to enable people to connect
their older peripherals. But, Apple warned, the ADB port will
eventually be eliminated, joining the SCSI (``scuzzy'') connection
scheme in obsolescence.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who have SCSI peripherals that are not yet ready
for the scrap heap, Apple offers a $50 adapter card that plugs into
one of the four expansion slots inside the G3.
</P>
<P>
   The USB ports will make it easy to replace the icky mouse and
keyboard that are standard with the new G3 desktops. Some people
have come to love, or at least tolerate, the hockey-puck mouse and
skeletal keyboard that Apple introduced with the iMac, but I am not
among them. Gamers will also want to add a decent set of USB
speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Such quibbles over feeble peripherals should not overshadow the
power of the new G3 models, however. There are three, increasingly
powerful versions of a new Power PC microprocessor that uses a
copper wiring scheme.
</P>
<P>
   The base G3 model, which costs $1,599, includes a 300-MHz Power
PC chip with 64 megabytes of DRAM, 512 kilobytes of level 2
backside cache, a 6-gigabyte hard disk, a 24X-speed CD-ROM drive,
an Ethernet network connection port along with USB and Firewire
and, in an improvement certain to excite game players, an ATI Rage
128 graphics controller with a whopping 16 megabytes of video
memory.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The ATI Rage 128 chip, in fact, is now included in all the G3
Macs, which simply means that the Macintosh is now a screaming game
machine. Owners of Windows-based machines can come close to
achieving similar performance by adding a $200 graphics card to the
fastest PCs, but Apple has chosen to make such performance standard
on the G3 line.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of midlevel G3 machines, at base prices of $1,999 and
$2,499, employ a 350-MHz version of the Power PC chip and 1 MB of
cache memory, further enhancing the machine's performance. The
$2,499 model includes a Zip drive and an extra 64 MB of DRAM, as
well as the other features of the base model.
</P>
<P>
   At the high end, $2,999 will buy a G3 Mac that includes a
400-MHz chip, 128 MB RAM, 1 MB of backside cache, a fast 9-GB hard
disk and a CD-ROM drive. At the really high end, both in terms of
performance and price, the new G3s can be rigged with a staggering
1 GB of system memory and more than 100 GB of internal storage,
consisting of a trio of 36-GB hard drives that Apple says will be
available soon.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve its goal of becoming the best game machine, Apple has
to convince more game developers to resume writing software for the
Mac. To that end, Apple also provided an early peek at the Virtual
Game Station, a $50 software product from the Connectix Corp. that
allows Macs to play most of the games available for the popular
Sony Playstation game console.
</P>
<P>
   The superb graphics capabilities of the G3 models deserve to be
shown off on a high-quality display, and Apple has three new ones
to offer.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have $1,499 to spend, a big, stout desk and no
fear of hernias, Apple's massive new 21-inch monitor is a luxurious
and impressive display. Graphics professionals will admire its
automatic color-calibration abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have considerably less desk space will appreciate the
revamped 15-inch Studio Display flat-panel monitor, which has a
newly lowered price of $1,099. For everyone else, there is a new
17-inch monitor with a wallet-friendly $499 list price. All three
displays share the blueberry and ice color scheme of the new G3
desktop Macs.
</P>
<P>
   As for the new iMacs, the technical improvements over the
original models consist of a slightly faster processor (a 266-MHz
G3 chip) and a bigger hard disk (6 GB). Otherwise, the major
changes are the addition of all the new colors and the lower price.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft Corp., meanwhile, reaffirmed its commitment to the
Macintosh community here by releasing two new Mac software products
_ the Internet Explorer 4.5 Web browser and the Outlook Express 4.5
mail manager _ as well as a new Internet Web site devoted expressly
to Macintosh users (www.microsoft.com/mac). As before, the price of
the programs is right: free. And you get far more than you pay for.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Explorer 4.5 in particular is a welcome upgrade, with a
number of compelling performance advantages over its main rival
from Netscape, including features that are not available on any
Windows browsers. Microsoft claims that the new Mac version is
easier to download and install, more reliable (i.e., it crashes
less frequently), faster to boot into memory and more clever in
keeping track of pages that have been viewed already.
</P>
<P>
   One of many praiseworthy features is a new ``print preview''
function that allows people to print copies of Web pages much more
easily than before, without chopped margins and paper-wasting
second sheets for those few lines of ancillary junk at the bottom
of many Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   With print preview, pages can be shrunk to fit on a single sheet
of paper, cluttered backgrounds can be eliminated, white text on
colored backgrounds can be transposed to black on white, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Apple reopened its online Apple store
(www.store.apple.com) this week after shutting it down over the
holidays. In a case of welcome failure, the site was temporarily
overwhelmed, apparently by people eager to place orders for the new
Macs. Apple must be tickled pink.

INNER JOURNEY HAS DANGEROUS PATCHES

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, I'm on my way to Mississippi on ice, and my heart has taken
up residence someplace outside my chest. Not permanently. Not in
any one place. It moves frequently between my chest and my mouth.
</P>
<P>
   I am so tense that I speak only to tell Jimmy to slow down, to
watch that car, or to warn Jamila, forever thinking out loud, to
quiet down.
</P>
<P>
   I notice Asha, at peace in the seat behind her father, reading
another of those Baby-Sitters Club books that she loves so much. I
wish for the days when Jamila was more this way, so much so that
the words break loose from my lips like water overflowing a dam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamila, you used to be so sweet,'' I sputter. I want to take
the words back, but they hit the air so hard that they break into a
thousand little pieces.
</P>
<P>
   I start to apologize, but before I can get the words out, Jamila
tells me, ``Well, Mama, people change.''
</P>
<P>
   Before I can respond, her father, forever composed, adds, ``But
you should always try to become better, not worse.''
</P>
<P>
   I can't speak. For miles, his words hang over me. I wish I could
be more like him. I think about the New Year and resolutions. I
hear my mother's voice singing, ``Search me, Lord.'' I search
myself. Wonder what I might change about me.
</P>
<P>
   Under the constant humming of highway traffic, I resist being
too hard on myself. I reason that some people live a lifetime and
never change, never even see the need. They go through life as if
fixed forever. But nothing is forever, really. The Earth is always
shifting, generations are always being born, and I have been made a
thousand times over.
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing is, I've never made a New Year's resolution. Never
promised myself I'd lose a pound (I love to eat too much to lie
about not eating). Never promised to quit, well, anything.
</P>
<P>
   But something inside of me inevitably forces me to take stock of
my life, and not just on New Year's. So every now and then, I make
deliberate attempts to change who I am, to give up bad habits, to
add a new and better one. Other times, it seems, change has simply
forced itself upon me.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the old year gives way, I think about the new one and
how I might be different, better than in 1998. Should I change my
hair or the way I dress? Maybe, at my age, I really shouldn't eat
so much. Maybe I should finally add real exercise to my daily
routine, and not rely so much on working up a sweat doing
housework. Maybe I should resolve to become debt-free. I've managed
that feat before. Of course, before there were children.
</P>
<P>
   I inhale deeply and wonder, ``What's this about? Jamila's
revelation? Jimmy's? The new year? Resolutions? Should I have to
think so hard about this?''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it possible to go to bed one night, wake up one morning or
simply walk through a door you've known all your life and discover
between inhaling and exhaling that the self you've sewn together
isn't measuring up, is, as the Scripture says, as dirty rags?
</P>
<P>
   I resist these thoughts the way I struggle with Jimmy's reckless
driving. I reason that it is much easier to give a name to the evil
without than to locate the terror within.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, in a world seemingly drunk on fine old freedom, it is
much easier to ignore one's own faults. I resolve to not do that,
to start over when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Then, I start to worry. Worry about how life's circumstances can
cause us to break even the most solemn vow. I think, ``What's the
use?'' I think what I really need, for starters, is a change of
attitude.

A TWINKLING TERRACE THAT REACHES FOR THE STARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY PAULA DEITZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Zooming up the Champs-Elysees in her Saab, Kathryn
Gustafson, an American landscape architect, stopped to admire
bouquets of roses tightly arrayed in the rear window of a florist's
truck. ``That's a garden, too,'' she said, and she drove on.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers had better prepare themselves for such judgments.
Ms. Gustafson, 47, has been handed her first U.S. project, the
Arthur Ross Terrace at the American Museum of Natural History,
scheduled to open in the spring of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Her new, nearly one-acre urban garden will be just outside the
moonlike sphere, designed by Polshek &AMP; Partners, that will house
the new planetarium. Ms. Gustafson's terrace, on the 81st Street
side of the museum, will echo what's inside, with a long slanting
shadow of dark granite _ meant to evoke a lunar eclipse _ that will
glisten with streaks of water and twinkle with fiber-optic stars
depicting the constellation Orion.
</P>
<P>
   James Stewart Polshek, architect of the planetarium, said Ms.
Gustafson won the competition to design the terrace because ``she
understood that the design must be metaphorically linked to the
planetarium.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen V. Futter, the museum's president, said she found Ms.
Gustafson's spare design for the terrace ``elegant yet simple,
harmonizing both with nature on earth and with the universe beyond,
in a physical context.'' She expects that crowds will be drawn to
the pristine quality of this public space, and to Ms. Gustafson's
fantasy of fiber-optic starlight that will sparkle at night.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1997, Ms. Gustafson lived and worked in France. Now, she
is back in her native Washington, on Vashon Island in Puget Sound,
but she still commutes to Paris for work. Her projects remain best
known in Europe, and it is necessary to understand what she has
done abroad in order to comprehend her vocabulary for the museum
terrace, which is only beginning to take shape.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gustafson's esthetic veers toward abstract and minimalist
forms, and was shaped in France by her mentors there, including the
well-known landscape architect Jacques Sgard (``I never drew a
curve before I worked with him''), the sculptor Igor Mitoraj (``He
gave me the tools to sculpt my clay models'') and Peter Rice,
structural engineer of the Pompidou Center. Walks among the
systematic beds and the glasshouses of the Jardin des Plantes in
Paris influenced her planting designs.
</P>
<P>
   What has evolved is a vision of landscape as an immense canvas
to shape and manipulate. Ms. Gustafson takes into consideration the
movement of people through these spaces and the environment beyond:
not only buildings, but also shifting sunlight and shadows
throughout the day or, at night, landscapes made vivid by her
lighting design.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, she has been involved in three dozen important
public projects: town squares, corporate landscapes and city parks.
The Parc de la Villette, in Paris, is on her roster, as are a
number of projects for corporations and governments.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, when the city of Lausanne, Switzerland,
invited landscape architects to enhance its narrow streets and
broad esplanades for an International Festival of Urban Gardens,
Ms. Gustafson redesigned the esplanade of Montbenon, an undefined
expanse of lawn overlooking Lake Geneva. By placing swathes of
silvery leafed plants next to long blue beds, she linked this plaza
visually with the gray-blue waters and the Alps rising beyond.
Then, with the composer Francois Paris, she suspended glass chimes
and gongs from metal arches along the adjacent walkways. Their
tinkling sounds were reminiscent of Swiss clock chimes.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, Ms. Gustafson was in the London offices of Sir
Norman Foster, the architect of the Great Glass House for Britain's
newest botanic garden, the National Botanic Garden of Wales in
Llanarthne. It will open next year. The elliptical structure, 330
feet long, will be the largest single-span glasshouse in the world.
Ms. Gustafson is designing the interior, best described as the
Grand Canyon under a glass sky. With deep, sharply cut stone chasms
and crevices, a 16-foot waterfall and a flood plain at the bottom,
the landscape, to be planted with Mediterranean flora from the
Northern and Southern hemispheres, will be a milestone in botanic
garden design.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But France has been her stronghold, especially the town of
Rueil-Malmaison on the Seine, eight miles west of Paris, where
several corporations have built new homes nestled among the quiet
residential streets lined with linden trees. Those corporations
wanted to add to, not detract from, suburban neighborhoods already
filled with gardens. Ms. Gustafson gave Shell Petroleum rolling
green lawns that are bermed up against the headquarters building.
</P>
<P>
   One can understand why she says, ``I'd love to design a golf
course.'' The lush lawns, separated by sharp-cornered limestone
walls, are like a green lava flow.
</P>
<P>
   Her complex designs for corporations are comparable in scope to
gardens designed around palaces and chateaus in the 17th century,
though her work is more the equivalent of that of contemporary land
artists like Michael Heizer or James Turrell. Behind Shell's
buildings, Ms. Gustafson switched from a bold to an intimate,
almost domestic, scale. A canal cum water garden separates the two
main buildings, which are joined by a series of glass-enclosed
bridges. Along the water, plantings of dogwood, magnolia, azalea
and rhododendron are arrayed in color patterns from white to
purple. Along the canal, a low boardwalk with steel handrails
barely skims the water.
</P>
<P>
   In a simpler but no less elegant vein, Ms. Gustafson laid out a
series of rills in marble troughs in front of the Esso headquarters
just blocks away. The troughs stretch like ribbons of water between
rolling lawns and a grove of willow trees. From each side, these
channels empty into a shallow cascade that flows gently toward the
Seine.
</P>
<P>
   Her ideas about history, culture and memory are summed up in her
park for the medieval town of Terrasson in the Dordogne. It
redefines the meaning of gardens. On a steep hillside next to a
15th-century fortified abbey, Ms. Gustafson created what she
describes as ``history fragments of gardens'' or what the town
calls imaginary gardens. One mysterious feature of the park is how
streams, fountains and cascades rush into the open _ and just as
quickly disappear. It is possible to walk through her forest of
fountains there and, on a still day, not get wet.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gustafson is also in tune with Paris, and with what makes it
the City of Light. Driving by the Place de la Concorde one night,
she pointed out how the numerous lampposts are placed at different
heights. ``If you squint your eyes,'' she said, ``it is like
driving through a galaxy of stars.''

PETER ZUMTHOR: ARCHITECTURE'S SWISS MYSTIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DIANA KETCHAM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALDENSTEIN, Switzerland _ The image of the mountain mystic
clings to Peter Zumthor, the former cabinetmaker and surveyor who
is a leader of the new Swiss architecture. A visit to Zumthor is
not unlike a pilgrimage. It can take all day to traverse the
mountain valleys from Zurich to this farming hamlet of 700 in the
southeastern corner of the country. Here, among the music of
cowbells and smells of the chicken coops is Zumthor's studio,
distinguishable from his neighbors' wooden barns by its high-style
metal door.
</P>
<P>
   The door swings open and here stands the architect, looking the
part of the mystic, with his cropped hair, robelike garb and
bemused expression. Is he laughing at the sight of yet another
visitor arriving, breathless, at his door?
</P>
<P>
   At 55, Zumthor has barely a dozen buildings to his credit, yet a
powerful legend has grown up around him. Until last year, he
limited publication of his work, most of it in this remote canton
of Graubuenden. In contrast to the hectic spirit of much
fashionable architecture, he creates an architecture of calm and
sufficiency: his mountain buildings are simple volumes,
meticulously constructed of basic materials.
</P>
<P>
   When he was awarded the international Carlsberg Architecture
Prize in September, the judges noted: ``Perhaps because he lives in
a remote part of the country, he has been able to pursue his ideas
with few distractions. The isolation has not made him provincial,
but more profound.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zumthor's obscurity is becoming a thing of the past. The
first book on his work, ``Peter Zumthor: Works, Buildings and
Projects 1979-1997,'' appeared last spring, followed by a
collection of his essays, ``Thinking Architecture,'' both published
by Lars Mueller.
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, his museum for the Topography of Terror, on the
sensitive site of the former Gestapo headquarters, broke ground in
September. In Hamburg, his Swiss pavilion at Expo 2000 will soon be
underway. Such events inspired Richard Ingersoll to observe in
Architecture magazine that, like Zarathustra, Nietzsche's hermit
protagonist, ``Zumthor has come down from the mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an atmosphere of studied tranquillity to Zumthor's
studio, a low, shady room with a band of windows looking out into
fruit trees. On one side stands a grand piano. Zumthor is practiced
at calming the visitor. ``We all know what it feels like to be in a
good building,'' he says. ``It gives you a sense of well being, of
feeling good from within. I have such strong memories from my
childhood of this feeling. You can return years later and have the
same sensation.'' His voice rolls on, accompanied by Bach and the
clang of cowbells.
</P>
<P>
   Without belonging to any style or period, Zumthor's buildings
unselfconsciously evoke local tradition. His barnlike houses are
faced with boards. His shingled chapel in Sumvitg recalls the
cylindrical silos of the region. His Archaeological Museum, which
stands over the Roman ruins in Chur, the nearest town, is ``like a
barn we would build to protect bales of hay,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Evocatively photographed, the architect's wooden facades have
become his signature in the design press. Yet, similar wood siding
is ubiquitous in Graubuenden. What, then, causes critics to
describe his buildings as ``lyrical'' and ``ennobling'' or, in the
case of Ingersoll, ``wrenchingly mysterious''?
</P>
<P>
   The permeable sheds of Zumthor's Archaeological Museum do not
exceed what is needed to protect the Roman site. What could be more
practical here than wooden louvers? Yet the structure is not simply
utilitarian. In the daytime, these walls look solid. At night,
viewers have the thrill of looking through them.
</P>
<P>
   Zumthor has built the enclosure as not one, but two boxes, whose
subtle placement electrifies this corner of the town. They heighten
one's awareness of the handsome wood siding of the old building
across the street and of the rich texture of the forest behind
them. As the English critic Peter Davey said in awarding Zumthor
the Carlsberg prize, ``While his buildings always respect their
surrounding, they are never meekly contextual.'' The buildings hold
their own in Switzerland's highly evolved rural landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Zumthor wants people to experience silence in his buildings. For
him, this is a state related to permanence achieved through craft.
``I dislike cheap consumer products such as CD players, with their
built-in obsolescence,'' he told Mohsen Mostavi of the
Architectural Association in London. ``I prefer to have something
that my children might use, or my mother used before me.''
</P>
<P>
   The architect grew up in Basel, a Swiss city with a proud
artisan tradition. As a teen-ager in the 1950s, he served a
four-year apprenticeship in woodworking at the side of his father,
a cabinetmaker. Then, he took a degree in interior and furniture
design at the Basel Arts and Crafts School and a year of courses at
Pratt Institute in New York. In the '70s, he moved to Graubuenden
to work for the canton's preservation council.
</P>
<P>
   The architect relishes his youthful memories of the
cabinetmaker's shop. ``I was 18 when I got to design my first
cupboard,'' he said. ``I remember the satisfaction of fitting the
door so it closed with a special sucking sound. I have the Basel
pride in the well-built object.''
</P>
<P>
   Temperamentally, Zumthor suffers few of the urban architect's
afflictions. He doesn't talk about alienation, or the fragmentary
nature of modern life. He says straight out that ``buildings have a
soul.'' His writings are suffused with a marked optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``My colleagues Herzog and de Meuron used to say that
architecture as a single whole no longer exists,'' he said, ``but
has to be created in the head of the designer. I'm not mainly
interested in what buildings mean as symbols or vehicles for
ideas.'' And at a time when architecture can seem like just another
form of entertainment, Zumthor defends its separate identity. ``I
believe that architecture has its own tasks and that its essence is
the act of construction,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Zumthor's own command of building skills can be seen by the
naked eye. One has only to look up at the beams of his mountain
chapel, or observe the pattern of its shingle skin. Yet, he is
insistent that how buildings are put together affects us at a level
far deeper than the visual.
</P>
<P>
   In designing apartments for elderly mountain dwellers being
resettled in the town of Chur, he played on a range of sense
impressions. ``I wanted them to have many of the same experiences
as they had living in their mountain houses, such as wooden floors
that make a sound when you walk on them.'' In the kitchens, he put
small windows up high to catch the morning light, ``for mountain
people who have been early risers all their lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The architect's thermal baths in Vals, opened in 1997, have
brought design pilgrims to this quiet spa town. A tour de force of
stonework, the baths are an extreme expression of his lifelong
preoccupation with materials. He began by imagining a single
enormous block of the local stone emerging from the mountainside.
The baths would be created by hollowing out this stone.
</P>
<P>
   In the complex of pools, terraces, and changing rooms nearly
every surface is a greenish striated stone. Quarried nearby, it was
cut into 12-inch-wide ``boards'' that are stacked like lumber and
integrated into concrete walls. The lavish use of wide stone slabs
gives an impression of solidity rare in modern building.
</P>
<P>
   The result has inspired rapturous comparisons to the baths of
antiquity and primitive buildings. It also demonstrates the
ideological pitfalls for a contemporary architect who evokes the
timeless. Wilfried Wang, the director of the German Architecture
Museum in Frankfurt, said: ``This attempt to evoke an archaic
architecture is dishonest. If you want the primitive feeling of a
place like Stonehenge, you can't also have air-conditioning. This
is scenography.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the bath's admirers is Frank Barkow, a Berlin-based
architect who designed the American pavilion for Expo 2000. ``I
expected the baths to seem archaic and vulgar at the same time,''
he said, ``almost like something you'd find in Hollywood. Only
someone with this Swiss mastery of craft could bring it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Authentic or not, such buildings are painstakingly designed for
their mountain settings. Yet, Zumthor laughs at his image as an
exotic regional architect. ``This place is not the city, but it is
not remote,'' he said. ``My sons watch baseball and dye their hair
blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Chance led the architect to settle in the mountains. ``When I
came back to Switzerland in 1966, I was lost,'' he said. ``New York
in the Vietnam era had politicized me. My training in the Bauhaus
tradition suddenly seemed meaningless. When I heard about a job
here with the preservation council, it seemed like socially useful
work.''
</P>
<P>
   As easily as he wears his mountain persona, Zumthor is a man of
the world. His English is not only fluent, but hip. In the '80s, he
taught at the adventurous Southern California Institute for
Architecture in Santa Monica. He has declined subsequent
invitations to teach in the United States until recently; next
month he will join the Harvard University faculty for a term.
</P>
<P>
   Zumthor rejects labels, including Swiss minimalism. But he
acknowledges a general kinship with fellow Basel architects, like
Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, and Roger Diener. ``We share
the strain of sobriety in our culture, a respect for what is
pragmatic and down to earth,'' he explained. ``It's in the Basel
tradition of aristocratic understatement.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, Zumthor has left his mountain territory
for the town and city. Besides the baths, his most prominent new
building is the multistoried steel and glass art museum of 1997 in
Bregenz, Austria, which shimmers above the downtown lake front. As
with any regional architect famous for small country buildings,
Zumthor's admirers wonder about his future designing for urban
settings. If the shed is simply enlarged, the result can be a big
box. Will it be that critical anathema, a boring box?
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's what people said about me, I wouldn't care,'' he
said with a shrug. ``I don't make architecture to be entertaining.
I don't want to stir up emotions with buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   This attitude served Zumthor well when he won the Topography of
Terror museum competition in 1993. The setting is a weed-choked
vacant lot in the historic Wilhelmstrasse government district where
the Gestapo and SS headquarters and prison once stood. In 1979,
simple placards were placed around the grounds, stating what had
taken place there, one of Berlin's most feared addresses. Zumthor's
design is a long narrow building of alternating vertical ``boards''
of concrete and glass reminiscent of his shed for the
Archaeological Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Its modesty is in tune with Zumthor's assertion that ``what goes
on in a building is more important than the architecture.'' It is
also his way of respecting authenticity of place, a nearly sacred
concept in the Berlin architectural debate. The gallery will be
unheated, with a gravel floor, in the spirit of the original
outdoor exhibition. ``I don't want to give visitors the comforts
they would have in the symphony hall,'' he said. ``They can keep
their coats on while they look at the exhibit.''
</P>
<P>
   The architect is the last person to claim that he works best in
Swiss settings. ``If the world is not present, the work will be
dull,'' he said. Zumthor has his worldly ambitions. ``You know what
my dream is?'' he asked, leaning across the desk. ``To do a hotel
in New York City, a small hotel that would give people an
old-fashioned sense of home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The old buildings in New York are very well built,'' he said.
``There is a sense of materiality. I want to prove that the
architect in New York does not need to be alienated. I would not be
alienated there at all.'' Of course, he added with a smile, ever
the village householder, ``the hotel would have to be personally
run.''

CALL-IN SHOWS TAKE OVER DRIVER'S SEAT

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; What's the hot topic with Los Angeles drivers?
</P>
<P>
   Road rage, say Kenny Morse and Reed Berry, co-hosts of ``Traffic
Jam,'' the KRLA-AM (1110) show that looks behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are testy,'' Morse said. ``They're honking and flipping
each other off. Drivers don't use turn signals because it's
considered signaling the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   The call-in show, which airs at 1 p.m. Saturdays, features
interviews with well-known local residents such as Jay Leno, Dennis
Franz and Bob Barker.
</P>
<P>
   Radio and driving have been partners for ages. Along with
programs about driving, auto repair and car buying, local residents
are blessed with KKTR-AM (1650), an entire station devoted to
traffic reports.
</P>
<P>
   REMEMBER KMET?: The radio history of Los Angeles is well
documented, but one now-defunct station rarely gets mentioned _
KMET-FM.
</P>
<P>
   The free-form rock station went on the air in 1971 and featured
a roster of DJs including Dr. Demento, Jim Ladd, Steven Clean, Mary
Turner, Jeff Gonzer, Shadoe Stevens and Jimmy Rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   KMET _ which was at 5828 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles _ closed in
1987 but had begun to change fundamentally as early as 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Ladd, whose current show is broadcast at 6 p.m. weekdays on
KLOS-FM (95.5), wrote a book about life at KMET. Ladd's ``Radio
Waves: Life and Revolution on the FM Dial'' was published in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``KPCC-FM came first, then KMET,'' Ladd said Wednesday. ``It's
best described as the tribal drum _ it was free-form radio. What
I'm doing now at KLOS is free-form radio. They've given me the
opportunity to carry on that tradition.'' &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Polar air will return to the Northeast on brisk breezes from the
west after a cold front moves offshore on Thursday morning. Snow
showers will be frequent along the east shores of Lakes Erie and
Ontario, but sunshine should return east of the Appalachians during
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As the cold front moves into the Carolinas and Tennessee Valley,
jet stream winds will begin to blow parallel to the front causing
it to stall. Moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will stream northward
over the stationary front producing considerable cloudiness and
patches of light rain in the Gulf States.
</P>
<P>
   A mound of frigid, dry air centered over Indiana will quickly
glide east allowing milder, moist air to return to the Ohio Valley
later in the day. Clouds will rapidly increase and patches of snow
and ice will develop in parts of the southern Appalachians during
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and light snow will cover the western Plains as a strong
disturbance exits from the Rockies. A windstorm is possible along
the east slopes of mountains near the track of the storm in
Colorado. A wedge of dry air in the northeast Plains and southern
Great Lakes will promote sunny skies, but very cold weather.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest will notice more clouds with a little rain on the
Coast and showers in the Bitterroots. A ridge of high pressure will
move toward California. The clockwise circulation around the fair
weather system will cause offshore winds which will direct warm,
dry air into southern California. Fog trapped in the Central Valley
will change little.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Siege of Fog
</P>
<P>
   Visibility lowered to 300 feet in parts of California's Central
Valley early Wednesday as the siege of dense morning fog grew to
six days. In the early afternoon, however, visibility typically
improved to at least one mile once fog lifted into a deck of low
clouds. But, with the January sun hanging low in the sky, weak rays
of sunlight merely reflected off the top of low clouds instead of
penetrating thin spots and encouraging clouds to evaporate. With
low clouds staying intact by day, the stage has been set for clouds
to lower to the ground at night, causing the foggy cycle to recur.

A GAME THAT MELDS FIGHTING AND DANCING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Dance Fever'' meets Mortal Kombat.
</P>
<P>
   Parappa the Rapper meets ``Saturday Night Fever.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to discern the rationale behind Bust-a-Groove, a
strobe-lighted disco combat game developed in Japan. But if there
is a rationale, it has to do with dancing and fighting and how a
video game blurs the edges between them. There is a vocabulary of
moves, a kinesthetic grammar. In a video game, as in a martial arts
movie, combat is extremely formal and highly stylized. Just like
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   In Bust-a-Groove, you maneuver the controller to the beat of the
rhythm. If you execute a bunch of complex combination moves in sync
with the music, your character throws sparks on the dance floor and
the camera moves in for a close-up. The more camera time you get,
the more your Enthusiasm Gauge rises and the more dynamic your
overall performance. The object is to hog the camera, win over the
crowd and upstage your opponent.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the combat part comes in. Because each of the
game's 10 characters has a signature weapon _ fireballs, poison
gas, pistols, giant hamburgers, swirly tornadoes of pink hearts and
so on _ that will wreak havoc on their opponent's Enthusiasm Gauge.
</P>
<P>
   If it looks as if you're going to lose, you can unleash one of
these weapons. But you have to do it on the fourth beat. And it's
possible to dodge these groove-destroying projectiles. But you have
to dodge on the fourth beat. Everything happens on the fourth beat.
And there's a disco ball. And flashing colored lights under the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Like any fighting game, Bust-a-Groove pits you against
outlandishly dressed adversaries. If you beat them all, you face a
giant monster in the pyrotechnic showdown. In this case, the big
boss is a 50-foot robot re-enacting Madonna's ``Vogue'' video atop
a Tokyo skyscraper.
</P>
<P>
   It's a very stylish robot.
</P>
<P>
   It's a very stylish game _ whoever designed these characters
obviously spent some time on the Tokyo rave scene. The pants are
right. The hats are right. The sneakers and sunglasses are right.
The characters are a multiethnic grab bag of teen-agers and
20-somethings, all wildly charismatic and telegenic, with their own
back stories and occupations: artist, street thug, office girl,
space alien, budding mad scientist.
</P>
<P>
   My personal favorite is Kitty Nakajima, age 16, star of the hit
television series ``Litterbox Warriors 5.'' After receiving her
first big paycheck, the manual informs us, ``Kitty N. bought out
the entire top floor of the tallest building in the city.'' It
adds, ``From that vantage point, she prances around in bright
lights, not minding if any adoring fans happen to catch her in
their binoculars.'' In a white cat suit, platform boots, cartoon
kitty mask and green pigtails, this character does not look like a
human being.
</P>
<P>
   But then, neither do the virtual gladiators, action heroines or
athletes who run, jump and parry their way across our computer
monitors and television screens in a thousand video games. Many of
their movements, however, were originally performed by human beings
_ martial artists, dancers and sports stars rigged with sensors and
recorded in 3-D. Digital skins are wrapped around the data. The
animation is fine-tuned, shuffled and recombined. And voila, the
virtual black belt. Or the virtual white polyester suit. Ready to
jump, fight, shoot, score. Ready to dance.
</P>
<P>
   As in a fighting game, the human movement in Bust-a-Groove makes
everything seem less mechanical and more realistic (even the
50-foot robot moves like an aerobics instructor). The difference is
what happens after you win. In a fighting game, after you win, you
get the satisfaction of seeing your opponent whimper on the ground
in a convincing way. And after you beat everyone, that's it. That's
all there is.
</P>
<P>
   In Bust-a-Groove, after you win, you see your opponent whimper
on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   And after you beat everyone, you can make your own music video.
It's a reward for winning: instead of following a routine, you are
allowed to program your own. String together the steps. Play with
camera angles.
</P>
<P>
   You can fiddle with the tempo _ in the absence of human physical
constraints or gravity, these characters can go into Keystone Cops
hyperspeed or instant-replay slow motion. If you slowed them all
the way down and put the camera behind them, you could probably
teach yourself a bunch of hip-hop dance moves. I'm sure that
somewhere in Tokyo, a bunch of eighth graders have brought this
process full circle. Playstation-a-go-go. Coming to a dance floor
near you. (Fireballs optional.)

DOWNLOADING FILMS MAY BE COMING UP TO SPEED 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think downloading software takes too long? Imagine downloading a
complete film like ``Saving Private Ryan,'' then watching it on
your 15-inch computer monitor. Most people would rather line up for
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   But some film industry observers, like Kay Shaw, of Amber
Images, and Chris Gore, publisher of Film Threat Weekly, say film
distribution over the Internet will become viable within five or so
years. One company, Brilliant Digital Entertainment, says it has
already solved the problem of distributing computer-generated 3-D
animated films over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company, an entertainment production and technology
development studio based in Los Angeles, intends to release tools
into the marketplace early this year that can be used with 3-D
Studio Max, a popular animation program, said Kevin Bermeister,
Brilliant Digital's president.
</P>
<P>
   With these tools, called B 3-D, Bermeister said, animation
developers big and small will be able to to use a novel method to
send sound and moving pictures over the Internet at much faster
speeds. He said the animation would retain much more of its orginal
look, sound and full range of motion when it was seen on viewers'
computer monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to squeeze an entire film through the usually
narrow bandwidths of the telephone lines used to gain access to the
Internet, Brilliant Digital breaks up the animated film into visual
components like wire-frame characters and backgrounds. The system
downloads them. Next, it sends not the film itself, but
instructions (along with the soundtrack) to a viewer's computer on
how to reconstruct the film, piecing it together as it is being
watched. Bermeister said the system provided as much detail as the
viewer's computer could handle.
</P>
<P>
   Bermeister said that downloading a 30-second Dancing Baby
segment, audio and video, might take some Internet users 25 to 30
minutes, depending on the connection, but that Brilliant Digital's
method would trim that wait to one or two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that as more people discovered how easy it was to
make and send computer-generated movies, the wired world would
never be the same. ``People will create their own 3-D animations,
mini-movies, art forms, their own characters,'' Bermeister said.
``They will publish them to the Net, changing its whole shape and
form.''
</P>
<P>
   Brilliant Digital is distributing on the Internet its own short
serialized movies, generated by computer, which it calls
``webisodes.'' For $8.95 a quarter, viewers can subscribe to the
weekly interactive 3-D films at the www.multipathmovies.com site.
(Trial episodes, including versions of ``Xena, the Warrior
Princess'' and ``Ace Ventura, Pet Detective,'' can be downloaded
free.

   ``We see a lot of resistant pneumococcal pneumonia, for example.
It used to be you could just open a vial of penicillin in the same
room with pneumococcus and the patient would get better. We had a
standard regimen for treating pneumonia with penicillin, and it
worked every time. It would be considered negligent to treat you
like that if you came in with pneumonia today,'' Canady said.
``There's a one in five chance it wouldn't be effective.''
</P>
<P>
   PEOPLE EXPECT ANTIBIOTICS
</P>
<P>
   One component of the antibiotic overuse, Canady said, is that
the public's perception of the drugs is often inaccurate. A new
survey, conducted by the American Society of Health Systems
Pharmacists, which includes more than 30,000 pharmacists who work
in institutional health-care settings, shows that consumers lack a
consistent understanding of how and when to use antibiotics:
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the adults between ages 18 and 34 who were polled
said they had not finished an antibiotic prescription before it was
completed because their symptoms went away.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine percent said they have saved leftover antibiotics
and taken them at a later time.
</P>
<P>
   One in 10 reported they have shared antibiotic prescriptions
with someone else.
</P>
<P>
   More than half (57 percent) said they believe that antibiotics
are the best medicine for viral infections caused.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are consequences to not taking antibiotics properly, and
our research shows that many consumers aren't aware of them,''
Canady said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because someone on antibiotics begins to feel better does
not mean that his or her body has completely fought off the
infection. When consumers stop taking their antibiotics before the
prescription is completed or save their antibiotics and use them at
another time, they are allowing bacterial strains to grow stronger
and more resistant to the drugs that are supposed to fight them,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Canady said, ``absolutely'' patients expect their doctors
to prescribe antibiotics whenever they have any type of infection,
sore throat or bad cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to a physician with a problem, you leave with a
piece of paper. If you don't, you think you are not getting good
care or the doctor just doesn't realize how sick you are. The
expectation is that treatment equals good care; advice doesn't
count,'' Canady said.
</P>
<P>
   JUST SAY NO
</P>
<P>
   To stop the antibiotic fever that has hit our country, Mary Ann
Block said, doctors, patients and, in the case of children, parents
must work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors have to say no to patients and parents who demand
antibiotics when they are inappropriate,'' she said. ``We have to
educate patients as well. Ninety percent of ear infections will
heal on their own. Patients need to know that if they develop
serious pneumonia, there may not be an antibiotic available that
will work for them when they need it to save their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bodies are incredibly good at healing themselves, and we
are not giving them that opportunity,'' Block said.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to help our kids short term, she said, is hurting their
immune systems in the long term. The antibiotics do the job our
immune systems should be taught to do.
</P>
<P>
   As for Olivia Booth, her mother said she hasn't had an ear
infection since she let her suffer through that last one, with the
help of Block's manipulation therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Olivia did have strep throat a few months ago, and Block
prescribed an antibiotic after a throat culture identified it as
strep.
</P>
<P>
   The drug treatment cured the strep without causing any allergic
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she just had too many different antibiotics in her
little body for a while there,'' Linnea Booth said. ``Her body was
rebelling against them.''

   Her pediatrician recommended ear tubes, which helped for a while
_ until the left one fell out in January 1998, when Olivia was not
yet 2. Otitis media, the most common disease of early childhood,
returned with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Olivia is not alone. Ear infection is the most common disease of
early childhood, affecting an estimated 24 million American
children each year.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all those kids are prescribed antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of a nationwide love of antibiotics that some medical
experts say is getting out of hand. Last year, according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 18 million
prescriptions were written for antibiotics to combat nonspecific
respiratory infections, most prescribed to meet public demand
during the cold and flu season.
</P>
<P>
   The misuse of antibiotics and the associated increase in
drug-resistant bacteria has been debated in medical journals for 10
years, but the answer has always been to develop newer, more
powerful antibiotics. Now, some doctors are looking for
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Those leading the anti-antibiotic charge say that the drugs are
overused and misused and, more important, are to blame for the
development of ``superbugs,'' strains of bacteria that are
resistant to the most potent antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   When Olivia's ear infections came back, antibiotics caused an
additional complication. The little girl, who weighed just 19
pounds, broke out in hives. She had welts the size of dollar bills
on her back and chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did Ceclor, Biaxin, Augmentin, Zithromax, you name it,''
said her mother, Linnea Booth. ``One infection lasted six or seven
weeks because we had to keep taking her off the different
antibiotics. We would stop everything for a week and then try
another. We also were giving her a steroid for the hives. I was
watching her every second, because I was afraid the allergic
reaction would cause her throat to swell shut and she wouldn't be
able to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Booth sought out Mary Ann Block, a Tarrant County
osteopathic physician and author of ``No More Amoxicillin,'' a book
on preventing and treating children's ear and respiratory
infections without antibiotics. Block recommends avoiding
antibiotics for all but the most serious life-threatening
infections to prime the body's own immune system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so afraid of being sick that we are literally killing
ourselves with the overuse and misuse of antibiotics,'' Block said.
</P>
<P>
   To treat Olivia, Block temporarily removed any allergy-provoking
foods, including dairy foods, which she said may weaken the immune
system. She began giving Olivia very gentle osteopathic
manipulation (much like massage) to help drain her ears and sinuses
and clear the lymph system to boost natural immunity.
</P>
<P>
   She taught Olivia's mother manipulative techniques to do at home
and emphasized that her daughter needed to be sick long enough to
develop natural antibodies that would help to protect against
future infections.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to wait and watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning you think, `If I don't get my child on
antibiotics, it's going to end up hurting her hearing for life.'
It's really scary,'' Booth said.
</P>
<P>
   A CALL FOR ALTERNATIVES
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Canady, president of the the American Society of
Health-System Pharmacists and a doctor of pharmacy, is one expert
who has joined recently appointed Surgeon General David Satcher in
the call to stop prescribing so many antibiotics so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started overusing antibiotics as soon as they became
available,'' said Canady, who is also a clinical professor of
pharmacy and medicine at the University of North Carolina..
</P>
<P>
   ``We started using them for everything we thought they could
possibly make better.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent report in the ``Journal of the American Medical
Association'' estimates that 90 percent of upper respiratory
infections, including colds and bronchitis, are caused by viruses,
and that the antibiotics prescribed for them are almost always
useless.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in this
country are contributing to the increasing death rate from
infections, the third-leading cause of death. According to Satcher,
the U.S. death rate from infectious disease, excluding HIV//AIDS,
rose by 22 percent between 1980 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional response in the medical community has been
relatively simple almost since the time penicillin first came on
the market nearly 60 years ago: If an antibotic doesn't work
anymore for a patient, develop a stronger one. Canady said that at
some point, the upward spiral must stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly there is hope that we can keep developing stronger
and stronger antibiotics, but if we ever hit the wall with this
thing, we will be in trouble,'' Canady said by telephone from Las
Vegas, where the society held its annual meeting last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the science gets better, it enhances our ability to fight
infections, but we are always just one drug ahead of an epidemic as
we develop resistance problems,'' Canady said. ``We are always just
a step away from disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The misuse of antibiotics is troublesome to health-system
pharmacists, who practice in hospitals, nursing homes and other
organized health-care settings where dangerous infections are
rising because of resistant bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a problem for us for a long time. We have the
sickest people, with the worst bugs, and most of them have already
been fighting those bugs with all kinds of drugs for a long time,''
Canady said. MORE &QL;

A JAPANESE VERSION OF `GEISHA'? WELL, IT MAY SOUND EASY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY SHERYL WUDUNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ It seems the Great Japanese Novel: the tale of a poor
fisherman's daughter who parlays a pair of beautiful gray eyes into
a career as one of Japan's most bewitching geisha, setting a record
price when her virginity is auctioned.
</P>
<P>
   But the story actually was written in English by an American
man, Arthur Golden, and published in 1997 as ``Memoirs of a
Geisha'' (Alfred A. Knopf). The novel, which has spent 58 weeks on
the New York Times best-seller list and appeared in 26 foreign
languages, is finally being prepared for publication in Japan this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that turning the Great Japanese Novel into
Japanese turns out to be a good deal more difficult than anyone
expected, and the Japanese are likely to be among the last people
who get to read it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of problems, a lot of difficulties with
this novel,'' said Yoshiki Nishiyama, the translation editor at
Bungei Shunju Ltd., the Japanese publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Colloquial English has to be rendered in various Japanese
dialects. Japanese-sounding American expressions have to be turned
into proper Japanese idioms. The elderly voice of the geisha,
Sayuri, has to be distinct from the youthful one, and the
characters in the fishing village of her childhood need to speak
the right local dialect.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties with dialects, and especially of accurately
portraying the refined, scarcely known Japanese used by top geisha,
led four translators to reject the job after they read the novel.
But there was a push for a speedy translation from Japanese
involved in the production of a film version of the book, to be
directed by Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   It now seems that the book will not come out in Japanese until
late this year. Moreover, the film has been delayed, lifting some
of the pressure for the Japanese translation.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Nishiyama turned to Takayoshi Ogawa, a scholarly
expert in American literature, to transform the novel into
Japanese. Ogawa, an English professor, embarked on it soon
afterward _ between classes three days a week and other translation
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me,'' said Ogawa.
``I knew it would be difficult, but I also knew it would give me
lots of pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Ogawa and Nishiyama acknowledge that they were a bit at sea in
working on the novel, for neither had ever met a true geisha.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most of us, geisha are not a part of our lives,'' said
Ogawa, in his thoughtful, deliberate English. ``The geisha life,
the geisha tradition _ Arthur Golden knows those things, and I
don't. I thought it would be hard to translate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ogawa realized that he did not know enough about geisha to
render the novel into credible Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition of geisha _ refined and artistic entertainers who
dance, play musical instruments, exude charm, and sometimes share
their bodies _ has lasted for more than two centuries, and their
liaisons with Japanese samurai and politicians are legendary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese, they must view this with some puzzlement,'' said
Golden, in a phone interview from Boston. ``They must think it a
strange thing that an American man has written this book.''
</P>
<P>
   To complicate the translation, Golden's story is not just about
any geisha. It is about the geisha of Gion, in the ancient capital
of Kyoto. Gion has fewer than 100 geisha these days, a tiny
fraction of its number a few decades ago, and it is still famed for
its tea houses, its narrow streets and its role in Japanese
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gion is a very special place for the Japanese,'' said
Nishiyama. ``It's a very private area. The language is very
special.''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Ogawa had to learn the geisha expressions of Gion.
Having the geisha speak in more ordinary Japanese would have seemed
out of place to a Japanese reader, Ogawa said.
</P>
<P>
   Golden uses the term ``debut'' for the time a young apprentice
makes her first appearance as a geisha and becomes a member of that
world. After a bit of digging, Ogawa discovered the appropriate
Japanese term, ``misedashi,'' which is not generally used outside
of Gion. Similarly, there is a special Gion term, ``o-hirome,'' for
making a new geisha known in certain circles.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ogawa has built a database of Gion phrases, culled from
books, articles and other resources, which he stores in his
computer. And there are many other phrases in the book that demand
deliberation.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the story, the mistress of the house where
Sayuri lives in Gion scolds a maid, saying ``You'll have no dried
fish for six weeks.'' To Ogawa, ``six weeks,'' sounded too precise,
too business-like and not very Japanese. So he plans to change it
to ``a month.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It never occurred to me that someone would be translating it
into Japanese,'' said Golden. ``I'd probably have been a lot more
self-conscious than I already was.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ogawa needed a contact close to Gion. It took a great deal of
wriggling for the translators to work their way into a geisha
circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to use every connection we could,'' said Nishiyama. And
luck helped.
</P>
<P>
   Nishiyama asked a friend in the personnel department of his
company to comb the company for any ties to Gion. Exasperated, he
happened to voice his frustration to a receptionist, who happened
to have a friend in the sales department who just might know
someone in Gion. He did, and they found one connection.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a former geisha contacted Nishiyama as a candidate
for the translation job. Nishiyama couldn't offer her the job, but
signed her on as a key consultant, another connection to Gion.
Then, Nishiyama turned to friends of Golden's, and they put him in
touch with a Gion-born fashion designer who introduced him to a
third woman, a former geisha.
</P>
<P>
   With these three ties, Nishiyama and Ogawa made their first
pilgrimage to Gion to see the world that Ogawa was rendering into
Japanese. It was September, and Ogawa was more than halfway through
his translation.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ogawa expects to finish the translation by March, the
book, which will probably be called ``Sayuri'' in Japanese, is not
scheduled for publication until September. But Nishiyama argues
that quality is more important than speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a Japanese reader finds a strange expression in the
translation, the story would lose the power of reality,'' said
Nishiyama. ``It would lose the power of the fiction itself.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tuesday was a busy day at the Banco Popular on 116th
Street in East Harlem, but Joyce Lynes wasn't lining up for the
teller or an ATM. She was in a throng surrounding a table arrayed
with fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, a circuit breaker and
coloring books with a fire-safety theme.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of fires that have killed 20 people since early
December in New York City, the Fire Department was out in force,
trying to seize the moment to teach a few lessons about fire
prevention as part of a citywide program. In English or in Spanish,
neighborhood residents voiced their concerns. How could they sort
through the fog of myths and misinformation about what to do if a
fire broke out?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the first thing I'd do,'' said Ms. Lynes, a transit
worker, recalling a fire she experienced as a child more than 30
years ago. ``When my brother yelled that there was a fire upstairs,
we all ran out of the room, and the ceiling collapsed onto the
floor behind us. A kid was trapped and jumped out the window, and
his brother caught him. Then his aunt came running out with her
hair on fire.'' Ever since, Ms. Lynes has slept near a working
smoke detector. Now, she said firmly, ``I'd take my family and
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Gladys Bennette, the community coordinator for the Fire
Department's education unit, asked her, ``Do you live in building
with a fire escape?'' If so, getting out of the building would be
the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Ms. Lynes lives in a six-story city-owned
building that meets the city's standards for fireproof construction
_ it is built with materials that will contain a fire to one
dwelling unit. As long as the fire was not in her own apartment,
she would probably be just as safe closing the metal apartment door
and staying put until firefighters arrived.
</P>
<P>
   It was a reminder that in a city with more than 800,000 dwelling
units in multiple-residence buildings, there appear to be at least
800,000 ways to plan for a fire emergency. While some people may
remember their single-file march during a school fire drill, many
are now realizing that they are ill prepared to choose among a
bewildering range of strategies, some of them more suitable for a
brownstone than a high-rise, better for city housing than a walk-up
with a fire escape.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Brian Dixon, a department spokesman, urged New Yorkers to
tailor their safety plans to their buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't make generalizations,'' he said. ``New York has so
many different varieties of buildings. You need to know what kind
of building you're in, first, and that will determine what you
should do next.''
</P>
<P>
   Management companies are not required to inform tenants about
fire-safety preparations, but several new approaches are being
explored. Starting soon, a pamphlet for high-rise dwellers prepared
by the Real Estate Board of New York, an industry group, and the
Fire Department will be distributed regularly to managers and
agents for buildings where 300,000 people live.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't ignore it the way 95 percent of us ignore the safety
cards in airplanes,'' said Steven Spinola, president of the real
estate board. He said the pamphlet will be distributed at least
twice a year and will be posted throughout buildings and included
in new leases and renewal packages. The possibility of asking
tenants to acknowledge receipt of the pamphlet, as they are now
asked to complete window-guard questionnaires, has also been
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets complicated when you ask people to start signing,''
Spinola said. ``Some tenants are reluctant to sign anything. They
think they're giving up their right to sue.''
</P>
<P>
   Some management companies are renewing fire-safety efforts on
their own. ``We'll make arrangements for the Fire Department to
give a talk to any assembled group of people or board members on
request,'' said Eric Kornfeld, executive vice president of Heron
Management, which operates more than 80 residential buildings in
New York. ``I've set up three in just the last two weeks. But quite
truthfully, we only do it when a board expresses interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Kirschenbaum, the general counsel for Insignia Corp.,
which manages more than 320 residential buildings, said that
distributing the high-rise safety pamphlet ``is on our agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't tell people to wait for O.J. Simpson to rush up the
stairs,'' he said, alluding to a rescue in ``The Towering
Inferno,'' the 1974 film.
</P>
<P>
   The portrayal of fires in disaster films like ``Inferno'' and
``Backdraft'' actually hinders the Fire Department, Dixon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People die from smoke inhalation,'' he said. ``Hollywood can't
show smoke. It's too dark. In the movies they always show fire.
It's more dramatic. But flames are not really the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Disaster films ``make people think they can go up to the roof
and a helicopter will pick them up,'' he added. ``That's not going
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The best approach, he said, is to remember a mantra: ``Have a
smoke detector. Have a plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents can start by asking whether their building has
fireproof construction. Michael Carter, vice president of the
Uniformed Firefighters Association, noted that most high-rises have
such construction, as do city housing projects. He offered a tip:
if there's a fire stair with self-closing metal doors, the building
typically meets the ``fireproof'' standard; if there's a second way
out, like a fire escape, it probably doesn't. If the building
manager or superintendent can't tell you what kind of building it
is, he said, the certificate of occupancy will.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Here are some basic precautions suggested by fire safety
professionals for all types of housing:
</P>
<P>
   _ Develop a drill with an escape plan and practice it often
enough to make it a ritual. Agree on a rendezvous point outside the
building, so everyone can be accounted for easily. ``You'll be more
logical even if you panic,'' Dixon said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Place smoke detectors within 15 feet of sleeping areas, but
not in or near kitchens or bathrooms. (A detector with a
three-minute delay outside the kitchen will give you time to fan
off the smoke from the roast.) Since 1989, the city building code
has required that new buildings with three or more dwelling units
provide smoke detectors that are wired into the electrical system.
Change batteries in detectors at least annually.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 12- to 18-inch-tall fire extinguisher marked ``ABC'' (for
multipurpose) should be kept in the kitchen, but it should be used
only on small grease, electrical or wastepaper fires. ``Don't use
it to delay calling 911,'' said Dixon, adding that it's important
to place yourself between the fire and the door. ``Don't put
yourself in a corner without a way to back out,'' he said. ``You'd
be better advised to get everyone out.'' Baking soda is effective
in dousing small grease fires. If furniture catches fire, leave
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   _ Call 911 as soon as you safely can.
</P>
<P>
   _ Close the door behind you as you leave a room or an apartment.
``People have been propping doors open as they leave their
apartments,'' said Carter of the firefighters' association. ``It's
a psychological thing. They can't bring themselves to close the
door in case others might need to escape after them.'' He also
suggested closing doors to children's bedrooms every night.
</P>
<P>
   If your building doesn't meet the ``fireproof'' standard, here
are some safety strategies:
</P>
<P>
   _ Exit immediately if fire breaks out. Feel the front door to
see if it's hot, and check the staircase outside.
</P>
<P>
   _ If there is smoke, go to the fire escape. If you see smoke
there, or it's hot, don't use it; try to get to a fire escape in
another apartment. Know your building and all the ways out of it,
Dixon advised.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some brownstones don't have fire escapes. It may be possible
to use a window as an emergency exit. Get advice on an escape plan
from the neighborhood fire station.
</P>
<P>
   If you live in a ``fireproof'' building, experts say you should
do the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ If a fire occurs in your apartment, leave immediately, closing
the door as you go.
</P>
<P>
   _ If the fire is elsewhere in the building, resist the urge to
flee down the stairwell. Be aware, too, that smoke rises, so going
upstairs can be dangerous. Stay put. As Dixon put it: ``I know it
sounds counterintuitive _ `Stay in place! Your building is burning
down.' But we'll get to you. In most instances, you're safer in
your apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon said that in the Upper West Side fire that killed four

   Will a firetruck ladder reach a 10th-floor apartment? (No. It
will go only about eight stories.)
</P>
<P>
   If there's smoke in the hall and the apartment has a balcony,
should I go out there? (Only if the sound of a firefighter knocking
on your door can be heard from there. And don't lock yourself out.
If smoke is rising from below, don't stay out there.)

 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In more than a dozen years as president and chief
executive of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, William H. Luers never
really spoke out about the nation's biggest art museum or his
tenure there. That was the deal he cut with the museum's director,
Philippe de Montebello.
</P>
<P>
   De Montebello, though technically his subordinate, rules over
the Met's art, and has always aspired to hold both jobs one day, as
most museum directors do. ``We agreed it was essential that he be
the voice of the museum,'' Luers said.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 31, Luers, a tall, tweedy former career diplomat, will
be handing over the chief executive's post to de Montebello. On a
recent day, sitting at the big round table in his office, he
offered his thoughts as he prepared to depart for his new job as
chairman and president of the U.N. Association of the U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging interview, Luers took credit for
professionalizing the Met's staff and for being _ if not the public
``voice'' _ at least ``Mr. Outside'' to city and state
administrators. He predicted that the museum would grow in
importance if it tapped into new media like the Internet. And he
recalled his fondest moment as the day that Met officials, courting
Walter H. Annenberg, showed him a model of the galleries they had
designed in hopes of gaining his huge trove of Impressionist
paintings. By the look in Annenberg's eyes, Luers knew the museum
had clinched his bequest of the works.
</P>
<P>
   Luers said that the Met was bursting at its seams and working
hard to expand bathrooms and other amenities for crowds that often
reach 30,000 to 40,000 on Saturdays and Sundays. ``Whether there's
an outside limit that says on a Sunday you can take only 50,000, I
don't know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the diplomat, Luers said his sharing of power with de
Montebello, however strained their relationship sometimes was,
served its purpose. ``I think it worked because the trustees wanted
it to work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Luers had only a mild warning for de Montebello, who is assuming
the chief executive's post as well as remaining director, a job he
has held for 21 years. ``There are a lot of very complicated
management issues,'' Luers said. ``And he has 18 curatorial
departments. It just places a tremendous strain on the director.
But I think he will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting his best spin on their relationship, Luers said,
``Inevitably, we had moments of disagreement because of our
positions.'' He declined to discuss specifics but characterized
them as things like the pace of upgrading administrative systems
and computerization.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we worked it out, and I think he's comfortable with the
pace now and he's behind it,'' Luers said. ``There have also been
some disagreements about individual people who would be hired. But
these were momentary differences.''
</P>
<P>
   On some occasions, he said, when the two disagreed, they relied
on other executives at the museum.``When they saw us talk about an
issue, they made sure we faced issues together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   De Montebello, noting that ``identical twins and married couples
have moments of disagreement, too,'' also played down their
differences. ``We have become a very large museum with a big
budget, and he has put a structure in place and a staff and an
overall administrative complex that runs very smoothly,'' de
Montebello said.
</P>
<P>
   The Met has a $116.5 million annual budget and 1,800 full-time
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Luers had agreed to retire when he turned 70 this year, on May
15. He accelerated his departure after he was asked to lead the
U.N. Association, which does research and organizes chapters of
U.N. supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Museum trustees and other Met-watchers agree with Luers'
assessment of his contributions and add another: his nonstop
entertaining of donors, potential donors, well-placed politicians
and other powers that might be able to help the Met. Much of that
took place at the Met-owned apartment he occupies with his wife,
Wendy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's indefatigable,'' said Carl Spielvogel, a trustee. ``I
don't know many people willing to be out at breakfast, lunch and
dinner seven days a week, but he was. And he was very good at it.''
</P>
<P>
   No one expects de Montebello, who is far less outgoing, to pick
up that particular mantle (although Spielvogel, who used to head
the museum's business committee, said, ``Philippe said to me at one
point, `Carl, any place you want me to go to raise money, I will
go.' ''). Rather, many Met social activities are likely to revert
to its development office, headed by Emily K. Rafferty.
</P>
<P>
   The Met is now returning to a management structure employed by
most museums. ``The flaw in splitting the job is that nothing is
clearly an artistic decision _ it's always a combination of
artistic and economic issues,'' said Richard E. Oldenburg, a former
Museum of Modern Art director who is now chairman of Sotheby's
North America.
</P>
<P>
   In leaving, Luers will have to give up that fancy apartment, but
he said he would most miss working at the Met and being able to
roam the galleries when they are closed to the public. ``There's
nothing like this place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Luers said he had come to the job with a longstanding love
particularly of the Old Masters and 19th-century European art. He
leaves with broader taste, especially a new appreciation for
ancient art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every exhibition here opened my eyes to ancient
civilizations,'' he said. ``There are common fundamental ideas, and
the one thing I've thought of is that I would create a curator of
the whole, a department of curators who would spend their time
relating the collections to each other. It is fascinating to me how
much we can learn from juxtapositions of the way different
civilizations have dealt with the same subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Met will hold a dinner honoring Luers, along
with Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the museum's outgoing board chairman
and the chairman emeritus of The New York Times Company; James R.
Houghton, the incoming chairman, and David E. McKinney, a former
IBM executive who is becoming the chief operating officer, with the
title of president, reporting to de Montebello.
</P>
<P>
   In his new position at the U.N. organization beginning on Feb.
1, Luers returns to his first love, international affairs. It seems
revealing that in a recent speech at Hamilton College, his alma
mater, he cited as the highlights of his Met career the visits of
Vaclav Havel, Andrei K. Sakharov and the emperor and empress of
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Showing a trace of emotion in his voice and invoking a custom of
the Foreign Service, Luers said he would return to the Met often to
see its displays, but not to attend its parties. ``You don't
return,'' he said.

TEPPANYAKI CUTS ITS WAY INTO AMERICAN COOKING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MICHAEL LOPEZ  
 &HT;     c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The hibachi before chef Johnny Chen is not merely
a cooking surface; it is Chen's searing playground.
</P>
<P>
   There, he builds Mount Fuji from a funnel of onion rings that
billow flame and smoke; he flips shrimp tails in the air, teasing,
``this one's for you, this one's for me,'' as one tail lands
directly under the nose of the patron, while the other flies into
his shirt pocket. He sets his fingertips on fire for a little
candlelight.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, a chef at Miyako Japanese Steak House in Albany, N.Y., is
demonstrating the cooking style of teppanyaki, or the Japanese
steakhouse, that is a fairly recent culinary tradition of Japan
and, now, the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Teppanyaki restaurants got their start in Japan some 30 years
ago. At first, the cooking was a rather staid grilling style, said
Audrey Yamaguchi, who helps her husband, Toshi, owner of Miyako.
The cooking style, she said, gradually became more entertaining,
with the now-famous flourish of knives and speed.
</P>
<P>
   The chain restaurant, Benihana, introduced Americans to the
grill-side cooking show when founder Rocky Aoki opened the first
Benihana in New York City in 1964. The chain has since grown to 60
restaurants, including 12 licensed franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Aoki, according to Benihana's corporate headquarters, borrowed
teppanyaki-style cooking from his father, Yunosuke, who cooked on
steel grills in his Tokyo restaurants. Teppanyaki evolved from one
of Japan's oldest cooking practices, yakimono, or searing.
</P>
<P>
   The cooking in Japan does not quite reach the feverish crescendo
that it does in the United States. ``Over here, it's more
entertaining than the shows in Japan,'' Audrey Yamaguchi said.
``The American people come here to relax, and to laugh. They make
more fun than in Japan. In Japan, it's still more closed, and more
quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   When Chen wheels out a cart loaded with cut lemons, slices of
raw beef, chicken and vegetables, and bottles of oils and sauces,
you know he means business.
</P>
<P>
   Chen has been a chef for more than five years, but has been
honing the craft for 15 years. ``He's quite expedient,'' Yamaguchi
says with some understatement.
</P>
<P>
   He twirls a two-pronged fork and spatula like a Western
gunslinger. Once he sets a rapid fire, with a whoosh, Chen quickly
slices and dices a tender, flavorful combination of mushrooms,
carrots, onion, the shrimp and the meats. Though this burst of
flavors, enhanced by ginger and mustard dipping sauces, is what
really counts, you'll also experience the cathartic laugh of
watching Chen goofily discover a seasoning shaker that he's thrown
up in the air and caught in the red chef's hat atop his head.
</P>
<P>
   There is no step-by-step method behind teppanyaki. Chefs and
restaurateurs describe a tricky process. The grill temperature must
be exact, because the food sticks if the surface is too hot.
Conversely, food becomes a watery goo at low temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Yamaguchi, of Miyako, is trying to learn hibachi cooking
by practicing the crisscross pattern of cutting in a frying pan
when preparing family meals. While all the rapid slicing makes for
high entertainment, she points out that speed actually is a
necessary element to teppanyaki. Overcooking can happen all too
easily.
</P>
<P>
   And in Japanese cooking, something as simple as an imperfect cut
can spoil the texture of the meat. (Such precise carving is
especially essential when presenting sushi and sashimi).

`PJS' DRAWS ANGER FROM BLACK ACTIVISTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; ``The PJs,'' a prime-time cartoon series that
will debut on the Fox network at 8:30 p.m. Sunday, has drawn the
ire of African-American activists.
</P>
<P>
   Najee Ali, the head of Project Islamic H.O.P.E., a religious
advocacy organization, is leading a campaign to protest the show,
created by comedian Eddie Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PJs,'' short for projects, is focused on Thurgood Stubbs
(voiced by Murphy), the superintendent of the inner-city housing
development. The show is produced by Imagine Television, Touchstone
Television and Will Vinton Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Ali says that there are no redeeming characters in ``The PJs.''
He also criticizes the show for having too many scenes of people
drinking beer out of 40-ounce bottles and using crack cocaine as a
comic device.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it is very negative and reinforces stereotypes about
the African-American community and pokes fun at residents living in
poverty,'' Ali said. ``There is nothing good about it. There should
be at least one positive character to balance it out. We're asking
that it be taken off the air if it can't be rewritten with some
kind of positive balance in the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, which has heavily promoted ``The PJs,'' issued a statement
defending the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox looks forward to `The PJs' joining its schedule and
believes the true measure of any show lies in its ability to raise
important cultural issues rather than avoid them. We respect the
opinion of each member of the Fox audience, and so we hope everyone
will judge `The PJs' for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali and other African-American community leaders will stage a
protest outside the 20th Century Fox studios at 9 a.m. Tuesday.
Later that evening, ``The PJs'' will move into its regular 8:30
p.m. time slot.

`PJS' DRAWS ANGER FROM BLACK ACTIVISTS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; ``The PJs,'' a prime-time cartoon series that
will debut on the Fox network at 8:30 p.m. Sunday, has drawn the
ire of African-American activists.
</P>
<P>
   Najee Ali, the head of Project Islamic H.O.P.E., a religious
advocacy organization, is leading a campaign to protest the show,
created by comedian Eddie Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PJs,'' short for projects, is focused on Thurgood Stubbs
(voiced by Murphy), the superintendent of the inner-city housing
development. The show is produced by Imagine Television, Touchstone
Television and Will Vinton Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Ali says that there are no redeeming characters in ``The PJs.''
He also criticizes the show for having too many scenes of people
drinking beer out of 40-ounce bottles and using crack cocaine as a
comic device.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it is very negative and reinforces stereotypes about
the African-American community and pokes fun at residents living in
poverty,'' Ali said. ``There is nothing good about it. There should
be at least one positive character to balance it out. We're asking
that it be taken off the air if it can't be rewritten with some
kind of positive balance in the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, which has heavily promoted ``The PJs,'' issued a statement
defending the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox looks forward to `The PJs' joining its schedule and
believes the true measure of any show lies in its ability to raise
important cultural issues rather than avoid them. We respect the
opinion of each member of the Fox audience, and so we hope everyone
will judge `The PJs' for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali and other African-American community leaders will stage a
protest outside the 20th Century Fox studios at 9 a.m. Tuesday.
Later that evening, ``The PJs'' will move into its regular 8:30
p.m. time slot.
</P>
<P>
   Ali, who has also led protests against movies such as ``How to
Be a Player'' and ``The Player's Club,'' said he expected more from
Murphy.

ARTS COUNCIL CHAIRMAN RESIGNS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By FELICIA R. LEE   
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earle I. Mack, an arts patron and former real estate developer
who helped restore financial aid to the arts in New York state to a
level not seen in nearly a decade, has resigned as chairman of the
New York State Council on the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, who was appointed in 1996 by Gov. George E. Pataki, said
he would remain on the board but would resign as chairman as of
next Monday to spend more time with his family.
</P>
<P>
   In his resignation letter to Pataki, Mack said that the council
had met virtually all of the goals that the governor had
envisioned. He said that before Pataki's first inauguration, the
state arts budget had been cut by 56 percent over a five-year span,
morale was low and the arts infrastructure at the council and
around the state was eroding.
</P>
<P>
   When Mack became chairman the council's budget stood at $31.6
million, after a series of cuts during the state's economic
downturn; it now stands at $46 million. The increase ``has not only
resurrected the nonprofit cultural sector in New York state,'' said
Mack's letter, dated Monday, ``but also the council as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The council distributes grants ranging from hundreds to many
thousands of dollars to more than 1,000 museums, cultural heritage
groups and performing arts companies around the state. From April
1995 through December 1998, it gave $138.5 million for 9,000 grants
to 1,300 arts organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Norma P. Munn, the chairwoman of the New York City Arts
Coalition, a citywide advocacy group, said the general consensus
among her colleagues was that Mack had served the council and the
arts world well. A deliberately low-key man, he won a reputation
for being energetic and finding common ground with upstate and city
legislators for financing and programs, despite the initial
suspicion that his appointment was a favor for financial support of
Pataki's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found Earle to be extremely hard-working,'' Ms. Munn said.
``I found him sophisticated about the political atmosphere in
Albany. One would expect him to have connections to the governor,
but he had connections to the legislators.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm devastated he's leaving,'' said Randall Bourscheidt,
president of the Alliance for the Arts, an advocacy group in New
York City. ``He understood the bottom-line need was for a
restoration of funding. In three years he's accomplished an
incredible amount.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of his political connections, Mack assumed his post
under the skeptical eye of many artists and arts organizations, who
were well aware of his role in organizing a major fund-raiser for
and making a $25,000 contribution to Pataki's 1994 campaign and top
contributions to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's 1993 campaign.
Although he served on the board of the City Ballet and Dance
Theater of Harlem, Mack was better known as a senior partner of a
family-controlled real estate and investment business, Mack Co. of
Rochelle Park, N.J., and for serving on the board of the state's
Racing Association.
</P>
<P>
   He became chairman of the council at a time of intense
frustration with Republican cuts to the arts at the national and
local level. He had the challenge of succeeding the immensely
popular Kitty Carlisle Hart, who served on the arts council through
five administrations.
</P>
<P>
   During Mack's tenure, though, Mrs. Hart called his budget
increase victories ``nothing short of miraculous.'' He also won
points for organizing the first state arts technology conference;
putting together three studies on the economic impact of the arts;
establishing an arts partnership program in the public school
system and helping to make available a license plate to salute and
promote the arts. The $39.50 ``State of the Arts'' plate includes a
$15 contribution to the council.

BOMB EXPLODES AT HIGH SCHOOL, INJURES 11 STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Northeast High School was expected to open
with extra security today after a bomb exploded in a locker
Tuesday, injuring 11 students and destroying three lockers.
</P>
<P>
   Six students were taken to hospitals with debris in their eyes
and ringing in their ears. One of the six may have a broken arm.
Five other students were treated at the school for bruises,
scratches and other minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the explosion, students identified a suspect for
police. Police were questioning witnesses Tuesday night but did not
have a suspect in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Police and school officials did not have a motive for the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Just before 1 p.m., the school's vice principal, James Harrison,
heard students screaming and went to the first floor. He told
police he saw sparks shooting from a locker and several students
running from it. The hallway was crowded with students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was standing 20 feet away, and I saw this girl open a
locker,'' said April Appleton, a freshman. ``She opened it and
boom! The noise hurt my ears.'' Appleton said she heard two quick
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Danyelle Judie said she heard two explosions and then
saw the locker doors pop off their hinges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The locker blew off in that girl's face,'' she said. ``Her
face looked all messed up. Smoke and stuff flew everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Tyree Thomas said she could feel vibrations from the
explosion on the third floor.
</P>
<P>
   The blast sent students running from the building, said
sophomore Roneice McHenry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know what was going to happen next, like if another
bomb was going to go off,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Students were evacuated from the school and stood outside in the
cold before moving to the warmer gym. Anxious parents stood around
the school waiting for their children, who were dismissed at 1:30
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   School board member Lance Loewenstein arrived at the school
within moments of the blast. Loewenstein said many students were
angered by the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been so proud of the kids,'' Loewenstein said.
``They are very upset. They're naming names. I don't think it will
take too much time to figure out who did it.''
</P>
<P>
   The explosion knocked a tile from the false hallway ceiling and
blew three locker doors off their hinges. The locker in the middle
of the three, which was not assigned to a student, was thought to
have housed the bomb, police and fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The remains of the bomb were sent to a lab to be analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   After everyone was evacuated, federal Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms officers took a bomb-sniffing dog through the school, but
no other devices were found.
</P>
<P>
   Loewenstein said students reported no problems at the school
this year that may have provoked the bombing. Reports of gang
activity have plagued the school and neighborhood in the past.

MAIL ABOUT OIL AND SENIOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Returning to the real world of work after December's
leisurely routine is always a frightful reality check, but it can
be made a good deal more agreeable with a little help from your
friends.
</P>
<P>
   For me, those friends are the readers whose missives were being
reserved for a holiday mailbag column that never got written. So,
in the interest of putting off honest toil for at least one more
turn, my choice is to ease into the new year by letting the readers
write today's column.
</P>
<P>
   The first draftee is a correspondent who can't understand why
falling prices cause problems for the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were building houses and the price of lumber went down, I
would make more profit because my costs were lower. So, why are the
oil companies losing money because the cost of their material is so
low? It seems that low crude oil prices would be the best thing oil
refining companies could ask for.'' Dear Wondering:
</P>
<P>
   They don't call them oil companies for nothing. If you were
building houses, chances are you wouldn't be producing your own
lumber, shingles, nails, wiring and such. Thus, theoretically at
least, you could boost your profits by pocketing the savings from
lower material costs. The integrated oil company is in a different
situation. It invests large amounts of capital to discover oil,
drill for it, transport it to refineries, process it into various
products, and market what it produces. When a global glut of crude
depresses oil prices, it becomes difficult for the oil company not
only to sustain its profits, but also generate a reasonable return
on its capital investment. This jeopardizes the stock price. Thus,
the merger of the biggies is a defensive move to reduce overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, almost every mailbag column has at least one
Social Security question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you tell me why seniors who want to work are restricted in
their earnings? ... This seems very unfair. ... Has anyone ever
challenged the government over this one?'' Dear Outraged:
</P>
<P>
   Social Security's designers conceived it as more than a pension
program. It also was a way to help younger job-seekers by
encouraging older workers to retire. One way to achieve this is to
restrict how much a beneficiary can make at a job without incurring
a benefit reduction. The restriction, incidentally, ends at age 70.
As for fairness, what's the point of government paying a pension to
somebody who chooses to continue working? It's bad enough that
retired plutocrats are allowed to get Social Security benefits
they'll never need while collecting millions in dividends, interest
and executive pensions.
</P>
<P>
   A column several months ago on Dilbertisms brought some
responses from readers wanting to share the most idiotic statements
they'd heard from the ranks of management. The most amusing
contribution was from a local automotive plant employee whose angry
boss decreed, ``We're going to continue having these meetings every
day until I find out why no work is getting done.''
</P>
<P>
   Another, which is probably apocryphal, was attributed to a
British naval officer, who posted the following ship's order:
``Daily floggings will continue until morale improves.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep them cards and letters comin', hear.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you live in the world of Jean Racine, the
17th-century French tragedian, you definitely don't want to mess
with Venus. The goddess of love is also, as one of the dramatist's
characters puts it, the ``goddess of pure remorseless cruelty.''
She's implacable and unbeatable, and she takes no prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't stop the ever-imperious Diana Rigg, in the title
role of the London production of Racine's ``Phedre'' that opened
Tuesday night for a limited run at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's
Majestic Theater, from putting up a battle royal against the deity.
She may be doomed from the start, but this Phedre goes down
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Clutching at her velvet-encased torso as if to wrest the demon
of unholy love inside her by some act of radical, self-administered
surgery; howling at the heavens in an ocean-deep voice that would
surely cow any human adversary, Ms. Rigg turns Phedre's protracted
suicide into something like an Olympic event.
</P>
<P>
   She is a woman born to command who is aghast to find that a
force beyond her control is now commanding her. As a Greek queen
unhinged by her illicit lust for her stepson, she brings to mind
someone who, having known robust health all her life, is suddenly
consumed by cancer. She cannot get over the vicious, unspeakable
betrayal of her own body. Venus has fastened onto her like a tiger,
as Ted Hughes' stark new translation puts it, and Ms. Rigg's Phedre
makes you feel the claws digging in.
</P>
<P>
   The pyrotechnics of Ms. Rigg in high dudgeon are always a
spectacle worth watching. As anyone who saw her Medea of several
seasons ago can testify, few actresses can anatomize anger with
such intelligence and precision. Unfortunately, Ms. Rigg has more
to struggle against here than the predations of Venus.
</P>
<P>
   This Almeida Theater production, directed by Jonathan Kent, Ms.
Rigg's collaborator on ``Medea'' and ``Mother Courage and Her
Children,'' is as intense and mannered as its star. But unlike Ms.
Rigg's performance, the production itself, which runs through Jan.
17 in repertory with Racine's ``Brittanicus'' (opening Friday),
seems to work from the outside in, rather than the opposite. Kent
has spoken of his wish to turn ``Phedre'' into something more than
a marmoreal museum piece, a stately study in the pathology of
passion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a rigid, solemn self-consciousness informs the evening, a
sense of pomp and posture as stylized and exaggerated as anything
the Comedie Francaise might have come up with a century ago. The
look of the show, designed by Maria Bjornson with lighting by Mark
Henderson, is breathtakingly, ponderously chic.
</P>
<P>
   The single setting, a palatial corridor presided over by a
menacingly severe statue of Venus herself, brings to mind Cocteau's
cinematic fantasies of the midcentury, exuding an aura of ominous
enchantment. It is an indication of Kent's literal-mindedness that
there is also a fountain on stage, from which the overheated
characters periodically and vainly try to cool themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The costumes, accordingly, bring to mind the era of Balenciaga
and Charles James. There are sculptured cowls and panniers on the
women's dresses, cumbersome trains and capes that swish through the
air and drag the floor, inhibiting natural movement.
</P>
<P>
   Hippolytus (Toby Stephens), the innocent object of Phedre's
ruinous lust, wears a drapey metallic pullover and pleated leather
pants that give him the look of a glitter-rock disco boy, while his
father, the king and Phedre's husband, Theseus (Julian Glover), is
clad in a bizarre red velvet breastplate that does much to
undermine regal dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, these costumes are meant to suggest the confinement
of public roles, of court personae. But clad in such a manner, who
can resist the urge to sashay and strut? As Aricia, the beautiful
dispossessed princess wronged by Theseus and loved by Hippolytus,
Joanna Roth works her voluminous off-the-shoulder cloak like a
runway model. The overall effect is both glamorous and deadly
earnest, a dangerous combination, and the periodic laughter from
the opening night audience was surely not always welcome to the
performers.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that Kent encourages his actors to assume
melodramatic poses that seem to belong to the age of Sardou, like
flattening themselves against the walls in moments of anguish, and
that are curiously at odds with the muscular leanness of Hughes'
free-verse adaptation. Stephens is the worst offender in this
respect. Though Hippolytus is routinely described as a haughty
stoic, an impenetrable man of stone, this actor wears the stricken
soul within on his metal mesh sleeve from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   There's emotional fire in Stephens' performance, but it burns
far too bright. He always appears to be on the verge of hysteria,
and when Ms. Rigg's Phedre makes her tormented confession of love
to him, the scene feels absurdly out of kilter. His tremulous
discomfort is too close to hers, and it makes more of a case for
Phedre's misreading of Hippolytus' reactions than is called for.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cast, in fact, seems to be performing at the same
fever pitch, as though trying to match the suspenseful, Gothic
tones of Jonathan Dove's music, which wouldn't be out of a place in
a remake of ``Rebecca.'' There's a pervasive sense of
hyperventilating emotion without any solid anchor of character.
</P>
<P>
   The estimable Barbara Jefford, as Phedre's nurse and confidante,
glows toxically with vicarious power lust as she counsels her
mistress to perform disastrous acts in the name of
self-preservation. Yet she seems like an abstract instrument of
Phedre's unhappy destiny; you have no sense of the history these
women have shared, of what their relationship might have been
before. David Bradley, as Hippolytus' tutor, brings a
palate-cleansing dryness to his performance, and his climactic
account of his pupil's death is beautifully rendered.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is Glover, however, who affectingly and fully registers the
damage wrought in ``Phedre.'' Theseus arrives late in the play, but
you feel you come to know this character, a blustering adventurer
who has always assumed he can bend life to his liking, in a way you
are not allowed to know anyone else, Phedre aside. His gradual
deflation from kingly arrogance into bereft humility is genuinely
heartbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   So is Ms. Rigg's portrayal of a woman who is never spared the
awareness of her degradation, who must be a conscious, condemning
witness to her every act of folly. The actress' keen, slightly
glacial intellect serves her well here, giving a stinging
credibility to a guilt induced, after all, not by illicit action
but the mere contemplation of it.
</P>
<P>
   When Sarah Bernhardt first took on the same part in the 1870s,
she was famously advised to push for the character's pain rather
than the rage. Ms. Rigg gives us both: a righteous cosmic anger and
a pathetic, human sense of suffering that continually feed off each
other.
</P>
<P>
   From her early days as the deliciously cool Emma Peel of ``The
Avengers'' to her triumphantly vengeful Medea, she has always been
the image of unfailing resourcefulness and confidence. To see her
play a character for whom those traits finally mean nothing is as
harrowing an astonishment to us as it is to Phedre herself.

   VANITY, THY NAME IS: (INSERT ISP) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Die-hard fans of the band Kiss can do more to show devotion to
their rock idols than just buy CDs. They can now join
Kissonline.net, the official Internet service provider of the band.
</P>
<P>
   The service offers unlimited Web access for $19.95 a month,
which is no great deal, but it has perks like access to
members-only content and an affinity e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL and Earthlink cater to the general populace. If you're a
Kiss fan, you want an ISP that caters to you,'' said Mike
Brandvold, Webmaster for Sony Pictures, a Sony merchandising
company that organizes content for the Kiss site and ISP.
</P>
<P>
   Kiss is on the cutting edge, but the band is not out there
alone. David Bowie, the heavy-metal band Megadeth, the Ohio Society
of Certified Public Accountants, the alumni association of the
University of South Florida and the Vanguard Group, a financial
services company, are among many organizations that have recently
sponsored private label ISPs. On the information superhighway,
these ISPs are vanity license plates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These bands and businesses do not operate the services
themselves; they contract out the technical side to one of several
providers that coordinate access to a national network of dial-up
numbers and furnish technical support.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Laser Link Communications, based in Media, Pa.,
provides all the back room and technical operations for
Megadeth.net, and Ohio-CPA.net, among several others. It is up to
the sponsors, like Megadeth, to do the marketing and provide extra
content for their official sites.
</P>
<P>
   It is now possible to establish these special services because
it is more economical and less complex to operate a national ISP.
Much as Visa and Master Card do with their affinity charge cards,
companies like Laser Link create a generic product, then let the
sponsors stamp it with their own brands. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IRISH DEBATE FORUMS ARE REINED IN BY AOL &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   America Online has decided that subscribers who favor or oppose
Irish nationalism can continue their heated disagreements in AOL's
online forums, but they're going to have to be more cordial about
it.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 11, AOL, the world's largest online provider, pulled the
plug on 23 Irish Heritage discussion forums. AOL said it had done
so because the political debates had included too many personal
attacks and ``vulgarity and profanity,'' which violated AOL's terms
of service.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, AOL reopened the discussion groups after ``cleaning
them up,'' said a spokesman, Jim Whitney. In a note to visitors to
the discussion groups, AOL stated, ``We encourage you to make this
a more amiable place where any person, regardless of faction, can
openly discuss political issues and current events.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We encourage and remind you to debate issues only and not
resort to personal attacks or member harassment,'' the note
continued.
</P>
<P>
   Some Irish nationalists who favor Irish rule for Northern
Ireland dispute AOL's account. On The Irish People Web site
(inac.org/IrishPeople/top/121998/121998aol.html), critics contend
that AOL is seeking to silence outspoken Irish nationalists to make
the service more appealing in Britain, where AOL is trying to build
membership.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney denied that AOL's actions were motivated by that. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOTEL STAFF MAY INCLUDE A &UR;  &LR; NEW `TECHNOLOGY BUTLER' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Staffs at a few Ritz-Carlton Hotels in the United States will
soon be glad to turn down your bed, fluff up your pillow and answer
your questions about configuring software.
</P>
<P>
   For that last service, the hotel chain, owned by Marriott
International, will offer the use of a ``technology butler,'' a
staff member whose sole job is to help customers with questions
about hardware, software and the Internet. The 248-room
Ritz-Carlton in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, began the pilot project in
August with great success, said Stephanie Platt, a spokeswoman for
the chain.
</P>
<P>
   She said that in Kuala Lumpur, an employee was on call from 8
a.m. to 11 p.m. to answer questions by phone or visit individual
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll help with Internet questions, fax connections, software
problems,'' said Ms. Platt, who noted that the service was free and
used primarily by business travelers. Ms. Platt said Ritz-Carlton
had preliminary plans to test the service next at three U.S.
hotels, two in California and one in Virginia. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SURF THE NET BY TELEPHONE? THAT MAY BE POSSIBLE SOON &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several high-tech companies are working on a ``telephone
browser'' that will enable users to surf the Internet by speaking
into the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a user could ask for basic information, like
sports scores or the temperature, and the software will translate
that into a data query and retrieve the information from the Net.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone browser combines voice-recognition programs from
Lucent Technologies and data-mining software from Spyglass, a
provider of software and services for making devices work with the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Yurtin, director of business development for Spyglass,
based in Naperville, Ill., said a commercial product could be
available within a year. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FORGET THE OSCARS, HERE COME THE WEBBYS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The digerati should already be picking out formal gowns and
making sure that their shoes match their mouse pads. Yes, the
International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences on Wednesday
announced nominations for the 1999 Webby Awards, the ``Oscars of
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   And the nominees are. ...
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there are far too many to mention, 110, in 22
categories, including arts, education, humor, music, politics and
law, technical achievement, and _ because it's the Web _ the weird.
Each category has five nominees. The entire list of nominees can be
found at www.webbyawards.com/best.
</P>
<P>
   For those keeping score at home, there also is an interesting
development behind the scenes. The three-year-old Webbys are the
creation of International Data Group, based in Boston, the
publisher of magazines like PC World and Computerworld. To
establish credibility for the awards, the company last year created
the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences to act as
nominators and judges.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, it is an academy, like the Motion Picture Academy,
that establishes an awards show, not an awards show that creates an
academy of voters and judges. ``In this case, it is the other way
around,'' conceded Tiffany Shlain, executive producer of the Webby
Awards.
</P>
<P>
   The awards ceremony, scheduled for March 18 in San Francisco,
seeks to mimic the prestige of the Oscars. But the Oscars may want
to copy one welcome aspect of the Webbys: winners' acceptance
speeches are limited to five words.

`DUANE'S DEPRESSED': TRADING WHEELS FOR HOPE ON A ROAD LESS
TRAVELED 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(JT) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It doesn't seem at first as if Duane Moore is depressed in Larry
McMurtry's bittersweet new novel, ``Duane's Depressed,'' a sequel
to the author's two earlier books also set in the oil-patch town of
Thalia, Texas, ``The Last Picture Show'' and ``Texasville.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's just that ``it occurred to him one day _ not in a flash,
but through a process of seepage, a kind of gas leak into his
consciousness _ that most of his memories, from first courtship to
the lip of old age, involved the cabs of pickups.'' The passage
continues, ``His long marriage to Karla, their four children, their
nine grandchildren, his booms and his busts, his friendships and
his few love affairs had somehow all happened in the few brief
periods when he hadn't been in the cab of a pickup, somewhere in
the Texas oil patch.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So ``two years into his 60s,'' Duane one day decides to park his
pickup in his carport, hide the keys on a high shelf in the kitchen
and from then on ``walk wherever he went.'' Thalia would get used
to it, he thinks. ``The county had slowly come to accept C-Span and
computers _ in a few months they could probably be brought to
accept a walker, too.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Duane's action sets off ``a hormone storm,'' as Rag, the
Moores' family cook, puts it. Karla leaps to the conclusion that
Duane wants to divorce her. The women of Thalia are gladdened, for
Duane, popular enough in town to be elected president of the school
board and vice president of the Chamber of Commerce, will now be
available to marry. And the reader braces for more of the sort of
dark-humored farce that McMurtry has proved so adept at in his
fiction, particularly the novels, like ``The Last Picture Show''
and ``Texasville,'' that have deprecated the bleak and isolated
region where the author grew up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the edge of the plot of ``Duane's Depressed,'' these
expectations are fulfilled. Duane and Karla's four rampageous
children overcome their problems with drugs and irresponsible
lovers and take their acts to more worldly stages. The nine
grandchildren begin to emerge as far-out characters on their own.
(For instance, Barbi, Dickie's 6-year-old, announces that she wants
to join the Mafia when she gets big: ``It's my favorite thing in
the whole world.'')  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Crawford, Duane's sometime buddy and rival for the love of
Jacy Farrow, the town beauty, gets gangrene of the feet from
sitting around too much in his convenience store. Jacy disappears
in the Alaskan wild while filming a beer commercial; eventually an
ice fisherman finds her bones. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the focus of the novel stays fixed on Duane, and through
typical narrative sleight of hand on McMurtry's part, the farce is
modulated into something drolly moving. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once Duane starts to walk, he keeps on walking ... away from his
home, his family and his oil business to a getaway cabin he owns
some six miles outside Thalia. There, his perspective subtly
changed, he discovers that while he wishes his family well, he has
``stepped out of the flow of ongoingness'' and doesn't miss them in
the least. In stages cast off like the layers of an onion, he
passes through boredom, anxiety, a Thoreauvian desire to simplify,
an urge to clean up the landscape, a sense that he has wasted his
life, until eventually he discovers that the competent and
attractive daughter of a storekeeper he begins to get his supplies
from is, of all unlikely things in this desolate stretch of Texas,
a psychoanalyst, Honor Carmichael M.D. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The second half of the novel is built around Duane's relations
with Dr. Carmichael. Duane is indeed depressed, but he is many
other things as well, and McMurtry continues skillfully to plumb
his psyche layer by surprising layer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A couple of slightly overloud notes result from the collision of
black farce with the more modulated comedy: a character whose
outlook hinges on his despair over having lost one testicle to
cancer; an exchange in which Karla asks a friend if she's ever
heard of male menopause, and the friend responds that she hasn't,
but she knows a lot of men who pause ``just at the wrong time,''
and a waterbed that smells of fish because, as it turns out, it is
inhabited by a catfish. And a shocking death occurs just a little
too conveniently. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But ``Duane's Depressed'' holds steady at its core. In one
typical diversion, Dr. Carmichael asks Duane to read Proust's
``Remembrance of Things Past.'' There follows a comically
sympathetic description of an intelligent but uneducated man
struggling with a book that seems to him ``an impenetrable mass of
words.'' At one point he tries to speed-read it, but ``the keyword
technique that had been so helpful when reading Time was completely
useless when applied to the book he had in his hand. The sentences
seemed to run on for pages _ often he could not even find the
verbs.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he completes the assignment and Dr. Carmichael
explains that she wanted him to read it ``because it's still the
greatest catalog of the varieties of disappointments human beings
feel.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We have come a long way from the novel's slapstick opening to
its nearly sentimental conclusion. But thanks to McMurtry's sure
touch, there isn't the least sense of disappointment.

IMPEACH (Washington) - Thursday, one of the most extraordinary
legal proceedings in American history begins. The country's most
powerful 100 men are entering unexplored waters, and there is not
telling when or in what condition they will emerge. Although there
are few recognizable landmarks, Arizona Sen. Joh Kyl tells us that
a GOP caucus he attended Wednesday morning was told to be braced
for a tough fight. For one thing, they expect Democrats to insist
on a full vote of the Senate to approve of the appearance of each
witness. The result is that the process in the Senate could be just
as raucous and partisan as it was in the House. By JEFF BARKER.
Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
IMPEACH-INTERNET (Phoenix) - As the Senate begins its first
impeachment trial in 130 years, there are powerful forces on the
right and left trying to monkeywrench the process. The right,
largely through the Internet and talk radio, is pushing a
six-year-old rumor, resurrected by a supermarket tabloid, that
President Clinton has an illegitimate son by a prostitute in
Arkansas. The editor of the ``Star'' tabloid, quoted by the
Internet's Drudge report, said the story ``could be a 13-year-old
hoax,'' but that hasn't stopped talk radio from spreading it across
the airwaves in an apparent effort to pressure GOP members of the
Senate. By MICHAEL MURPHY. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;

   BKN-NBA-SETTLE (New York) _ The NBA and the players' union
reached an agreement today to end the 6-month-old lockout and save
what's left of the season. After a secret all-night bargaining
session between commissioner David Stern and union head Billy
Hunter, the deal was struck sometime around 6 a.m. _ hours before
the league's Board of Governors was set to vote on canceling the
remainder of the season. By Mike Wise.

   IMPEACH-RDP (Washington) _ The 106th Congress convened Wednesday

   HOUSE-HASTERT (Washington) _ A man-in-the-news profile of Rep.
Dennis Hastert, the new speaker. Hastert, who was catapulted from
obscurity and drafted for the job of speaker only three weeks ago,
has earned a reputation as a ``nice guy.'' He knows how to listen,
stifles his temper and keeps his word, which is why he swiftly
received the backing of moderate Republicans and conservatives
alike. But, no matter how congenial and hard working, Hastert,
faces a daunting double-barreled challenge: He comes to the job of
speaker as one of the most untested leaders in memory, a no-name
congressman new to the battles of top tier politics, and he
confronts one of the most sharply divided, least forgiving,
Congress' in years. By Lizette Alvarez.

   STOCKS-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ Nothing but up. That's what stock
markets around the world delivered Wednesday, wowing investors with
jumps of at least 2 percent and in some markets overseas more than
3 percent one-day gains. So far, 1999 has been a banner year for
equities. The boffo performances look a lot like last year, only
better. By Gretchen Morgenson.

<P>
   CHINA-ANOMALY (Nanjie, China) _ In an age often marked by an
economic free-for-all, the village of Nanjie is a dinosaur: its
farm, its factories, its housing are all collectively owned and
managed. Residents must attend regular study sessions of Mao's
teachings, and their take-home pay does not exceed $30 a month.
Nanjie is often cited as a paragon by China's ``leftists.'' But the
very fame of this strange showcase suggests just how anomalous it
is today _ and how far those leftists have fallen. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   PAROLE-STATES (New York) _ Gov. George Pataki is proposing to
take New York down a road already followed by 16 other states in
eliminating parole and sentencing convicts to fixed prison terms.
But eliminating parole so far has not been found to have any direct
effect on crime rates, while having enough unexpected consequences
that three states _ Connecticut, Florida and Colorado _ have
reinstated it. By Fox Butterfield.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT JUDGE ENTERS HIS OWN COURT EXHIBIT
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial queues.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After having admitted thousands of e-mails,
depositions, market surveys and other documents into the Microsoft
antitrust trial, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson on
Wednesday volunteered his own piece of evidence _ one that may
signal how he will eventually rule in the historic case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Court Exhibit No. 1'' was a newspaper column about America
Online Inc. that Jackson had read over breakfast in The Washington
Post.
</P>
<P>
   In his debut column for the paper, veteran Post editor David
Ignatius quoted AOL chairman Steve Case as saying it would be
``crazy'' for him to pick a fight with Microsoft chairman Bill
Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason why Microsoft is the most valuable company on
earth,'' Case told Ignatius. ``I have a lot of respect for
Microsoft. I continue to live in fear of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Case also said in the interview: ``We have no flight of fancy
that we can dent in any way, shape or form what is a monopoly in
the operating system business. ...It's hard to imagine that
(personal computers) won't be the dominant way people connect with
the Internet for many years to come, and Microsoft has a pretty
amazing lock on that business.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, joined by 19 states as plaintiffs, has
charged that beginning in mid-1995, Microsoft sought to crush
Netscape Communications Corp., Microsoft's rival in the Internet
browser wars, by using illegal business tactics. The alleged motive
was in part because Microsoft feared the popular browser might one
day undermine its Windows operating system near-monopoly for
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Before the trial had recessed for the holidays, Jackson had
noted from the bench that the planned $4.2 billion merger between
AOL and Netscape ``might be a very significant change in the
playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft lawyer Michael Lacovara was pursuing that theme with
the government's final witness, economist Franklin Fisher of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, when the judge interceded,
calling a brief recess so the column containing Case's comments
could be distributed.
</P>
<P>
   After the trial resumed, Jackson read several paragraphs to the
witness and said: ``The question I have of you is ... is this
consistent with your understanding of what the impact of the
consortium will be, insofar as developing viable competition?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly is,'' Fisher replied.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official who has attended the trial since
its inception in October said it was ``highly unusual'' for the
judge to intervene in the middle of the case to present his own
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is a highly unusual case, added the official, Jeffrey
Blattner. ``It has some aspects of a major antitrust trial. But
it's also akin to a legislative hearings. And then, of course,
there's the daily media show outside the courthouse.''
</P>
<P>
   For the bone-chilled camera team, David Boies, the government's
lead attorney, termed the potential impact of the AOL-Netscape deal
a ``red herring.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the witness stand, Fisher conceded that the
planned merger ``will have some relevance,'' calling it ``hopeful
sign'' of renewed competition in the industry. But he added: ``It
won't have changed the fact that Microsoft took actions to reduce
the threat from Netscape's browser.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacovara told Jackson that he plans to complete his
cross-examination of Fisher on Thursday. Microsoft will then begin
its defense Monday, with the company's witnesses being
cross-examined by Boies and his team.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT JUDGE ENTERS HIS OWN COURT EXHIBIT
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial queues.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After having admitted thousands of e-mails,
depositions, market surveys and other documents into the Microsoft
antitrust trial, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson on
Wednesday volunteered his own piece of evidence _ one that may
signal how he will eventually rule in the historic case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Court Exhibit No. 1'' was a newspaper column about America
Online Inc. that Jackson had read over breakfast in The Washington
Post.
</P>
<P>
   In his debut column for the paper, veteran Post editor David
Ignatius quoted AOL chairman Steve Case as saying it would be
``crazy'' for him to pick a fight with Microsoft chairman Bill
Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason why Microsoft is the most valuable company on
earth,'' Case told Ignatius. ``I have a lot of respect for
Microsoft. I continue to live in fear of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Case also said in the interview: ``We have no flight of fancy
that we can dent in any way, shape or form what is a monopoly in
the operating system business. ...It's hard to imagine that
(personal computers) won't be the dominant way people connect with
the Internet for many years to come, and Microsoft has a pretty
amazing lock on that business.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, joined by 19 states as plaintiffs, has
charged that beginning in mid-1995, Microsoft sought to crush
Netscape Communications Corp., Microsoft's rival in the Internet
browser wars, by using illegal business tactics. The alleged motive
was in part because Microsoft feared the popular browser might one
day undermine its Windows operating system near-monopoly for
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Before the trial had recessed for the holidays, Jackson had
noted from the bench that the planned $4.2 billion merger between
AOL and Netscape ``might be a very significant change in the
playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft lawyer Michael Lacovara was pursuing that theme with
the government's final witness, economist Franklin Fisher of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, when the judge interceded,
calling a brief recess so the column containing Case's comments
could be distributed.
</P>
<P>
   After the trial resumed, Jackson read several paragraphs to the
witness and said: ``The question I have of you is ... is this
consistent with your understanding of what the impact of the
consortium will be, insofar as developing viable competition?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly is,'' Fisher replied.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official who has attended the trial since
its inception in October said it was ``highly unusual'' for the
judge to intervene in the middle of the case to present his own
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is a highly unusual case, added the official, Jeffrey
Blattner. ``It has some aspects of a major antitrust trial. But
it's also akin to a legislative hearings. And then, of course,
there's the daily media show outside the courthouse.''
</P>
<P>
   For the bone-chilled camera team, David Boies, the government's
lead attorney, termed the potential impact of the AOL-Netscape deal
a ``red herring.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the witness stand, Fisher conceded that the
planned merger ``will have some relevance,'' calling it ``hopeful
sign'' of renewed competition in the industry. But he added: ``It
won't have changed the fact that Microsoft took actions to reduce
the threat from Netscape's browser.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacovara told Jackson that he plans to complete his
cross-examination of Fisher on Thursday. Microsoft will then begin
its defense Monday, with the company's witnesses being
cross-examined by Boies and his team.

 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reader, you are to know that I am one who naturally likes
stories and loves the tactile, sensual feel of a freshly minted
book as well as anyone. I am a person whose appetite for a book is
often particularly tempted by the lush coloring and crisp lettering
of its cover. Further, that I am of a temper that is, if not
outright technophobic, certainly not that of one who is a
technophile.
</P>
<P>
   Yet notwithstanding any of this and recently settled comfortably
in a chair with a resolve to read, I reached for a book. Well, it
wasn't really a book, or at least one consisting of printed pages
bound together, but rather an electronic thing, paperless. Suddenly
I was a power reader, and there was a new theatricality to the act
of reading. A medieval baron probably felt the same way the first
time he held a Gutenberg book. For me, to my amazement, I must say,
there was this wondrous feeling of fantasy, that I was perhaps a
squire who had drawn my sword from its scabbard for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I have never experienced even an audio book, nor would I
ever read a condensed edition of a printed book. But someone had
lent me this electronic book, an e-book as it is called. This one
was the Rocket eBook, manufactured by Nuvo Media Inc., a neat
charcoal gray contrivance that in its classy stylishness reminds
one of, say, a fine automobile, although it measures only 5 by 7{
by 1{ inches and weighs 22 ounces. The device, whose reading screen
is 4{ by 3 inches) costs $499 in the Levenger catalog. With
backlighting it can run for 17 hours on batteries without being
recharged; without backlight, for 33 hours. There are at least two
other e-books out there, the Softbook(R), by Softbook Press Inc.
and the Millennium Reader by Librius Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Rocket eBook can store an average of 10 books, each 300 to
400 pages, which are available through barnesandnoble.com on the
Internet for about the price of a regular paperback book. They can
be downloaded _ a scary twilight word that I've never used and a
concept I'm not sure I'll ever master _ onto one's computer and
then onto an e-book. My e-book contained Jon Krakauer's ``Into Thin
Air'' (Villard); ``American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas
Jefferson'' by Joseph J. Ellis (Alfred A. Knopf), and the Modern
Library edition of Emily Bronte's ``Wuthering Heights.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough reading for more than one transcontinental flight; or, if
fully loaded, several weeks at the beach. I'm not a gadget wonk,
but the gizmo can do everything: mark your place, allow you to
write notes in the margin, highlight juicy paragraphs, call up a
dictionary if needed, change type sizes, add backlighting for
reading in dark rooms, and more. A lot, although I am sure true
techies will have many demands for improvement, particularly when
it comes to the ease of loading it up with literature.
</P>
<P>
   What is it like to read on such a device? It must be stated that
the screen draws one's eyeballs like a magnet, sort of bewitching
them into staring, and therefore reading, as if one's pupils were
independent of the mind. Two well-placed buttons on the book's
``spine'' scroll pages forward or backward, and a font with
comfortable-size type will produce a page displaying about 100
words; that is less than a third the number on a printed book's
page, but this can easily be adjusted to bigger and smaller type
and thus fewer or more words.
</P>
<P>
   It could be the novelty, the feeling that at last even I have at
least tiptoed into the the computer world, but I must admit,
hesitantly, that I liked the little machine.
</P>
<P>
   But it does have drawbacks, or, more precisely, annoyances. One
is not surprised or distracted by starting at the top of a ``book''
book in midsentence. In a book made from trees, there's a flow from
the bottom of the previous page or the eye can quickly return
there. In the e-book a page can start this way: ``... and shock. At
one point during my research I asked three other people to recount
an incident all four of us had witnessed high on the mountain, and
none of us could agree ...'' (from ``Into Thin Air''). Now, can
anyone reading their e-book remember what came before ``and shock''
without stopping to hit the rewind button? No. What came before
``and shock,'' for those of you who want to know, was ``badly
distorted by exhaustion, oxygen depletion ...'' Which is the way
one can feel, I assure you reader, with too much e-booking.
Besides, I could never tell how far along I was.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow Heathcliff and ``Wuthering Height's'' wickedness are
more tolerable on the printed page, I found, than on the small
screen, but nonetheless I have to ask whether I really want to lug
a bound volume of ``Wuthering Heights,'' no matter how enticing, in
my carry-on bag when I can put that book and about nine others in
my coat pocket and barely notice them?
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the comfort factor. Like all readers, I can
sit for hours with a book if its story purrs along, happily turning
the pages, sometimes deep into the night. With the e-book, after
about an hour, the very eyeballs that were seemingly hypnotized and
seduced by the gadget begin to complain. Even increasing the font
size doesn't help much, and, anyhow, the screen, though small,
looks funny with too few words on it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the e-book is not a passing thing, but here to stay as it
becomes cheaper and improved. Nonetheless, it is really no more
than a screen upon which to read, and it is clear that when enough
people start reading them, electronic books will do for the
ophthalmologists what taffy and caramels did for dentists.

SCHUMER TAKES ON MANTLE OF `SENATOR POTHOLE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Introducing New York's new ``Senator Pothole'':
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schumer, 48, hadn't even been sworn in yet Wednesday as
his state's junior Democratic senator when he was on the phone
shaking loose $500,000 in federal highway funds for Ogdensburg, a
small upstate city along the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just spoke with the Federal Highway Administration,''
Schumer beamed at a news conference shortly before he took the oath
administered by Vice President Al Gore. ``Ogdensburg is going to be
getting the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Such attention to local matters proved a successful political
formula for Schumer's predecessor, Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
who earned the nickname ``Senator Pothole'' for his commitment
during his 18 years in Congress to helping local officials tease
money from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   And Schumer said he's proud to don the mantle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I campaigned against Sen. D'Amato, one thing I never did
was demean the title Senator Pothole,'' Schumer said. ``I think
that is an important role for a senator, although certainly not the
only role.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, during his campaign last fall to unseat D'Amato,
Schumer ran a political advertisement making fun of an unnamed
lawmaker who filled potholes.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, in one of his first acts since changing addresses on
Capitol Hill, where he previously was a congressman representing
Brooklyn for 18 years, asked Kenneth Wykle, who heads Federal
Highway Administration, for federal funds to help convert the
Ogdensburg post office area into a downtown economic hub. Wykle
obliged.
</P>
<P>
   The request had come from the town's mayor. ``I'll be on the
phone to let him know the good news,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a page out of D'Amato's play book, New York's new senator
has traveled around the state since his victory to meet with local
officials and offer his help.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he was in Albany telling local leaders that he would
help them get federal funds to improve roads to the city's airport.
</P>
<P>
   He has traveled several times to Fort Drum, home of the Army's
10th Mountain Division, to reassure leaders there that he
understands the base is the economic lifeblood of the region and
should remain open.
</P>
<P>
   When upstate New York was socked in by a winter storm earlier
this week, Schumer said he was on the phone with local leaders ``to
see if Buffalo needed any help. ``I've always wanted to be two
kinds of senator at once,'' he explained, ``a senator who
legislates and a senator who is able to handle the specific
individual requests.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to working on matters with national implications
like Social Security and education, Schumer said he intends to
serve as his state's top cheerleader urging corporations interested
in relocating to consider New York.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to aid economically depressed areas, Schumer said
he will ask companies located in New York City to open branch
facilities in such places around the state where labor costs and
taxes are less burdensome.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer defeated D'Amato in November after an often acrimonious
campaign. But he praised his predecessor Wednesday, calling him
``gracious'' in seeing that Schumer had a smooth transition into
his new post. The new senator promised he would continue to work on
some projects that D'Amato had championed.

IF CHRISTO WRAPS IT, PEOPLE WILL COME 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By   CAROL VOGEL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Christo and his wife, Jeanne-Claude, waited 24 years
for the German government to allow them to wrap the Reichstag in
Berlin in more than 1 million square feet of aluminum-colored
fabric; 10 years for permission from the French authorities to
swathe the Pont Neuf in Paris in 454,178 square feet of a
champagne-colored textile that shimmered like silk; seven years to
plant a forest of giant umbrellas in the rice paddies near Tokyo
and along the open hillsides of Southern California, and 32 years
to veil 161 trees in black-and-white polyester mesh in a park in
Basel, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   If persistence pays off this year, the Bulgarian-born artist and
his wife will have spent more than 20 years on their project to
erect 11,000 steel gates in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   But don't bet on it. In 1981 the New York City Parks Department
denied Christo a permit to put up the gates, which would stand 15
feet high and be topped by free-flowing panels of woven
saffron-colored nylon stretching along 27 miles of walkway.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons for the denial cited in a 107-page report
issued by Gordon Davis, then te parks commissioner, was the crowds
``The Gates'' were expected to generate. (Officials at both the
Parks Department and the Central Park Conservancy said recently
that if the ``Wrapped Reichstag'' attracted more than 5 million
visitors, New York could expect even more people to converge on
Central Park if ``The Gates'' were installed.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christos have a wonderful racket, but we don't need them
here,'' said Henry J. Stern, the parks and recreation commissioner.
``If they want public attention, why not try wrapping Trump
Tower?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the couple remain undeterred. ``It's not patience, it's
passion,'' Christo said. ``We're not giving up. Of course there
will be traffic in Central Park, but we will have more than 2,000
people monitoring the project day and night. The park will be
cleaner and safer than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple often encounter the kinds of costs, delays and
hurdles more familiar to real estate developers than artists.
Although most of their installations are up for about two weeks,
their choice of populated sites means there are always zoning and
planning boards to be dealt with, not to mention insurance
companies. There are also the inevitable problems and politics that
come with public art projects.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, whose first collaborations were executed in 1961,
are persuasive. He was born Christo Javacheff, though he uses only
his first name (as does his wife and collaborator, who was born
Jeanne-Claude de Guillebon). He is a short, inquisitive figure with
an intense stare; many people have said he resembles Woody Allen.
She is perhaps best identified by her decisive manner and flaming
red hair, a color chosen by her husband).
</P>
<P>
   They finance their projects with the money they make selling
Christo's artwork: drawings and collages of projects as well as
early works from the 1950s and 1960s of wrapped objects. A recent
book about their umbrella project sells for $750. They say the idea
of accepting sponsorship is an anathema. ``If we had sponsors, we'd
lose our freedom,'' Jeanne-Claude said. ``We'll sell anything but
our son.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrapping the Reichstag was a $13 million project. Placing the
umbrellas in Japan and California cost $26 million. They haven't
drawn a bottom line on the cost of the ``Wrapped Trees'' in Basel,
but she estimates that it was under $1 million. The cost of ``The
Gates'' in Central Park could reach more than $30 million, but the
couple say they never know the true cost of a project until it is
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Christo and Jeanne-Claude were both born on June 13, 1935, he in
Bulgaria, she in Casablanca, Morocco. They met in Paris in 1958,
but it was only four-and-a-half years ago that they began putting
both their names on their projects. (From the beginning, she has
been the manager on every project.) Since they came to New York 34
years ago they have lived and worked out of a 200-year-old building
in SoHo that was an ammunition depot during the Civil War. ``When
we arrived here there were no other buildings around it,'' said
Christo. ``It was empty, and we rented one floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Now they own the building and use the second floor as a gallery,
the third floor for framing and shipping, the fourth floor as part
home, part office, and the top floor as Christo's studio. All day
long they communicate by walkie-talkie.
</P>
<P>
   Every project requires years of planning, nightmarish logistics
and specialists. When they wrapped the Reichstag they employed 210
construction workers, including 90 specially trained rock climbers,
as well as 17 office workers and 600 guides to answer questions and
control crowds. The umbrella project took 2,800 workers, and the
Basel installation required the services of 37 professionals,
including rock climbers and pruners, as well as 200 people to
control the traffic and crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds must be monitored, as the couple know only too well. Two
deaths resulted from ``The Umbrellas, Japan-U.S.A., 1984-91.''
During the dismantling of the umbrellas in Japan, a 51-year-old
crane operator died when the arm of the crane he was operating
touched a 65,000-volt power line. In California, high winds blew an
umbrella across a road and crushed a 33-year-old woman against a
boulder. ``These accidents were devastating for us,'' said
Jeanne-Claude.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the threat of accidents that has the Parks
Department and the Central Park Conservancy opposed to ``The
Gates.'' Officials cite environmental reasons too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Christo fan,'' said Marc Matsil, chief of the Natural
Resources Group for the New York City Parks Department. ``But in
this case Christo has gone from post-modern to post-mortem. It's
unconscionable to drive stakes and piles into one of the greatest
parks in the world. It could contribute to a slow or quick death to
some of the trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Ira M. Millstein, the chairman of the Central Park Conservancy,
said he didn't see how ``The Gates'' would add to the enjoyment of
the park. ``It's the conservancy's role to protect the park for the
benefit of the public, and that's what we're doing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple contends that no harm will be done to the trees or to
the park environment. ``We will insert sleeves that will be driven
hydraulically into the ground,'' Christo said. ``We will avoid
roots and rocks. We are very responsible people. When we take the
gates down, we will fill the holes with good soil. Nothing will
remain when the project is over and nothing will be harmed.''
</P>
<P>
   So determined are the couple to turn ``The Gates'' into a
reality that they hired the social psychologist Kenneth B. Clark to
conduct what they call a human impact study based on interviews
with 660 New Yorkers. They said it showed that the majority of the
respondents were in favor of the installation. `` `The Gates' would
be like a giant floating roof over the park,'' Jeanne-Claude said.

   Fabric is the common denominator in every project. ``For over
5,000 years, artists have been fascinated by folds and pleats and
draperies,'' Jeanne-Claude said. ``The greatest example is Rodin.''
</P>
<P>
   His first version of Balzac was of a naked figure, Jeanne-Claude
recalled. But Rodin was not satisfied with the sculpture, so he
took a cape, put it in wet plaster and draped the figure. ``By
wrapping the sculpture, he left only the essence of Balzac, which
is exactly what we did to the Reichstag and the Pont Neuf,'' she
said. ``We removed the details and left the shape and the
proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   Fabric selection can be a project in itself. The black and white
polyester mesh used for the ``Wrapped Trees'' was woven in Germany
in 156 separate patterns, since most of the 178 trees, some of
which were as tall as 85 feet, had definite silhouettes that
required specific tailoring. The 500,000 square feet of black and
white polyester mesh had to be transparent enough so that when the
sun was behind the trees every branch was visible. ``Our fabrics
are full of motion, they're not static,'' Jeanne-Claude said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple are testing different kinds of fabric for yet another
project in the planning stages: creating a six-mile wave of fabric
panels 10 to 23 feet above the Arkansas River in Colorado. Approval
of that one will require running a gantlet of 27 Federal, state and
local agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever permit they get first _ for ``The Gates'' in Central
Park or ``Over the River'' in Colorado _ will determine which
project they will concentrate on in earnest. Each has its
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has an opinion or discussion about a painting a painter
hasn't painted,'' Jeanne-Claude said. ``But everyone discusses in
advance what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's the ephemeral quality of each Christo project that
creates much of the magic, they say. ``It gives our art a
once-upon-a-time quality,'' she said, to which her husband added:
``It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience.e do something, we'll
never do it again.''

COMMENTARY: LOTT'S `BIG MISTAKE'
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Miss.) (bl) 
By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I asked Gordon Lee Baum if he felt black people were
intellectually inferior to whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal belief is that the overwhelming, almost unanimous
belief of the professionals, the academia, if you will, in the
field, say that is the case _ that there's a difference between
black and white intelligence. My personal inclination is to believe
that `The Bell Curve' is not too far off the mark.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on: ``You will have a hard time finding somebody in the
field _ I'm a lawyer, I'm not a scientist or an applied
psychologist or psychiatrist _ but you would have a difficult time
finding anybody in academia who would dispute that. Try it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baum is the chief executive officer of the Council of
Conservative Citizens, a right-wing, pro-white group that until
recently was a favorite stop of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
who is from the right-wing, pro-white state of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Now that some of the openly racist contents of the council's
publications have gotten national attention, Lott is trying to keep
his distance. It's not working. He can try to present himself as a
statesman in the impeachment proceedings, but the smell from this
dismal group is all over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Council of Conservative Citizens is the reincarnation of
the racist White Citizens Councils of the 1950s and 1960s,''
according to a report compiled by the Southern Poverty Law Center,
an organization in Alabama that monitors hate groups. The council's
main publication, Citizens Informer, offers what the law center
described as ``a steady stream of anti-black and anti-homosexual
columns.''
</P>
<P>
   The law center's report, released in December, said: ``The
Informer's subscribers are continually encouraged to study
biological determinism, eugenics and other racist views packaged as
`scientific.' Last fall, for instance, the magazine carried a
glowing review of Gerald M. Spring's `The Philosophy of the Count
de Gobineau,' a book about a French 19th Century writer on race and
biology.''
</P>
<P>
   An excerpt from the ecstatic review followed: ``His `Essay on
the Inequality of Human Races' ... advanced the thesis that each of
the three major races plays a distinct role in history. ... The
whites were the creators of civilization, the yellows its
sustainers and copyists, the blacks its destroyers. We need to know
more about this great thinker. ... The enlightenment truly began in
France.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, nothing about the council seemed to bother Lott. He
once told a gathering of its members, ``The people in this room
stand for the right principles and the right philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the majority leader experienced some discomfort recently
when stories in The Washington Post and elsewhere spotlighted the
council's repugnant views and the fact that speeches had been
delivered to the group by Lott and Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Lott claimed he had been completely in the dark about the race
stuff. Didn't know a thing. Said through a spokesman that he had
``no firsthand knowledge of the group's views.'' No awareness at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Spare me. Trent Lott is immersed from his wingtips to his
forehead in the culture of the South. He is an unabashed admirer of
Jefferson Davis and the Confederacy. He has addressed the council.
He has been photographed hobnobbing with its leaders. His
syndicated column has appeared frequently in the Citizens Informer.
</P>
<P>
   Lott is nervous about the potential reaction to his association
with the council, but in fact he is receiving very little
criticism. Black racism is a big no-no nowadays, but white racism
largely gets a pass. Imagine the outcry if a mainstream black
politician gave a rousing keynote address to the Nation of Islam,
and declared that Louis Farrakhan's philosophy and principles were
the right ones.
</P>
<P>
   What little heat Lott is taking is coming from the right.
``We're not real happy with Trent because we don't think he's
conservative enough,'' said Baum during a telephone interview
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked if he was upset that Lott was keeping his distance
from the council, Baum said no. ``He's gotta do what he's gotta do.
We're not going to badmouth him.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``Trent's probably making a big mistake. It isn't
going to help him back home, I can tell you that. It isn't going to
help him in Mississippi.''

NO-FAIL, NO-FAULT RESOLUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since we are a full seven days into the new year, it's probably
safe to say that you have broken all or most of your New Year's
resolutions. This happened, of course, because all your resolutions
involved things you didn't really want to do or stop doing.
</P>
<P>
   Stop smoking, exercise more, stop eating like a pig ... all
these resolutions require tremendous willpower and, let's face it,
if you had that kind of willpower, you wouldn't be the wheezing,
lazy, slob you are today.
</P>
<P>
   It is much better, in my wheezing, lazy, slob opinion, to make
resolutions based on what you already want or don't want to do.
These resolutions have a much higher chance of success and are a
great way to bolster your self-esteem as you chain-smoke Marlboros
while lying on the couch stuffing your face with pork rinds.
</P>
<P>
   One of the resolutions I have made for myself this year is to
stop worrying about the Asian stock market. The fact that I worried
little if any about the Asian stock market last year dramatically
improves my chances of succeeding with this resolution this year.
Also, there are plenty of people who are paid to worry about the
Asian stock market, so volunteer worriers are hardly necessary.
This eliminates any feelings of guilt you may have and allows you
to devote more of your energies to smoking and snacking.
</P>
<P>
   Another resolution I have made is to give up any hope of
understanding what a ``browser'' is. The word ``browser'' popped up
often in stories about the Microsoft antitrust case (another
subject I have resolved to stop worrying about) last year but there
was seldom, if ever, any explanation as to what a browser might be,
leaving computer illiterates such as myself to imagine little old
men killing time in the public library while waiting for the first
seating at the early bird special.
</P>
<P>
   This cannot be true, of course, because the browsers in question
are worth billions and have much better things to do with their
time than nap in a public library with a copies of National
Geographic draped over their faces. Also, it would be hard to make
the browsers of my imagination small enough to fit inside those
little computer boxes, even with the aid of semiconductors,
whatever they are.
</P>
<P>
   While it may be irresponsible to abandon any hope of
understanding browsers, given the fact that the entire U.S. economy
is somehow dependent on them, I have no qualms whatsoever in making
a resolution to stop caring when or if the NBA strike is ever
resolved. I expect to have no trouble sticking with this resolution
for two very good reasons:
</P>
<P>
   1) I have less interest in pro basketball than I have in men's
figure skating, if you can imagine such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   2) It is hard to feel sorry for the team owners or the players,
both of whom are so rich they could probably buy the Asian stock
market and have enough left over for a browser or two.
</P>
<P>
   On a more personal level, I resolve to stop making excuses about
my backyard fence. My backyard fence has been in a state of what
could most charitably be described as ``disrepair'' for several
years now and is maybe one good wind storm away from disrepairing
into individual sawdust molecules randomly connected by a few
strands of rusting wire. Visitors, of course, notice the fence
first thing and often make helpful comments such as, ``Were you
aware you have an ugly, rotten fence in your back yard?'' or
``Isn't there some sort of county ordinance intended to punish
people like you?''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, I have apologized for the fence and promised that
it is on ``my list of things to do,'' knowing full well that such a
list does not exist and even if it did exist, fence replacement
would be a low priority, somewhere between ``add a second story''
and ``manually push the house 2 inches to the northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   I could come up with many other low-pressure New Year's
resolutions, but that would violate my last resolution, which is to
make fewer and shorter lists in 1999.
</P>

DWARF GALAXIES DENSER THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT, RESEARCHERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Hawaii, Calif., Conn.) 
 (nk) 
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Compared to luminous giant galaxies like the
Milky Way, dwarf galaxies are faint and fuzzy, like celestial
ghosts. Yet they may outnumber the giants and apparently harbor far
denser concentrations of invisible dark matter, the enigmatic stuff
that constitutes nearly all the mass of the universe, astronomers
reported here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The new research, announced at a meeting of the American
Astronomical Society, shows that these small galaxies with a
scattering of bright stars have dark-matter densities about 100
times greater than the density of matter in the more imposing
galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   ``These dwarfs may look insubstantial, but they are like
cannonballs to a giant galaxy,'' said Dr. John Kormendy, an
astronomer at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   Because the high densities of the faintest dwarfs appear to be
comparable to the assumed average density of the early universe,
these objects could be remnants of the earliest time of galaxy
formation. Astronomers also said the findings could provide new
insights into how dark matter affects galaxy formation. The nature
of the elusive dark matter and its role in shaping the universe are
among the foremost mysteries in cosmology.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small fraction of the cosmic mass is composed of visible
stars, planets and other ordinary matter. At least 90 percent is
something else, most of which is presumed to be exotic subatomic
particles created in the Big Bang, the theorized origin of the
universe. The existence of this ``missing mass'' is inferred from
its gravitational effect on the shape and motions of galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   In another report at the meeting, astronomers studying the
Hubble Space Telescope's infrared images of the faint halo around
the spiral galaxy NGC 5907 found evidence of a surprising abundance
of low-mass stars. The observations support the concept that some
of the dark matter in galaxy halos could be small stars that have
gone undetected. In that case, both low-mass stars and exotic
particles may contribute to galaxy formation and structure.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Vera Rubin, an astrophysicist at the Carnegie Institution of
Washington, who pioneered dark-matter studies in the 1970s, said
the work of both research groups was impressive, but left
astronomers still groping for a solution to the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the Dark Ages about dark matter, and we're
looking for a Renaissance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kormendy and Dr. Kenneth C. Freeman of the Australian National
University and Mount Stromlo Observatory based their research on
studies of 43 galaxies ranging from large bright spirals to the
faintest dwarf galaxies known. As suggested by other recent
observations, they found that the less luminous galaxies have lower
densities of stars but higher densities of dark matter.
</P>
<P>
   The most visible part of Earth's home galaxy, the Milky Way, is
about 50 percent dark; the smallest dwarf galaxies are almost
completely dark, with no more than 1 percent of their matter in the
form of stars.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers think they have an explanation. Because smaller
galaxies have less of a firm gravitational grip on their contents,
the dispersed gases from their first stars to die in explosions may
vanish into intergalactic space, leaving the dwarf galaxy with less
gas to form new generations of stars. The explosions, on the other
hand, have little effect on exotic dark matter.
</P>
<P>
   Kormendy noted two other implications of the new research. One
is that the higher dark-matter densities indicate that the smallest
dwarf galaxies are not shreds torn from colliding large galaxies,
as had been theorized; if they were, they would probably have lower
densities than their parent galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are real galaxies, not little fragments pulled out of big
galaxies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This, in turn, means that the number of dwarf galaxies is not
somehow tied to the limited number of galaxy collisions that have
occurred in cosmic history, Kormendy said. And since these dwarf
galaxies have so few stars and are hard to see at best, many more
of them are out there beyond human vision.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin agreed. ``If something is not forbidden by physics, it
probably exists,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The research on NGC 5907's dark matter was conducted by Michael
Liu, a graduate student at the University of California at
Berkeley, working with Dr. James Graham of Berkeley, Dr. Steve Zepf
of Yale University and astronomers in England, France and the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   It was what they did not see that intrigued them. Looking into a
patch of the galaxy's dim halo, they expected to see more than 100
giant stars that would have accounted for the faint glow, but
detected only a handful. They estimated that at least 20 times more
light in the halo comes from low-mass stars too faint to be singled
out than from visible giants.
</P>
<P>
   Liu said this was ``the first direct evidence of a substantial
population of stars which is essentially all dwarf stars.'' Some of
the dark matter of a galaxy had been detected, and it is ordinary
matter, but this was not enough to hold this galaxy together. So
the search for what else there is must continue.

<P>
   Many companies are placing more responsibility in the hands of
employees by setting up electronic benefits services to handle
things like enrollment choices, address and dependent changes,
insurance claims and shifts in investment allocations. Making such
choices is no small feat, considering that some large companies let
their workers choose from among as many as 150 health maintenance
organizations. For consumers who want information that goes beyond
what a company or benefits provider may make available during open
enrollment, several Web sites are available. Here is a sample. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH PAGES: www.thehealthpages.com This is an online service,
based in New York, where you can search a database of more than
500,000 doctors, managed care plans and other health care providers
in the United States. The information is based on current data at
state health and insurance departments, federal and state health
data organizations, professional licensing boards and provider
directories. The site also lets visitors review comments from
patients about particular health-care providers. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL COMMISSION ON QUALITY ASSURANCE: www.ncqa.org This
group, in Washington, tracks quality levels at most major managed
care organizations in the United States. It began accrediting
managed care organizations in 1991; since then, it has expanded the
range of organizations it certifies. Through its Consumer Page, you
can find the accreditation status of health plans or download the
entire list. The commission also produces Accreditation Summary
Reports, which are more detailed decision-making tools for
consumers and employers. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HEALTHFINDER: www.healthfinder.gov The federal government
furnishes information on how to choose quality health care.

 &HT;    Mircosoft scores big at Macworld
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As a freshman at Harvard University in 1985, Ben
Waldman wrote software programs for the Macintosh because he liked
the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, he went to work for Microsoft Corp., long
regarded by some as the arch enemy of Apple Computer Corp.'s arch
enemy, which makes the Macintosh. But his job is to produce
Microsoft software than runs on Macintoshes.
</P>
<P>
   This week at Macworld Expo in San Francisco, the work of Waldman
and his staff won plaudits from Mac users.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Word 98 software for the Mac won the Software
Productivity Award at Macworld and the Excel spread sheet program
was runner up.
</P>
<P>
   As general manager of the 200-employee Macintosh Business Unit,
Waldman works closely with Apple and Mac users. His appearances at
with Apple's interim
</P>
<P>
   chief executive Steve Jobs at Macworld make him one of the most
</P>
<P>
   visible Microsoft executives with Mac users.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're committed to bring features first and only on the
Macintosh version of our product,'' Waldman told the audience on
Tuesday, thrusting his arms toward the crowd while walking back and
forth on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft employs one of the biggest Mac software development
team outside of Apple, according to both companies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Mac staff may seem small, but it demonstrates the
importance of having widely used software available for the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mac users have mixed emotions about Apple's alliance with
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Tom Miller, an Oakland, Calif., businessowner
whohas used Macs for 10 years, watched a Microsoft employee
demonstrate Office 98 to a large crowd at Macworld. He plans to buy
a copy of it for his small music-production company.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he won't switch to Microsoft's World Wide Web
browser, Internet Explorer, because he believes Microsoft has
treated Netscape Inc. unfairly, as the U.S. Justice Department
alleges in the antitrust trial currently underway in fedeal court
in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of bias, to be honest with you, because of
everything that has gone down with Bill Gates and the federal
case,'' Miller said. ``I would never consider using Internet
Explorer.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple's interim chief executive Steve Jobs periodically reminds
Macintosh users, as he did this week at Macworld in the Moscone
Convention Center, that Apple and
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft are partners, not foes.
</P>
<P>
   Many Mac users, who are fond of pointing out ways in which
Windows
</P>
<P>
   does not measure up to the Mac system, were shocked at the
summer 1997 Macworld in Boston when Jobs announced that Microsoft
was coming to Apple's rescue with a $150 million purchase of Apple
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs also noted that Microsoft's software support was crucial
toApple, especially since many developers gave up on the Mac
platform as Apple sank into financial trouble in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft isn't sticking with Apple out of kindness or to
show critics that it helps some of its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 10 million customers using our software on the
Macintosh,'' Waldman said
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday.

TAKING 13 HOURS TO FIX THE ERRORS MADE IN 90 MINUTES  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 10)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By MARGY ROCHLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If it's true, as the adage goes, that a second-rate novel can be
made into a good movie, then surely a second-rate movie can be made
into a good television show. Or so it would seem in the case of
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' a flatly directed horror spoof that
lived and died on the big screen in 1992 but was reborn five years
later as the critically lauded series that legitimized the
struggling WB network.
</P>
<P>
   In its second incarnation, the quirky title, the stake-flinging
blonde high school girl and her all-knowing, older mentor (the
Watcher, as he is known, sort of a guru regarding all things
creepy) remained. But everything hackneyed had been tossed aside
and craftily replaced with new ideas by Joss Whedon, the creator
and executive producer of the television ``Buffy.''
</P>
<P>
   In what he has often described as a sequel to the film, Whedon's
heroine (played by Sarah Michelle Gellar) has gone from a
smug-but-dim cheerleader to a social outcast. Gone is her San
Fernando Valley address; she now lives in Sunnydale, a fictional
Southern California suburb that rests atop a portal called the
Hellmouth.
</P>
<P>
   While Buffy's nights are still spent snuffing monsters and
fanged assailants, they are no longer mere pop-up scare tactics but
metaphors for the real-life traumas that teen-agers face on the
path to adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Whedon's expert repair job should have been no
surprise. Before he became a dual-medium success story, he was
known in Hollywood as the guy who was brought in to fix the scripts
of event movies like ``Speed,'' ``Twister'' and ``Toy Story''
(which earned him an Academy Award nomination). Whedon was also
known as the guy who wrote the original ``Buffy'' screenplay but
felt the feature film didn't fully realize his concept.
</P>
<P>
   But what if Whedon's dark, witty script had been more faithfully
translated as a movie? It might have become a classic instead of
taking in only $16 million at the box office. And that could have
stood in the way of its eventual television success.
</P>
<P>
   That's because turning not-so-great movies into prime-time
series may be a growth industry. At least two cable series _ ``La
Femme Nikita'' and ``The Net'' _ have come into being the same way.
Television can be the perfect environment for fine-tuning an
imperfect film.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is the failed prototype, offering a clear look at
numerous mistakes to avoid. And 13 hourlong episodes (rather than
90 movie minutes) can give the characters enduring dimension. Maybe
more television producers should be looking at the critics'
10-worst lists for possible future projects.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on the history of small screen knockoffs,
much-loved hit movies often make for pretty uninteresting
prime-time fare. Yes, there have been memorable ratings toppers
like ``The Odd Couple'' and ``M-A-S-H,'' but they're the exceptions
to the rule. In the name of trying to appease the nit-picking
expectations of an adoring fan base, the people who adapt the films
often end up doing a cautious imitation of a movie like ``The
Client,'' a short-lived 1995 series that cleaved to the source
material and featured actors who were fuzzily reminiscent of the
stars who created the roles on the silver screen.
</P>
<P>
   JoBeth Williams and John Heard in the Susan Sarandon and Tommy
Lee Jones roles, that is. In fact, had Whedon's original ``Buffy''
script been a box-office blockbuster, instead of a Kristy
Swanson-Luke Perry misfire, the sales pitch to the WB brass
probably wouldn't have been, ``This is going to be extremely
different from the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The series probably would have been done exactly like the
feature,'' said Gail Berman, an executive producer of the series,
who says, in all honesty, that she loves both Buffys. ``You
wouldn't have explored anything differently. And if you look at the
shows based on feature films that are successful, they are the ones
that explore things differently and move the concept forward.
Television series that continue the concept are just silly.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Ms. Berman's prediction is best proved by the USA
Network, which has made a name for itself in the world of basic
cable by programming original hourlong shows that bear film titles.
Aside from its World Wrestling Federation slamfests, USA's primary
draw is ``La Femme Nikita,'' which takes its inspiration and core
premise from Luc Besson's stylish but ultimately hollow 1991
underground hit.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, USA was not the first to spot potential gold in
the movie's tale of a heroin addict who kills a policeman and is
given the offer of being executed or being groomed as a
professional assassin for a top-secret government organization,
whereupon she wisely chooses the latter.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, John Badham directed ``Point of No Return,'' an
American remake of ``La Femme Nikita,'' which was an almost
shot-by-shot duplicate, save the rechristening of its central
hit-woman character as Maggie (with Bridget Fonda as a most
incongruously petite hired gun).
</P>
<P>
   So when the series ``La Femme Nikita'' had its premiere in
January 1997, the smartest thing about it was how it had been
retrofitted for television. Chosen as its headliner was a
5-foot-11, blond, blue-eyed Australian unknown named Peta Wilson,
who was not quite as feral as Besson's leading lady Anne Parillaud
but a more credible fighting machine than Ms. Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Operating on the logic that audiences might not want to invite
an amoral murderer into their living rooms every week, Joel Surnow
(``Miami Vice,'' ``The Equalizer''), the executive consultant, gave
Nikita a more sympathetic back story. Falsely accused of the crime
that keeps her duty-bound to her employers, she never relishes
whacking evildoers, but if she doesn't dispatch them, she'll be
handed her mortal pink-slip.
</P>
<P>
   On a happier note, every day is designer day for the pacifist
superspy. The impracticality of Nikita's work wardrobe is never
addressed. And who cares? This is pop fantasy television. You're
supposed to lean back and appreciate the parade of Dolce &AMP; Gabbana,
Mizrahi and Gaultier.
</P>
<P>
   A little bit ``Mission:Impossible,'' a little bit ``MTV's House
of Style,'' Surnow's ``Femme Nikita'' doesn't try to be what it
isn't. No series has the budget to reproduce big-money action
sequences, but things can stay current. While Besson and Badham's
second-rate look-alike became dated the second the final print was
struck, Surnow makes sure that his characters' weaponry and
computer gadgets appear state-of-the-art and that his story lines
are ripped straight from the international section of the evening
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Stylistically, we have the opportunity to give a
five-minutes-into-the-future look at where we are
technologically,'' said Surnow, who feels that the public is inured
to small-time urban violence because of reality programming like
``Cops.'' ``Dealing with the Abu Nidals and the Osama bin Ladens
and the stuff that's happening right now seems to be really scary
in a real world way.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been interesting to have sat in on the creative
meetings that hatched USA's ``Net,'' which is based on Irwin
Winkler's 1995 thriller about Angela Bennett, a freelance software
consultant whose electronic identity is erased by cybercrooks and
replaced with that of a known felon.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the $50 million in domestic ticket sales was
emphasized, while no one probably mentioned that at the time
moviegoers were so besotted by its star, Sandra Bullock, that they
would have paid to see her in an update of ``Howard the Duck.'' And
did anyone bring up the brutal reviews? (``Riddled with more
coincidences and implausibilities than Hitchcock permitted himself
in his entire career,'' said one review.)
</P>
<P>
   In truth, USA's version of ``The Net'' doesn't always make sense
either. Still, it's touching to watch how Brooke Langton, last seen
kvetching to Billy on ``Melrose Place,'' throws her entire being
into the principal role, looking relieved to have landed the part
of someone who actually has something worthwhile to add to a
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Langton's computer whiz is spunkier and sexier than Ms.
Bullock's mopey recluse and, given her life-threatening
circumstances, refreshingly social. But there's nothing Ms. Langton
can do to get around the fact that the writers of ``The Net'' have
made her a novice at the art of cloak-and-dagger.
</P>
<P>
   Still on the lam from both deadly techies and the police, Angela
moves from town to town, armed with only a half-alias
(distressingly, she only bothers to change her last name) and
always seems ready to blow her cover to the first person who asks.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from this glitch, or perhaps because of it, there's more
fun to be had in any episode of ``The Net'' than in Winkler's
plodding, overly serious movie. There's something amusing about how
the baddies are often shot in leering, comic-book close-ups and how
the show's producers aren't above crowbarring in bits that are
meant to keep the men in their mixed demographic happy.
</P>
<P>
   (Recently, for example, Angela managed to escape arrest from a
yacht by diving overboard and swimming to shore, but not before
removing her shiny blue cocktail dress to reveal her matching bra
and panties.)
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Ms. Langton's heroine isn't a patsy. When the chips are
down, she takes charge _ which, of course, is what makes the series
similar to ``Nikita'' and ``Buffy.'' Not only are these
protagonists linked by smarts and self-sufficiency; they are
prisoners of their own bad luck. Having been assigned jobs they
never applied for, they still try to rid planet Earth of sinister
forces with type-A zeal.
</P>
<P>
   But given the chance, they'd trade in their white hats for
ordinary lives _ you know, love, stability, no blood on your hands.
Which makes for a different action dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can write a tough guy,'' said Patrick Hasburgh,
executive producer of the television version of ``The Net.''
``Bringing a female sensibility to that kind of character expands
it 10 times. There's a kind of truthfulness to the violence and a
sense of how painful it really all is.'' In this way, Ms. Gellar,
Ms. Wilson and Ms. Langton inhabit three of the most complex and
unusual female characters on television.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are plenty of examples of shows with strong,
competent, reflective women, but, with the possible exception of
``Xena: Warrior Princess,'' they are spoon-fed to us as colorful
personalities that exist within the ensemble population of, say, a
law office or a police station or a Federation starship.
</P>
<P>
   That Buffy, Nikita and Angela are allowed to drive the story has
something to do with the fact that the WB and USA networks have
neither the budget nor the viewership to compete with the Big
Three, so they have no recourse but to be experimental. That these
shows bore the names of feature films allowed the shows' creators
and executives alike to reason that at least these experiments came
with a built-in promotional hook. Each project had a cult
following.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' for example, was No. 1 in video
rentals more than once. Be it a large cult or a small one, that's
still thought of as an incremental edge in the netherworld that is
weblets or basic cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There you are, buried up on channel 39 or something and
competing against the traditional networks with very lean
resources,'' said Rod Perth, USA's former president, who acquired
the rights to ``La Femme Nikita'' and ``The Net'' because he wanted
his roster of shows to include ``assertive, pro-active female
leads.'' ``A project based on a feature gave me viewer awareness
without putting a nickel behind marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the redemptive power of television. After all, if the
overblown heroism of Kevin Costner's 1997 bomb ``The Postman'' were
toned down, would it be impossible to envision a postapocalyptic
drifter saving mankind on a weekly basis? And given the success of
CBS' ``Martial Law,'' starring Sammo Hung, is it that big a leap to
see ``The Replacement Killers'' _ a middling 1998 action flop
starring Chow Yun-Fat and Mira Sorvino _ rejiggered into a series?
(He's a Hong Kong hit man who got a conscience! She's a high-priced
forger who looks good in gauzy half-tops!)
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities are endless. Somebody someday may even have a
bright idea about ``My Giant.''

IMPEACHMENT TRIAL TO OPEN WITHOUT AGREEMENT ON FORMAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND and STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate prepared to open the first impeachment
trial of an elected president Thursday amid a continuing partisan
dispute over whether witnesses should be summoned to testify about
President Clinton's cover-up of a sexual relationship with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., huddled separately
with his 54 GOP colleagues, with Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., and with House Republicans in an effort to map
trial procedures that Lott said would give ``all parties a fair
chance to make the case and get to a conclusion that's an equitable
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's impeachment trial opens Thursday when 13 members of
the House, led by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., formally present two articles of impeachment against
Clinton to the Senate. The articles accuse Clinton of committing
perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist will then swear in
the 100 senators as jurors to weigh the articles of impeachment
approved by the House last month. The next action is expected
Monday, though no one could say what will happen then.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats said the price for bipartisanship in the Senate
trial would be Republican agreement not to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   House lawmakers urged the Senate to hear testimony from
Lewinsky, presidential secretary Betty Currie and Clinton
confidante and Washington superlawyer Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle, the leader of Senate Democrats, declared that there was
``universal, unanimous opposition'' to calling witnesses among the
45 Democratic senators.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican senators expressed concern that summoning
Lewinsky to the ornate Senate chamber would be distasteful,
inappropriate and politically damaging to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a possible Republican presidential
candidate in 2000, said he was ``very skittish'' about calling
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the door to calling witnesses also raised the risk that
Clinton would be called upon to testify _ forcing the embattled
chief executive to either show up and publicly admit that he lied
or to reject the Senate summons, precipitating a constitutional
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either way it would be disastrous,'' said Alan Dershowitz, a
Harvard law professor and Clinton defender.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has received no commitment from Senate leaders
that the trial will be limited only to evidence gathered by special
prosecutor Kenneth Starr, according to White House Press Secretary
Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the White House hoped that a bipartisan
arrangement might still emerge to enable the nation and Clinton to
avoid a prolonged Senate trial featuring televised testimony about
the president's sexual activities.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what trial procedures the Senate eventually
adopts, Lockhart predicted that Clinton would prevail in any Senate
impeachment trial. If 67 senators vote to convict Clinton of one or
both of the impeachment charges, he would automatically be removed
from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the facts and based on the Constitution, the
president will prevail,'' Lockhart declared.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, continuing to portray himself as routinely at work
despite his impeachment, appealed for bipartisan cooperation on
legislation in the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot use anything as an excuse not to deal with our
pressing priorities,'' Clinton declared. ``I do not intend to do
that; I do not think the American people expect us to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton remains ``focused on doing his job,''
adding that the president wants the Senate to agree on trial
procedures ``and let us know so we can properly prepare.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like some GOP colleagues, Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., said he
favored ``the option of witnesses.'' Hagel said arrangements could
be made to enable witnesses to avoid ``getting into the specifics''
of the sexual relationship between Lewinsky and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could take testimony without getting into the lurid aspects
of the whole slimy episode,'' Hagel said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said the Senate had to determine
whether it had ``an obligation to do a significant amount of
discovery as an integral part of a trial or can we rely on the
record of the House?''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said senators remained confused about
how to conduct the first Senate impeachment trial since senators
weighed the removal of President Andrew Johnson in 1868 in a
dispute over the severity of federal occupation of the defeated
Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who became president after the assassination of Abraham
Lincoln, escaped removal from office by a single vote.
</P>
<P>
   Mapping a Senate impeachment trial is ``an arcane, unusual
process,'' Graham said. ``We're stumbling around in the library of
ancient history where the lights have been turned off.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House declined to say whether the president's lawyers
would call defense witnesses. ``That involves legal strategy, and
I'm not going to get into legal strategy,'' Lockhart said.

   Showcasing luminaries like Josephine Baker, Sidney Bechet,
Hugues Panassie, Cole Porter and Man Ray, the Smithsonian
Institution's 1997 exhibition ``The Jazz Age in Paris, 1914-1940''
is taking to the road. Three reduced versions of the original, each
featuring nearly 100 evocative images of artists, entertainers,
posters and other memorabilia will visit 20 states. The show places
the early jazz movement in historical context and highlights the
contributions of American expatriates. ``The Jazz Age in Paris''
opened &UR;  &LR; Thursday at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library in
Washington and the Newport News Public Library in Virginia. On
Wednesday it goes to the Delta State University Archives in

   Blame it on the bossa nova. Brazil has renamed Rio de Janeiro's

   NEW YORK _ Just in time to inject some heat into winter, ``Noche
Flamenca'' returns to New York for two performances this weekend at
the Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College. With Soledad Barrio leading
the troupe, seven musicians, singers and dancers will conjure up
the earthy essence of flamenco as passed down from Andalusian
Gypsies. With sinuous armwork, volleying footwork and flashing
skirts, the performances are scheduled for 8 p.m. Saturday and 7
p.m. Sunday.

<P>
   The novelist Salman Rushdie will receive France's most
prestigious literary award in London this month. The French Embassy
announced Wednesday that Rushdie, author of ``The Satanic Verses,''
who has lived under a threat of death since 1989 for allegedly
blaspheming Islam, was to be made a commander in the Order of Arts
and Letters. The honor reflects his popularity in France, where he
has many admirers.

   PRIZE PERFORMER
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicholson may not need another award from the Hollywood
Foreign Press Association. After all, he has five of its Golden
Globes. But he's going to get one anyway next month. Nicholson, who
won a Golden Globe only last year for his performance as the
misanthropic writer in ``As Good as It Gets,'' will receive the
organization's honorary Cecil B. DeMille award for ``outstanding
contribution to the entertainment world.''

   BOSTON _ George William Bates Jr. of Somerville, an editor at
the Boston Herald and the former managing editor of the Paris
Herald Tribune, died of cancer Tuesday in Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center in Boston. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Bates was born in Nashville, where he began his newspaper
career delivering the Tennessean at the age of 12. After graduating
from Vanderbilt University in 1950, he served in the Navy during
the Korean War before returning to the Tennessean as a sports
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   He then was a news editor at the Miami Herald before joining the
staff of the New York Herald Tribune in 1964. He then was managing
editor of the Paris Herald Tribune (now the International Herald
Tribune).
</P>
<P>
   After his return to the United States in 1977, he was managing
editor of the short-lived Trib in New York City. He then became a
news and features editor at the Boston Herald, where he worked
until last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Mr. Bates was known for his strong grasp
of international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a really good eye for stories. He understood the
dynamic of the international stuff, which was unusual in those
days,'' said Bob Sales, former executive editor of the Boston
Herald.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a real perfectionist and did a tremendous job to make
sure everything was absolutely right and historically correct,''
said Norman Gray, current Herald news editor.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Betsy Buffington Bates, and many nieces and
nephews.

 &HT;    FOOD SUPPLEMENTS DATA BASE TO PROVIDE SCIENTIFIC FACTS
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The burgeoning ``dietary supplements'' industry,
with a natural substance to treat nearly every ailment and a store
to sell it in nearly every mall, has had severe shortages in one
area: facts.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's ginko biloba to ward off senility or St. Johnswort
for depression, consumers who pushed sales of the herbal remedies
industry to $15 billion last year have little information about the
stuff they are swallowing each morning along with their one-a-days.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary
Supplements on Wednesday unveiled a plan they hope will start
changing all that.
</P>
<P>
   A new Internet site _ http://dietary-supplements.info.nih.gov _
will provide the public with ``user friendly'' access to
information from more than 250,000 scientific research reports on
the effects of 50 of the most popular dietary supplements.
</P>
<P>
   When the site is fully operational, anyone with access to the
Internet can key in a few words and get a list of the titles and
summary abstracts of scientific papers dealing with dietary
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   In a demonstration Wednesday, an NIH computer program designer
pecked the words ``calcium'' and ``bone or osteo?'' and ``exerc?''
onto a laptop computer and came up with 100 references in the
system's scientific database, beginning with an article from the
Journal of the American College of Nutrition entitled:
</P>
<P>
   ``Contributions of dietary calcium and physical activity to
primary prevention of osteoporosis in females.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet site was to be available by 3 p.m. Wednesday, but a
glitch kept the data off-line.
</P>
<P>
   The database was developed with assistance from the Department
of Agriculture's National Agricultural Library, said Bernadette M.
Marriott, director of the Office of Dietary Supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Mariott said that the database will not provide the full text of
scientific articles and that consumers will have to go to a public
or university library to find that.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged that some of the abstracts are highly
technical, such as another ``calcium'' find Wednesday offering
information on ``involvement of a guanine-nucleotide-binding
protein-mediate mechanism for enhancement of arachidonic acid
liberation by phorbol 12-myristate. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   She said the database will be used not only by consumers but by
scientists as well.
</P>
<P>
   Congress in 1994, under heavy lobbying pressure from the dietary
supplements industry, passed a law that greatly restricted the
authority of the Food and Drug Administration to regulate the
substances.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of that law, sales have exploded, and a
spokeswoman for the Council for Responsible Nutrition, an industry
group, said sales last year appear to have been between $13 billion
and $15 billion, although no one is sure what the figure was.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists, concerned about the soaring popularity and
restricted regulation of the substances, have warned that people
take dietary substances without knowing what they are getting - at
times to the exclusion of pharmaceuticals or medical care they may
need.
</P>
<P>
   But Annette Dickinson, a vice president of the Council for
Responsible Nutrition, said the sales have been driven by
accumulating scientific data bringing out the health value of food
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it (the NIH database) will be just one more step
toward more information for consumer-- and everybody else about
what the scientific basis for these products is, and I think
that'll be good for the industry,'' she said.

PRINCE EDWARD TO WED LONG-TIME GIRLFRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Determined to succeed where his siblings failed, Prince
Edward, Queen Elizabeth's youngest son, announced Wednesday that he
and his longtime girlfriend, Sophie Rhys-Jones, are going to get
married.
</P>
<P>
   No date was set, but the prospect of a royal wedding _ and even
more so, the prospect of a durable royal marriage _ is a welcome
diversion for a monarchy that has been on the defensive since
Diana, Princess of Wales, died in a Paris car crash 16 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   All of Edward's three siblings, including Prince Charles,
Diana's ex-husband, have divorced. Loveless marriages were common
to monarchies in previous centuries, when unions were arranged
around political and financial considerations. But even in the
latter half of the 20th century, when royals have been allowed to
marry for love, few of the Windsors have made it work.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most royal watchers, including Jennie Bond, the BBC's
royalty correspondent, and Ingrid Seward, Edward's biographer, give
this marriage a much better chance of succeeding. First, they point
out that Edward and Rhys-Jones have been going out steadily for
five years. Second, they suggest that Edward is without ambition
within the royal family. Finally, they say Rhys-Jones is far more
mature than either Princess Diana or Sarah Ferguson were at the
time of their weddings.
</P>
<P>
   Edward, 34, was said to be conscious of the pressure to emulate
his parents, who have been married for 51 years. That is one of the
reasons he held off on popping the question for so long. According
to friends, he wanted to make sure that Rhys-Jones was the right
one.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Rhys-Jones, who works for a public relations firm
in London, is described by friends as independent and hardly
determined to become part of the royal family. While Diana and
Fergie became mothers, party girls, and clothes horses after
marrying, Rhys-Jones said she intends to keep working.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rhys-Jones bears a resemblance to the aristocratic
Diana, she is a commoner. Her friends describe her as uncommonly
easygoing and confident. While Diana battled eating disorders and
various neuroses as she tried to fit in with a family that did not
like her, few expect Rhys-Jones to have difficulties fitting in.
She is already a fixture at royal family gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before a bevy of photographers and reporters, Edward
said he and his future wife are ``the best of friends.''
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the 1981 storybook wedding of Charles and Diana,
which brought the nation to a standstill, Edward and Rhys-Jones
want a wedding that is considerably less grandiose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think getting married is a very personal thing,'' Rhys-Jones
told reporters. ``Naturally, there is going to be more interest in
us than there would be in other people. But it is a personal
matter, and it is a family occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Seward, Edward's biographer, said the long courtship and
Edward's timing of the announcement was in character with his
independent streak.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his brothers, Edward hated the military and quit the
Royal Marines after just four months, angering his father. Edward's
dislike of soldiering, love for the theater, and lack of a serious
girlfriend in his 20s led the tabloids here to suggest he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   Edward, seventh in line to the throne, produced a documentary on
Britain that was broadcast last year on PBS. In another documentary
about his great-uncle, Edward, Duke of Windsor, he suggested the
royal family had been too harsh in denying a title to another
commoner, Wallis Simpson, the American divorcee for whom his
great-uncle abdicated.
</P>
<P>
   A royal couple seen as marrying for love could be just what the
monarchy needs, as it battles to regain the popularity it lost when
Diana died.

IMPEACHMENT TRIAL TO OPEN WITHOUT AGREEMENT ON FORMAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: INSERTS new grafs 3-4 to update with Lott, Moynihan)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND and STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate prepared to open the first impeachment
trial of an elected president Thursday amid a continuing partisan
dispute over whether witnesses should be summoned to testify about
President Clinton's cover-up of a sexual relationship with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., huddled separately
with his 54 GOP colleagues, with Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., and with House Republicans in an effort to map
trial procedures that Lott said would give ``all parties a fair
chance to make the case and get to a conclusion that's an equitable
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Lott indicated on the Senate floor that he was leaning
toward a full trial of the impeachment charges, effectively
rejecting efforts to design a short one-week version. Lott said the
House would present the articles of impeachment at 10 a.m. EST and
that Chief Justice William Rehnquist would take the chair at 1 p.m.
to begin the trial.
</P>
<P>
   After Lott spoke, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., took the
floor to praise Lott for his fairness and his efforts to fashion a
bipartisan approach.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen House members, led by House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., will formally present the two articles
of impeachment against Clinton, accusing him of committing perjury
and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   When he takes the chair later, Rehnquist will swear in the 100
senators as jurors to weigh the articles of impeachment approved by
the House last month. The next action is expected Monday, though no
one could say what will happen then.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats said the price for bipartisanship in the Senate
trial would be Republican agreement not to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   House lawmakers urged the Senate to hear testimony from
Lewinsky, presidential secretary Betty Currie and Clinton
confidante and Washington superlawyer Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle, the leader of Senate Democrats, declared that there was
``universal, unanimous opposition'' to calling witnesses among the
45 Democratic senators.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican senators expressed concern that summoning
Lewinsky to the ornate Senate chamber would be distasteful,
inappropriate and politically damaging to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a possible Republican presidential
candidate in 2000, said he was ``very skittish'' about calling
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the door to calling witnesses also raised the risk that
Clinton would be called upon to testify _ forcing the embattled
chief executive to either show up and publicly admit that he lied
or to reject the Senate summons, precipitating a constitutional
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either way it would be disastrous,'' said Alan Dershowitz, a
Harvard law professor and Clinton defender.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has received no commitment from Senate leaders
that the trial will be limited only to evidence gathered by special
prosecutor Kenneth Starr, according to White House Press Secretary
Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the White House hoped that a bipartisan
arrangement might still emerge to enable the nation and Clinton to
avoid a prolonged Senate trial featuring televised testimony about
the president's sexual activities.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what trial procedures the Senate eventually
adopts, Lockhart predicted that Clinton would prevail in any Senate
impeachment trial. If 67 senators vote to convict Clinton of one or
both of the impeachment charges, he would automatically be removed
from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the facts and based on the Constitution, the
president will prevail,'' Lockhart declared.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, continuing to portray himself as routinely at work
despite his impeachment, appealed for bipartisan cooperation on
legislation in the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot use anything as an excuse not to deal with our
pressing priorities,'' Clinton declared. ``I do not intend to do
that; I do not think the American people expect us to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton remains ``focused on doing his job,''
adding that the president wants the Senate to agree on trial
procedures ``and let us know so we can properly prepare.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like some GOP colleagues, Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., said he
favored ``the option of witnesses.'' Hagel said arrangements could
be made to enable witnesses to avoid ``getting into the specifics''
of the sexual relationship between Lewinsky and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could take testimony without getting into the lurid aspects
of the whole slimy episode,'' Hagel said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said the Senate had to determine
whether it had ``an obligation to do a significant amount of
discovery as an integral part of a trial or can we rely on the
record of the House?''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said senators remained confused about
how to conduct the first Senate impeachment trial since senators
weighed the removal of President Andrew Johnson in 1868 in a
dispute over the severity of federal occupation of the defeated
Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who became president after the assassination of Abraham
Lincoln, escaped removal from office by a single vote.
</P>
<P>
   Mapping a Senate impeachment trial is ``an arcane, unusual
process,'' Graham said. ``We're stumbling around in the library of
ancient history where the lights have been turned off.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House declined to say whether the president's lawyers
would call defense witnesses. ``That involves legal strategy, and
I'm not going to get into legal strategy,'' Lockhart said.

 &HT;    The NBA labor battle has just begun, experts say
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's going to be a tough, hard-fought NBA season _ and that's
off the court.
</P>
<P>
   Players and owners might have salvaged some of their season, but
they've got long-term fallout to contend with, labor experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Owners walked away from the negotiating table with hard-earned
concessions, and players go home with the prospect of making even
more millions, but the compromise doesn't ensure future labor
harmony. And the patience of fans of all pro sports is wearing
thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``These strikes tend to damage . . . professional sports,'' said
Les Hough, director of the W.J. Usery Center for the Workplace at
Georgia State University. ``Baseball is just now recovered from its
(1994 strike) in terms of attendance and revenues. It has taken
(three) full seasons before the industry was back to pre-strike
levels in attendance and revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``NBA fans tend to get very upset when players and owners can't
come to agreements. It damages attendance, sales of (souvenirs).
Only time will tell whether NBA attendance recovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the issue of egos and earnings has been settled, who
won?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to know if either side won, from a labor point of
view,'' said Richard Ray, secretary-treasurer of Georgia's AFL-CIO,
which represents 300,000 members in about 200 unions. ``It sounds
like they split the difference. The union gained more in the (Larry
Bird) exception rule, while owners gained in the revenue
percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overwhelmingly for the next few seasons, both sides have lost,
because revenues will be down, attendance will be down and so will
TV-audience viewing,'' Hough said.''It will be hard to get the
(television) networks to cough up money.''

 &HT;    NBA TV situation may be ``murky''
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the NBA's television carriers finally were able to exhale
after a Wednesday agreement ended the lockout, NBC and Turner still
did not know about its programming for the abbreviated season.
</P>
<P>
   NBC said it would not comment until it gets official
notification from the league, a position shared by Turner Sports
vice president Greg Hughes, who would say only, ''Obviously, we're
pleased with the latest developments.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's television partners were reluctant to comment because
it seems unlikely that their current schedules will be joined in
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's still murky,'' said Fox Sports South vice president
Hunter Nickell, whose regional sports network has packages with the
Hawks and Hornets. ''What will the NBA release as a new schedule is
the key piece of information, and all we can do right now is wait
and see.''
</P>
<P>
   If the NBA has a 13-week regular season, as projected, that
should mean at least 39 games for Turner, which will have games
Monday on TBS and Tuesday and Friday on TNT. Additional games are
possible, either as part of a doubleheader on those three nights or
on a different night.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's current schedule, slated to resume Feb. 7, has 23 games
remaining. As a result the NBA's carrier on ``free TV'' might not
be affected beyond the current loss of nine telecasts and the
All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   While Turner has been able to substitute movies that get similar
ratings to regular-season NBA telecasts, the cable carrier, as its
network counterpart at NBC, has taken a big hit in the key male
demographics that advertisers find most attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Both networks have sponsors with long-term deals on their NBA
packages, so they should not have to start from ground zero to get
advertising for the shortened season. But getting all of the spots
sold will be a much tougher task.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our sales people have stayed in contact with the sponsors and
advertisers,'' Nickell said. ''And my feeling is that the sponsors
and advertisers have been terrific about hanging in through the
process. But we won't know until the schedule is confirmed how it
really is.''
</P>
<P>
   A major concern for NBC will be timing of the NBA Finals, which
almost certainly will not be held in the first week of June.
Viewership levels tend to drop as the summer advances, and ratings
for the Finals could plunge if the playoffs drag into the first
week of July.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the radio side, the sales staff at WSB faces tghe
challenge of drumming up advertising for the Hawks' package in less
than a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to jump in there and do our best,'' WSB Radio vice
president Marc Morgan said. ``Right now, we're not sure of the
total impact (the lockout) has had. But, hopefully, all the fan
rage and any uncomfortable feelings will begin to subside.''

 &HT;    Q&AMP;A on NBA lockout
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Is there a clear winner now that a basic settlement is agreed
upon?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not totally. The owners got what they wanted, which is cost
certainty, but the price is high, too high for some. However, now
the NBA will get labor peace for at least six years, with the
league holding an option for the seventh. That gives the game time
to recover and win back its fans.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a loser?
</P>
<P>
   A: Union executive director Billy Hunter is hardly a winner
after vowing to ``kick David Stern's butt'' and falling far short.
The high-end players will suffer a little, because their salaries
have been topped out. That is an unhappy result for Scottie Pippen,
for example, who hoped he would be able to break a couple of banks
with his next deal, since the 35-year-old rule would remain in
effect even for players eligible for the maximum contract. It means
that no player who will reach age 35 during the term of a contract
can sign for more than four years.
</P>
<P>
   Q What are the maximums for ``Larry Bird'' free agents?
</P>
<P>
   A: Players through the first six years can start as high as $9
million. Hawks free-agent Alan Henderson is an example of a player
in that range. Players in years 7 to 9 can start at $11 million.
Players with 10 or more years of service can start as high as $14
million. The maximum raise for Bird players is 12 percent, based on
year 1. The maximum for everyone else is 10 percent. That means
that instead of going for a $100 million-plus deal from Minnesota
next season, Stephon Marbury could sign for $9 million, with annual
raises of $1.08 million a year for the duration of his agreement.
It is a significant victory for the NBA and for small- to
middle-market teams. No club will be held hostage again in a Kevin
Garnett situation.
</P>
<P>
   Q What about David Falk, who for years was able to intimidate
teams into paying huge salaries?
</P>
<P>
   A: This deal does wound Falk. As it works its way through the
next few years, many players will realize that the slotted salaries
will make high-powered agents far less effective. Instead of paying
as much as 4 per cent of salaries, they might choose agents who
charge an hourly fee.
</P>
<P>
   Q When can teams talk to players and sign free agents?
</P>
<P>
   A: After ratification of the agreement, which is expected to
take 10 days. Training camp and free-agent signings will start the
next day.Q What about Michael Jordan? Will he play?
</P>
<P>
   A: No one knows for certain, but the betting is that he will
retire. The scenario presented by his good friend Charles Barkley
is that Jordan waited until a deal was in place to make his
announcement so he would not undercut his friend and agent David
Falk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there any chance this agreement will fall apart?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, although there might be a little of kicking and
screaming. Both sides could balk over details and threaten to blow
it up, but that's not going to happen. The deal will be made.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So, when does the season start?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not certain, but the players think they will go to
training camp on Jan. 18 and start play Feb. 2, with the season
running to May 1. Each team will have a week in which it plays
three nights in a row, and the schedule is said to be in the 50- to
52-game range.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happens to the old schedule?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's basically gone. No tickets will be sold until a new
schedule is in place, and season patrons apparently will be able to
exchange their old tickets for new. It is reasonable to assume that
the NBA has been working with a number of scheduling scenarios.
Each team probably will play the majority of its games within its
own division and conference. Some traditional East-West rivalries
will be retained, if possible, but arena days will rule the day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What were the principal compromises that made the deal
possible?
</P>
<P>
   A: The union and the league met at a 55 percent split for the
players in years four, five and six. In year seven, the players
will take home 57 percent, but only if the league exercises its
option.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about the salary cap?
</P>
<P>
   A: For this season, it will be $30 million, about $1 million
less than had been projected. But next season, the cap jumps to $34
million, great news for a team like the Hawks, who finally get Ken
Norman's contract off their cap. For example, this season, Norman
is slotted at $3.75 million.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about the cap exceptions?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are two. The agreement retains the $1 million exception
to be used every other year, and the so-called average-salary
exception is being phased in at $1.75 million this season,
increasing to $2 million, $2.25 million and then to the average
salary of the league. This exception is available every year to
teams over the cap.
</P>
<P>
   Q What about rookies?
</P>
<P>
   A: The NBA prevailed here, too. First-rounders will sign
three-year deals, with an option for a fourth year after the second
year. In year 5, all teams retain the right of first refusal.

 &HT;    PGA season for 1999
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The PGA Tour's offseason is about as short as a gimme putt. It
resumes today _ in limited fashion but with the first official
money of 1999 available _ with the first round of the Mercedes
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament moved this year from its traditional venue, the
LaCosta Resort in Carlsbad, Calif., to the Kapalua Plantation
Course on the Hawaiian island of Maui. It features just 30
tournament winners from 1998 out of a possible field of 35.
</P>
<P>
   For players such as Fred Couples, who when last seen was
lamenting a President's Cup loss to Australia in mid-December, it
seemed as though time away from competition ended almost before it
started.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Christmas was over, I couldn't believe six days later I
was getting on plane,'' Couples said.
</P>
<P>
   Rough duty, it isn't. While the Midwest digs out from another
blizzard, 30 players compete in 80-degree temperatures for a purse
of $2.6 million, an increase from $1.7 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Four players in the field have won the previously unofficial PGA
Tour event there. Couples and Davis Love III were two-time
champions at Kapalua, and Mark O'Meara and Jim Furyk each won once.
</P>
<P>
   LaCosta, for all its Southern California splendor, regularly had
trouble with January rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fine with me, moving here,'' Couples said. ``The course
is fantastic. The guys will miss LaCosta, but this is a good spot.
It's a playable course, but it can play hard. When the wind blows,
you can get the ball going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Five players were eligible but are not attending for various
reasons. The absentees are England's Lee Westwood, who plays mainly
on the European Tour; the recently married Ernie Els of South
Africa; Olin Browne, recovering from a wrist injury; Zimbabwean
Nick Price, who usually doesn't appear on the PGA Tour until Doral
in March; and Hal Sutton, whose wife will deliver twins soon.
</P>
<P>
   For two players in particular, the challenge to match 1998's
successes will be formidable. Former Georgia Tech player David
Duval won four times, captured the money title with $2,591,031 and
won the Vardon Trophy for the lowest scoring average (69.13).
Player of the Year Mark O'Meara, 41, became the oldest player to
win two majors, taking the Masters and the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods is coming off a season that lacked victories _ his
only PGA Tour win came at Atlanta's BellSouth Classic _ but
produced $1,841,174 and 12 top-10 finishes.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercedes begins a landmark year, with the introduction of
three World Golf Championship events, each with $5 million purses,
beginning with the Andersen Consulting World Match Play
Championship, Feb. 24-28 at LaCosta.
</P>
<P>
   For the Atlanta area, big-time golf in 1999 enjoys an expanded
forum. The BellSouth Classic and the Masters will be played in
consecutive weeks to begin April.
</P>
<P>
   Other questions to be answered in the coming months:
</P>
<P>
   Will Greg Norman win again at 43 during his comeback year from
shoulder surgery?
</P>
<P>
   Will Nick Faldo, who disappeared last year as quickly as Norman
did on Sunday at Augusta in 1996, climb back up the world rankings?
</P>
<P>
   Will Tom Lehman, another victim of shoulder surgery, regain the
form that made him the PGA Tour Player of the Year in 1996?

 &HT;    IN SHADOW OF HISTORIC TRIAL, CLINTON SOLDIERS ON
 &HT;    490&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ About to become only the second president in
history to face a Senate impeachment trial, President Clinton spent
Wednesday much as he has spent the past year: juggling his public
duties as chief executive with behind-the-scenes efforts to manage
a complicated legal and political campaign to save his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   While officially the White House described his mood as
''concerned,'' Clinton, by his own telling, is a man torn by deep
emotions: shame over his own conduct, frustration with the
predicament it has landed him in, and anger toward those he blames
for using his troubles as a weapon against him.
</P>
<P>
   Up front, though, the president and his senior aides are
projecting the image of a chief executive fully in command of his
office, and engaged, if not obsessed, with doing the people's
business.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president's mood hasn't changed since the last time you
asked me this,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters
Wednesday. ''He's focused on doing his job; He is concerned about
how this process will unfold.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Senate trial scheduled to ceremonially open Thursday,
Clinton staged a press event on Wednesday to highlight good
economic news.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by key members of his economic and budget team, Clinton
announced that the budget surplus for this year is expected to top
$76 billion _ a record. He used the estimate, which normally is
released along with the Feb. 1 issuance of the annual
administration budget proposal, to claim credit for ending three
decades of federal budget deficits, declaring that ''the era of big
deficits is over.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth day in the past five that Clinton has trotted
out some element of his 1999 legislative agenda. He proposed
increased defense spending on Saturday, tax credits for long-term
health care on Monday, and a plan for combating crime and drugs on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, even as the Senate soberly takes up the formalities
of his impeachment trial, Clinton plans to spotlight yet another
initiative, a plan for helping working Americans pay for
after-school care for their children.
</P>
<P>
   It's normal for presidents to use the first working days of the
year to lay out early priorities, as Congress returns from its
year-end recess and begins to gear up for the work ahead. The idea
is to build momentum for the White House agenda in the weeks
leading up to the president's annual State of the Union address,
which Clinton is preparing to deliver on Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, there's an added mission to the message.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for Clinton's continuing popularity _ polls continue
to show that roughly 7 in 10 Americans approve of the way he's
doing his job _ is that the public generally believes he's hard at
work on issues that matter to most people.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining that image, through a continuing stream of
theme-of-the-day events, if need be, is a cornerstone of the
president's survival strategy.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   White House officials won't say how much time Clinton spends
each day coordinating his legal strategy with the battery of
personal lawyers and White House counselors that will defend him
against charges of perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't really have the answer to that question. I think the
lawyers are unlikely to be specific about it,'' said James Kennedy,
spokesman for the office of White House Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will officials spell out the president's role in working
with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., to try to come up with a
compromise that the White House hopes will lead to a speedy trial
ending in acquittal or, at worst, censure.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is spending the appropriate amount of time he needs to on
this,'' Lockhart said, referring to the legal side of the effort to
save Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Said Kennedy, ''the bulk of his time remains on his other
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met Wednesday, for instance, with his economic and
budget team to try to put together remaining pieces of his proposed
budget for the fiscal year that begins next October, a massive
package of some $1.7 trillion in taxes and spending that will form
the centerpiece of his 1999 agenda.
</P>
<P>
   He also spent an hour meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, national security adviser Samuel Berger, Defense
Secretary William Cohen, and other national security principals,
surveying an array of foreign policy challenges ranging from the
ongoing conflict with Iraq to efforts to bring peace to the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's official duties, however, are set against the
extraordinary backdrop of the first Senate impeachment trial of a
president in 130 years.
</P>
<P>
   No one is pretending that it's business as usual for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   For while the White House contends that the charges against
Clinton don't warrant his removal from office, a trial is still a
trial, and whether at the end of it two-thirds of the Senate would
vote to remove Clinton from office is, at the moment, impossible to
predict.
</P>
<P>
   ''Based on the Constitution and based on the facts as we know
them, I don't see how they could,'' said Lockhart. ''That doesn't
mean that they won't.''

 &HT;    First day on the job for Governr Jeb Bush
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE _ On his first full day as governor, Jeb Bush
exercised, had a bran muffin for breakfast, and held private
meetings with the Senate president and House speaker _ despite a
constitutional requirement that meetings among the three be open to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a courtesy meeting,'' Bush said of his separate
20-minute meetings with Toni Jennings and John Thrasher, adding
that they discussed ``in a broad, general way'' the state budget
and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Constitution states that meetings between the
governor and either presiding officer called to find agreement on
``formal legislative action that will be taken at a subsequent
time, or at which formal legislative action is taken, regarding
pending legislation . . . shall be reasonably open to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the budget _ which this year could top $47 billion _ and
any tax cuts would require legislation passed by both chambers.
Bush Wednesday asked the two leaders' permission to postpone the
due date for his first budget from Jan. 16 to Feb. 15 and also
asked for assistance from their budget staffs.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Thrasher, before he entered his meeting, said he
planned to discuss education and tax cuts. Senate President
Jennings blamed Bush for failing to post any required notices of
the meeting but urged leniency. He called her Tuesday to invite
her, and it was his responsibility, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't my meeting,'' she said. ``Let's give him a week to
know what's happening and then we'll jump on him about secret
meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``I do not believe the governor intentionally
violated the spirit or the letter of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, backed up by his general counsel Carol Licko, argued that
Wednesday's meetings don't fall under that requirement. For
instance, Bush said, the subject of his tough gun-crime initiative
called ``10-20-life'' never came up with Thrasher, even though a
House committee passed a bill creating the harsher sentencing rules
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no specific discussion,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   That explanation is not good enough, said Barbara Petersen of
Tallahassee's First Amendment Foundation. ``I think he's splitting
hairs, and he's violating the spirit and the intent of the law,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   David Bralow, the lawyer for the Florida Society of Newspaper
Editors, said the new governor may not be accustomed to the strict
openness under which government operates in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notwithstanding wanting to give the new administration the
benefit of the doubt, in Florida we've always erred on the side of
access not on the side of closure. . .,'' Bralow said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his top staff have since Election Day said they intend
to be the most open, most forthcoming administration in history
regarding open meetings and public records. Wednesday's face off
with capital bureau reporters, however, was the latest in a series
of disagreements between the media and Bush over what constitutes a
public document or an open meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's team released ``questionnaires'' filled out by
prospective administration appointees on Dec. 31, weeks after
requested by The Palm Beach Post and only after The Post and other
newspapers prepared to file a lawsuit to get them.
</P>
<P>
   Transition team lawyers initially argued that Bush was a private
citizen in the two months between his election and his
inauguration, even though he had access to a $2 million transition
budget, occupied state buildings and posted a Web page on a state
computer.

The following article was reported by Robert Pear, Pam Belluck and
Lizette Alvarez and written by Ms. Alvarez. 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Only minutes after he was elected speaker of the
House on Wednesday, Dennis Hastert flashed the regular-guy charm
and Midwestern sensibility that his backers hope will insulate him
from the partisan warfare that toppled the previous speaker and a
would-be successor in less than two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, Mr. Speak...'' Hastert said, as Democratic Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt handed him the speaker's gavel, a slip of the
tongue that spoke volumes about his quest for bipartisanship and
perhaps, Democrats wish, an ability to see the future.
</P>
<P>
   Then Hastert handed Gephardt the gavel for safekeeping, stepped
down from the speaker's lofty perch and ambled back down to the
well of the House. ``Customarily, a new speaker gives his first
remarks from the speaker's chair,'' Hastert said as he addressed
his colleagues in the 106th Congress. ``While I have great respect
for the traditions of this House and the institution, I am breaking
tradition this once, because my legislative home is on the floor
here with you, and so is my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 12 years in Congress, Rep. John Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., a
bear-like lawmaker who was catapulted from obscurity and drafted
for the job of speaker only three weeks ago, has earned a
reputation as a ``nice guy.'' He is the kind of rare Washington
commodity who knows how to listen, stifles his temper and keeps his
word, members say, which is why he swiftly received the backing of
moderate and conservative Republicans alike.
</P>
<P>
   But, no matter how congenial and hard working, Hastert faces a
daunting double-barreled challenge: He comes to the job of speaker
as one of the most untested leaders in memory, a no-name
congressman new to to the battles of top- tier politics, and he
confronts one of the most sharply divided, least forgiving,
Congress' in years.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with only a slim, 10-vote Republican majority in the
House, Hastert will have to tread carefully between Republicans and
Democrats, conservatives and moderates, chairmen and ranking
members to sidestep last year's damaging tag of a ``Do Nothing
Congress'' and get legislation passed.
</P>
<P>
   High on his list are a host of prickly, but popular, issues:
Shoring up Social Security, passing tax cuts, fixing schools,
pumping up the nation's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative ideologues, most of them from the rebel class of
1994, will watch Hastert closely for any tarnishing of the
impeccable conservative credentials that his votes have displayed.
</P>
<P>
   But, at the same time, he must work with Democrats who are both
emboldened by their gains in the November elections and embittered
over the impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are also the first to raise their suspicions about
Hastert's close ties as chief deputy whip to Rep. Tom DeLay,
R-Texas, the House's top vote counter and a powerful conservative.
DeLay locked up the votes for Hastert only hours after Rep. Bob
Livingston, R-La., who had been designated the next speaker,
announced his resignation Dec. 19. Democrats now wonder about
Hastert's independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a question mark,'' said Rep. Thomas Barrett, D-Wis.,
who has worked closely with Hastert on the Committee on Government
Reform and Oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got his work cut out for him,'' Barrett said, alluding to
the narrow Republican majority in the House. He cited ``a deeply
divided Republican caucus, and a Democratic caucus that feels that
it has just been burned royally,'' adding, ``It's not an enviable
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans roll their eyes at the presumption that Hastert's
relationship with DeLay, his inexperience and his soft edge make
him a pushover. ``I've never seen anyone step on Denny,'' said Rep.
Chris Shays, R-Conn., a moderate who clashed with DeLay over
campaign finance legislation. ``I haven't seen anyone even get
close to it. And if anyone has tried, he got him in a good
headlock. It's probably that very few people saw it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Republicans in the House call it getting ``Dennyized.''
</P>
<P>
   A bulky arm would suddenly drape over their shoulders and,
before long, they would pour their hearts out about an upcoming
vote on the House floor. Hastert, his thick glasses framing his
face, would genially press them to be part of the legislative team,
all the while making sure they they leave with their egos intact.
</P>
<P>
   It is a style that Hastert, 57, honed as a high-school wrestling
coach in the rural town of Yorkville, Ill., in the 1960s and 1970s.
Bob Evans, a friend and fellow coach, said Hastert knew instantly
what each boy would be good at, and knew how to talk to the boys
about their weaknesses and still ``make them feel good about
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He just knows how to get along with people,'' said Rep. Ray
LaHood, R-Ill., who has known Hastert since 1982. ``He has the
ability to sit down and listen 80 percent of the time. And when you
listen 80 percent of the time, you give people the feeling you are
concerned about what they are concerned about, and that endears you
to people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the vitriolic atmosphere that has pervaded the House in the
past two years, colleagues say Hastert's approach to politics,
which he has vowed to keep intact as speaker, could usher in
gentler time. Many saw him as the ideal antidote to the bitterness
and controversy that marked last year's turn of events: the
election losses, Rep. Newt Gingrich's ouster as speaker, followed
by Livingston's resignation under the cloud of a sex scandal and
then President Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that moment, people were really tired of controversy and
the high drama that had been going on,'' LaHood said of the hours
that followed Livingston's announcement. ``He is the most
noncontroversial person in the House.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Hastert's style could not be more different than
Gingrich's, something that members note with a sense of relief.
</P>
<P>
   Cast as the regular guy, Hastert is a plain-talker, more
comfortable working in the shadows than before the camera lights.
He has no plans to become a national party spokesman, leaving that
task to other members. He does not easily go off on tangents,
intellectual or otherwise. And he is not a talker.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert did not work his way up to speaker through the ranks of
the top leadership; he was never a majority leader or a whip or a
conference chairman. He doesn't even have a leadership PAC yet,
which is an invaluable tool to raise money and build support.
</P>
<P>
   Many people would see that as a liability. Most House
Republicans do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a clean start, a new beginning,'' said Rep. David
McIntosh, R-Ind., echoing the conventional wisdom among House
Republicans. ``Here is a guy who is a family man, who is hymble,
not flashy, who connects with real people. He's not a Gingrich
figure, or a Ronald Reagan figure, but a good solid person in our
leadership.''

HOUSE LIFTS RESTRICTIONS ON INEXPENSIVE GIFTS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House of Representatives voted Wednesday to
allow members to accept modest gifts, like inexpensive meals and
souvenirs, easing a strict limit on gifts that has been in force
for three years.
</P>
<P>
   The change, which took effect immediately, was agreed to by a
voice vote, and no one spoke against it.
</P>
<P>
   House rules now conform to the Senate's, allowing noncash gifts
worth up to $50. A House member may not accept more than $100 worth
of gifts from one person each year. Gifts worth less than $10 do
not count toward the annual limit.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old rules, House members and congressional staff
members could not accept gifts or meals except under narrow
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The changes were part of a broad revision of the House rules
that was adopted Wednesday. Most of the changes involved
legislative procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The gift limit was changed in part because so many members were
applying to the Ethics Committee for exceptions to allow them to
accept trivial gifts. Examples of items that now are exempt from
controls include a greeting card, baseball cap, or T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   The changes were worked out by a bipartisan group of lawmakers
and were offered on the House floor by Rep. James Hansen, R-Utah,
who heads the Ethics Committee, and Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif,
its senior Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have learned more than I ever wanted to know about the gift
rule, and I think everyone who has had to deal with it feels the
same way,'' said Hansen, who is stepping down as chairman. ``The
fact is that under the current rule, modest and inexpensive gifts,
which raise the least ethical concerns, still raise questions.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Ethics Committee had issued about 1,500
opinions about exemptions to the rule, and that sometimes members
had to ponder whether to accept something as simple as a box of
candy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't have to have a lawyer stand by your side to tell
you what is and isn't acceptable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rules change did not alter a longstanding loophole that
allows lawmakers to take junkets like expenses-paid trips to
meetings of business groups at resorts, on the grounds that such
appearances are part of their official duties.
</P>
<P>
   The House also clarified its rules to require that consultants
working for House members and committees follow the same ethics
rules as House members and full-time employees, limiting their
lobbying activities. Last year, House Democrats objected when two
Republican consultants to a committee investigating the teamsters'
union continued to work as lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   And the House agreed to let junior staff members receive payment
for writing, speeches and other activities not related to their
official duties. Congressional employees were not covered by a 1995
Supreme Court decision that let other government workers earn such
outside income.

MOVIE REGENERATES STRONG EMOTIONS IN FAMILIES OF DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOREEN IUDICA VIGUE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For the families whose lives are partially depicted in
``A Civil Action,'' Wednesday's premiere brought a jumble of
conflicting emotions: excitement and grief, anticipation and anger.
</P>
<P>
   While most agreed the film starring John Travolta is a powerful
and accurate ``Hollywoodization'' of the lawsuit brought against
two major corporations for allegedly poisoning town water wells,
they say it offers no closure, or comfort for their continued
suffering. Some said they could not even bear to watch parts of the
film, such as the death of 3-year-old Jarrod Aufiero.
</P>
<P>
   The well-water contamination with toxic chemicals is believed to
have led to the deaths of five children and one adult. All died of
leukemia suspected by the plaintiffs to have been caused by toxins
dumped into the water system by W.R. Grace and Beatrice Foods Inc.
The case was settled for $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Aufiero, Jarrod's father, said he had one mission in
attending the opening at the Wang Theatre: To confront Walter Jay
Skinner, the judge who presided over the case, and Jerome Facher,
the attorney for Beatrice Foods. Skinner was not expected to
attend, but Facher planned to.
</P>
<P>
   Aufiero, whose son died in 1982 from acute lymphocytic leukemia,
blames Skinner for not allowing the plaintiffs to take the stand
and for being ``hostile'' toward them and their laywer, Jan
Schlichtmann, Travolta's character. He blames Facher for cutting
what he believes was a backroom deal with Skinner so the case would
favor the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I see them, I am going to ask them how they
could live with themselves, and ask what their Makers are going to
say about how he handled this,'' said Aufiero, his voice rising
with anger. ``They're not God, and I'm going to let them know
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Aufiero, like several other Woburn family members
interviewed, said they hope the film encourages other people to act
as they did: Speaking up when they find something wrong and not
backing down to corporations that pollute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope people come away from the movie realizing what our
motives were,'' said Anne Anderson, whose son, Jimmy, died of
leukemia at age 12 in 1981. She is played in the film by Kathleen
Quinlan. ``We wanted accountability from these companies; we wanted
the world to know we were harmed by what they did and that it
caused too many of our children to become ill and too many to die.
I hope the movie encourages people to seek the truth in their own
areas of concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the original eight families who joined in the lawsuit
still live in Woburn, most in the same homes. Many said the
emotional ties to a place where their children were born, played
and died is incentive alone to stay. They drink bottled water or
have filters fixed to their faucets. They wryly note that Woburn
now has some of the purest, most highly monitored drinking water in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm honestly very happy about the movie coming out, but
sometimes it's hard to know how to feel,'' said Donna Robbins,
whose son Robbie, died, of leukemia in 1976 at age 9. ``It's
exciting that all this is happening, that people know about what we
went through and tried to fight. But it's also upsetting because
our children are gone and that kind of pain doesn't end.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins said she had hoped the families would be seen more in
the movie, which focuses on the lawyers in the case. She also
wished the film were more accurate in its portrayal of her. The
writers gave a highly emotional line to the Anderson character
that, in reality, was said by Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not out to hurt or destroy the movie or the people in
it,'' said Robbins. ``I'm very glad it's out there. It reminds
people what went on in Woburn and makes sure the kids don't get
forgotten.''

   BOSTON _ George William Bates Jr. of Somerville, an editor at
the Boston Herald and the former managing editor of the Paris
Herald Tribune, died of cancer Tuesday in Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center in Boston. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Bates was born in Nashville, where he began his newspaper
career delivering the Tennessean at the age of 12. After graduating
from Vanderbilt University in 1950, he served in the Navy during
the Korean War before returning to the Tennessean as a sports
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   He then was a news editor at the Miami Herald before joining the
staff of the New York Herald Tribune in 1964. He then was managing
editor of the Paris Herald Tribune (now the International Herald
Tribune).
</P>
<P>
   After his return to the United States in 1977, he was managing
editor of the short-lived Trib in New York City. He then became a
news and features editor at the Boston Herald, where he worked
until last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Mr. Bates was known for his strong grasp
of international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a really good eye for stories. He understood the
dynamic of the international stuff, which was unusual in those
days,'' said Bob Sales, former executive editor of the Boston
Herald.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a real perfectionist and did a tremendous job to make
sure everything was absolutely right and historically correct,''
said Norman Gray, current Herald news editor.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Betsy Buffington Bates, and many nieces and
nephews.

ASTRONOMERS SUSPECT EXISTENCE OF GHOST GALAXIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Astronomers still don't know what the mysterious ``dark
matter'' that constitutes 90 percent or more of the universe is,
but Wednesday they reported discoveries that may go a long way
toward showing where it is.
</P>
<P>
   Entire galaxies may be made up almost entirely of invisible dark
matter, ghostly galaxies that perhaps far outnumber _ and outweigh
_ the billions of galaxies that are brightly visible, astronomers
from the University of Hawaii reported at a meeting of the American
Astronomical Society.
</P>
<P>
   And, said astronomer John Kormendy, there is reason to believe
that there are even greater numbers of galaxies that are completely
invisible galaxies and contain no ``normal'' stars at all.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers have long known that normal galaxies contain large
amounts of invisible matter, perhaps made up of anything from
unknown subatomic particles to huge black holes or something in
between. But it turns out that these smaller ``ghost'' galaxies
contain a far higher density of dark matter than the normal ones.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers know that the dark matter, whatever it may be, has
to be there because of the way its gravitational pull affects
visible things nearby. Careful studies of the way stars and
galaxies move has shown that more than 90 percent of the universe's
mass is made up of dark matter.
</P>
<P>
   Kormendy described observations of a ``galaxy that's almost not
there, that looks like being almost nothing. They look
insubstantial, so gossamer that you can hardly see them.'' And
that's why, until the development of ultra-sensitive electronic
detectors for telescopes to replace photographic plates, the
ghostly galaxies had not been found earlier.
</P>
<P>
   By painstakingly studying the motions of the few stars seen in
these faint galaxies, Kormendy and colleagues Karen Rehbock of
Hawaii and Kenneth Freeman of Mt. Stromlo Observatory in Australia
learned that they pack a greater density of dark matter than
ordinary galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   That means that these nearly invisible galaxies ``may look
insubstantial, but they are like cannonballs,'' Kormendy said. They
are about 100 times denser than normal, bright galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the density indicates they are true galaxies that
may have been among the earliest to form in the universe, he said,
not simply fragments of larger galaxies that were torn apart in
collisions with other galaxies. If they were only fragments,
Kormendy said, their density would have to be lower than that of
normal galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   The faintest dwarf galaxies are ``almost pristine remnants of
the earliest time of galaxy formation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And as faint and ghostly as they appear, such galaxies could
constitute a substantial portion of the mass of the universe --
perhaps even most of it. ``There might be a large population of
dark galaxies that contain too few stars to discover,'' he said.
``They may outnumber all the luminous galaxies combined.''
</P>
<P>
   The smaller and fainter the galaxies, the less likely they are
to be discovered. But even the tiniest ones probably contain as
much matter as 10 million suns, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vera Rubin, an astronomer at the Carnegie Institution of
Washington who was one of the first to discover the existence of
dark matter, said the findings illustrate how ``every time we start
studying something in detail we find new puzzles.'' They raise the
question of whether there are ``galaxies that are so faint we can't
see them. I think the answer is probably yes.''
</P>
<P>
   By finding evidence that tiny, invisible galaxies may exist in
great numbers, she said, Kormendy and his colleagues ``have done a
great service.'' The nature of the dark matter remains a mystery,
and studying it is as if ``we're in a dark room doing an all-black
puzzle. We don't know where the pieces are, and when we find them
we don't know how they fit.'' The findings at least add ``new
pieces to the puzzle.''

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Texas has taken to the skies in its war against
rabies.
</P>
<P>
   For the fifth straight year, three bright yellow Twin Otter
airplanes are dropping millions of fish meal baits containing oral
rabines vaccine over tens of thousands of square miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're flying along the border ... and are trying to get in
three rounds a day,'' said Doug McBride, a spokesman for the Texas
Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   The targeted animals _ coyotes and gray foxes _ will eat the
baits, especially in colder weather when traditional food sources
may be scarce and when fire ants are dormant.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the drives will spread bait over 34,000 square miles
in 48 counties over the next four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall goal is to contain and then eradicate canine
rabies in South Texas,'' said McBride. ``Through November 1998, we
have five cases, so obviously the virus is still there among the
coyotes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Health Department statistics show a marked decrease in
rabies in the area since the campaign began to counter a rapid
increase in the virus in South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the outbreak began in South Texas in 1988, we've had 704
cases of canine rabies. The high year was 1995 with 142 cases in
South Texas. Last year we had five,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last human case of rabies in South Texas was in 1994, the
year before the program began,'' he said. ``Since 1990, we estimate
3,000 people in South Texas have taken rabies treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   During that time, two people died of canine rabies.
</P>
<P>
   McBride said regular analysis of coyotes shows that a high
percentage consumed the bait and significant numbers have developed
an immunity to canine rabies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In South Texas, the latest tests showed that 82 percent of the
tested coyotes have eaten at least one bait, and of those,
two-thirds had an immunity to rabies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The aerial drive to contain rabid gray foxes will involve
dropping bait along a horseshoe-shaped course in Central and West
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The foxes, which carry a different strain of rabies, will be
offered oral vaccine in dogfood baits.
</P>
<P>
   McBride said the programs will continue until rabies is
eliminated in the wild canine populations.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials are also looking into the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico officials are interested in possibly applying the same
techniques there because when you have a common border, as we do,
what's ours is theirs and what's theirs is ours when it comes to
diseases,'' he said.

LAWYERS DIFFER WITH MOVIE'S PORTRAYAL OF WOBURN CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Forget the fact that they're portrayed as defenders of
companies who poison little children.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers for the defense in the lawsuit that became ``A Civil
Action'' have a different complaint: Hollywood overlooked the fact
that they won.
</P>
<P>
   ``It saddens me to the extent that people jump to the conclusion
that merely because somebody is injured some corporation must
pay,'' said Jerome Facher, a partner at Hale &AMP; Dorr in Boston.
``There was no case against Beatrice.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Keating, whose character was merged with that of William
Cheeseman, a fellow partner at Foley, Hoag &AMP; Eliot in Boston, said
the toxic chemicals in the groundwater that made the Woburn
children fatally ill had been there long before W.R. Grace or
Beatrice Foods were on the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't mind if it was a fair portrayal of what we did,''
Keating said. ``From our point of view, these were not just legal
defenses, these were true.''
</P>
<P>
   Facher and Keating say they are accustomed to hearing vicious
attacks in the courtroom, but outraged at the movie's
characterization of Judge Walter Skinner as biased against Jan
Schlichtman and the Woburn families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The depiction of the judge is grossly unfair,'' said Keating.
``I think he was actually doing everything he could to help Jan
Schlichtman out, particularly in the beginning when he did not seem
to be up to the task in a case with such high stakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Lyons, Skinner's clerk for many years, said he
hand-delivered an invitation to Wednesday night's film premiere to
the judge, but that Skinner did not plan to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've distorted him to make the judge look like a monster,''
Lyons said of the jurist who, he insisted, is widely regarded as
fair and even-tempered. ``I've sat with 50 federal judges over the
years and he's top shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   Facher said that, in the wake of the book's success, he has been
castigated in anonymous letters and e-mails as ``slimy,'' but that
his sympathy is for Skinner, who has been unable to defend himself
because of ethical rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge was not partisan to anybody and certainly did not
favor me,'' said Facher. ``We were not colleagues or classmates.''
</P>
<P>
   Facher said he considered himself a ``somebody'' after teaching
for 30 years at Harvard Law School and trying some sizable cases.
But when Robert Duvall was cast as Facher, he made no effort to
adopt his looks or mannerisms _ which convinced Facher that the
movie was, after all, a Hollywood product.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I'm going to play you the way I feel like playing
you,' '' Facher said. `` `Because nobody knows who you are.' ''

IT'S OFFICIAL: PRINCE EDWARD TO MARRY LONGTIME GIRLFRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Queen Elizabeth's youngest child, Prince Edward, is
finally to follow his royal siblings' path down the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Putting an end to periodic rises and falls of expectation,
Buckingham Palace announced Wednesday that the 34-year-old brother
of Princes Charles and Andrew and Princess Anne, all of whose
marriages ended in divorce, would wed his longtime girlfriend,
Sophie Rhys-Jones, 33, this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``No decision has been taken yet regarding the venue and date
for the wedding,'' the announcement of the engagement said.
``However, Prince Edward and Miss Rhys-Jones hope that it might be
possible to use St. George's Chapel, Windsor, in the late spring or
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The palace said the queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, Edward's
father, were delighted at the news.
</P>
<P>
   Windsor, in suburban Berkshire, is the queen's favorite
residence and would provide a symbolically fitting spot for a
restorative moment in the life of a family recently unaccustomed to
happy events.
</P>
<P>
   It was a devastating fire at the castle in November 1992 that
capped what the queen called her ``annus horribilis,'' the year in
which all three of her children either separated or divorced,
exposing the palace to levels of intrusive publicity it had never
known.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, however, also provided the story for a successful
television documentary made by the prince, who, as Edward Windsor,
film producer, has led a life independent of royal duties as the
head of his own company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a glorious piece of architecture, and it's somewhere
different,'' Edward said Wednesday, talking of Windsor as just the
kind of retreat from pageantry and publicity that might do the
family good. ``I think there is no such thing as a private wedding,
but I hope that it will be predominantly a family wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure in recent times to wed Miss Rhys-Jones, whom he
began dating five years ago, the bachelor prince told friends that
he would make that decision only when his company, Ardent
Productions, was secure. An earlier venture failed, and Ardent lost
$2 million in 1997 but now can point to several well-received films
and a contract with the William Morris Agency that has brought it
financing for future projects as proof that the first Windsor to
have an outside job is making a success of it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the impression lent by her hyphenated name, Miss
Rhys-Jones is not an aristocrat but the head of her own public
relations firm who was raised in a Victorian farmhouse in the Kent
village of Brenchley, 35 miles southeast of London, and never went
to a university. Her father is a former car salesman who later
worked for a tire company selling to Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Her age, her middle-class upbringing, her stable family life and
her working experience have been cited by friends as guarantees
that her entrance into the royal family will not be as traumatic as
that of the younger and more impressionable Diana Spencer, the wife
of Prince Charles, and Sarah Ferguson, the wife of Prince Andrew.
Edward is also not her first extended romance; she spent a year in
Australia with a ski instructor she met in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   With the tacit approval of the queen, she and the prince have
been intermittently living together in royal apartments and on
royal travel, and they attend ceremonial and intimate family events
as a couple. The arrangement has afforded her a chance to
accommodate herself to the demands of royal life that the Princess
of Wales and the Duchess of York never had.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Wednesday how she felt about joining the royal family,
Miss Rhys-Jones said, ``I am fully aware of the responsibilities,
and I feel I am ready for it.'' She added, ``I have had a few years
to get used to it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of Edward's siblings, Princess Anne at 23 was the first to marry
and to divorce, but also the first to remarry. Wed to Capt. Mark
Phillips in 1973, she divorced in 1992 in order to marry her
current husband, Cmdr. Timothy Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles, then 33, married Diana, who was 20, in 1981, and
their divorce was announced in 1996. She died in a car crash in
Paris in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, both of whom were 26, were wed
in 1986 and divorced in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Edward pays for his own business travel, often stays with
friends rather than in hotels and tells anyone who asks to call him
Edward Windsor. Consequently, he has been able to avoid the kind of
publicity that has dogged the rest of his family.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the newly betrothed couple strolled hand in hand
during a photo call in the gardens of St. James's Palace, she
showing off her Asprey Garrard diamond engagement ring and he
bantering with reporters pressing him on why he waited so long to
propose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible for anyone else to understand why it has taken
me this long,'' he said, ``but I don't think it would have been
right before and I don't think Sophie would have said yes.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Hopefully by the fact that she did say yes, I must
have got the timing right.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple took notice of one another for the first time in 1993
when she was doing publicity for a charity sports event that Prince
Edward headed. Before then Edward had been linked with a number of
actresses and models, but from that point, the romance with Miss
Rhys-Jones became a constant.
</P>
<P>
   In the family tradition, Edward had entered the military after
graduating from Cambridge, but in a show of independence he quit
the commando course of the Royal Marines in 1987, resigned his
commission and returned to civilian life to pursue a career in the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for three years as a production assistant for Andrew
Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Co., doing backstage jobs at the
musicals ``Cats,'' ``Starlight Express'' and ``Phantom of the
Opera'' in the West End of London. In 1992 he and friends set up a
theater production company, which collapsed a year later, one
million dollars in debt.
</P>
<P>
   His Ardent Productions, now five years old, has had its largest
successes with royal subjects, one the story of his great-uncle
Edward VIII called ``Edward on Edward''; another a series called
``Crown and Country,'' which was shown on PBS in the United States
in September and will reappear in a sequel in February; and
``Windsor Restored,'' the documentary on the $61 million project to
resurrect Windsor Castle after the 1992 fire.
</P>
<P>
   The couple will live in Bagshot Park, a sprawling estate in
Surrey that Queen Victoria built for her favorite son, Prince
Arthur, Duke of Connaught, and that Edward took over on a
50-year-lease in 1997 to house his business headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Both will continue their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business as usual,'' Miss Rhys-Jones, chairwoman of RJH public
relations, said Wednesday. And he will try to be just Edward
Windsor, joint managing director of Ardent Productions, formerly
known as prince.

`SUPERFLARES' SEEN AS DOOMSDAY PRECURSORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Stars just like the sun occasionally send out
``superflares'' with enough explosive energy to destroy the entire
ozone layer, disable all satellites, knock out all electric power
grids, and create spectacular auroras worldwide, astronomers
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But, they hasten to add, they are quite sure that our own sun
has never produced an outburst with that much energy and never
will. That's good news, they say, because the loss of the ozone
layer would allow deadly ultraviolet light to penetrate the Earth's
atmosphere, wiping out the food chain for years and leading to mass
starvation.
</P>
<P>
   A tentative theory holds that a large planet with a strong
magnetic field, similar to Jupiter, would have to be orbiting very
close to the sun to produce such giant flares.
</P>
<P>
   And, added Yale University astronomer Bradley Schaefer, if our
sun were capable of emitting superflares, descriptions of the
events would surely be found in Earth's historical records, and
their effects would be detectable on the moons of other planets. No
such evidence has been found, he said, so ``our sun does not have
superflares, as far as we can tell. . . This isn't going to happen,
so don't worry.''
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer presented the evidence of superflares from nine other
sun-like stars at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society.
The findings emerged from a study of more than a century's worth of
astronomical observations.
</P>
<P>
   One such event was reported just a century ago, in 1899, by
astronomers in three countries. They simultaneously noticed that a
star called S Fornacis suddenly became more than 10 times brighter
than normal, and later that night returned to its normal
brightness. Schaefer said most of the superflares he has found
evidence for appeared to last only about an hour, although some
lasted a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Rubenstein, another Yale astronomer, theorizes that the
superflares are caused by the interaction of a star's magnetic
field with the magnetic field of a giant planet orbiting very close
to it. Recent searches for planets orbiting other stars have found
numerous examples of large, close-in planets, and Rubenstein said
that the stars that have produced superflares should become prime
candidates for searching for such planets.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery was an outgrowth of Schaefer's search for stars
associated with enigmatic events that astronomers call gamma-ray
bursts. As part of his research, he made a systematic search of
astronomical records, looking for episodes of brief, unexplained
changes in a star's brightness. Many kinds of stars are known to
vary regularly in brightness, but Schaefer was looking for changes
in a type of stars where variability was not expected. He
concentrated on F- and G-type stars, similar to the sun, which is a
G-type.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer's search turned up superflares from 100 to 10 million
times more powerful than the strongest flares ever observed from
our sun. Some flares from our sun produce vivid auroral (Northern
Lights) displays, interfere with delicate electronic systems on
orbiting satellites, and occasionally cause power surges in
electric powerlines that cause blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   From the small number of cases he found, Schaefer estimated that
sunlike stars produce superflares about once a century, but he
added that the uncertainties are such that the timing could be
anywhere from once a decade to once a millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Had our own sun produced a superflare in the last century or
two, it undoubtedly would have been seen and its effects would have
been apparent. Auroras produced by a superflare anytime in the last
few millenniums would most likely have been recorded, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer also calculated that such an outburst would have melted
much of the ice on moons as far out as Saturn's, causing vast, flat
floodplains that would have refrozen and would be clearly
detectable even now if the flare had occurred anytime in the last
billion years or so. So, he concluded, the sun is apparently not
one of the stars able to produce superflares.

<P>
   Art gets around. Museums are pretty well stuck in one spot, but
their treasures keep on truckin'. At a time when museums build
buildings that tend to be more significant than the collections
they shelter, some centers have gone the less expensive route of
converting existing industrial centers into galleries. A few others
are experimenting with putting art, at least temporarily, into
essentially unconverted places that respectable museums would once
have thought dreadfully infra dig: marginal retail areas,
department stores, dance halls.
</P>
<P>
   If a museum can install art in abandoned banks and garages, if
the New Museum in SoHo can call itself a museum though it has no
permanent collection, if the Contemporary Museum in Baltimore can
operate with neither collection nor home, has the museum been
redefined as merely a state of mind?
</P>
<P>
   A museum is still a museum if it's closed for a year or two, but
its exhibition potential drops alarmingly. At the Pompidou Center
in Paris, the permanent collection has been closed since September
1997 while the galleries are being restored, though the
contemporary galleries remain open for temporary exhibitions until
mid-1999. (The entire museum will then close until the year 2000.)
But France's modern treasures have not been stashed in mothballs.
Bernard Blistene, vice director for contemporary art of the
Pompidou, says with a tinge of horror in his voice that putting
such a great collection into storage for two years would amount to
confiscation.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the Pompidou, a national museum and well aware that not
everyone can travel to the capital, considers decentralization part
of its mission. Already the biggest lender in the world, according
to Blistene _ approximately 6,000 items every year _ the Pompidou
is sending out more than 100 loan exhibitions while its doors are
shut. Among them are major shows of Kandinsky and Giacometti for
regional museums in France, 120 ``masterpieces of the collection''
for Tokyo, and the exhibitions of 20th-century art currently at
both branches of the Guggenheim in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Blistene is also organizing an enormous exhibition in a Paris
department store for March. This will occupy an entire floor _ more
than 16,000 square feet _ of La Samaritaine, a store where you can
buy a lipstick, a bike and a hamster in one outing. La Samaritaine
has never before regarded itself as a branch of the national
museums of France.
</P>
<P>
   This store, an early example of an emporium where people
discovered they could buy floor mops and frou-frou in one place,
will house a festival of art by young contemporary artists, many of
whom are marrying conventional arts to unconventional media. The
exhibition will include fashion, performance, music, dance,
lectures and happenings, all free. Blistene says he would ``like to
reconsider the generosity and diversity of art of this century, the
intensity and efficiency of contemporary art, not art as just a
dead object.''
</P>
<P>
   Why a department store? Michael Kimmelman pointed out in The New
York Times that in America, from the late 19th century to the
1950s, certain department stores maintained the populist ideal by
giving lowly shoppers a taste of high art. Some of these
exhibitions in the land of commerce were mounted with the aid of
museums. In the 1930s, the Museum of Modern Art's ``Machine Art''
show traveled to department stores in the Midwest. The French have
only occasionally shown art in a department store; depending more
heavily on Louis XVI than Thomas Paine, they have been more
inclined to use national fairs than commercial outlets to educate
the public taste in art.
</P>
<P>
   Blistene, however, is delighted with the opportunity to put art
where once only shoppers dared to tread. He notes that people go
where things are happening _ the Armory, for instance, the Piers
and the Gramercy Park Hotel in New York when they open up to art.
And he was looking for an empty place and a site for stimulation
and activity, ``a way to react against the temptation of being
melancholy,'' as he puts it.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that nostalgia is currently being used as a barrier
against contemporary reality but insists that art must remain
involved as well as critical. ``People think it was better
yesterday,'' he says. ``I think it's always better tomorrow.'' One
might think shopping was the way to cure melancholy in today's
society; perhaps La Samaritaine will provide an avant-garde
alternative to the capitalist anodyne it ordinarily prescribes.
</P>
<P>
   It seems only fitting that at a moment when museums are creating
virtual department stores within their precincts, the jazziest art
of the day should take up residence in the realm of the ladies who
lunch. And it is delicious to think that someday at Bloomingdale's
or Saks the mechanical voice that now and then pretends to be an
elevator operator might call out, ``Lingerie and intimates on four;
fifth floor, Pollock, Rothko and de Kooning.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who will not go to the mount of Parnassus, Parnassus
will obligingly come to them. Art long ago joined the rounds of
daily life via public sculpture in parks and airline terminals and
on occasional billboards and advertising pages. Museums, too, want
to creep into quotidian consciousness, to play a role in the
texture of ordinary, 9-to-5 life.
</P>
<P>
   They also need more space for display and are conscious that
they need to address different audiences. The Los Angeles
Contemporary Museum opened not one but two temporary spaces and,
like the man who came to dinner, they stayed on. In the late 1970s,
the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts had a wandering exhibition on an
``art truck'' until insurance and conservation permanently put on
the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half years ago, the WPA/Corcoran, part of the Corcoran
Gallery of Art in Washington but independent of it, began putting
on shows of emerging regional artists, many of them recent
graduates of art schools in the Baltimore, Washington and Richmond
area. The shows now appear in Project Space, temporary quarters in
a former nightclub called the Insect Club in a slightly rundown
business district. Metal grasshoppers as large as hallucinations
still stand guard by the door while the bar looms darkly along one
wall.
</P>
<P>
   This decor is appropriately rakish for the kind of installation
art that sends aluminum-foil leaves wafting across the gallery to
the sound of grinding gears, or displays suits that look like
torture instruments, with artists strapped into them on weekends.
MCI, the communications company, opened a sports arena nearby late
in 1977, and Nadine Gabai-Botero, the program director for the
WPA/Corcoran, says the area's economic good fortune will probably
drive out unprofitable contemporary art. Then art will be on to the
next marginal area, perhaps to spaces that are available only for a
month or two, prime for a lightning strike by the art corps.
</P>
<P>
   This is a guerrilla art tactic, to invade a location where art
never lived and billet the art troops there for a while, a maneuver
not usually employed by established museums. In the late 1960s and
70s, when artists were vigorously questioning and frequently
repudiating the role of museums, alternative spaces sprang up to
shelter art that did not want entry to museums, or could not gain
it. After a while a few museums saw the usefulness of such places
and began to set up their own alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's Contemporary Museum has made guerrilla artfare a
modus vivendi. A museum without a museum, the Contemporary is a
full-time nomad, a homeless institution that not only has no
collection but has no location either.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1989 and headed since 1996 by Gary Sangster, the
Contemporary puts on two shows a year, one in, and in conjunction
with, a local institution and the other in some highly improbable
place, like a former Polish convent, a former Buick car dealership,
an abandoned bus garage without electricity and the former Famous
Ballroom, without either fame or heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catfish Dreamin','' a project by Alison Saar, was installed on
a 1959 Chevy pickup and driven into 80 neighborhoods in four states
over a period of five months, giving the term ``traveling show'' a
down-home dimension. ``Too Jewish?,'' a show organized by and first
shown at the Jewish Museum in New York, was exhibited in Baltimore
in a vacant shopping mall, a notable instance of art taking up
where commerce leaves off.
</P>
<P>
   This doggedly temporary Contemporary Museum first made a
national name for itself in 1992 when it worked with the Maryland
Historical Society to install Fred Wilson's ``Mining the Museum,''
an ironic look at the neglect of black people and American Indians
in historical displays. A show last spring, ``Mysterious
Voyages/New Photography,'' a bold exploration of the current search
for meaning in photography and art by artists like Sophie Calle,
Adam Fuss, Andreas Gursky and Thomas Struth, was in the vacant
ground floor of a downtown office building three blocks from
Baltimore's red-light district and two from a police station.
Visitor records revealed an audience drawn from both the
surrounding area and the art world; the attempt to reach a local
community must be working.
</P>
<P>
   Sangster says: ``We operate in the discourse of ideas about the
visual. We're not here just to expose artists or artworks but ideas
that influence the community through visual means.'' The
Contemporary asked visitors, including some local critics, to write
their own labels for ``Mysterious Voyages''; eventually three were
put up for each piece.
</P>
<P>
   Sangster would now like a more permanent space _ ideally an
aircraft hangar in the middle of Baltimore, if only he could find
one _ to give the museum a stronger identity. In the meantime he is
eyeing the Web, having already done one show on it, as the most
likely means to preserve the explorations of a museum that cannot
afford to publish. The Web, in fact, may be  &UR; the &LR;  outreach museum
of the future, bringing art straight to your desk at any hour.
Numerous museums and galleries beam it into your home right now,
unfortunately at a resolution not much more convincing than the one
you made on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   So what is a museum, and where? It may be whatever a director or
curator says it is, a rather new twist on Marcel Duchamp. Back in
the 1920s, Hannes Meyer, an instructor at the Bauhaus, thought that
museums should all be rededicated as soccer fields. The history of
art takes many curious turns; we may yet live to see soccer fields
rededicated as museums.

ANDREW JOHNSON AND BILL CLINTON: PARALLELS IN THEIR CASES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 10)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the possible exception of Richard Nixon, no
former president has been mentioned in the news as often during the
past year as Andrew Johnson, who succeeded to the nation's highest
office with the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and who, before
Bill Clinton, was the only chief executive ever impeached by the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Yet few Americans know much about Johnson. Until 1998, he was an
obscure figure in history. Now, because of Clinton's impeachment
and trial, analysts are finding a number of parallels between his
life and Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   Like the current president, Johnson was a product of the South.
Also like Clinton, he was reared by a mother who remarried after
the death of her first husband. Both boys knew poverty when they
were small.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson certainly is not listed among the great or near great
presidents. In fact, in most lists he ranks near the bottom, where
Clinton will probably be.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson had an unusual achievement: He is the only president
to serve in the Senate after the end of his White House tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Having been a member of the Senate from 1857 to 1862 and
president from 1865 to 1869, Johnson was returned to the Senate by
the Tennessee legislature in 1875. He died in office two months
later.
</P>
<P>
   When the South seceded from the Union in 1861, Johnson was the
only lawmaker from a Confederate state who remained in the Senate.
A Democrat, he had supported the presidential bid of Democrat John
C. Breckinridge of Kentucky in 1860 against Republican Abraham
Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   But once it became clear that Lincoln had won, Johnson,
according to historians, electrified the Senate when he declared:
``Though I fought against Lincoln, I love my country. I love the
Constitution and swear that it and the Union shall be saved, as
`Old Hickory' Jackson did in 1832. Senators, my blood _ my
existence _ I would give to save this Union.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, there was an ironic parallel between Johnson's
career and that of Andrew Jackson, the idol he referred to.
Jackson, in vetoing the charter of the second Bank of the United
States in 1832, incurred the animosity of business and banking
leaders in the eastern half of the nation. For that action, he was
censured by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jackson censure was later expunged from the record.
Johnson, after being impeached by the House, was saved by a single
vote from a guilty verdict in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators who oppose censure for Clinton, preferring that the
Senate find him guilty of impeachable offenses, point to the
Jackson experience to substantiate their contention that censure
would merely be a slap on the wrist that could be eradicated from
the record when Democrats reclaim control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was not an evil man, although he reportedly had a
fondness for liquor and was somewhat intoxicated when he was sworn
in as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   His is a classic American story of a poor, uneducated boy who
taught himself to read and write and diligently worked his way up
to the highest office in the land.
</P>
<P>
   As teen-agers, Johnson and his brother William became indentured
servants, bound by law to work as apprentice tailors for a man in
Raleigh, N.C., who would provide them with food and clothing and
teach them the tailoring trade.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, they broke their bond and escaped to Carthage,
N.C., where Andrew Johnson made money as a tailor. Later, they
moved to Greenevillle, Tenn., where Andrew married 16-year-old
Eliza McCardle, who bore him five children and helped him learn
reading, spelling and math.
</P>
<P>
   While still in his 20s, Johnson was elected mayor of
Greeneville. From that office, he began a steady political
progression that saw him serve in both houses of the state
legislature and become a U.S. senator, vice president and then
president.
</P>
<P>
   Although Johnson was a Democrat and Lincoln was a Republican,
Lincoln chose him for vice president in 1864 to strengthen his bid
for a second term. Two years earlier, Lincoln had appointed Johnson
as military governor of Tennessee, which had been reclaimed by
union forces.
</P>
<P>
   A month and eight days after Lincoln's second inaugural, the
president was shot and Johnson succeeded to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's No. 1 priority was to protect the Union. It was not to
extend constitutional rights to freed black slaves or to deal
harshly with the defeated Confederacy. He wanted to follow
Lincoln's policy of restoring full legal status to white residents
of Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was considered a traitor in the South, he became
embroiled in a bitter power struggle with Congress, which was
dominated by radical Republicans who were determined to punish the
South.
</P>
<P>
   Congress was just as determined as Johnson to dominate
Reconstruction policy.
</P>
<P>
   Over Johnson's veto, it passed in 1868 the ``Tenure of Office
Act'' that denied that president the right to remove certain
government officials, including Cabinet officers, without Senate
approval. Johnson immediately violated the law by firing Secretary
of War Edwin Stanton, a powerful leader of the Radical Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The House swiftly voted 11 articles of impeachment and the
Senate trial began. But after all the charges and counter charges
had filled the atmosphere with venom, seven moderate Republicans
joined Democrats to save Johnson from conviction and ouster.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson served out the remaining eight months of his term and
returned to Tennessee, where in 1875 he once more became a senator.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the current Clinton case, the fight against Johnson did
not involve perjury and obstruction of justice. It was purely a
political battle over power. But then as now, political
polarization poisoned the process. That is yet another parallel
between the 17th and 42nd presidents.

DOW JONES SURGES TOWARD THE MYTHICAL 10,000 MARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ American investors disregarded impeachment worries
and profit concerns Wednesday to send the US stock market to new
highs, with the Dow Jones industrial average edging ever closer to
the mythical 10,000-mark.
</P>
<P>
   Investors poured year-end bonuses and the gains of previous
deals into the market creating an upward cycle of money chasing
money that lifted the Dow 233.78 points, or 2.5 percent, to a
record 9544.97, its first time ever above the 9500 level. Other,
broader market measures were also up.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the sharp rise in share prices reflected renewed
confidence in the market's and the economy's ability to grow, a
marked turn-about from the fears of last fall when it appeared that
the financial system might be headed for a crack-up.
</P>
<P>
   But in the very swiftness of its rise, the market left many
investment professionals uneasy Wednesday, fearful of being left
behind, but also unable to justify the prices being paid for many
of the hottest stocks, especially Internet shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a capitulation to exuberance,'' said Richard B. Hoey,
chief economist and equity research director at $120
billion-Dreyfus Corp. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are throwing money at the market. It's kind of scary,''
said Thomas M. O'Neill, chief investment officer with the $60
billion Fleet Financial Advisors in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there was some good economic news during the day.
The government said that new home sales reached record levels in
November, and General Motors, Toyota and Honda posted
stronger-than-expected auto sales for December. Both are signs that
the American consumer, who some economists had worried was tapped
out, is continuing to buy at a furious pace, a trend that's likely
to keep the economy growing for some time.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, analysts said there are few signs of economic
trouble that could act as a damper on investors, and what few there
are can be easily handled by policymakers at the Federal Reserve.
``What you've got is an economy that will not roll over and play
dead,'' John F. MacNeil, an equities strategist with Salomon Smith
Barney in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts conceded that the presence of good economic news
and the abense of bad is hardly enough to explain stocks' latest
rise. Neither is Corporate America's profit picture.
</P>
<P>
   Although the profits of companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
stock index grew during the September-through-December quarter, an
improvement over their June-through-August performance when they
shrank, Charles L. Hill, research director of First Call Corp. in
Boston, said that the growth was almost certainly less than four
percent. That's anemic compared to the 20 percent-plus quarterly
growth during much of the decade, and there is little reason to
expect much improvement this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be lucky to make in the 4 percent range,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Without economics or profit growth to point to, most analysts
fell back on some varient of the money-chasing-money explanation
for Wednesday's market climb, and several expressed reservations
about the trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about earnings; it's not about dodging a slowdown
in the global economy,'' Robert Froehlich, chief investment
strategist for Scudder Kemper Investments told Bloomberg News.
``You put more money into this market and the market's going to go
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans traditionally pump money into investments in January
as they receive year-end bonuses and make decisions about their
retirement plans. A new report suggested that as in te recent past
a substantial fraction is going into stocks.
</P>
<P>
   For a third week running, investors shoveled money into US stock
funds, according to Trimtabs.com, a California research firm that
tracks fund flows. About $3.13 billion in new money went into stock
funds in the week ended Monday, or about the same as the $3.16
billion the previous week, Trimtabs said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, much of the new money in the market has gone to
shares of a few large companies, a trend that worries some who say
that it shows that many investors are looking for safe havens. Much
of the rest has gone into wildly speculative Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said there was some evidence Wednesday that cautious
investors are beginning to venture beyond big company shares as
virtually all market indexes rose.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Dow, the S&AMP;P 500 Index gained 27.56 points,
or 2.2 percent, to close at a record 1272.34. The Nasdaq Composite
Index rose 69.59 points, or 3.1 percent, to close at a record
2320.86. Even the Russell 2000 Index of smaller stocks, which
trailed the broader market last year, climbed 5.70 points, or 1.4
percent, to close at 427.79.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the investment spectrum, there were few
signs of speculative investors cooling to Internet shares, an
enthusiasm that has many investment professionals worried. Shares
of Amazon.com, the on-line bookseller jumped 13 1/2 to 138 while
those of CMGI Inc., a firm that invests in Internet companies in
hopes of taking them public, lept more than $30 to 151.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the greater-fool theory of investing,'' said Scott Black,
president of Delphi Management in Boston. ``Total speculation, a
``casino mentality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the greatest mania I've ever seen in my career,'' added
Fleet's O'Neill.

EISNER'S BONUS CUT TO $5 MILLION AS DISNEY PROFITS WEAKEN 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla.)   By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney Co., is about to have
his bonus cut in half, to $5 million from $9.9 million, because of
the company's weak performance in the 1998 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would revamp the formula that determines the
bonus but did not elaborate on a new formula, saying only that it
planned to submit a revised plan for shareholder approval and that
nothing would be carried out until the 2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner's $750,000-a-year salary and his bonus have never been
the chief source of his wealth. His stock options, however, made
him hundreds of millions of dollars, and he always said he had
preferred to benefit if the company had done well. Disney's
performance in 1998 was weak compared with previous years, with net
profit rising just 4 percent, to $1.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner joined the company in 1984, and Disney's stock soared
until recently. Faced with problems at its ABC television network,
among other issues, however, Disney's stock closed Wednesday at
$30.9375, down from its high of nearly $42.80 in May.
</P>
<P>
   Although some critics have said the size of Eisner's option
grant was incredibly rich, the company made no mention Wednesday of
changes in his stock-option plan. In the 1997 calendar year, Eisner
exercised options on 21.9 million shares for a profit of $550
million. He still holds options on 24 million shares. The so-called
strike price of the options _ the price he will pay when he is able
to claim them _ is $21.18 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner has a incentive to improve performance. He cannot start
to exercise those options before September 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has asked that the bonus formula be renegotiated because
it is based primarily on earnings per share. It appears that Eisner
benefited significantly because of the increase in earnings per
share after the company bought Capital Cities/ABC Inc. in 1996. He
now has the potential to benefit from last year's purchase of a 43
percent stake in Infoseek &UR;  &LR; because it could also improve earnings
per share. The company said it planned to revamp the bonus, taking
into account that it could be inflated by an acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner, however, will not have to give back any of his 1997
bonus, a company spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to shareholders in the company's annual report,
Eisner also said the company's performance in its fiscal year ended
Sept. 30 was affected by key strategic investments and new
initiatives that would raise profits ``down the road.''

FIDELITY FILES TO LAUNCH THRIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual fund
firm, hopes to launch a federally chartered thrift, according to
documents filed Wednesday with regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's parent, FMR Corp., filed papers with the Office of
Thrift Supervision in Washington to open a Boston-based bank called
Fidelity Personal Trust Co. The institution would not be a
full-purpose traditional bank making loans and the like; instead,
it would serve to allow Boston-based Fidelity to grow its trust
business, which caters to wealthy investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always look for ways to enhance the service we provide our
trust customers, and this is a first step in that process,''
Fidelity spokesman Jim Griffin said.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity is the latest financial services outfit to seek to
launch a thrift. From insurers to former bank executives looking to
go it alone, financial players have deluged regulators in recent
years with applications to open thrifts, which are subject to
different regulations than savings banks. Insurance companies are
especially keen on the move: the nation's largest insurer,
Travelers Corp., which is merging with Citibank to form Citigroup,
applied to set up a thrift last year.
</P>
<P>
   Among asset management firms, however, thrift charters are
relatively rare.
</P>
<P>
   Thrifts are no longer synonomous with the costly, failed savings
and loans of the 1980s. As the regulatory walls separating banks,
asset management firms, insurers, and brokerages come tumbling
down, financial companies are looking for new ways to offer a
broader array of services. Under a thrift charter, a company can
more easily offer trust and other services in different states.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, which manages around $715.9 billion in assets and has
14.4 million customers, hopes to boost fund sales and other
revenues by capturing a greater portion of the new wealth generated
this decade.
</P>

   ``When you look at Fidelity's empire building, setting up a
thrift is probably more the result of them looking for a new
business opportunity,'' said Jim Lowell, editor of the independent
Fidelity Investor newslettter.
</P>
<P>
   The company's application may draw fire from critics of the
mutual fund behemoth. Fidelity said its thrift, like other small
banks, would not have to make the community investments required of
more traditional banks under Federal law.

INVESTIGATORS STUMPED IN DOG POISONINGS; REWARD UPPED 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ Law enforcement officials remained stumped Wednesday by
the post-Christmas poisonings of six dogs in Milton, a Boston
suburb, prompting an animal humane society to increase the reward
in the case to $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are kind of getting frustrated that no one has come forward
yet with any solid leads,'' said Robert Fennessey, deputy director
of law enforcement for the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals. ``People have just called and given their
opinions who might have done this.''
</P>
<P>
   The $6,000 reward, which was increased Wednesday from $4,000
with contributions from other humane societies and an MSPCA
emergency fund, is the largest in the society's 130-year history,
Fennessey said.
</P>
<P>
   Five dogs died and another was seriously injured Dec. 26 after
eating meatballs believed to have been laced with
strychnine-treated seeds left in the yards of their homes in the
Pope's Pond neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   State pesticide regulators said the sale and use of products
containing strychnine have been outlawed in Massachusetts for 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Oats and grains treated with the highly toxic chemical had been
commonly used to rid orchards and farms of crop-raiding rodents,
said Steven Antunes-Kenyon, toxicologist at the Massachusetts
Pesticide Bureau. But the products were eventually banned because
they also attracted and killed birds.
</P>
<P>
   Antunes-Kenyon said unused products were supposed to be returned
to retailers once the prohibition went into effect, but it was
impossible to know if everyone complied. According to Fennessey,
the products have a 100-year shelf life.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the dog owners said Wednesday they would hold a rally at
a neighborhood park Jan. 17 to express community outrage over the
poisonings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody will let their dogs out anymore,'' said Gerald
Kawadler, whose dog, Lucy, was the only one to survive the
poisonings but whose daughter's two dogs were killed. ``Everyone is
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   (Anyone with information in the case should contact the MSPCA at
1-800-628-5808 or Milton police at 617-698-COPS. Donations toward
the reward fund or to help defray the cost of the investigation may
be sent to the MSPCA, 350 South Huntington Ave., Boston, MA 02130.)

has earned a reputation as a ``nice guy.'' He knows how to listen,
stifles his temper and keeps his word, which is why he swiftly
received the backing of moderate Republicans and conservatives
alike. But, no matter how congenial and hard working, Hastert,
faces a daunting double-barreled challenge: He comes to the job of

RAYTHEON WORKERS UNHAPPY WITH UNION LEADERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS AND ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Almost three years after angry Raytheon Co. workers
voted in new union officials, dissatisfaction within Local 1505 of
the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers has led to a
backlash against those leaders and a labor board complaint alleging
misrepresentation.
</P>
<P>
   Already, five months before the union's scheduled election in
June, one former Raytheon employee has openly declared plans to run
for president, a seat vacated recently when Arthur Osborn Jr.
stepped down to take a management job at the company. In addition,
at least one employee has indicated plans to challenge incumbent
business manager Michael Zagami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of hearing, `The company says, the company says.'
The company has always said, but the union used to say, `No,' ''
said 36-year-old Janet Griffin, a laid-off worker who kept her dues
current so she would be eligible to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Added George Noel, a 41-year-old radar tester who intends to run
for business manager: ``The company doesn't take us seriously, and
the grievance procedure is a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Noel feels Zagami has grown too close to the company's
management. He also said Osborn's decision to take a managerial
position with the Lexington defense contractor was particularly
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's announcement in October that about 1,200 workers
would be laid off and the Waltham plant would be shut has
contributed to the members' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 19 Raytheon employees, transferred from the company's
printed wire fabrication unit to the advanced device center after
the unit's work was shipped to Texas, have filed a
misrepresentation claim with the National Labor Relations Board in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Filed in November, the complaint alleges the union violated a
provision in its 1995 to 1998 contract guaranteeing seniority
rights to workers targeted for reassignment, reclassification, or
layoff because of changes at the $20 billion industrial giant.
</P>
<P>
   The workers contend that people with less seniority were given
positions they should have received, violating their seniority
rights. They also blame Zagami for a letter of intent that amended
the contract language to allow for the change.
</P>
<P>
   Zagami was traveling and at meetings this week and did not
respond to several attempts to reach him at the union office in
Bedford. Raytheon spokeswoman Toni Simonetti also declined to
discuss the complaint. ``We have not been in receipt of this
complaint and feel we cannot comment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Employees maintain the changes occurred after Raytheon's $9.5
billion purchase of Hughes Aircraft, a division of General Motors
Corp.'s Hughes Electronics Corp. After the purchase, Raytheon
developed what it calls ``centers of excellence,'' including a
center for printed wire fabrication that consolidated the work in
Texas. As a result, workers in Massachusetts who had held a ``B''
or a ``C'' classification in that unit found they were about to
lose their jobs. Under the contract, however, they should have been
permitted to ``bump'' or displace less senior workers, they claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a situation where a lot of these people had bumping
rights, but they were prevented from exercising them because the
union agreed to a letter of intent or an amendment to the
contract,'' said Noel, a former steward. As a result, some of the
``B'' classified workers wound up in a lower classification, with
less pay.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin gave up her union steward job last year prior to being
laid off, to protest what she described this week as an unfair
change in seniority. She said the action contributed to tensions
within the local, which has been ravaged by a series of layoffs in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin also has a grudge: She was suspended from the union last
year for wearing a T-shirt that said, ``No Zagami, Yes to
Seniority,'' when John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, visited
workers at the Andover plant.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1996, however, workers ousted business manager Joseph
Kelleher, who had battled hard to keep defense jobs from leaving
the state, because of anger over concessions. Now, their anger is
directed at Zagami and Osborn.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Guthrie, a Raytheon electrician who plans to support Noel
in his bid for business manager, is upset about Osborn's recent
switch to management. He believes it raises questions about the
loyalty of Local 1505's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an apparent betrayal,'' he said. ``We have got to demand
more from our leaders. I think they should take a pledge'' against
making such moves to management in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do their loyalties lie?'' asked Guthrie.

<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda _ Congolese rebel leaders admitted late Wednesday
night that some of their soldiers had killed about 400 Hutu
militiamen last week, but denied that they had massacred 500
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday a Roman Catholic news agency reported that rebel
soldiers had shot and hacked to death hundreds of people, many of
them women, children and elderly people, in eastern Congo over
three days ending Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, confusion over the incident only widened, though
it does appear that something happened near Uvira, on the western
shore of Lake Tanganyika not far from Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   The Missionary Service News Agency, which originally reported
the killings, said the violence began when rebels were kidnapped
along Lake Tanganyika and forced to help unload weapons that came
ashore for fighters loyal to President Laurent Kabila. Several of
the rebels were killed, the agency said in a report based on a
survivor's account.
</P>
<P>
   The news agency said a larger rebel group then attacked
Makobola, near the lake in the Kivu region, because residents there
were believed to have helped the pro-Kabila fighters who had
kidnapped their comrades.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day a leader of the rebels, Ernest Wanba dia
Wanba, said he would investigate the news service's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is true, then those responsible will be punished,''
Wanba, president of the rebel group, the Congolese Rally for
Democracy, told reporters Wednesday in Goa, in eastern Congo. ``But
we cannot say if it's true or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Wednesday night the rebels released a statement denying an
attack on civilians. Rather, the statement said, the killings were
the result of a military engagement with forces they accused of
attacking from Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no civilian victims in the course of the
fighting,'' the statement read.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels' explanation contradicted accounts by some leaders
Tuesday that the area has been quiet recently.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation, if true, would also represent a continuation of
the deadly and seemingly endless clashes between members of the
Tutsi ethnic group, which is the driving force behind the Congo
rebellion, and the Hutu.
</P>
<P>
   Neither account, from the missionaries or the rebels, has been
verified by any outside authority.
</P>
<P>
   But Emmanuel Nzahiro, a spokesman for the Rwandan Defense
Ministry, strongly denied that any Rwandan soldiers could have been
involved in any massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no military personnel in that area,'' he said. ``We
can only wait to hear from the others what they find out from the
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, backed by Rwanda and Uganda, are an increasingly
divided group of Congolese soldiers, former officials in the Kabila
government and former loyalists to Mobutu Sese Seko, the longtime
dictator of Congo when it was called Zaire.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila is supported by Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad. And
just as the rebels are supported by ethnic Tutsi, Kabila is largely
supported by Hutu. He has also gained backing among factions of the
Mayi-Mayi warriors, a loose band with no particular ethnic
allegiance.

LEARNING TO LIVE WITH THE EURO GLYPH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PHIL PATTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trading in the euro, the first common European currency since
the Roman Empire, began on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Europe seems to be proving that it can smoothly draw on
euro bank accounts, but drawing the euro symbol on a yellow pad or
a computer screen is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   The new currency is represented by a symbol the European Union's
monetary commission calls the ``euro glyph.''
</P>
<P>
   The euro is the first currency in history designed for
electronic transactions. Actual coins and bills won't be used until
2002 _ the euro glyph is a combination of curves and 80-degree
angles that resembles a ``C'' crossed with an equal sign. For
ordinary folk, simply rendering the glyph is as much of a challenge
as adapting computers to track its value in local currencies.
</P>
<P>
   The symbols for most currencies are rooted in history. But the
euro glyph was handed down by secretive European Union bureaucrats
fully formed, instant and anonymous. The basic shape is clear and
recognizable enough. It shares a family resemblance with other
monetary symbols, like the dollar and pound, letters made into
symbols.
</P>
<P>
   The glyph's shape, the European Union officially declares,
evokes epsilon, the Greek ancestor of ``e'' and a tribute to the
birthplace of European civilization. The parallel strokes evoke
stability. The strokes end in angles that lend dynamism to the
shape, as well as a vaguely gothic effect.
</P>
<P>
   The symbol is aimed to transcend language and local reference
and serve throughout what the monetary commission calls not Europe
but ``the euro zone'' or ``euro land.''
</P>
<P>
   Most computers can't display the glyph. While Windows 98 has the
euro glyph in three of its basic fonts, few users will be able to
find it. In the current issue of ID magazine, Peter Hall voices the
complaints of graphic designers and typographers that the
character's design is too wide and too specific to fit computer
fonts.
</P>
<P>
   A British company called Eurotype sells a euro add-on for
Windows to make any key you choose print the glyph. Adobe Systems
is devising a glyph for its fonts. The Financial Times has come up
with a thinner, more upright version that looks like a seahorse.
</P>
<P>
   If the glyph designers were thinking little of computer
keyboards, they were thinking even less of the local retailer. Most
grocery stores and cash registers use the letters EUR for prices.
Computers do the same, and the lack of a glyph key is not a problem
for online transactions in the new currency. But consider the
vegetable vendor with chalk in hand, scribbling the day's prices
for artichokes or arugula.
</P>
<P>
   The symbols of and on our money engage in a complex interplay
with language, especially slang. We get greenbacks and, from the
noble Roman ``X'' on old $10 bills came the sawbuck and, in turn,
the buck. The strange almost cursive-style ``L'' of the pound
symbol comes from Libra, the balance, and suggests the intonations
of weight and solidity that make the pound sterling as dear to
British hearts as beef or beefeaters.
</P>
<P>
   But the euro's references lack this vernacular history. They are
conscious and calculated _ it's a post-modernist glyph, as if
dreamed up by semiologists from academe. Company logos once
commonly derived from some visual element of the business _ a bell
or bolt of electricity. The euro arrives with the feel of the logo
of a company that comes out of a megamerger or corporate
reinvention _ a Lucent or Unisys _ the logo of euro land.
</P>
<P>
   But a currency needs a symbol, not a logo, a mark people can
scrawl or adapt. The glyph will turn into such a symbol, but only
by defiance of the official specifications, just as local and
personal differences will survive the templates of the euro zone.
Therein, perhaps, lies a model of how the whole new European system
is likely to work: rules made continentally, adapted locally.

THERE MAY BE A SEASON, BUT WILL MICHAEL BE PART OF IT?  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the big question of whether there will be a National
Basketball Association season has been settled, one more big
question remains:
</P>
<P>
   Will there be an NBA season with Michael Jordan, perhaps the
best player ever and certainly the highest paid?
</P>
<P>
   Even before the 191-day lockout of the players by the owners
ended Wednesday, there were questions whether Jordan, who will turn
36 on February 17, would return for his 14th pro season or, as he
has often hinted, retire. Jordan is a free agent, and David Falk,
the all-powerful agent for Jordan and other NBA stars, said Jordan
had not decided yet whether he would play for the Bulls or anyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   Falk did not say where Jordan was, and no one else seemed sure.
While outlining a course of action for Jordan, Falk gave no clue on
what Jordan would decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is out of the country right now,'' Falk said. ``When he has
an opportunity to review the deal, see what direction the Bulls are
taking and look into his own heart, he'll make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't speculate on the timetable. I think Michael is the
only human being who knows. Any speculation that a short season
dictates he'll play or retire would be like reading tea leaves. I
think Michael would still like to play, but I think a number of
things have to coalesce in order for him to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no gut feeling on it. He has to make whatever decision
makes him happy, and I'll support whatever decision he makes. He
needs to see what the rules of the new agreement are so he can see
what the big picture looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jordan wants to play, the money will certainly be there. Last
year, the Bulls paid him $33 million, the highest one-year salary
for any athlete in any sport, and he earned an additional $40
million or more from commercial endorsements, notably McDonald's,
Nike, MCI WorldCom and Gatorade.
</P>
<P>
   The collective bargaining agreement reached Wednesday allows a
team to pay any player 105 percent of his previous season's salary.
That would allow the Bulls to pay Jordan $34.7 million for a full
season or, if this season is trimmed to 50 or so games, a pro-rated
salary of $22 million.
</P>
<P>
   Th 6-foot-6-inch Jordan is probably America's best-known
athlete. He has led the Bulls to six NBA championships in the
1990s, three in the last three seasons. He has won 10 scoring
titles plus five most-valuable-player awards during the regular
season and six in the playoff finals.
</P>
<P>
   Some friends, including Charles Barkley of the Houston Rockets,
say Jordan has indicated he will retire. He retired once, sitting
out the 1993-94 season for an uneventful minor league baseball
career. And in June, after the Bulls had won their most recent
title, he said, ``I wouldn't miss it at all, as much as you may
think.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is known to be upset that Phil Jackson, who coached the
Bulls to those championships, is no longer there, and he fears that
the Bulls will not make strong efforts to keep Scottie Pippen and
Dennis Rodman, both free agents. In all, the Bulls have nine
unsigned free agents and only four signed veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league could survive without him,'' said Bill Wennington,
the Bulls' center and also a free agent, ``but it would really be a
setback. ``People love to watch him play. I love to watch him
play.''

FORMER ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF ANNOUNCES CHALLENGE TO NETANYAHU 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, the telegenic former army chief
of staff, formally announced his centrist candidacy for prime
minister on Wednesday, casting his first dart, a particularly
pointed one, at the incumbent, Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netanyahu is dangerous for Israel,'' he said, the harsh words
emanating from a casual, genial man dressed in an open-neck shirt
and sports jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Shahak's announcement was a sore disappointment to Labor Party
leaders. They failed to persuade him to join forces with them
despite the intervention of President Ezer Weizman and Leah Rabin,
the widow of Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister who was assassinated
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But based on polls, Shahak, 54, believes his chances of beating
Netanyahu are stronger than those of the Labor Party leader, Ehud
Barak. And Shahak's colleagues said defeating Netanyahu is
sincerely and urgently important to him.
</P>
<P>
   With no party, no platform and no experience, Shahak is a wild
card in what now cannot be the traditional Israeli race between
conservative Likud and liberal Labor candidates. He is very popular
here at least partly because he has never before been sullied by
politics, and partly because he radiates the decent integrity of a
favorite type: the citizen-soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Tel Aviv at a news conference broadcast live on both
Israeli television channels, Shahak introduced his political self
in military terms _ as a civilian ``recruited'' to the ``mission''
of defending Israel, this time from internal battles, divisions
that he said Netanyahu exploited for political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here today because I am worried,'' he said. ``How did it
happen that in this wonderful country of ours, in which we were
able to do so many good and proper things, that we became torn by
internal differences, hatred and violence? How is it that hope
drifted away?
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past two and a half years, since Benjamin Netanyahu was
elected prime minister, those differences, legitimate as they may
be, became an abyss of hatred. Secular against religious, veterans
against newcomers, Ashkenazi against Sephardi, right against left _
a country in war, in war with itself, an internal war that could
bring disaster if we do not stop it in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Shahak went on to paint a picture of a nation overcome by a wave
of lawlessness, intolerance and violence. He cited the bias murder
of an immigrant soldier, the high rate of car accidents, even
wife-beating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you noticed that people on the street are not smiling as
much?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shahak is clearly calculating that the Israeli public is
exhausted and upset by the vociferous internal struggles, and wants
at least the uplift of healing words.
</P>
<P>
   What he revealed of his politics did not seem very different
from those of Labor, particularly on foreign policy issues. He said
he believed the peace effort must move forward, and that only a
negotiated solution with Syria could permit the Israeli Army to
withdraw from Lebanon. But on social issues his emphasis was
somewhat different. He went out of his way, for instance, to
underscore how important he considers immigrants to Israel's
economy and well-being.
</P>
<P>
   But he sharply criticized Labor for a being a dinosaur party,
aiming squarely for what Labor, in trying to remake itself as ``the
New Labor,'' believes to be its Achilles' heel _ a perception that
it is elite and out of touch with young, Sephardic, Russian and
religious voters.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's advisers have reportedly counseled him to steer
clear of attacks on Shahak. Wednesday his Health Minister, Yehoshua
Matza, defended him, branding Shahak as a leftist and accusing him
of ``inciting'' against the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Shahak trouncing Netanyahu in the second round of
voting if he survives the first against Barak. The elections are to
be held on May 17, and it is probable there will be a runoff on
June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders, too, are uncomfortable with the thought of going
after Shahak, especially since any center-left government would
probably see them linking forces. But in the first round of voting
he is their competition, and so the barbed assessments of his
inexperience began lobbing his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Shahak on the phone,'' Yossi Beilin, a senior
member of the Labor Party, said in an interview earlier this week.
``I said, `I really respect you and like you, but we're going to
have to go after you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a contradiction between his appearance as a modest
person and his ambition to be prime minister in his first bid for
elected office, no? It takes a lot of experience and finesse to
manage the political body in this country, but maybe he doesn't
know this, like the kid who pulls at the tail of the cute little
Rottweiler and doesn't know he is danger''
</P>
<P>
   Disarmingly to some, Shahak conceded that he has ``no political
experience, that is true.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he made it clear that he would present that as a
selling point. ``I am not a politician,'' he said. ``But I didn't
land here from another planet, either.''

DESPITE TALK OF BIPARTISANSHIP, BICKERING OPENS NEW HOUSE SESSION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Mo., N.J.)  (See also IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-SCENE, IMPEACH-LOTT, IMPEACH-STARR,
HOUSE-HASTERT, CONGRESS-ETHICS, CONGRESS-NY and IMPEACH-JOHNSON) 
(js) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Dennis Hastert was sworn in as the 51st
speaker of the House Wednesday and immediately tried to set a tone
that would salve the destructive politics that have paralyzed the
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Solutions to problems cannot be found in a pool of
bitterness,'' the 57-year-old Illinois Republican said as the new
Congress convened and he sought to treat the House's wounds, left
raw by the tumultuous tenure of his predecessor, Newt Gingrich, and
by last month's near-party-line vote to impeach President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats responded warmly to the tone that Hastert set
Wednesday and in his 18-day run-up to becoming speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's bury the hatchet,'' Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the
Democratic leader, said as he presented the gavel to Hastert.
``Let's put to rest the poisonous politics which have infected this
place.''
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as the curtain fell on the day's formal ceremonies,
the parties lapsed back to their old bickering. They squabbled over
proposed changes in House rules, which Democrats said watered down
their rights as the minority party. Republicans quashed a
Democratic attempt to boost their representation on committees to
reflect the same ratio of Democrats to Republicans that has been
elected to the full House. All votes ran strictly along party
lines.
</P>
<P>
   But the real fury between the parties erupted as Democrats
sought to re-hash last month's bitter impeachment debate and even
overturn the outcome. The venue was discussion over a requirement
that the new House sworn in Wednesday reappoint the 13 Republicans
that the old House appointed last year to act as prosecutors in the
impeachment trial of Clinton in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans tried to treat the measure as a mere housekeeping
matter. But Democrats took it as a chance to reassert to the nation
that the Republicans' vote to impeach the president was highly
unpopular with the public and only demonstrated that in their zeal
to punish the president, the Republicans were ignoring more
important issues.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., led the way, warning the House that
a vote to reappoint the managers ``would be tantamount to voting to
remove the president from office.'' As Democrats monopolized the
floor, Rep. Steven Rothman, D-N.J., declared: ``This impeachment
should never have occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   But after debate, the House voted 223-198 to reappoint the
managers, with 218 Republicans and five Democrats _ the same five
who voted for impeachment last month _ voting in favor. Opposing
the measure were 197 Democrats, one Independent and no Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The squabbling was a sign of what some say will be the real
guiding principle of this Congress _ the narrowness of the
Republican majority. With Gingrich's resignation from Congress
Wednesday afternoon, there are 222 Republicans, 211 Democrats, one
Independent who leans Democratic and one vacancy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gingrich's seat in his heavily Republican suburban-Atlanta
district is to be filled in a special election Feb. 23. Robert
Livingston, who had been chosen to follow Gingrich as speaker but
is quitting Congress in the wake of his acknowledgment of
adulterous affairs, is leaving in six months.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their differences, the parties quickly agreed on one
piece of legislation _ to relax their self-imposed restrictions on
accepting gifts from lobbyists. They have been chafing since 1996
over their rule that they could accept gifts only from family and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday they adopted by voice vote the same language that
guides the Senate, allowing members to accept gifts up to $50 from
lobbyists, with an annual $100 limit on items from any single
source. They left in place a loophole that allows private
organizations to sponsor both foreign and domestic travel by
members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But the message of the day was bipartisanship and a kind of
back-to-basics value system. Shucking the loftiness of his new
position and showing his affinity with the rank and file from which
he had emerged, Hastert stepped down from the podium and delivered
his 17-minute acceptance speech from the floor. It ran half the
length of Gingrich's acceptance speech in 1995 and was void of
Gingrich's high-blown oratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stalemate is not an option,'' he said in vowing to meet
Democrats at least half-way. ``Solutions are.''
</P>
<P>
   He made no mention of impeachment, although he was one of the
Republicans to vote for it on Dec. 19. Instead, he called on
Clinton to work with him on saving Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they went back to battle on the House floor, members of
both parties said that Hastert's speech had pointed them in the
right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm encouraged because I know Dennis Hastert,'' said Rep.
Henry Waxman, D-Calif. ``The rancor and raw partisanship and
nastiness to which the House sunk in December shocked members of
both parties. And I think that many on both sides of the aisle want
to start reaching out to deal with the issues that voters sent us
here to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., said, ``Members are tired of not
getting enough work done. We all have issues, we all have bills we
think will help the people we represent and we want to see them
considered!''

 &HT;    Chairman of Rich's unit will leave Federated
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_Russell Stravitz will end a 30-year career with
Federated Department Stores, stepping down as chairman of its
Atlanta-based Rich's/Lazarus Goldsmith's division, the company said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stravitz will be replaced by Arnold Orlick, who has been
president and chief operating officer of the division since May
1997. The change is effective Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Taking Orlick's position is Edwin J. Holman, known as a
tenacious numbers man who will likely boost efficiency and
productivity in the Rich's/Lazarus Goldsmith's division.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the consummate operations executive. He's going to get
goods to the floor faster and improve logistics at every level,''
said colleague Bob Mang, chief executive of Monet Group, a New
York-based costume jewelry manufacturer. Mang and Holman ran former
Washington, D.C., retailer Woodward &AMP; Lothrop during its
reorganization in the mid-1990s. Federated nearly bought the chain
in 1995 following bankruptcy proceedings, but was outbid by May
Department Stores and J.C. Penney Co.
</P>
<P>
   Holman was most recently chairman and chief executive of Petrie
Retail Inc., a Secaucus, N.J.-based women's apparel chain that
operated stores under the Stuarts and Marianne nameplates. In 1996,
Holman was brought in to shepherd bankruptcy proceedings Petrie
began the previous year. Petrie recently liquidated.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues do not characterize Holman as a ``slash and burn''
type, but they do expect him to further trim expenses under a
Federated model that is already cost-conscious.
</P>
<P>
   Rich's, along with the nearly identical Lazarus and Goldsmith's
chains, is Federated's third-largest division behind Macy's East
and Macy's West. Rich's currently has 13 stores in metro Atlanta.
The division operates 75 stores in the Southeast and Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Stravitz's departure was no surprise to Prudential Securities
analyst Wayne Hood, who noted that beyond divisional leadership
posts, opportunities at Federated are limited. ``I think
opportunities outside the company will be more challenging for
him,'' Hood said.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Rich's division since 1993, Stravitz has
overseen a new strategy and major remodelings in metro Atlanta to
help the chain better compete with specialty retailers, discounters
and a growing consumer demand for brand name apparel.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Stravitz was executive vice president and a merchandise
manager at Federated's Bloomingdale's division in New York, where
he began his career in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Stravitz, 50, indicated he was taking a break from the retail
track to spend time with his family before making his next
professional move.
</P>
<P>
   Other management changes at Federated:
</P>
<P>
   -- Ron Klein has been named chairman and chief executive officer
of Stern's, succeeding Matthew D. Serra, who left the division in
September. Klein has been vice chairman and director of stores at
Federated's Macy's East division since February.
</P>
<P>
   -- Peter R. Sachse has been named vice chairman and director of
stores at Macy's East, succeeding Klein. Sachse was executive vice
president/general merchandise manager at Macy's East.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: White House continues wider focus
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago this week, Newt Gingrich appeared before the Cobb
County Chamber of Commerce to outline an ambitious agenda for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming year, the Republican speaker proposed taking
serious steps toward saving Social Security, reforming education
and the tax system and resolving the big questions over health
care. He challenged his listeners to begin thinking much more
long-range about the generational problems that confront the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Roll the tape forward a few weeks and Monica Lewinsky's name
appears.
</P>
<P>
   Roll the tape up to the present and we have Gingrich, his
speakership not only given up but in its second generation of
successor, addressing the future in a much different speech to a
gathering of conservatives in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the most we can hope for,'' Gingrich advised, would
be to block liberal initiatives in Congress and ``set the stage''
for a Republican to get elected president in Y2K. He advised the
assemblage of right-wing notables to adopt a ``do no harm'' policy
for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   The stupendous national opportunity that was missed in the year
between those speeches would be the real story of 1998, if inaction
could qualify as a story.
</P>
<P>
   The big 21st Century problems Gingrich spoke of remain untended.
Instead of thinking over decades, as he urged last year, the
congressional attention span has shrunk to a point where, less than
24 hours before Bill Clinton's impeachment trial was to begin, it
was not clear in the Senate how it will proceed or _ the question
that preoccupies Washington as another year begins _how long it
will take to finish.
</P>
<P>
   What had so much to do with Gingrich's undoing now rests
uncomfortably in the lap of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, who
on the eve of the trial was still struggling to hold the reins on a
process he has been unable to foreshorten.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meanwhile, was announcing the second straight budget
surplus, a projected $76 billion for the coming year, on a day when
the Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&AMP;P 500 all were flirting with record
highs. He spoke as optimistically as Gingrich did a year ago about
reforming social security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say that this task will be too complicated for the
Congress and the administration to achieve,'' the president said,
enlisting his jurors in the great work.
</P>
<P>
   No real progress can be made toward such a goal during an
impeachment trial, of course, and little serious thought seems to
have been given to what the atmosphere will be like after it's
over.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the White House can demonstrate a longer view and
wider focus than the Republican Congress, however, it holds the
political high ground. The most easily dismissed suggestion of the
year so far was that Clinton postpone his Jan. 19 State of the
Union message, a speech that provides a grand opportunity if there
ever was one to draw a contrast between wide and narrow.
</P>
<P>
   The great opportunity to put the nation on a firm footing for
the new century lingers, meanwhile, but health care costs are
creeping back up and the international economic problems that
seemed so threatening a year ago have not eased. Opportunities
don't last forever.

IMPEACHMENT OVERSHADOWS OPENING OF NEW CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The 106th Congress formally opened Wednesday with
the election of Representative Dennis Hastert as House speaker, but
his promises of comity and cooperation were met with immediate
skepticism by Democrats who tried unsuccessfully to halt the Senate
impeachment trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of a new congressional session is normally a time to
put aside partisanship and celebrate the democratic system that
peacefully elects representatives and senators. On the surface,
Wednesday was no different, as House members allowed their children
to roam the floor, with babies bawling and young girls clutching
Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear this was no ordinary opening day as soon as
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt ceremoniously handed the
gavel to Hastert, of Illinois, who was elected speaker 220-205.
Republicans narrowly control the House with 222 seats, while
Democrats have 211, plus one Independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's bury the hatchet,'' Gephardt said. ``Let's put to rest
the poisonous politics that have infected this place.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar sense of unreality pervaded the Senate side. Vice
President Al Gore swore in the senators even as Republican leaders
were meeting to discuss how to proceed with an impeachment trial
that _ if it results in Clinton's conviction _ would make Gore the
new president. Republicans control the Senate 55-45, with a
two-thirds vote necessary to convict and remove the president from
office.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few hours after House leaders vowed cooperation, there
was a heated debate as Democrats tried in vain to prevent
Republicans from re-appointing the 13 House ``managers,'' or
prosecutors, for the Senate trial. While the managers had been
appointed last month by the outgoing 105th Congress,
parliamentarians determined that the new Congress had to vote on
the matter again, partly because funding will be required to pay
their expenses during the trial. Republicans said no such new tally
was needed on the articles of impeachment. The measure to reappoint
the managers was approved 223-198.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the House voted to ease the 1995 gift ban, allowing
members to accept meals and other items up to $50, and up to $100
in gifts from one source per year. The measure is similar to the
gift rules followed in the Senate and was widely supported by House
members who said the existing gift ban was so complicated it was
impossible to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, 57, a former high school teacher and wrestling coach,
kicked off the day's public ceremonies with a speech on the House
floor that few Democrats could find objectionable. He vowed to meet
Democrats more than halfway, pledged to take Clinton's Social
Security reform plan seriously, and declared that ``stalements are
not an option.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Solutions to problems cannot be found in a pool of
bitterness,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   As Democrats filed out of the House chamber, they said they
liked what they heard, noting how moderate Hastert sounded in
comparison to his predecessor, Newt Gingrich, who resigned after
Republicans lost five seats in the November elections. While
Hastert had little choice other than to seek bipartisanship due to
the Republicans' slim majority, many Democrats have said they could
work with him.
</P>
<P>
   But Representative Charles Rangel, a New York Democrat,
underscored the concerns of his party when he wondered aloud
whether Hastert would control the House, or would the House
minority whip, Tom DeLay of Texas, who is widely seen as the
driving force behind the impeachment effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on whether DeLay is pulling the strings,'' Rangel
said. ``I want so badly to be optimistic, but DeLay hasn't given me
any reason for optimism.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative William Delahunt, the Massachusetts Democrat who
sits on the House Judiciary Committee, said there was a ``surreal
quality'' about the day. He welcomed Hastert's words coming after
``we just saw a totally partisan breakdown in terms of this major
constitutional crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, who had Gephardt preside over the House, walked to the
well to deliver his speech. ``Nearly a year ago, President Clinton
came here to give his State of the Union address'' and ``called for
Social Security reform,'' Hastert said. ``This year, I invite him
to return to give us his reform plan. He has my assurance that it
will be taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said his other priorities included Medicare reform,
education, lower taxes and more money for national defense.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from the scene was Gingrich, who resigned both as
speaker and as a House member. Representative Robert L. Livingston
of Louisiana, who initially was tapped to replace Gingrich of
speaker, had stepped aside after admitting to marital infidelity.
He plans to resign from the House later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich was known as an ideological firebrand, who pushed
through parts of the Contract with America after he led the
Republican takeover of the House in the 1994 election. Hastert, by
comparison, is being counted on by his colleagues to be more a
conciliator in the mold of former House Minority Leader Bob Michel,
also of Illinois. Hastert takes control with such a slim majority
that he must worry whether Democrats can pick up the seats
necessary to win back control in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, where members are elected to six-year terms, 34
senators were elected or reelected in 1998, including four new
senators from each party.

 &HT;    Mindspring joins net giants with 400,000 subscriber acquisition
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_MindSpring took a giant step toward becoming a major
Internet player Wednesay with the purchase of Netcom's 400,000-plus
subscriber base.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition will put the Atlanta-based Internet service
provider over the million mark in subscribers and propel it into a
league with some of the Net's biggest names.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite a little pack up there,'' says MindSpring founder
and chairman Charles Brewer referring to the nation's top ISPs,
including AT&AMP;T's WorldNet Service, Earthlink, CompuServe and the
Microsoft Network which all now claim one to two million
subscribers each. America Online leads the pack with 15 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was finalized at 6 a.m. Tuesday and MindSpring
executives including chairman and founder Charles Brewer, president
and COO Michael McQuary and chief financial officer Michael
Misikoff discussed the deal in a 9 a.m. conference call with
analysts who spent most of the question and answer period
congratulating Brewer on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer size of the combined companies will help advance the
company's long term goals, but McQuary says he knows it won't be
smooth sailing to grow that fast and keep customers happy on a
daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The excitement is announcing the acquisition,'' he said in an
interview, ``but it's like watching a duck swimming on the pond. It
looks very elegant on the surface, but you don't realize that under
the water there is a lot of furious paddling.''
</P>
<P>
   It will take some paddling to incorporate the ailing Netcom into
the prosperous MindSpring.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 400,000 dial-up customers, MindSpring also
acquired Netcom's 3,000 commercial Internet accounts and 18,000 Web
hosting customers.
</P>
<P>
   McQuary said the addition of Netcom's Web hosting services
combined with MindSpring's own hosting services will give the
company about 38,000 Web hosting customers, making MindSpring a
player in the SOHO (small office/home office) market.
</P>
<P>
   The sale also includes other assets including leased operations
facilities in San Jose, Calif. and Dallas, Texas. MindSpring also
acquired the U.S. rights to the ``Netcom'' name as well as select
software and equipment. ICG communications retains its network
assets and international ISP customers in Canada, Brazil and Great
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer said the company plans to borrow the money to cover the
deal against cash on hand. Subject to regulatory approval, he said
the deal should close in February.
</P>
<P>
   It's a particularly exciting challenge for Brewer, who says he
was a Netcom customer in the ISP's earliest days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've wanted to jealously buy Netcom for a while, even when
ICG bought it'' a year ago, Brewer said. ``Netcom hasn't grown, nor
has it achieved profitability. I think we can fix that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer says the company's increased size will give it leverage
in areas in which it wants to play. ``I do think it helps,'' he
says. ``It makes us a more credible spokesperson (for the industry)
and it makes us a more attractive partner for the ``last mile''
owners, meaning that cable and telephone companies will view
Mindspring in a different light.
</P>
<P>
   With the Netcom deal, MindSpring finds itself fighting a war on
two fronts. The company may be able to capture the attention of
federal regulators, advertisers and potential business partners
with its new and improved subscriber base. But if it's hunger for
growth, power and influence comes at the expense of the stellar
customer service and ``core values and beliefs'' the company has
built it's reputation upon, MindSpring could lose its impressive
new market share and all the perks that go with it.
</P>
<P>
   McQuary flew to San Jose Tuesday evening for a day of
Bible-thumping with Netcom's 400 employees. ``I'm out here meeting
with employees because it's important to understand how to treat
each other and the customers, as well,'' said McQuary in a phone
interview Wednesday morning. ``It's all going to begin and end with
the customers.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Brewer both say they'll be jetting back and forth to
oversee the transition. They both say that while Atlanta will
always be home, having a presence in Silicon Valley will be a
definite asset.
</P>
<P>
   However the immediate challenge is at the customer level. The
MindSpring executives must devise a way to take Netcom _ a company
with sinking membership and outsourced customer service _ and apply
MindSpring's philosophy of treating employees, customers and
investors with equal measures of respect. McQuary says it will take
some time to ramp up the flagging Netcom to the same levels of
service and support that brought MindSpring its legions of loyal
subscribers and investors.
</P>
<P>
   The company eventually plans to replace Netcom's customer
service operation, which Netcom currently outsources, and begin
adding additional staffers to MindSpring-owned and operated call
centers in Atlanta, Phoenix, Seattle and Harrisburg, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The primary goal is to resurrect Netcom to a top flight ISP
based on MindSpring's emphasis on service and support. However, the
company has no plans to turn Netcom upside down overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Netcom may be a lacking as an ISP, but MindSpring management
knows Netcom is an established Internet brand which, despite its
troubles, still has subscribers who might not want to change
addresses. McQuary says he expects a certain amount of resistance
from Netcom subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netcom was the leader in taking an ISP national,'' McQuary
says. ``So there's also a lesson for MindSpring in this. You have
to constantly work hard and rededicate yourself to your customers.
Being the first pioneer doesn't mean you're going to be the one to
hold on to it.''
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring also will own the Netcom name in the U.S. and plans
to continue using it for now. The company is unsure how it will
fold Netcom into the rest of MindSpring, but it must be done in a
way that makes Netcom customers comfortable, McQuary says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever there is a change of control and your credit card
bill has a new line on it, people will evaluate their options,'' he
says. ``Some of the 400,000 Netcom customers we have won't make the
transititon to MindSpring. But we plan to scramble like crazy to
get those subscribers to know who we are and how we can perform.''
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring execs say, despite the challenges facing them, they
are still interested in growth through acquisition. ``There are
still lots of other opportunities out there,'' McQuary says, ``but
we have to get our arms around this one first. We won't be blind to
other opportunities. We have an appetite to continue doing this.''

 &HT;    MindSpring joins Net giantswith $245 million acquisition
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MindSpring Enterprises joined the ranks of the giants of the
Internet today when it announced the planned purchase of the
domestic consumer base of Netcom from ICG Communications.
MindSpring will pay $215 million in cash as well as $30 million in
MindSpring stock in a deal worth $245 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call today, MindSpring Chairman Charles Brewer
and President Michael McQuary, the Atlanta-based Internet
provider's chief operating officer, talked about the challenges and
opportunities that now face the company.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would give MindSpring about 400,000 individual customer
accounts as well as 3,000 commercial Internet accounts and 18,000
Web hosting customers. The acquisition of San Jose, Calif.-based
Netcom would more than double MindSpring's subscriber base and
place the company on a par in size with Internet giants such as
Earthlink, AT&AMP;T WorldNet and the Microsoft Network, which all claim
more than a million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   America Online is the nation's largest provider with 15 million
paid subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is
expected to be completed during the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this acquisition will put MindSpring over the one
million dial-up subscriber mark,'' said Brewer, the company's
founder. ``It also makes us a larger and more credible spokesperson
and will help the company in its negotiations with cable and phone
companies for last-mile high-speed access as well as a more
attractive potential partner. ...This acquisition is consistent
with our mission to become a major player in the telecommunications
industry of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer also said MindSpring will benefit from having a presence
in Silicon Valley and cited increased marketing opportunities and
affiliations the company could now take advantage of, but he did
not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Netcom was the first Internet provider to cross the half-million
mark. It was founded in 1988. McQuary said the challenge is to
infuse Netcom, an Internet pioneer with flat subscriber growth,
into a growing company with the reputation for service and support
MindSpring is known for.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring stock was up 4 3/4 to 71 5/16 late this morning. ICG
was down 15/16 to 22 3/16.

DISTRIBUTOR ALLEGES COCA-COLA ENTERPRISES USED WIRETAPPING AND
OTHER TACTICS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Md., Ark.)  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In court papers disclosed this week, Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.,
the world's largest Coca-Cola bottler, is accused of engaging in
fraud, wiretapping and other tactics in an effort to drive a small
Maryland soft-drink distributor out of business.
</P>
<P>
   In an amended version of its original lawsuit, the distributor,
B.K. Miller of Clinton, Md., contends, among other things, that
lawyers for Coca-Cola Enterprises submitted false reports to a
federal court from a private investigation company in an attempt to
prove that B.K. Miller illegally had shipped Coke products outside
its assigned sales territory.
</P>
<P>
   The papers filed by lawyers for B.K. Miller say, ``CCE attempted
to persuade the court to rely on documents which it knew were so
fraudulent that its general counsel was recommending to Coke USA's
general counsel that the matter be turned over to law enforcement
authorities.'' (Coke USA is the American unit of Coca-Cola Co.,
which makes soft-drink concentrate and sells it to Coca-Cola
Enterprises and its other bottlers.)
</P>
<P>
   Documents in the case, which began in 1997 in U.S. District
Court in Greenbelt, Md., were unsealed on Tuesday at the request of
The New York Times. Over all, they form a rare public portrait of
the sharp edges of the soft-drink business that emerge when two
parties clash.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for both sides refused to comment on the case, citing
the litigation. A jury trial is scheduled to begin on Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Coca-Cola Enterprises called the allegations
``totally without merit,'' and added: ``It is the policy of
Coca-Cola Enterprises to fully comply with all laws applicable to
our business operations, and we are taking this matter very
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the case is B.K. Miller's contention that
Coca-Cola Enterprises tried to take over Miller's customers, which
include vending machines and small stores. Miller says that
Coca-Cola Enterprises, which supplied Miller with products, imposed
a price increase and shifted strategy to include controlling highly
profitable vending machines after the bottler's local management
changed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since at least the summer of 1996, CCE has engaged in a
deliberate campaign to destroy B.K. Miller's business,'' contends
one document filed last year by Miller's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for CCE, although agreeing that the bottler's
strategy shifted, say the company was simply engaged in normal
competition. ``B.K. Miller was never targeted for extinction,'' one
response said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, CCE has accused B.K. Miller of engaging in
``trans-shipping,'' or selling Coke products outside its assigned
territory, for which Coca-Cola Co. levies fines of $5 a case that
it then largely gives to the bottler in whose territory the offense
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Miller denies trans-shipping. But Coca-Cola Enterprises has
tried hard to make its case.
</P>
<P>
   One agent hired by Coca-Cola Co. to investigate trans-shipping
by a number of distributors ``falsified his daily activity logs,''
according to one document. Although the validity of that report and
others was being questioned by company officials, the reports were
submitted last year to the Federal judge presiding in the B.K.
Miller case as support for CCE's claim.
</P>
<P>
   David Miller, the president of B.K. Miller, said Wednesday that
he planned to see the case through to its conclusion. ``I want the
ability to market the products I own the way that I think I
should,'' he said. ``I play by the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The family-owned B.K. Miller, which is named for David Miller's
grandfather, sells about 1.6 million cases of Coke products a year.
David Miller's brother Thomas V., who is known as Mike, is a
well-known state senator in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The company is an uncommon hybrid in the soft-drink business,
being both a customer of Coca-Cola Enterprises, from which it buys
products for its store, and a competitor, because it resells some
of those products through vending machines and other outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The documents filed by Miller's lawyers include reports by a
private-investigation company that Coca-Cola Enterprises hired
around the time the lawsuit was filed to look into business
practices at B.K. Miller, among others. Senior executives at
Coca-Cola Enterprises, including Henry A. Schimberg, now the chief
executive, were kept up to date on the investigation of B.K.
Miller, internal memorandums show.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Epic Investigations, was hired by a Coca-Cola
Enterprises executive who insisted on secrecy, instructing that all
bills be sent to his home, not to his office, according to a
document filed in the court proceedings by Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Enterprises paid Epic $21,000 in cash to set up a sham
company with the goal of catching B.K. Miller and others in the act
of selling soft drinks outside their designated territory, the
Baltimore-Washington area. That effort failed to turn up any
evidence of violations by Miller, the documents say.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls by Coca-Cola Enterprises employees as well as
B.K. Miller workers were recorded, in most cases without the
knowledge of both the caller and the recipient, the documents say.
Miller's lawyers said Maryland law forbids secret telephone
recordings, though Coca-Cola Enterprises said the calls took place
across state lines.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was identified by Coca-Cola Enterprises to other
distributors as a company that had violated the trans-shipping
rules. In two cases cited by Miller's lawyers, companies stopped
selling Coke products to Miller as a result.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the documents show, a Sam's Club owned by Wal-Mart
was featuring an unusually low price for the soft drink in May
1997, and B.K. Miller tried to take advantage of the sale but was
turned away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were grave concerns of Wal-Mart about their relationship
with their supplier (Coca-Cola) if they did what David Miller was
asking,'' Mark S. Levinstein, a lawyer for B.K. Miller, states in
the transcript of a conference call among lawyers and the judge in
the case. In another example, a Giant supermarket also refused to
sell to Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Coca-Cola Enterprises countersued B.K. Miller,
contending breach of contract, fraud and other offenses in
connection with the trans-shipping accusations. ``CCE has suffered
damage as a result of B.K. Miller's trans-shipping,'' the lawsuit
contends, ``and its intentionally false promises and
misrepresentations to CCE about B.K. Miller not trans-shipping
product.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Enterprises says it has documents that show evidence
of the trans-shipping activity.

 &HT;    After disappointing 1998, AirTran names new CEO
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Struggling AirTran Airways made a leadership change Wednesday,
naming one-time Eastern Airlines executive Joseph B. Leonard to
replace D. Joseph Corr as top executive.
</P>
<P>
   The move follows a disappointing 1998 for Orlando-based AirTran,
the successor to ValuJet.
</P>
<P>
   The low-fare airline failed to achieve a predicted profit
rebound, and stock in parent AirTran Holdings fell as low as $2.14
a share. Shares rose 31 1/4 cents Wednesday to $3.62 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Corr, 58, whose contract didn't expire for almost another year,
said the decision to leave early was his own. The self-described
turnaround specialist said he achieved his goal of rebuilding the
carrier ``to the point that it runs like a real business'' and
wanted to return to his home and other business interests in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Corr said he remains convinced AirTran will succeed, adding he
advocated Leonard's selection as the new chairman, president and
chief executive of AirTran Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, who is leaving as CEO of AlliedSignal Inc.'s Aerospace
Marketing, Sales and Service unit to take the AirTran job, said he
foresees no immediate strategy shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go in and take a look from A to Z at the
operation, but not with any pre-set notion of what changes should
be made,'' he said. He starts work Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first order of business is to make AirTran as profitable
as we can be, and we'll go where the path leads us after that.''
</P>
<P>
   The move marks a return to the airline field for Leonard, 55, an
Augusta, Ga. native and Auburn University(AL) graduate.
</P>
<P>
   He previously worked at Eastern, Northwest and American
airlines. At Eastern, he was chief operating officer during the
stormy ownership of Frank Lorenzo and was involved in
management-union wars that led to the carrier's 1991 demise.
</P>
<P>
   He was customer service chief at Northwest before joining
AlliedSignal in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard said he has long known not only Corr but also Robert
Priddy and Lewis Jordan, the two ValuJet co-founders who sit on
AirTran Holdings' board and own big chunks of stock.
</P>
<P>
   Corr succeeded Jordan as ValuJet's president and CEO in late
1996, shortly after the carrier resumed flying in the wake of the
government-ordered shutdown that followed the Flight 592 crash in
Florida. Corr led ValuJet into its merger with AirTran in 1997,
then launched a product and marketing overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   The airline earned its first post-shutdown profit in the second
quarter of 1998, but fell back into the red in the summer quarter.
Corr said he expects close to break-even results for the fourth
quarter ended Dec. 31.

VAST DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CLINTON-JOHNSON IMPEACHMENT TRIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The deeper Congress and the White House wade into
the fearful waters of a historic impeachment trial that begins
Thursday in the Senate, the deeper the two branches dig into a
constitutional crisis, the deeper the differences between the
tragedies of Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton appear.
</P>
<P>
   But with the chief justice about to swear in 100 senators as
presidential jurors, these differences are emerging as more than
simply historical curiosities. A look back at the bitterness and
betrayal that marked the Johnson trial during the most contentious
days of the Reconstruction period 130 years ago tells us a lot
about our own age at the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
   For all the modern dangers facing America at century's end _
global economic uncertainty, the threat of terrorism, worries about
arms proliferation _ the United States is a secure, mature nation
in 1999. It is the oldest democracy in the world. In 1868, it was
an experiment.
</P>
<P>
   For all the divisions among us _ religious, racial, gender,
language, sexual orientation, region, wealth _ the United States is
basically one nation in 1999. That was not at all clear in 1868,
when memories of the Civil War were fresh, when the continent was
still riven with sectional tensions and when whole parts of the
country were under military occupation. Today we are more
pluralistic than we were in 1868, but no one would think of the
term ``United States'' as a plural noun. Then the United States
were. Today the United States is.
</P>
<P>
   For all the resentment between the legislature of one party and
the White House of another, the two branches are far closer to each
other in 1999 than they were in 1868. President Johnson
deliberately and repeatedly antagonized his congressional rivals,
thwarting their initiatives, defying their will, stomping on their
prerogatives.
</P>
<P>
   Though President Clinton has just been impeached, lawmakers of
both parties Wednesday asserted their intentions to treat the
president fairly and to work with him on matters of substance.
Indeed, in the past several years, compromises between the
Republican Congress and the Democratic president have produced an
overhaul of welfare and a budget plan.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons Clinton is likely to survive his brush with
history is he was elected twice by large popular margins.
Lawmakers, themselves answerable to the public, are chary of
questioning the wisdom of the very voters who placed them in office
and in the position of deciding the destiny of the president.
Johnson wasn't elected to the presidency; he ascended to the White
House after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in 1865.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons the stakes were so high in 1868 was there was
no vice president to succeed Johnson. Next in line for the
presidency was Benjamin F. Wade, the president pro tempore of the
Senate, a figure described by a fellow Ohio lawmaker (and future
Republican president), James A. Garfield, as ``a man of violent
passions, extreme opinions, and narrow views; . . . a grossly
profane coarse nature who is surrounded by the worst and most
violent elements in the Republican party.'' Wade's high-tariff and
soft currency views would have been a major departure in 1868. Vice
President Al Gore's views on important issues do not differ
substantially from Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the reasons the nation may be taking the Clinton
impeachment and trial in stride _ and not rushing the doors of the
Capitol, as the men in suits and women in hoop skirts did in 1868 _
is that consequences of the episode are so much less critical now
than they were in Johnson's time. At stake in 1868 was not only the
rule of law, but also the course of Reconstruction, which was the
process of building a nation from the rubble and resentment of the
Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle over the nature of Reconstruction _ how to reinvite
the Confederate states back into the Union, who should govern those
states, how the rebels should be punished, and how racial justice
should be defined and won _ is at the heart of why the Civil War
was fought and at the heart of what America's founders meant when
they talked about securing ``the blessings of liberty to ourselves
and our posterity.'' That struggle also raised questions of whether
one branch of government, the executive, had the option of not
enforcing the laws that were duly passed by the legislative branch.
</P>
<P>
   Great issues are, to be sure, in play in 1999, including the
implications of a president lying under oath to a grand jury and
obstructing justice, the two charges Clinton faces. Under question
here are the public consequences of the private morality of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1868, the question was the national morals of the
country. The overriding issues 130 years ago were the nature of
American democracy and the reach of American liberty, issues about
slavery and freedom left unresolved in the Constitution. It took a
Civil War and Reconstruction to answer those questions. But a
century later, it took the civil-rights movement to transform that
answer into reality.

 &HT;    EDITORS: THE FOLLOWING EDITORIAL IS RUNNING IN THE JANUARY 7
EDITION OF THE ATLANTA CONSTITUTION.
 &HT;    Try loosening screws on Cuba
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the enduring peculiarities of Bill Clinton's presidency
is his blind spot regarding Cuba. While his positions on other
world trouble spots are reasonably well thought out, he is in
denial about Cuba. Intent on perpetuating 40 years of official
hostility toward Fidel Castro's regime, he appears oblivious to the
policy's utter failure.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton first made a play for Cuban-American right-wingers'
support when he campaigned in Florida's Democratic primary in 1992.
As chief executive, he has never strayed far from their hard line _
not even this week, when he riled the fiercest of Castro's exile
enemies by announcing a handful of steps to strengthen
people-to-people contacts between Americans and Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   These measures, intended to open access to Castro's closed
society and improve the lives of ordinary Cubans, are fine so far
as they go. Unfortunately, Clinton declined to take an even more
meaningful step _ the creation of a bipartisan panel to review U.S.
policy on Cuba and give it a much-needed overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's timidity on the point is inexplicable. He had ample
political cover to set a bolder course. Three former secretaries of
state from Republican administrations _ Henry Kissinger, George
Shultz and Lawrence Eagleburger _ had urged him to initiate the
review, as had more than a dozen GOP senators, many of them of the
extra-conservative persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   So why cling to a failed policy? To placate Castrophobes in
south Florida and their mossback champions in Congress, such as
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.)?
</P>
<P>
   For 40 years this crowd has concentrated solely on Castro's
downfall; never mind the bitter consequences of isolation and
embargo on the Cuban people. To illustrate the point, Diaz-Balart
objected immediately this week to the modest Clinton proposal that
would make more food available to malnourished Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   What can he and his cohorts be thinking? The way to hasten the
end of Cuba's long night is not to extend the darkness but to open
up the country to trade and visitors and ideas. The only thing to
thrive in Cuba after 40 years of U.S. enmity is Castro's tyranny.
Isn't it time Washington tried a different tack?
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON'S NEW PLAN FOR CUBA
</P>
<P>
   -- Would permit any U.S. resident to send up to $1,200 annually
to needy Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   -- Would allow sale of food and agricultural supplies to private
Cuban groups.
</P>
<P>
   -- Would improve direct mail service between the United States
and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   -- Would expand charter flights to Cuba, extending service to
U.S. cities other than Miami.
</P>
<P>
   -- Would let the Baltimore Orioles and Cuba's national team
arrange exhibition baseball games.

 &HT;    State rep wants more oversight over Georgia child care systems
 &HT;    By Christy Oglesby
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_Already chock-full of children, Georgia's foster care
system barely has room for the abused, abandoned and neglected
minors who need to be in it.
</P>
<P>
   However, last year judges allowed caseworkers from the Division
of Family and Children Services to place at least eight children
into foster homes and shelters, only to have authorities later
determine that they did not need to be there.
</P>
<P>
   Newborn twins remained separated from their mother for 10 days
until Gov. Zell Miller ordered an immediate investigation which
sent them home the day he learned about the case. And six Atlanta
children went without their parents for 179 days until Tommy
Olmstead, commissioner of the state's child protection agency,
ordered a review of their case. They went home 36 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, during this legislative session, Rep. Georganna
Sinkfield (D-Atlanta) plans to pursue legislation that will protect
families who don't grab the attention of high-placed state
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, like several other states, she said, should be able to
provide emergency, temporary care for children whose parents are
suddenly and temporarily unable to take care of their children
because of illness or accident.
</P>
<P>
   Current laws only allow for care if judges give the state
custody of the children. To get the children back, parents must
follow the same procedures and timelines established for those
suspected of abuse and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Lolade Delu, lost custody of her twin daughters when
she returned to the hospital from complications related to the
delivery. Delu said she expected to be treated and released. When
doctors decided to admit her, she had no one to watch her 5-day old
babies. The hospital contacted DFACS, and Delu lost custody of the
girls.
</P>
<P>
   When she was being discharged two days later, Delu found out she
would have to go to court to get her twins back, she said. After
she became hysterical, doctors committed her to a psychiatric unit
where doctors determined she was not mentally ill, just
heartbroken, a nurse said. They released her.
</P>
<P>
   Delu said she is pleased that Sinkfield is pursuing a system of
care that would spare other parents from the trauma she endured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great idea,'' Delu said. ``I think they should
take children from people who are not taking care of them, but they
should not take children away from people who are taking care of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Several states already provide up to 72 hours of care for people
in Delu's situation.
</P>
<P>
   Sinkfield said she also will pursue establishing an ombusdman
program, which exists in some form in 24 states. Ombudsmen in the
child protection system advise parents and children of their rights
and provide third-party review of cases to make sure that state
agencies follow appropriate procedures before removing children
from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are issues of great importance,'' said Sinkfield who is
the chairwoman of the House Children and Youth Committee. ``The
least we should do is make sure we examine it and see how we could
fit them in with our programs.
</P>
<P>
   Peg Peters, DFACS director said she has concerns about the
length of time a child could remain in emergency care, but still
supports the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things being done locally, but I wouldn't be
opposed to doing something on a state-wide basis _ anything that
will help the children,'' Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   However, her support of an ombudsman program is conditional.
``It depends on what the situation is and what they are looking for
and the parameters under which the examination would be,'' she
said. ``My belief is the process we've got works well.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie Young and Edna Pittman said an ombudsman would be a great
service to children and parents. Their six children were in state
custody for 179 days after a caseworker removed them without
investigating a neglect claim.
</P>
<P>
   When children are not in immediate danger, DFACS policy requires
caseworkers to investigate claims before seeking the removal of
children from their parents. State laws require DFACS to present
evidence to a judge within 72 hours to justify the removal.
However, in Young's case, the caseworker did not investigate the
claims before taking the children and Fulton County juvenile court
judges granted several continuances and allowed the case to linger
155 days before hearing testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Young and Pittman repeatedly called DFACS officials and
politicians, including the governor, attempting to get their
children.
</P>
<P>
   Media inquires prompted Olmstead to request a case review, and
the reviewer found that the family needed some support services,
such as child care subsidies and parent aides, but the children did
not have to be in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   While DFACS rescues thousands of children from harmful family
situations, it's possible some unjustified removals happen,
Sinkfield said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been flooded with calls, especially after the article
about the six children,'' she said. And DFACS could benefit from
such oversight, she said. ``They should be glad to have
something,'' Sinkfield said, because the department could benefit
from having someone make sure that the agency doesn't remove
children unnecessarily. ``The ombudsmen play that role.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN TAKING CHARGE ON LOWER-THEN-EXPECTED EARNINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Northrop Grumman Corp., the nation's largest maker of airframes
for commercial aircraft, said Wednesday that it would take a $125
million fourth-quarter charge and that 1999 annual profits would be
about 20 percent below expectations because of the downturn in
demand by Asian countries for Boeing 747s.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles-based Northrop produces the fuselage for the
Boeing 747 jumbo jet, popular with Asian airlines. Last December,
as Asian countries saw a dramatic downturn in air traffic as the
region's economy weakened, Boeing announced it was cutting 747
production to two airplanes a month, from five a month just two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The ripple effect of the Asian economy has hit Northrop as it
regroups after a proposed takeover by Lockheed Corp. was called off
last July because of government objections. Northrop's stock traded
as high as $108 a share just before the takeover was halted. It
then tumbled and had begun to recover slightly last fall before the
Boeing announcement in December knocked it down again. Wednesday,
the stock closed at $69.3125, down $3.9375.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, Northrop projected it would earn around $6.33 a share,
or $1.18 a share less than the $7.51 consensus of equity analysts.
``We believe the current analysts' consensus estimate of $7.51 is
overstated,'' said Northrop chief executive Kent Kresa. The company
will announce its 1998 earnings Feb. 3. In 1997, the company had
sales of $9.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $125 million fourth-quarter charge, a total of $105
million is due to the 747 production cutbacks along with an
increase in costs of fuselages currently in production. The rest is
due to delays in a series of tests on a joint defense program with
the British and U.S. defense departments that have resulted in $20
million in unrecoverable costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Northrop is being pretty up front in defining these numbers,''
said Howard Rubel, an aerospace analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
``The hardest part was coming to a conclusion of what the numbers
would be and Northrop has done a good job of quantifying it.'' Each
of the 153-foot main 747 fuselages that Northrop makes generates
around $10 million for the company, which has been the 747s
principal airframe subcontractor since the 747 program began in
1966.
</P>
<P>
   The new write-off adds to a previously announced 1998 accounting
charge of $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also in the midst of reducing its work force of
54,000 by about 17 percent, or 9,000 workers, in 1999, through
layoffs and attrition.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian downturn also caused Allied Signal Inc., the world's
10th- largest aerospace company, to realign its aerospace business
to save $30 million to $50 million. The Morris Township, N.J.,
maker of aircraft equipment, facing the same slowdown in global
demand for commercial aircraft, said it expected to reduce costs
through layoffs and consolidation in its supply chain.
</P>
<P>
   The company did not provide information on how the aerospace
business would be realigned. But investors reacted more favorably,
with the stock closing at $44.6875, up 87.5 cents.

 &HT;    On Saturday, Atlanta hosts gospel's Stellar Awards
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta adds another notch Saturday to its growing
reputation as a mecca for gospel music when it hosts the 14th
annual Stellar Awards, gospel music's premier awards show.
</P>
<P>
   The affair begins at 5 p.m. at the Atlanta Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be big,'' said Eli Smith, disc jockey for gospel
radio station WYZE-AM (1480). ``The Stellar Awards are the gospel
version of the Grammy Awards.''
</P>
<P>
   And like the Grammy ceremony, the Stellar Awards will feature a
parade of celebrities, including Kirk Franklin, Fred Hammond &AMP;
Radical for Christ choir, Dottie Peoples, Take 6 and Donnie
McClurkin.
</P>
<P>
   The show's presenters will be as famous as its honorees. They
include comedian Steve Harvey, star of the WB sitcom ``The Steve
Harvey Show''; actress Lynn Whitfield, who starred in the 1997 film
``Eve's Bayou''; and Bobby Jones, host of BET's ``The Bobby Jones
Gospel Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's spotlight will also shine on Atlanta, a growing
center of gospel music. In recent years, the Stellar Awards were
held in Nashville. But program organizer Don Jackson decided to
change the location after Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell personally
persuaded him to make the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew of the great gospel tradition that was here in
Atlanta,'' Jackson said. ``I also made the decision because of the
size of Atlanta's black population.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's decision marks the second time recently that a major
gospel event has moved to Atlanta. In October, Gospel Heritage
Weekend, a concert honoring the nation's top gospel artists, was
held in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's vibrant black church scene has also been a steady
source of support for many major gospel artists who regard the city
as a must-stop for their national tours.
</P>
<P>
   While in Nashville, the Stellar Awards ceremony averaged about
2,000 people. Jackson said he ``easily'' expects about 4,000 to
attend the Atlanta event, which would make it the largest Stellar
Awards show ever.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets range from $15 to $75. For additional information, call
404-249-6400.

   ATLANTA _ One thing's guaranteed: By the time PBS' four-part
documentary ``The Mississippi: River of Song'' concludes, you may
never want to hear Creedence Clearwater Revival's ``Proud Mary''
ever, ever again.
</P>
<P>
   With its ``Rolling, rolling, rolling on the river'' refrain, the
'60s rock classic is the unofficial _ and overdone _ theme for an
ambitious, engaging, but not entirely satisfying musical tour of
the Mississippi from northern Minnesota to Delacroix Island, La.
That singular American sprawl, the production suggests, feeds
nearly every conceivable kind of folksy root music _ from the
fiddles of Scandanavian immigrants and the punk rock of
loft-dwelling city kids to the more obvious blues, R&AMP;B, gospel and
zydeco sounds of Memphis, Mississippi and Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The series, which begins at 10:30 tonight on WGTV and continues
at the same time for the next three Thursdays, is a noble effort on
the part of the Smithsonian Institution, which has released a
two-CD set and a book to accompany it, and producer John Junkerman.
But, tonight's opening segment, ``Americans Old and New,'' feels
like a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The juxtaposition of drummer Lori Barbero of the Minneapolis
punk trio Babes in Toyland with a classroom of immigrant Laotian
youths learning traditional Hmong qeej (bamboo reed) rituals, sure
looks nifty. But does it really establish anything?
</P>
<P>
   Big cities are magnets of opportunity for all kinds of people
and cultures. Give me a camera crew and an afternoon, and I'll find
as interesting a contrast in metro Atlanta. I'll even use the Big
Chicken as a metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, though, the river makes a compelling symbol, even
when it doesn't always shake out. ``You can't deny it,'' says Brian
Henneman, guitarist for Festus, Mo., rock band the Bottle Rockets,
featured in next week's segment, ``Midwestern Crossroads.'' A group
whose unshakably regional status Henneman credits to an
uncommercial insistence on fusing George Jones with Aerosmith, the
Bottle Rockets have always felt the psychological tug of the
Mississippi. ``That is the unexplainable thing. The river is there.
There it is! I don't know what it means, but you always knew it
meant something.''
</P>
<P>
   Junkerman contends the river is simply an organizing principle.
``I wanted to find a way of representing American contemporary
music in its wide scope and its many facets,'' he says, ``and we
hit upon the idea of following the Mississippi River partly for
personal reasons. I made a trip to New Orleans about 10 years ago
and fell in love with the area. I wanted to see what happened as we
followed the river northward.''
</P>
<P>
   The series improves as it moves in the opposite direction. The
farther south, the more seemingly disparate musical styles and
makers overlap _ and the more significant becomes the presence of
the Mississippi. No better illustration exists than in the final
hour, ``Louisiana, Where Music Is King.'' Early on, crusty country
singer Merle Haggard sits in with 98-year-old legend Jimmie Davis,
a former governor of Louisiana and a pioneering gospel artist who
penned ``You Are My Sunshine.'' Next, D.L. Menard, ``the Cajun Hank
Williams,'' joins performer Christine Balfa as she sings a familiar
melody at a country picnic. ``I'm content to be a Cajun,'' she
sings in the localized French dialect. But the tune, which passes
for traditional, is actually Haggard's ``Okie From Muskogee.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one of those scenes, familiar to anyone who's attended the
New Orleans Jazz &AMP; Heritage Festival, that you'd love to linger
with, but there's always more ground to cover.
</P>
<P>
   That's a constant frustration with ``River of Song,'' which in
its rush to embrace vibrant characters (whether it's bluesman Big
Jack ``the Oilman'' Johnson or St. Louis R&AMP;B stars Fontella Bass
and Oliver Sain) spreads itself too thin for a mere hourlong
segment. You wish Junkerman was lazier in his quest or had another
four hours of airtime.

RADICAL CHANGES PROPOSED FOR MEDICARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Leaders of a federal advisory commission on
Wednesday proposed radical changes in Medicare, under which the
government would offer a fixed amount of money, or a voucher, to
each beneficiary to buy private health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the commission agreed to draft a detailed proposal
for such changes, along the lines recommended by the chairman, Sen.
John B. Breaux, D-La., and the co-chairman, Rep. Bill Thomas,
R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would gradually increase the eligibility age for
Medicare and would provide coverage of prescription drugs for many
beneficiaries. ``Drugs are as important today as a hospital bed was
in 1965,'' when Medicare was created, Breaux said.
</P>
<P>
   He and Republicans on the panel endorsed the idea of redesigning
Medicare in the image of the Federal Employees Health Benefits
Program, which covers nine million people, including members of
Congress. The views of other Democratic members ranged from
skeptical to open-minded.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, people on Medicare could _ like federal
employees, retirees and their dependents _ choose from a wide range
of traditional insurance plans and health maintenance
organizations, and they could switch plans once a year.
</P>
<P>
   The government would pay a certain proportion, say 90 percent,
of the average premium charged by all health plans participating in
Medicare. Beneficiaries would pay the remainder, averaging perhaps
10 percent. But people who chose more expensive plans would have to
pay a larger share of the premium. The federal contribution would
be increased or reduced to reflect local differences in prices.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of this proposal contend that the competition among
private health plans would hold down costs _ a hope dismissed as
``total fantasy'' by Bruce C. Vladeck, a commission member who ran
the Medicare program from 1993 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal builds on changes made in Medicare in 1997. Those
changes have had limited success. Rather than rushing to compete in
the Medicare market, some HMO's have pulled out because they
consider the federal payments inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux said his proposal would also include these ideas, which
appear to have support from many commissioners:
</P>
<P>
   _ Private insurance policies that fill gaps in the traditional
Medicare program would have to cover prescription drugs. Medicare
HMO's might also be required to provide such coverage, as some now
do voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   _ The eligibility age for Medicare would be gradually increased
by two years, to 67 from 65. The change would occur over a 24-year
period starting in 2003. People age 65 and 66 might be allowed to
buy Medicare coverage if they were willing to pay the full,
unsubsidized price.
</P>
<P>
   _ Medicare officials would have more authority to choose the
doctors, hospitals and other health care providers who supply goods
and services to the elderly. Officials could use this authority to
select the best providers offering the lowest prices.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux's proposal would also reduce Medicare's role in paying
for the training of doctors, and this would save money for
Medicare. The direct costs of graduate medical education, including
salaries and fringe benefits of interns and residents, would no
longer come out of the Medicare trust fund. The money would be
subject to annual appropriation by Congress, and medical schools
fear they would get less.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Breaux's proposal say that elderly people can
become smart shoppers, like federal employees. Future retirees will
have had decades of experience with HMO's and other forms of
managed care, they note.
</P>
<P>
   But Marilyn Moon, a public trustee of the Medicare trust fund,
said: ``One-third of the 39 million Medicare beneficiaries are
unlikely to participate in a competitive market because they have
major medical problems or are struggling with Alzheimer's disease
or mental illness. That makes them much more conservative about
changing health plans. They are more likely to stick with one plan,
even if it becomes more expensive. And they probably won't be
sought out by health plans in their marketing campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   The 17-member commission, which completed a two-day meeting on
Wednesday, is studying ways to solve Medicare's long-term financial
problems. It must submit its recommendations to Congress and the
president by March 1. Recommendations made to the commission need
at least 11 votes to win approval.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux's proposal appears already to have 10 votes, with support
from all 8 Republican appointees and 2 Democrats, Breaux and Sen.
Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. Breaux said he hoped to win support from
several other Democrats, so the package would have more than the 11
votes needed for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., said the panel, the National
Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, should seek an
extension of the March 1 deadline for its report. With President
Clinton's impeachment trial scheduled to begin on Thursday, he
said, ``the Senate will be absorbed in other issues.'' Five of the
17 commissioners are senators.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux rejected the idea of an extension, saying that any delay
would increase the probability of Medicare's becoming entangled in
the politics of the next presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Under Breaux's proposal, the original Medicare program would
remain an option for all beneficiaries. But the government-run
program would have to compete with private health plans and would
receive the same federal subsidy as private plans, so it would be
under the same pressure to keep down costs, commission members
said.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Democrats like Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV of West
Virginia have said they fear that healthy people would desert the
original Medicare program in favor of private health plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a smaller and smaller fee-for-service Medicare
program, with older, sicker and poorer people,'' Rockefeller said.
Private HMO's will not compete aggressively for Medicare business
in rural areas or in states like West Virginia, where elderly
people generally have low incomes, he said.

 &HT;    Atlantan gives museum highly prized collection assembled by late
wife
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The High Museum of Art has started the new year on an
auspicious note, receiving a gift of 16 major contemporary works
from the collection of Atlantans Burton and the late Lenore Gold.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 artists would make most curators' Who's Who list. Among
the works are a print by the late pop artist Roy Lichtenstein, a
black velvet painting by Julian Schnabel, a ghostly female figure
by sculptor George Segal and a photo-installation by French artist
Christian Boltanski. Although the museum declined to reveal the
monetary value of the promised gifts, the collection could be
estimated at $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be a quantum leap forward for any museum in the
country,'' said Frank Robinson, director of the Johnson Museum at
Gold's alma mater, Cornell University, who knows the collection and
the family well. ``Together, Burt and Lenny had a brilliant eye.
They bought difficult, challenging art before people knew they were
classics. These are works of art that express the profoundest
emotions and concerns of our time. Any museum of any size would be
thrilled to get this, and it is extraordinarily generous that Burt
wants to share it.''
</P>
<P>
   High director Ned Rifkin said the donation marks ``a significant
advance'' for the museum's contemporary art collection. ``We are
acquiring works by artists we would otherwise have wanted to
purchase, and they are all really prime examples of their work,''
Rifkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Curator Carrie Przybilla says the gift fills important gaps,
citing a sculpture by German artist Anselm Kiefer as ``an important
example of a European artist considered one of the most important
of his generation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The gift also establishes a certain level of excellence,''
Przybilla said. In turn, it makes the High more attractive to
potential patrons. ``Collectors seem to want to give where a
collection is already prominent,'' she said. ``Perhaps others will
see that they can make a difference here, but also that ours is a
collection worthy of respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Friend and collecting companion Judith Taylor described the
Golds as informed and active collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was Lenny's passion . . . and he (Burton) was a great
partner,'' she said. ``Lenny had a great eye. She knew all the
dealers and would take a lot of time learning not only about a
particular artist but also what was going on in the art scene. She
always wanted to get the best piece possible. I don't know where
there's another contemporary collection in town of this caliber.''
</P>
<P>
   The Golds, both native New Yorkers, started collecting before
they moved to Atlanta in 1969. They have four daughters. Gold, who
lives in Atlanta, was chairman and CEO of Stratton Industries, a
carpet manufacturing business he sold in 1986. He has focused his
philanthropic and volunteer efforts on the Jewish community. Mrs.
Gold died in a car accident in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lenore was far ahead of me in understanding art,'' Gold said
Wednesday. ``She made the decisions. She would usually show me
something she was interested in, and I deferred to her, unless I
really hated it. Then we wouldn't buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the Golds were featured as one of America's top
collectors in Arts &AMP; Antiques magazine. She was quoted as saying,
``I'd rather buy art than eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for her hats, her ever-present toy poodle and a big purse
that always contained transparencies of one artwork or another,
Mrs. Gold was also passionate about the High Museum. She served on
the museum board and helped found the Contemporary Art Society. The
Golds were founding members of the Collections Council.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gold built her collection with the High Museum in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many times she would say, `Well, I hope you
like this, because it's coming to the museum,' '' Przybilla said.
</P>
<P>
   Gold recalled as well that his wife frequently made purchases
with an eye to how they would fit into the museum's collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really happy for Atlanta,'' said Peter Morrin, director of
the J.P. Speed Museum in Kentucky and the High's first curator of
modern art. ``It's a wonderful fulfillment of a process, which
began 20 years ago, in which Lenny was interacting with the museum,
exchanging opinions. She really wanted the best for Atlanta. She
galvanized and helped foster ambition in everyone around her.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Gold, ``It is a special privilege for me to commemorate and
honor Lenore's total commitment'' through this gift.
</P>
<P>
   Selections from the Lenore and Burton Gold Collection will soon
go on view at the High. An exhibition is scheduled for March 2001.

 &HT;    Wolfe helps revive sales of Roman philosopher
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Epictetus is not likely to become a best-selling author, but,
thanks to Tom Wolfe and his best-selling ``A Man in Full,'' the
first-century Roman philosopher is enjoying a revival of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   HarperSanFrancisco has gone back to press on two of Epictetus'
books _ ``A Manual for Living'' and ``The Art of Living'' _ and
people who once thought a Stoic was a long-legged bird that
delivered babies are immersing themselves in philosophy. Sales are
brisk in San Francisco, says publicist Meg Lenihan, and some
Atlanta bookstores saw a surge in sales last month.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in New York in November, Wolfe said he got the
idea for using Epictetus after reading about an American pilot who
was shot down in Vietnam and sent to a POW camp. ``He mentioned
that the only thing that had kept him going in prison was the
sketchy knowledge of Epictetus that he'd gotten from a course at
the Naval Academy.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the American pilot, Wolfe's character Conrad Hensley uses
the teachings of Epictetus to help him survive imprisonment.
Reading a copy of ``The Stoics,'' Hensley is profoundly affected by
Epictetus' simple message: Each man alone is totally responsible
for his deeds.
</P>
<P>
   The words were written 2,000 years ago, but they are especially
timely today, says Sharon Lebell, a San Francisco writer who
modernized Epictetus' archaic language for the two new volumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly it's become fashionable to be a decent person,''
Lebell said. ``The use of self-restraint and judgment are being
considered, especially in the wake of the Clinton and Lewinsky
debacle. There's a collective moral conversation going on now and
people are less interested in a spiritual search. They're searching
for a moral compass.''
</P>
<P>
   Epictetus, who was born a Roman slave, offers a formula that
sounds as if it were taken from a New Age self-help book or Poor
Richard's Almanac. ``Know what you can control and what you
can't,'' he advises. Other bits of wisdom: ``Seeking to please is a
perilous trap''; and, one that seems to discourage more sales of
Wolfe's big novel, ``Stay away from most popular entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   LITERARY CHANGE: When Nora DeLoach went through menopause seven
years ago, she really had a change of life.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the former social worker was having to deal with a
rebellious teenage daughter as well as hormonal shifts. ``My
husband tried to mediate and keep us from killing each other,'' the
58-year-old Decatur writer says, ``but I finally decided I needed
time by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Her solution was to convert the family patio into an office, buy
a computer and begin writing short stories. Having never taken any
writing courses, DeLoach accumulated a pile of rejection slips
until she placed fifth in a writing contest. Encouraged by her
modest success, she found a small publisher for her first novel, a
mystery featuring Grace Covington, an African-American Miss Marple,
and her daughter, Simone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been an Agatha Christie fan,'' DeLoach says, ``and
I like cozy mysteries. And, like Grace, I have a daughter with whom
I have a close relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Now signed with Bantam for a four-book deal, DeLoach hits the
road this month to promote ``Mama Rocks the Empty Cradle'' (Bantam,
$21.95). The novel is set in fictional Otis, S.C., but the plot was
inspired by the bombing of an abortion clinic in Sandy Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my novels to be contemporary,'' DeLoach says, ``so I
try to get my ideas from what's happening in the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   The story centers around a stolen baby, the discovery of several
infant skulls and a crime of jealousy and revenge. Despite the
intricacies of the plot, DeLoach's books are always
character-driven.
</P>
<P>
   ``My readers always want to know what's going on in my
characters' lives,'' she says. ``That's why they like reading about
Mama's cooking so much. Cooking is such a big part of the
African-American family ritual.''
</P>
<P>
   So does DeLoach cook like Mama?
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to when I was a full-time mama,'' she says, laughing.
``I still cook when everyone gets together five or six times a
year. But mostly now it's sandwiches and takeout.''
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING AHEAD: ``Fahrenheit 451'' author Ray Bradbury will be
the featured speaker March 25-27 at the Sandhills Writers'
Conference at Augusta State University. Atlanta authors
participating in the conference are playwright Sandra Deer,
novelist Fred Willard and children's author Carol Lee Lorenzo.

 &HT;    Here are some ideas on keeping it cool in the office
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though some like it hot, you might want it cold _ or at least a
bit cooler. If you belong in this camp, try these items:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  COOL DRINKS. When you're super-thirsty, resort to the Pump Pot
(right) with a glass thermal liner ($12.97). Fill the 2.6-quart
container with your favorite cold beverage, then sip away. At
Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  FAN-TASTIC. Look and feel cool with Holmes' Euro Style desk
fan ($9.99). The 10-by-10-inch electric box fan with two speeds
fits neatly on a desktop and doesn't disturb co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   Or, for a flash of air, try Holmes' pocket cooler fan ($4.99).
This battery-operated fan fits neatly into the palm of your hand.
Both fans are available online at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .kmart.com. Starting in February, the seasonal items will also
be available in Kmart stores, according to Ernie Morse, manager at
the Kennesaw Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WEARABLE AIR CONDITIONER. Invest in your own Personal Cooling
System (below) from the Sharper Image. The lightweight aluminum
collar fits around the neck. You simply fill its two chambers with
a few ounces of water, rest it on your neck and switch it on. A
quiet, tiny fan moves air across the water, cooling the area around
you up to 20 degrees. The flexible sides hold the cooling plate
against your neck _ and you feel cool all over. It weighs 16 ounces
filled. ($49). To order:

 &HT;    Don't touch that thermostat: Make your own warming trend without
overheating co-workers
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some like it hot _ in the office.
</P>
<P>
   You know the types. They huddle under a blanket, always wear a
thick sweater or wrap their hands around a hot drink, fantasizing
about turning the thermostat to high.
</P>
<P>
   But in many workplaces, messing with the thermostat is a no-no.
And you certainly don't want to start an office incident over a few
degrees. Besides, what's warm to some may feel unbearably hot to
others.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sujatha Reddy, who practices obstetrics and gynecology at
Emory University (Ga.), says some people just have less tolerance
to cold than others. ``The hypothalamus, the part of the brain that
regulates a person's temperature, is simply set at different
settings for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Although women seem to be more cold-natured, says Emory
endocrinologist James H. Christy, we don't really know why. ``We've
been debating that for 100 years. We don't know if it's
psychological or physiological. It could be genetic,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of fat tissue also makes a difference in how well a
person tolerates temperature extremes. ``Sometimes, thin persons
feel the cold more than people who carry more fat on their
bodies,'' Reddy says.
</P>
<P>
   To chase away winter's chills, we found the following items to
keep you comfy. Some you wear, others sit on your desk to warm up
your space. Best of all, these won't cause your co-workers to get
too hot under their collars.
</P>
<P>
   Create your own comfort zone
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the peace (and heat) in the office
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  IN THE HOT SEAT. Not only does this heated massage pad, in a
gray-and-black tweed, keep you warm, it also gives you a
personalized massage. Since it's portable, you can use it in your
car or home as well as in the office. The pad runs on AC power or a
12-volt car battery. $70 at Brookstone stores in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A HOT CUPPA . . . Nothing chases winter's chill away faster
than a hot cup of java or cocoa. Home Trends' electric coffee
warmer, with a metal heating unit, will heat up a cup in a jiffy
($5.97). At Wal-Mart stores. (Cup is not included.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  BLOWING HOT &AMP; COLD. This handy contemporary heater/fan from
Brookstone's Hard-to-Find Tools catalog is small enough to set on
your desk yet powerful enough to keep you warm. A tilting base
directs the heat exactly where you need it. And, in the summer
months, the handy item turns into a fan. ($54.99). For catalog,
call 1-800-926-7000.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WRAP IT UP. If your legs get cold, throw on a throw. They're
available in wools and synthetics; the rayon style shown here is 50
inches by 60 inches with a 12-inch knotted fringe. It's soft,
lightweight and lustrous. And when spring arrives, take your throw
home and toss it on your sofa to dress it up. ($49.99). At Rich's.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  TRENDY AND TOASTY. To ward off chills, opt for this boiled
wool sweater jacket ($79.50) from Lands' End catalog. When wool
gets steamed (boiled), the fibers permanently join, thus becoming
denser, stronger and warmer. And wool's natural ``breathability''
holds and releases heat, keeping you comfy. This lightweight
jacket, which can be stashed at your desk, looks good with either
pants or a skirt. For a catalog, call 1-800-356-4444.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THERMAL LAYER. Forget those long johns your great-grandfather
used to wear. The newest styles are cut from silk interlock. They
not only keep you warm but feel luxurious on the body _ a practical
indulgence. For him and her: long-sleeve crewnecks and pants banded
at the ankles (below); each piece is $29.50, from Lands' End
catalog (1-800-356-4444). Silk undies are also available at REI
stores, where the crewneck tops are $28 and the ankle-length
bottoms are $26. Colors for her: natural and black; for him: navy
and green.

PRESIDENT TO ASK TRIPLING OF SCHOOLS PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will propose Thursday tripling,
to $600 million from $200 million, funding for after-school and
summer-school programs, giving priority to school districts working
to end the practice of ``social promotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to announce the proposed increase to end social
promotions _ in which students are promoted without regard to
whether they meet requirements to succeed at the next grade level _
at a White House ceremony, where he will be joined by Vice
President Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The after-school and summer-school grant program is one of the
most highly competitive ever managed by the Education Department.
</P>
<P>
   Boston and Massachusetts were among the top grant recipients
last year. Massachusetts received roughly $2.2 million of last
year's total of $200 million. Boston's share was $305,977.
</P>
<P>
   That money helped fund Opening Doors to Schools and Learning,
run by the Boston public schools. The program offers tutoring,
arts, and cultural activities, as well as substance-abuse and
violence prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement is part of his practice of providing
peeks at the most popular aspects of his fiscal 2000 budget in
advance of his State of the Union message, scheduled for Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, he announced a proposal to provide a $1,000
tax credit to aid disabled Americans needing long-term care and
their caretakers. Last week, he said he would seek a 12 percent
increase, or an extra $105 million, for food safety and increase
defense spending by $100 billion over six years.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the proposed increase for after-school
programs builds on his earlier success at getting Congress to boost
the current funding of $200 million from $40 million in fiscal
1998. The program started with only $1 million in fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials estimate that the proposed $600 million
would help 1.1 million children nationwide to participate in
after-school and summer-school programs run by local school
districts. More than 190,000 children in 800 schools in 46 states
and the District of Columbia already are participating in
enrichment activities, tutoring, and recreation through the grant
program.
</P>
<P>
   Because the grants are so competitive _ the Education Department
last year received applications to fund programs in 6,000 schools _
Clinton will ask that schools be given extra points if they have
comprehensive programs to end social promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials view the after-school programs
as essential to responding to the needs of parents, who are
increasingly in the work force.
</P>
<P>
   More than 28 million school-age children have both parents or
their only parent in the work force. At least 5 million children,
and possibly as many as 15 million, are left alone at home each
week. Many experts agree that unsupervised school-age children are
far more likely to use alcohol, drugs, and tobacco or commit
crimes, receive poor grades, and drop out of school than those
involved in constructive supervised activities.

PRESSURE ON HUNTER BROUGHT AGREEMENT CLOSER  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For six months, the members of the National
Basketball Players Association were as unified as a chorus as they
followed the lead of union executive director Billy Hunter and
president Patrick Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   But the pressure began to mount, and the moment of truth was
upon them as David Stern, commissioner of the National Basketball
Association, issued the owners' final proposal this week and urged
the players to vote or else face the cancellation of the season
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the pressure, the voices of unity began to crack and a
groundswell of opposition toward the union's 19-man negotiating
team started to take shape. Suddenly, Hunters' invitation to the
league's 430 players to join in solidarity and vote the owners'
proposal down Wednesday looked like an invitation for an uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Star players like Shaquille O'Neal of the Los Angeles Lakers and
Hakeem Olajuwon of the Houston Rockets were on their way here to
voice their opposition to the union leadership. Over 30 players had
called Isaiah Thomas, a former union leader, and asked him to part
the stalemate and take control of negotiations. All-Stars including
Jayson Williams of the New Jersey Nets were adamant about getting a
deal done and not calling Stern's bluff. And many other players,
like Miami's Keith Askins and Toronto's Kevin Willis, were adamant
about voicing their approval of the owners' final deal.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's union was splintering before his eyes. Preventing what
could have been the downfall of the union's leadership and chaos
among players, Hunter met with Stern through the night and reached
an agreement to save the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end, the players took control of their own destiny,''
said Thomas, who did not fly to New York Wednesday upon learning an
agreement was being put in place. ``Enough blood had been shed.
There wasn't a revolt but there was the potential for one.''
</P>
<P>
   Players and agents grew anxious as the league's deadline to
cancel the season approached. On Dec. 29, the union's negotiating
committee _ which had been given the authority to approve or
disapprove the owners' proposal _ rejected what Stern said was the
owners' final proposal and refused to put it before their
membership for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   As a tense week passed, several players spoke out and pleaded
for a chance to vote. When Hunter relented on Tuesday, and invited
every NBA player to town in order to vote to reaffirm the
negotiating committee's stance, the union was confident they had
the support of their membership. In a 24-hour period, that
confidence eroded.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys were fed up, and that's why a lot of guys came
and were going to give their opinions,'' Charles Oakley said.
``They were going to do that rather than scrapping the whole
season. Billy and them heard a lot of feedback from a lot of the
guys coming to town. And a lot of guys weren't coming to vote no to
the owners.''

GRIMACES, RATHER THAN HIGH-FIVES, AS PLAYERS LEARN NEWS OF
SETTLEMENT  
(JT) 
 BY JUDY BATTISTA   
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was no high-fiving in the elevators or
chest-thumping in the lobby of the GM Building as scores of NBA
players, grimaces chiseled on their faces, made their way from
Wednesday's meeting to ratify the new collective bargaining
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The high spirits that dominate so many games were nowhere to be
found as players _ who had made their way to New York expecting to
vote on whether they supported the union's negotiating committee in
rejecting the previous league proposal _ instead learned that a
deal had been struck late in the night that ended the 191-day
lockout. Many left the building with little or no comment, making
their way through a horde of hundreds of autograph seekers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm upset,'' said Jalen Rose. ``I spent $2,000 on a plane
ticket and I'm getting dressed and I hear they got a deal done and
I'm like `Why did I come?'''
</P>
<P>
   But most players were more relieved _ and resigned _ then angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad they came to an agreement,'' said the San Antonio
Spurs' David Robinson after the two-hour players' meeting. ``The
whole issue is we were going to take a pay cut no matter what. We
knew we were going to go backwards. Most guys understand this is
business, not personal. We don't have anything against David Stern.
He's obviously done a great job building up this league. The
players have done a great job building up this league, and it's now
time for us to get back together and re-establish some confidence
with the fans. This thing was really ugly _ not just ugly for us,
but for fans, for the people who work at arenas, for all the people
who love the NBA. It's time for us to show them how much we do care
about playing this game.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was obvious that the tension that has permeated the
lockout lingered still at the meeting. In the days leading up to
the settlement, an increasing number of players had expressed
discontent with negotiations. Terry Cummings of the Knicks
predicted that players, many of whom he thought were ill-informed
about the negotiations, would have been divided if the original
vote to endorse the negotiating committee's actions had been taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't that far apart, and every time we got off the
issues, we got more involved in ego and pride and that was
hindering the process,'' Cummings said. ``The fans deserve better.
The game is more important than the players and the owners. The
owners pay the players to play the game and the fans pay the
salaries for players to play. We have to understand the economics
of the game. We can't afford to let something like this happen to
our game. Our game is not as old as baseball and we can't afford a
lapse like baseball had. We have to be more concerned about the
overall perception of ourselves and our game.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' Jayson Williams had been one of the most outspoken
critics of the way negotiations had progressed, and had repeatedly
suggested that an arbitrator be brought in to expedite a
settlement. Last week, the Knicks' Patrick Ewing, the union
president, criticized Williams for taking his complaints public. In
Wednesday's meeting, Williams _ who had not attended earlier
gatherings _ came face to face with Ewing, a meeting Williams said
was ``intense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not taking credit for this thing,'' said Williams, when
asked if he thought his comments had spurred the union to cut a
deal. ``Give it to the guys on the executive board. I just did what
I had to do to get them to play basketball. I wasn't going against
the union. I'm still with Billy Hunter. I'm 100 percent union the
whole time. I'm proud of David Stern and I'm proud of Patrick
Ewing. They'll probably hate me for the next two or three weeks,
but I'll make them love me again.''
</P>
<P>
   If Williams was in his usual mood to joke, few others were.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scary,'' said Kenny Anderson. ``The last two nights I
couldn't sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Charles Barkley, who is never at a loss for a quip, seemed
somber as he made his way to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair enough and we have to accept it,'' Barkley said.
``We couldn't cancel the season. Obviously there's been some damage
done to the game. Both owners and players have done a disservice to
the game. Some of the fans are going to be mad. But you can't worry
about that. I'd say to the fans, `If you want to come to the game,
come. If you don't, we still have to do our jobs.'''
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, it seemed, players were grateful that at least
they had a job for the next few months. Kevin Willis, who in recent
weeks had been critical of the union, said he expected the
animosity that had driven this lockout would now end.
</P>
<P>
   ''My thing is to start playing basketball again,'' Willis said.
``Forget about the nonsense, the greed, and seeing how much money
you can get. If we can split the money, so be it. Anything else is
absolutely ridiculous.''

<P>
   ANDY-KAUFMAN-FILM (New York) _ The director Milos Forman stopped
the action with a delighted, ``Perfect, Perfect,'' and the crowd
reverted to unfashionably dressed extras recreating one of the
routinely bizarre moments in the career of the performer Andy
Kaufman, his Carnegie Hall Concert April 26, 1979, when he took
everyone in his entire audience of 2,800 people who chose to come
along in rented buses for milk and cookies at a nearby school when
the show ended. The comic's career ended in 1984 when he died of
cancer at the age of 35. The film on his life ``Man on the Moon,''
which is being directed by Forman and stars Jim Carrey is scheduled
for release sometime next fall. By Peter Applebome. (Moved).

   CANCER-FILMS (Undated) _ The Big C has always been a fruitful
subgenre of Old Movie Diseases. Actresses from Bette Davis (``Dark
Victory,'' brain tumor, 1939) to Debra Winger (``Terms of
Endearment,'' lymphoma, 1983) to Diane Keaton (``Marvin's Room,''
leukemia, 1997) have received Oscar nominations for playing cancer
victims. The latest Hollywood divas to brave cancer on the screen
are Meryl Streep (``One True Thing'') and Susan Sarandon
(``Stepmom''). Both play well-off, middle-aged domestic goddesses,
but only Ms. Streep is made to look ravaged by the disease. By
Franz Lidz. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DORIS-HUMPHREY-VIDEO (Undated) _ Five recently released video
cassettes concerning the dances of Doris Humphrey come variously
described. The packaging lists them as ``Coaching, Analysis and
Performance.'' A press release suggests ``Appreciation and Coaching
Documentaries.'' Speaking the same, somewhat awkward introduction
at the start of each video, Stephanie Clemens, a dancer and the
executive director of the Doris Humphrey National Society, refers
to them as ``instructional videos.'' By Robert Greskovic. (Moved).

   THEATER

<P>
   DAVID-LEVEAUX-THEATER (New York) _ David Leveaux is drawn to
plays that are ``killers,'' he says, and one could argue that this
English theater director certainly knows how to slay the New York
critics. Although he has worked only three times over the last 14
years on Broadway, where his production of Sophocles' ``Electra'' _
starring Zoe Wanamaker _ is currently playing at the Ethel
Barrymore Theater, on each occasion he has come away with mostly
raves. By Matt Wolf. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   CANBY-YEAREND-THEATER (Undated) _ Vincent Canby's reviews
`Cabaret'; `The Shaughraun' and `Bosoms and Neglect.' (Moved).

<P>
   CLASSICAL-MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   OLD-BROADWAY-SHOWS (Undated) _ There are many performing arts,
but they all ask the same questions. To judge from recent trips to
the theater, ``Swan Lake'' thrives while ``On the Town'' is doing
less well. Critics and audiences tend to love the first but can't
make up their minds about the second. By Bernard Holland. (Moved).

</P>
<P>
   GLASS-MUSIC (New York) _ By the late 1970s, Philip Glass was
poised to conquer the mainstream. ``Einstein on the Beach,'' of
1976, a non-narrative music-theater work created with the director
Robert Wilson, had solidified his reputation in the downtown arts
community. It had also served to clarify and codify Glass'
distinctive language. With remarkable facility, he explored new
media like film, dance and opera. Even today, he remains fascinated
with experimental hybrids of music and theater. ``Monsters of
Grace,'' a loose collaboration with Wilson, was given its premiere
last month at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Billed as the ``first
3-D digital opera,'' it promised revelation but delivered only
titillation, since its special effects seemed marginal to both
scenario and music. By K. Robert Schwarz. (Moved). Photo.

   BLUE-NOTE-RECORDS (Undated) _ When Alfred Lion, a refugee from
Nazi Germany, founded Blue Note Records in New York in 1939, he had
no idea that the small label would become an item of worship. This
month, celebrating its 60th anniversary, Blue Note is filling clubs
in Manhattan with past and present members of its roster. The
widespread adoration of the label has its roots in the Lion's
extraordinarily high level of artistic production. Over the years,
the label recorded Bud Powell, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, Art
Blakey, Freddie Hubbard and Wayne Shorter. No other record label in
jazz has been as consistent in quality. By Peter Watrous. (Moved).

   ONLINE-MUSEUMS (Undated) _ The number of museums on line has

tallies links to more than 10,000 museums in 120 countries. By

<P>
   ART-EXHIBITS-PLACES (Undated) _ Art gets around. Museums are
pretty well stuck in one spot, but their treasures keep on
truckin'. At a time when museums build buildings that tend to be
more significant than the collections they shelter, some centers
have gone the less expensive route of converting existing
industrial centers into galleries. A few others are experimenting
with putting art, at least temporarily, into essentially
unconverted places that respectable museums would once have thought
dreadfully infra dig: marginal retail areas, department stores,
dance halls. By Vicki Goldberg. (Moved).

<P>
   MUSEUMS-EXHIBIT-STRATEGIES (Undated) _ Many of the best ideas
for making Museums holdings and programs accessible and meaningful
to a public that is increasingly diverse _ and often feels left out

who are being summoned from their basement cubicles to take part in
curatorial planning and implementation. By Marcia Tucker. (Moved).

   DIJON-ARCHITECTURE (Dijon, France) _ In 1991, when Dijon's
political elders decided to embark on the city's largest urban
project in decades, they chose a quintessentially Miami
architecture firm to do the job. How come? In truth, the selection
of Arquitectonica, headed by the husband-and-wife team of Bernardo
Fort-Brescia and Laurinda Spear, was the consequence of an earlier,
perhaps more fundamental, moment: the recognition by Dijon that it
could modernize the city's image by sponsoring some daring
architecture. So Arquitectonica won the international competition
for the $200 million development by proposing a striking visual
symbol as well as a practical design. By Alan Riding. (Moved).

   FILMS-TV-SHOWS (Undated) _ Turning not-so-great movies into
prime-time series may be a growth industry. ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayers'' and at least two cable series _ ``La Femme Nikita'' and
``The Net'' _ have come into being that way. Television can be the
perfect environment for fine-tuning an imperfect film. The movie is
the failed prototype, offering a clear look at numerous mistakes to
avoid. And 13 hourlong episodes (rather than 90 movie minutes) can
give the characters enduring dimension. By Margy Rochlin. (Moved).

<P>
   KOETSU-ART-ANTIQUES (Washington) _ To his credit, the collector
Charles Lang Freer recognized the 17th century Japanese artist
Hon'ami Koetsu's accomplishments, particularly in calligraphy and
ceramics, and acquired several of his important works early in this
century. These formed ``the esthetic center of Freer's interest in
Japanese art,'' said Ann Yonemura, an associate curator at the
Freer Gallery of Art, who was an organizer of the current
exhibition, ``Japanese Art in the Age of Koetsu.'' It provides the
perfect complement to a larger show at the National Gallery
entitled ``Edo: Art in Japan 1615-1868.'' The 44 works on view at
the Freer, including paintings, calligraphy, ceramic vessels and
lacquer ware, demonstrate Koetsu's influence at a high artistic
moment when the traditional Heian culture in Kyoto was transformed
into a looser decorative style. By Paula Deitz. (Moved).

NBA MAY NOT FIND FANS SO FORGIVING  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By LENA WILLIAMS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There were fans like James Lowry of Chicago, a Bulls
season ticketholder for 20 years, who were overjoyed by the news
that the National Basketball Association and the NBA Players
Association had finally settled their labor differences and were
ready to begin play February 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're planning a party to celebrate the return of our extended
family,'' Lowry said by telephone from the offices of his
Chicago-based diversity firm. ``During the lockout, some of us
die-hard fans went to the Big Eight College Basketball Tournament,
but we realized it just ain't the same. So we consoled ourselves by
watching videotapes of old Bulls games. We really need an NBA
fix.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the reaction of dozens of fans interviewed
Wednesday on the streets of midtown Manhattan to the snow-covered
sidewalks of Chicago and Denver and inside popular sporting haunts
like Manhattan's All-Star Cafe, the NBA needs to be fixed and more
than a few had suggestions as to how.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody should show up for their first few games,'' said Paul
Thorn, who identified himself over lunch at the All-Star Cafe as a
``disgruntled fan.''
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, Robert Riley, a telecommunications specialist, plans
to stage a self-imposed protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm canceling cable,'' he said. ``The only reason I have cable
was for the NBA games.''
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Oguntuase of Jamaica, N.Y., hopes both the owners and
the players end up losing ``a ton of money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And they owe the fans an apology,'' said Oguntuase who's spent
the past few months getting reacquainted with some football.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how apathetic or angry the fans were over the 191-day
lockout, now that the teams will be back on the court, it's only a
matter of time before the crowds return to a game many admit they
admire in spite of its faults.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like me will go back,'' said Charles Bock, a Manhattan
lawyer who goes to more than 10 New York Knicks games a year.
``It's just a fun experience. Basketball doesn't have the tradition
of baseball, but it's got the speed, the moves and it's exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel DePasquale of Denver doesn't even mind that the level of
play, and players, may be somewhat rusty after a six months layoff
or that the league's 82-games season will be reduced to only a
semblance of itself at 52 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy about it,'' said the 23-year-old assistant manager
of The Sports Fan, a sporting goods store in downtown Denver.
``I've missed Sundays on the couch with those tripleheaders. I've
had that with football, but it's almost over and hockey doesn't do
it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion about the labor dispute have run the gamut from
apathy to anger. While many fans acknowledged they had only cursory
knowledge of the specific contractual issues that pitted
multi-millionaire athletes against multi-millionaire owners, the
overwhelming sentiment expressed by the man and woman on-the-street
was that both sides were greedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't figure out how to divide $2 billion?'' said Keri
Donohue of Bayonne, N.J. drawing nods of approval from her friend,
Gail Mulewski. ``The only people I feel sorry for in all this are
the vendors. The owners and the players should be made to
compensate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, more than a few fans said that the big men had forgotten
about the little men and women without whose support there wouldn't
be an NBA. To those suffering from a case of selective amnesia, the
fans had a two-word antidote: baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took baseball five years and an historic home-run race to
recover from its strike,'' said Rob Uttrich, a disc jockey at the
All-Star Cafe. ``Basketball is going to need a Mark McGwire and a
Sammy Sosa to win back the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Uttrich based his assessment on an informal survey of the
restaurant's patrons. He asked lunchtime diners to indicate by a
show of applause whether they were happy the strike was over, which
drew a smattering of applause, and whether they wished the lockout
had continued, which solicited medium applause. The loudest ovation
came in response to the question: who doesn't care at all.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey conducted by the Simmons Market Research
Bureau last Spring, 70.3 percent of Americans said they
``occasionally'' watch, listen to, or attend basketball games
during the year. Those likely to be show little interest in the
game tend to be older, working-class Americans who live in small
towns and rural communities. The game's biggest supporters tend to
live in major urban areas like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``People at the United Center are socialites, not fans, and will
continue to go to games because it's something to do,'' said Troy
Agler, 26, of Chicago. ``Maybe, teams in the smaller markets will
be hurt because they are more community-based and are patronized
more by actual basketball fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many fans said the players, more so than the owners,
will bear the brunt of the fans rage, others were reluctant to lay
blame in either court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a business,'' said Timur Cagarli, a 16-year-old high
school student who was visiting the Guggenheim Museum in New York
with his class. ``It revolves around the almighty dollar sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lowry, the Chicago Bulls loyalist, said the joy in
the windy city is tempered only by the thought that the season may
be tipping off without Michael. (everywhere, it seems, there's only
one Michael).
</P>
<P>
   ``Jordan may come back because it's a shortened season,'' said
Lowry in a moment of wishful thinking. ``Most of us think he's
coming back. I love this game, but without M.J. it's not going to
be the same.''

QUESTIONS ON NBA LOCKOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NBA came within 29 hours of becoming the first North
American sports league to cancel an entire season because of labor
unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Only an all-night bargaining session on the eve of a
self-imposed ``drop-dead'' date saved the NBA from that horrible
fate, and today owners are voting to ratify an agreement, rather
than a death certificate.
</P>
<P>
   The 190-day lockout is expected to end officially with the vote
in New York, leaving precious little time to pull together a
truncated season.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some questions and answers on the minds of NBA fans:
</P>
<P>
   Q. So why did it take so long to resolve the lockout?
</P>
<P>
   Because $2 billion in annual revenue _ and the league's
long-term financial stability _ was at stake. The sides were miles
apart when the lockout began July 1, and neither side budged much
in the first five months, each waiting for the other to flinch. It
took the threat of a canceled season to force a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Owners had demanded an absolute cap on player salaries and
wanted to limit the players' overall share to 52 percent of league
revenues. The players union wanted a share of up to 60 percent and
opposed any limits on individual salaries. They met in the middle
at 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will there be more labor trouble in the future?
</P>
<P>
   Not immediately. The labor contract is for six years, with a
league-controlled option for a seventh year. Of course, if the deal
doesn't work out to the players' liking, they could always strike.
But labor peace seems assured until at least 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can the NBA win back its fans?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it could slash ticket prices, admit kids for free, donate
a hundred million dollars to charity, force players to sign
autographs for an hour a day and maybe sign Mark McGwire to a
contract. None of that is likely to happen, so instead, the league
will rely on its vaunted marketing genius, some catchy Nike
commercials and the hope that Michael Jordan plays at least one
more season.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So will Jordan be back, leading the Bulls to a seventh
championship?
</P>
<P>
   That's the 34.7-million-dollar question _ the amount Jordan can
make if he returns to Bulls _ but so far he's mum on his plans. His
agent said Jordan will study his options. Jordan confidante Charles
Barkley of the Houston Rockets has insisted Jordan is done. If
that's the case, the Bulls might also lose Scottie Pippen and
Dennis Rodman, and their reign is over.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will the Lakers and Clippers look like?
</P>
<P>
   At this moment, a lot like they did last season. The Lakers have
nine players under contract, led by Shaquille O'Neal, Eddie Jones
and Kobe Bryant. The Clippers have 10 players under contract, led
by Lamond Murray, and have added No.1 draft pick Michael
Olowokandi. But once teams are allowed to sign free agents and make
trades, about a week from now, expect some significant changes. The
Lakers are expected to trade Elden Campbell, and the Clippers will
look for a new point guard, possibly by trading one of their
forwards. Also, the Clippers have to hire a coach after failing to
replace Bill Fitch after last season.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who are the best free agents available?
</P>
<P>
   Jordan tops the list, but only the Bulls can pay him the $34.7
million. The group of stars looking for work includes Barkley,
Pippen, Phoenix's Antonio McDyess, Minnesota's Tom Gugliotta,
Portland's Damon Stoudamire, Washington's Rod Strickland and New
Jersey's Jayson Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does a short season mean with regard to the schedule?
</P>
<P>
   The usual 82-game schedule is impossible, so each team will
probably play 52 games, starting about Feb. 2. The reduced schedule
still allows each team to play the 28 other teams at least once,
but not all teams will visit all cities. In order to play 52 games,
teams will occasionally have to play three consecutive nights, and
the NBA Finals will wrap up in late June.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can I buy tickets yet?
</P>
<P>
   For now, only season tickets are available. Once the NBA devises
the schedule, probably this weekend, individual game tickets will
be sold through TicketMaster.
</P>
<P>
   !arrowQ: How does the shorter season affect season-ticket
holders?
</P>
<P>
   They made a profit, perhaps the only party to do so. During the
lockout, the NBA ordered teams to refund unplayed games, plus 6
percent interest. They are otherwise unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does this affect the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   The logical answer is the NBA would drop the first round, reduce
the field of teams and make the playoffs more meaningful. But the
NBA and TV networks aren't about to sacrifice that revenue, so the
playoffs will remain intact. But the postseason will start a couple
weeks later than usual, and teams probably won't get to hold
minicamps between regular-season and postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there enough time for players to get ready for the season?
It depends on the player. Many have been playing pickup games daily
since last summer. But others, notably Cleveland forward Shawn
Kemp, have gone flabby during the layoff and won't be in shape in
time. Teams will be cautious during training camp and in the first
few weeks of the season. Still, expect training rooms to be
standing-but-limping-room-only with hamstring pulls and ankle
sprains.

 &HT;    DREAMSVILLE: Doing the bop in Tishomingo, Okla.
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (''Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in which readers share
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   N. Loutrelle Williams has come a long way from Tishomingo, Okla.
_ ``to Los Angeles, Montana, Dallas and various other places'' _ in
search of her dreams. Never mind that she ended up in Antlers,
Okla., just 75 miles from her childhood hometown. Here's her story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happened to Randolph Scott? I think he and some of my
other old acquaintances might still be sighted if I sat quietly in
the old picture show on a Saturday afternoon:
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy Rogers and Gene Autry may still ride the range. Joan
Crawford may still be there, tough and dramatic, and Ava Gardner,
soft and sexy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I picture my hometown of Tishomingo in my mind, the
Thompson Theater pops into view there on Main Street. Other
landmarks appear as readily:
</P>
<P>
   ``Our old swimming hole, the Millpond; the soda fountain behind
the big glass window in Cobb drugstore; the U-turn signs at the
east and west ends of Main Street. These were the boundaries of my
youth, my world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't wait to get our driver's license and join the
Saturday night parade down Main Street, starting at dusk and
continuing until preview time, 10:45 p.m., at the picture show.
Everybody had dates for the pre-showing of the Sunday movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in the Thompson Theater that I first held hands with a
boyfriend. His name was George.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie was 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.' The following Monday
at school most of the 13- and 14-year-old girls wore yellow scarves
or ribbons for that 'certain someone.'
</P>
<P>
   ``No X-rated movie today can compare to the sexual tension and
excitement present when George's arm dropped and his hand slowly,
ever so slowly, snaked over my arm, and his hand closed on mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those good old days, our summers were spent at Millpond in
one-piece bathing suits with modesty flaps. The beach was littered
with towels and bottles of baby oil laced with iodine. Someone had
a portable radio playing loudly such hits as 'Jambalaya!' or
'Maybelline.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys vied to perform the best swan dives and half-gainers,
while we girls lay on our towels and admired them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later, we all piled into somebody's car and drove to the
drugstore for cherry limes, vanilla Cokes or milkshakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``From grammar school on, we dreamed our dreams of going to the
moon, or to New York City _ both seemed equally removed from
Tishomingo. Some of us simply dreamed of a house, two children, two
cars and a boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``In search of my dreams, I moved to Los Angeles, Montana,
Dallas and various other places. But whenever I felt crowded or
stressed or lonesome, wherever I was, I turned to memories of my
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my best reveries, I'm dancing a jitterbug or a bop on a
sandy beach. There is a watermelon chilling in Millpond.''

 &HT;    A tangle of strings on Turner's U.N. gift
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What in the world could be easier than giving away
money?
</P>
<P>
   Almost anything, if you ask the people who run the U.N.
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation was set up a year ago this week to administer
Atlanta entrepreneur Ted Turner's gift of $1 billion over 10 years
to U.N.-related projects. Its task is to give away $100 million a
year to projects connected with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a catch: They're supposed to do it well.
</P>
<P>
   ``John D. Rockefeller once said that it's harder to give away a
million dollars effectively than it is to make a million dollars
honestly,'' said Tim Wirth, president of the U.N. Foundation. ``And
that is true.''
</P>
<P>
   Before a dime of grant money could be awarded, a welter of
details needed attention. Office space had to be found, of course,
and staff members hired.
</P>
<P>
   A board had to be formed. Goals had to be set, and suitable
projects identified and evaluated. The new foundation's
relationship to the United Nations itself had to be defined, which
involved, even, the creation of a new office in the U.N.
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Rules governing the accountability of projects _ how the
foundation can keep tabs on whether the money is being used
effectively _ had to be decided upon and legal documents drawn.
</P>
<P>
   And then the board had to sift through proposals, and decide
which were deserving of grants and were most likely to make some
difference in the world _ either by inspiring other donors to ante
up as well, or by serving as pilot projects that could be emulated
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Take it from Wirth, a former congressman, U.S. senator and U.S.
undersecretary of state for global affairs: Doing this job presents
a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the most difficult thing I've ever done,'' he said.
``There's no question about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Foundation operates out of a flatiron building on
Connecticut Avenue in Washington. The powder-blue flag of the
United Nations flies from the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Wirth occupies a triangular, well-lit office on the seventh
floor. As staff of 18 full-time employees (which may grow to 25 or
30) occupies the surrounding offices.
</P>
<P>
   The board has been set: It includes Wirth; Andrew Young, the
former U.S. ambassador to theUnited Nations and former Atlanta
mayor; Ruth Cardozo, the first lady of Brazil and expert on
children's issues; Graca Machel, a former education minister of
Mozambique and the wife of South African President Nelson Mandela;
Emma Rothschild, the director of the Center for History and
Economics at King's College at Cambridge, England; Maurice Strong,
a Canadian businessman who was secretary general of the Rio Earth
Summit; Muhammmad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh,
which pioneered small-scale credit programs for women; and Turner,
a man whom Wirth describes as very focused, smart, disciplined _
and ``fear-instilling'' in his blunt drive for perfection.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation aims to support the United Nations in several
ways _ by strengthening the secretary-general; promoting
cooperation between different U.N. agencies; and creating support
for the United Nations among the American people, which might
induce the American government to pay off its arrears, which the
United Nations says now stands at $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the board decided to concentrate its grants in
three broad areas: children's health, the environment and issues
relating to women and population control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they're areas of concern to Ted,'' said Wirth.
``And they were things the secretary-general seemed to think made
sense. And they are issues that are difficult to do politically.''
</P>
<P>
   In two rounds of grants in its first year, the U.N. Foundation
gave money to projects with goals as diverse as providing vitamin
supplements to mothers in West Timor, Indonesia, ($860,000 over two
years) to the demobilization of child soldiers in the African
nation of Sierra Leone ($1.1 million over one year).
</P>
<P>
   Other projects that have received funding aim to reduce violence
against women in Latin America, increase the production in Burkina
Faso of shea butter (a fat from the seeds of the shea tree used in
making moisturizing soaps and lotions), and prevent female genital
mutilation in six African countries.
</P>
<P>
   You've got an idea and want some of that money? It doesn't work
that way.
</P>
<P>
   All proposals must come from U.N. agencies. The proposals
relating to vitamins for mothers and demobilizing child soldiers,
for example, came from UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund.
The shea butter project is run by UNIFEM, the U.N. Development Fund
for Women.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Foundation people will be happier when they receive a
greater number of proposals that involve more than one U.N. agency,
such as the one designed to reduce violence against women, which is
a joint project of eight of them.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. agencies cannot make their proposals for Turner money
directly to the U.N. Foundation for fear that might weaken the
authority of the U.N. secretary-general rather than strengthen it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they must submit their proposals to UNFIP, the newly
created U.N. Fund for International Partnerships, which decides
whether they are worthy of being passed on to the U.N. Foundation.
The head of UNFIP reports directly to Secretary-General Kofi Annan
so that, in essence, no projects can receive funding without
Annan's approval.
</P>
<P>
   With all that to do, the actual granting of money has lagged
behind schedule. Instead of $100 million in 1998, the U.N.
Foundation gave away $55 million.
</P>
<P>
   A new round of grants will be announced late this month, and
this year should be better, said foundation spokesman David
Harwood.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, however, agrees that more money is better _ or
that donating any money at all to U.N. agencies is a worthwhile
thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complete waste of money,'' said Michael Maren, an
author and former aid worker whose book ``The Road to Hell''
chronicles in excruciating detail the devastation that
international development aid can sometimes wreak.
</P>
<P>
   Maren argues that, by pouring money into the United Nations,
which he says is ``bureaucratically moribund'' and horrendously
ineffective, Turner is throwing good money after bad. And $100
million a year, compared to the U.N.'s annual budget of about $4
billion for development projects, is a piddling amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd be better off opening CNN bureaus in all these countries
and hiring and training local people,'' Maren said. ``These are
permanent things.''
</P>
<P>
   Maren pointed out, too, that the United Nations is composed of
its member governments and cannot act against their will. Those
governments, he said, are often the cause of poverty and need to be
replaced, but instead they use aid to prop themselves up.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, not surprisingly, has a different view.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N., like any large institution, is overly bureaucratic,
but that does not justify inaction, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving toward globalization,'' he said. ``We're in an
era where we have to play the international game. As the world's
sole superpower, we have to be engaged and be involved in the
United Nations. We need to show leadership. And we can't just do it
by dropping bombs on people. We've got to try to help them, too, or
else everybody else is going to be against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner said he is aware that, on a global scale, his gift is not
large.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hundred million is a very small amount,'' he said. ``We know
that. But maybe we can set an example. Maybe we can get other
people of great wealth to try the same thing. We're trying to do
kind of a pilot project here.''
</P>
<P>
   And the comparatively small size of the gift makes it all the
more important that the money be invested wisely, which he called
``a daunting task.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look at the situation as hopeless, so let's just drink
a lot and go to Las Vegas and gamble,'' he said. ``Or we can roll
up our sleeves and try.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of what makes the job so difficult, Wirth said, is the high
expectations he and others at the U.N. Foundation put on
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   What, at the end of the 10 years and $1 billion, would Wirth
consider evidence of success?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, if we found 20 other Ted Turners,'' he said. ``If we
had eliminated a couple of diseases, and we had developed a number
of other institutions like our own, elsewhere _ you know, if there
were a U.N. Foundation in Germany and Brazil and China and India.
If we had a strong constituency in the U.S. so that we paid off the
debt, and U.N. funding was something everybody agreed with. And if
we had on our board three or four very, very significant private
sector people who had really committed their institutions to trying
to get other private sector groups engaged, then that would be a
success.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a tall order and more, Wirth acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we pull it off, it'll be terrific,'' he said. ``And you
know, we might pull it off.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For all the impeachment foreboding washing about
the corridors of the Capitol Wednesday, the new Congress first
faced the vital routine of democracy and the unabashed joy of its
political survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, the House reading clerk had to buck the celebratory
buzz of a fresh crop of winners waiting to be sworn in as he
dispatched one piece of business as just another routine bit of
congressional foolscap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without objection, the letter of resignation of the honorable
Newt Gingrich will be inserted in the record,'' the clerk rapidly
concluded. The floor chatter of happy political survivors
overwhelmed this postscript to the career of former speaker
Gingrich, the grand winner of the 1994 elections, now gone
completely from the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revolution? What revolution?'' asked Rep. Peter King, smiling
gently at the once celebrated ``Gingrich revolution'' of 1994 as if
it dated to the sepia days of the Teapot Dome. King, like most
congressional survivors, threw a simple office party for himself
and his constituents. And on this wintry day of impeachment
anxieties, it became an occasion to consider some of the passing
wonders of politics as well as the fate of President Clinton
pending in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess democracy is just stronger than the people who take
part in it,'' the New York Republican said rather hopefully. ``It's
going to outlast all of us. Our country has amazing resilience.''
</P>
<P>
   National resilience was the patriotic watchword as both houses
offered an opening day of Breughelesque sweep.
</P>
<P>
   The laughter and wails of small children laced the House floor
as their beaming parents pledged their oath for a better nation.
Off the floor, the president's harshest critics continued to
propose that the Senate consider scrofulous hearsay tales in
documents in a House evidence room even though they received no
credit in the formal impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   Over in the Capitol's other half, the Senate chaplain, the Rev.
Lloyd Ogilvie, prayed above the lawmakers at the nation's ``awesome
moment.'' He beseeched the Almighty, ``Save them from the seduction
of human power.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators soon were offering one another serial standing ovations
of bipartisan applause, as if for Darwinian survival itself, as
they were sworn in to fresh terms in groups of four.
</P>
<P>
   Out in the corridors, a shadow of grim ritual impended as staff
experts announced the formal details of the Senate's impeachment
trial, down to the doorway Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist will
use as he arrives to preside. In a side room, news photographers
closed in on an inert oddity on a desk top: a pile of impeachment
trial tickets the public already is reported clamoring for.
</P>
<P>
   Returning senators told of being buttonholed furiously about the
trial by constituents. ``This has divided the country bitterly,''
said Robert Kerrey, D-Neb., exuding gloom at the uncertainties of
the trial. ``I wish people felt so strongly about other issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the visitors gallery, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the
donnish New York Democrat, arrived for ``the meeting of the
eights'' _ a private bipartisan conference of 16 senators who
searched through the day for a workable trial procedure, struggling
into the very eve of the trial's opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the subject of witnesses, I'm arriving as the Federalist
man,'' Moynihan sprightly declared. He brandished a dog-earred
paperback copy of ``The Federalist Papers,'' ready to quote
Hamilton to the gathering. He did not hesitate to share some aloud
in the corridor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most extraordinary things are being written about what
this new office of president will be,'' read the senator, obviously
savoring Hamilton's counsel across time. He had marked the founding
father's satirical, if now prescient, reference to critics'
warnings that Americans studying their presidents might some day
have ``to blush at the unveiled mysteries of a future seraglio.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering the meeting of the eights, Moynihan closed the book and
spoke for himself. ``If we can just get a trial without
witnesses,'' he said, sounding near prayerful, ``We will take all
the time necessary. But we won't get into something the nation has
had enough of.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The opening day's smattering of public debate revealed one House
newcomer having trouble smartly pronouncing the word
``divisiveness.'' But fresh opportunities will undoubtedly arise,
according to the cautions from veterans about the ``poisonous
politics'' ever infecting the place. At dusk, partying House
members were interrupted for a roll-call vote to reappoint
Republican members who will be arguing the Senate case that Clinton
should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do we go from here?'' the new speaker, Dennis Hastert,
asked the House after the welcoming round of bipartisan applause
had passed. The simple question seemed poignant in the face of the
political wreckage the new Congress was inheriting from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully plain-spoken rather than fiery, Hastert took a moment
to remember a predecessor. ``Thank you, Newt,'' he said, looking up
as if into the political ether. ``Good luck and God bless you.''
</P>
<P>
   King did not deny that he counted himself a happy survivor as he
played host at his re-election party. But he thought briefly of
Gingrich, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years ago Newt was literally Moses, the Messiah, whatever
_ he was everywhere,'' said King as he began his fourth term
sounding grateful to constituents but wary at the knife-edged ways
of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``How harsh a business politics can be,'' King observed amid the
celebration's happy scene. ``And how unforgiving it can be. When
you're gone, you're gone.''

 &HT;    A tangle of strings on Turner's U.N. gift
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What in the world could be easier than giving away
money?
</P>
<P>
   Almost anything, if you ask the people who run the U.N.
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation was set up a year ago this week to administer
Atlanta entrepreneur Ted Turner's gift of $1 billion over 10 years
to U.N.-related projects. Its task is to give away $100 million a
year to projects connected with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a catch: They're supposed to do it well.
</P>
<P>
   ``John D. Rockefeller once said that it's harder to give away a
million dollars effectively than it is to make a million dollars
honestly,'' said Tim Wirth, president of the U.N. Foundation. ``And
that is true.''
</P>
<P>
   Before a dime of grant money could be awarded, a welter of
details needed attention. Office space had to be found, of course,
and staff members hired.
</P>
<P>
   A board had to be formed. Goals had to be set, and suitable
projects identified and evaluated. The new foundation's
relationship to the United Nations itself had to be defined, which
involved, even, the creation of a new office in the U.N.
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Rules governing the accountability of projects _ how the
foundation can keep tabs on whether the money is being used
effectively _ had to be decided upon and legal documents drawn.
</P>
<P>
   And then the board had to sift through proposals, and decide
which were deserving of grants and were most likely to make some
difference in the world _ either by inspiring other donors to ante
up as well, or by serving as pilot projects that could be emulated
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Take it from Wirth, a former congressman, U.S. senator and U.S.
undersecretary of state for global affairs: Doing this job presents
a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the most difficult thing I've ever done,'' he said.
``There's no question about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Foundation operates out of a flatiron building on
Connecticut Avenue in Washington. The powder-blue flag of the
United Nations flies from the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Wirth occupies a triangular, well-lit office on the seventh
floor. As staff of 18 full-time employees (which may grow to 25 or
30) occupies the surrounding offices.
</P>
<P>
   The board has been set: It includes Wirth; Andrew Young, the
former U.S. ambassador to theUnited Nations and former Atlanta
mayor; Ruth Cardozo, the first lady of Brazil and expert on
children's issues; Graca Machel, a former education minister of
Mozambique and the wife of South African President Nelson Mandela;
Emma Rothschild, the director of the Center for History and
Economics at King's College at Cambridge, England; Maurice Strong,
a Canadian businessman who was secretary general of the Rio Earth
Summit; Muhammmad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh,
which pioneered small-scale credit programs for women; and Turner,
a man whom Wirth describes as very focused, smart, disciplined _
and ``fear-instilling'' in his blunt drive for perfection.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation aims to support the United Nations in several
ways _ by strengthening the secretary-general; promoting
cooperation between different U.N. agencies; and creating support
for the United Nations among the American people, which might
induce the American government to pay off its arrears, which the
United Nations says now stands at $1.5 billion.

three broad areas: children's health, the environment and issues
relating to women and population control.

``And they were things the secretary-general seemed to think made

gave money to projects with goals as diverse as providing vitamin
supplements to mothers in West Timor, Indonesia, ($860,000 over two

nation of Sierra Leone ($1.1 million over one year).
</P>
<P>
   Other projects that have received funding aim to reduce violence
against women in Latin America, increase the production in Burkina
Faso of shea butter (a fat from the seeds of the shea tree used in
making moisturizing soaps and lotions), and prevent female genital
mutilation in six African countries.
</P>

   You've got an idea and want some of that money? It doesn't work
that way.
</P>
<P>
   All proposals must come from U.N. agencies. The proposals
relating to vitamins for mothers and demobilizing child soldiers,
for example, came from UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund.
The shea butter project is run by UNIFEM, the U.N. Development Fund
for Women.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Foundation people will be happier when they receive a
greater number of proposals that involve more than one U.N. agency,
such as the one designed to reduce violence against women, which is
a joint project of eight of them.
</P>

   U.N. agencies cannot make their proposals for Turner money

If we had a strong constituency in the U.S. so that we paid off the
debt, and U.N. funding was something everybody agreed with. And if
we had on our board three or four very, very significant private
sector people who had really committed their institutions to trying
to get other private sector groups engaged, then that would be a
success.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a tall order and more, Wirth acknowledged.

A DREAM-WORLD SCRAMBLE OVER MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ We are left to ask what the whole thing was all about.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball strike of 1994-95 was all about deciding how
management and players were going to divide an estimated $1 billion
in revenues. The basketball lockout of 1998-99 was all about
deciding how management and players were going to divide an
estimated $2 billion in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   In a sport with just 12 players on a team.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things we learned from this disastrous six months of
arguing about great gobs of money is that the NBA players have been
so disgustingly spoiled by society's worship of their skills that
they have absolutely no perspective. They really do not accept the
fact that they live in a dream world. This is probably not a news
bulletin, but I'm not sure we all fully grasped the degree of their
insularity until now.
</P>
<P>
   Did they actually believe the public would identify any of them
as oppressed workers? Did they actually believe the public would
sympathize with the quest of the $3 million man to make $5 million,
the $8 million man to make $12 million, or the $15 million man to
become Michael Jordan? Did they actually believe the public would
have the slightest amount of sympathy for players in a league where
the minimum salary was $250,000 (it will now be much higher) and
the median salary was $1.2 million?
</P>
<P>
   What is the matter with these people?
</P>
<P>
   When the lockout was imposed, they were already the highest-paid
athletes in American sport, by every measure. They enjoy fabulous
working conditions, flying around the country in chartered planes
equipped with every conceivable luxury, staying in four-star
hotels, and generally being treated by both their organizations and
the public as traveling royalty.
</P>
<P>
   The players also seemed to have lost sight of the fact that we
live in a capitalist society. The owners put up the money and take
all the risks. They are entitled to a profit, and why shouldn't it
be a hefty profit? That is the very nature of our system.
Left-leaning idealists might wish for some sort of worker ownership
situation, but we're nowhere close to having that in any of our
sporting ventures, and we probably never will be.
</P>
<P>
   What is so apparent, and so little-discussed, is the notion that
these so-called sports unions aren't unions in the real sense at
all, nor can they ever be. Labor-management negotiations in sports
are farcical. They have nothing to do with real-life
labor-management negotiations because in real life, the workers
really are all equal. There are no star players, regular players,
or fringe players in a real union. There are no individual
contracts in a real union. There are no hardball agents demanding
back-breaking salaries for stars that will, by definition, suppress
the earning capabilities of lower-profile teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, there was a real need for sports unions.
Players really were exploited by uncaring owners. Fifty years ago,
no one in professional basketball, or any other sport, had health
benefits. There was no minimum salary, no pension, no body of rules
governing working conditions. It was a take-it-or-leave-it world,
and that wasn't right, either. But the salary gap between the
highest-paid players and the lowest-paid players wasn't that
significant. They really were in it together.
</P>
<P>
   Securing those basic rights is the most important function of
sports unions. You've got to stay on top of owners; we all
understand that. Few owners get into sport with altruistic intent.
But that doesn't change the simple reality that no sports union can
hope to serve the interests of all when within its umbrella, so
many people have so many individual agendas.
</P>
<P>
   The great fiction of the NBA lockout from the players' viewpoint
was that they were all in something together. It just wasn't so. It
was always all about the high-end players and their agents, and
nothing else. How could the rank-and-file have been so naive as to
think that Billy Hunter, David Falk, and Arn Tellem were looking
out for their best interests? If the stars cared about anything
other than themselves, they wouldn't place clubs in such impossible
salary binds. Can't they see that?
</P>
<P>
   I had to laugh when Hunter would lament the growing number of
players making the minimum salary. Did he ever stop to think that
perhaps the Shaquille O'Neals and Kevin Garnetts of the world were
the reason? If people like that are making $15 million-$20 million
a year, what is left for the others? Wouldn't $8 million or $10
million be enough?
</P>
<P>
   Well, no, nothing is ever enough. We have baseball players
signing $90 million contracts laden with, of all things, incentive
clauses. And we have NBA players, members of the highest-paid union
in the universe, acting insulted because someone is asking to cap
their potential earnings at $14 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   People are always asking the owners to say no, aren't they?
Finally, they did, but it was not as if they all morphed into
Ebenezer Scrooge. When it's all said and done, the NBA players will
have retained the honor of being our best-paid athletes. By
accepting this deal, the players are not being plunged into penury.
There can still be a luxury car in the driveway for both the player
and his lady.
</P>
<P>
   A frightening percentage of NBA players have been led to believe
since the age of 13 or so that they were Chosen People. Recruited
by high schools, AAU teams, and colleges, and fawned over by
everyone they've met, they have a well-developed sense of
entitlement. We created this monster, and the NBA owners are
finally attempting to tame it.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're going to find out if anyone still cares.

<P>
   NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. _ Let's give the devil his due. The S.S.
Michigan has had trouble, serious trouble. So much so that some
might think it was possessed.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Bill Kelly and his wife, Gay Wassall-Kelly, knew the
score about the Michigan before they ever bought the stubby
mackerel boat, which was built in the 1940s and then converted to a
miniature tugboat. In its 50-odd years, it has sunk nine times,
caught fire and had its hull stove in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we took her out, we had problems, something always
happened,'' said Wassall-Kelly, a San Fernando Valley expatriate
living dockside in Newport Beach.
</P>
<P>
   If you doubt the Michigan is hell-bent on being hell-born,
consider:
</P>
<P>
   _It was mired in muck and submerged by its fifth birthday, and
sat on the bottom throughout the late 1940s and early '50s.
</P>
<P>
   _It once sank after being hit with a can of beer fired from a
cannon during a boat parade.
</P>
<P>
   _After being fitted with a fiberglass bottom to help keep it
afloat, the Michigan promptly popped out of the fiberglass and sank
again.
</P>
<P>
   _Lloyds of London, the maritime insurer that routinely issues
policies for freighters in wartime, is said to have refused
coverage for the Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Michigan has had so many problems and spent so much
time stranded at every dock in Newport Harbor that it became a
status symbol to have it break down near your pier.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Rev. Joe Warren, federally licensed sea captain,
ordained minister and boat exorcist.
</P>
<P>
   While Warren would much rather officiate weddings at sea _ his
first calling _ than ridding boats of demons, as he sees it, it's a
job that has to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been recognized for centuries that Jonahs have been
aboard vessels,'' said Warren, who's from Newport Beach. ``Both
ethereal and physical beings can cause a great deal of havoc aboard
ships at sea. We see things from a traditional prospective, not a
scientific one.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren, a mixture of Jimmy Buffett and Jimmy Swaggart, Tom
Selleck and Thomas Aquinas, with a touch of Father Guido Sarducci
for good measure, is not quick to put a vessel through the ordeal
of exorcism. To date, he has had to perform only three.
</P>
<P>
   According to Warren, who has been ministering to the Michigan
since early November, the root of the problem is simple _ the
confused soul of a dead Norwegian fisherman.
</P>
<P>
   The man had died at sea and instead of going toward the light,
his spirit returned to his old boat, his place of greatest comfort,
to do mischief, Warren claims.
</P>
<P>
   When he's got a possession on his hands, Father Warren turns to
a pair of divining rods to locate the spirit. On the Michigan, the
evil dwelled in a spot on the starboard side of its deckhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Warren keeps a Torah-like scroll in an ark and otherwise
conducts a simple service involving ritual confession once a week,
after which a bottle of sacramental wine is given to the celebrant
who unburdens the most shameful confession.
</P>
<P>
   The exorcism aboard the Michigan started off unassumingly
enough. With great ceremony, Warren ignited a small can of Sterno,
picked up two small divining rods and reaffirmed the center of the
evil. His apprentices, Brothers John Hammond and Johnny O'Connell,
huddled around the offending side of the Michigan's wheelhouse.
``The Michigan is filled with seething evil!'' Warren bellowed,
raising his arms in defiance and righteous indignation.
</P>
<P>
   The chants and litany of Warren's apprentices pierced the
tranquility of the quiet dockside neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses to the service wore black and garlic-clove necklaces.
Some drank beer. Passers-by stopped and stared.
</P>
<P>
   Then Warren read from ``The Expulsion of Demonic Forces from
Vessels,'' a text he himself wrote. Incense was burned in censers.
A small miracle was performed as Warren turned Newport Harbor water
_ some of the filthiest water south of Marina del Rey _ into a
purified state. In an act that was nothing less than, well, icky,
Brother Hammond vomited into a font in an effort to purge the
demons that had been transferred from the boat to his body. Warren
nearly singed his eyebrows in a flameout and the ceremony was
basically over.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Michigan will stay afloat remains to be seen, but,
even if it does, the exorcist has his detractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing as haunted houses or haunted boats,''
said Dr. Michael Shermer, author of ``Why People Believe Weird
Things'' and editor at Altadena-based Skeptic Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does one boat have more trouble than another? Why are some
cars lemons? We are storytelling, pattern-seeking animals that try
to interpret our environment and explain it,'' Shermer said.
``Whenever there's a gap in our knowledge, we attempt to explain it
by summoning forth supernatural forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Summoning such forces may not have been exactly what Warren's
mother, an Italian immigrant, was hoping for when she prayed that
one of her three sons would become a priest.
</P>
<P>
   After a stint at the University of San Francisco, Warren moved
to Southern California and founded the Order of the Brothers of the
Riverboat Angela Louise. It is a nondenominational ministry, though
it is not without ``certain Catholic spikes,'' as Warren puts it.
</P>
<P>
   He got started exorcising demons from vessels after trouble
began brewing on his own boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Angela Louise had a powerful mojo going on,'' said Warren.
``A mojo is an icon that contains strong magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I bought her, I had to transit her from Shelter Island
(in San Diego) to Newport Harbor. The journey was beset by incident
after incident _ electrical, machinery, fuel, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the problems were of a demonic nature. I knew full well
I was taking the vessel away from her home, where she had been for
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found a rosary aboard that had belonged to the owner's
mother. (It) was originally there for good luck,'' Warren said.
But, for him, it was a bad omen.
</P>
<P>
   He cast the rosary into the sea, an act he felt would cleanse
the vessel. He also renamed the craft, which is always dangerous
from a spiritual standpoint. He then installed his own good mojos.
One of which was his mother's St. Christopher medal.
</P>
<P>
   So, does it work? Are all of his clients convinced their boats
have become demon-free?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, they are completely satisfied with the outcome of
the exorcisms,'' said Warren, who performs the rite in return for a
donation, which is loosely based on the afflicted boat owner's
ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee it from repossession _ unless, of course, there's
a lien on the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Michigan) is riding about 4 inches higher in the water,''
said Bill Kelly, cautiously optimistic over the result.
</P>
<P>
   The skeptics may have their doubts, but when a boat sinks at the
drop of a dime, the truth may lie somewhere between the devil and
the deep blue sea.

HOME SALES UP AND MARKETS LIKE THAT DIRECTION
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Conn., Texas, Mass., Germany, Brazil)  DOLLAR UP, OIL UP, By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 
 
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nothing but up. So said stock markets around the
world Wednesday, wowing investors with one-day gains of better than
2 percent and in some markets, more than 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only three days old, 1999 already looks like a banner year for
equities. The Dow Jones industrial average has risen 3.96 percent.
The Nasdaq composite index, which gained just under 40 percent last
year is up 5.84 percent. Germany's benchmark DAX index has risen
8.28 percent, and the Bovespa index of Brazil, which was beaten
down in 1998, has leapt 7.97 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All the major U.S. stock gauges _ the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, the
Nasdaq composite index and the Dow industrials _ are trading at
their highs. The Dow closed Wednesday at 9,544.97, up 1.8 percent
from its former peak of 9,374.27 on Nov. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Driving this euphoria is a conviction among investors that
gloomy economic predictions have been overstated. ``It's a show-me
market,'' said John L. Manley Jr., senior equity strategist at
Salomon Smith Barney. ``Investors are saying, `We've been waiting
for this recession for so long now and it hasn't materialized.' Now
they're saying `Prove to me we're going into a recession or I'm
going to buy stocks.'''
</P>
<P>
   Early January jumps in stocks are not unusual. In 1988,
according to Birinyi Associates, a money management firm in
Greenwich, Conn., stocks rose 3.9 percent in the first day of
trading. In the first two days of 1987, stocks began the year up
3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that stock prices often rise in January is the
tendency among investors to change where they put their retirement
accounts when they open a new calendar. Although most can make
changes in their accounts any time, investors often decide to
switch investments with the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   The most common change is to shift more money into whatever
performed best during the previous year. It is likely then that
investors moving money around now are doing two things.
</P>
<P>
   First, they are probably increasing their holdings in technology
stocks, which dominate the Nasdaq Composite, and have given the
biggest boost to that index.
</P>
<P>
   Second, they are likely shifting money from funds that have
lagged behind the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 _ more than 90 percent of
actively managed funds underperformed their benchmarks last year _
into those like the Vanguard 500 that mirror this index.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of these changes can be found in the disparity early
this year in the performance of big company stocks, like those in
the S&AMP;P 500 and the Dow, the small company stocks in the Russell
2000 index. While the Dow Jones and the S&AMP;P 500 have both blown
through their former all-time highs, the Russell 2000 is still 7.7
percent below its peak of last July. The small-stock index is up
only 1.4 percent in 1999. Although Wednesday's advance in big
company stocks was fairly broad, it did not lift all boats. For
every two stocks that gained, one declined. IBM, for example, fell
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors contributed to the broad market rally. The
Commerce Department reported that sales of new homes rose in
November to a record high, indicating that the economy is strong
and demand for appliance, furniture and other consumer goods to
fill these houses will continue to be robust.
</P>
<P>
   Another lift came from oil prices, which rose more than 3
percent following the news that oil inventories in the United
States had taken their biggest decline in 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Higher oil prices, while a pain in the neck for consumers, are
a positive for developing countries,'' said Jack Shaughnessy, chief
investment strategist at Advest Inc., in Boston. ``Anything that
tends to ease their financial stress is good for world markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The freefall in commodity prices, a sign of slow or negative
growth around the world, seems to have been stopped, leading some
investors to conclude that the worst of global economic turmoil is
behind us. The Commodity Research Bureau's index, which stood at
187 on Dec. 15, closed Wednesday at 197.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CRB was the last thing hanging out there that indicated a
problem in world economic growth,'' said James Paulsen, chief
investment office at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. But
firming commodity prices will also help U.S. corporations, Paulsen
argues, by allowing them to increase their prices and bolster their
profit margins. Companies have found it difficult to raise prices
in recent years, which has slowed earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   Because corporate earnings felt the pinch of Asia's economic
woes in the first quarter of 1998, investors also suspect the first
quarter of this year will look good in comparison. For investors
who still care about old-fashioned things like earnings growth,
improvements from a year earlier usually translate into higher
stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   As stocks ran away Wednesday, some market strategists speculated
that the overall market had been infected by the fever that has
Internet stocks sizzling.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning? When investors are willing to pay 80 times
revenues for Amazon.com or 366 times sales for Ebay Inc., why not
push Microsoft shares to 64 times estimated earnings? That lofty
level seems cheap in comparison, even though it is three times the
historical market average.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks and bonds also benefitted Wednesday by a sharp rise in
the dollar against the Euro. That currency, in its first days of
trading, fell from 1.1720 against the dollar at the close of
trading in Europe to 1.1568. Traders said that when Euro traders in
Europe went home, a lot of the support for the currency
disappeared. When trading shifted to New York, the market started
to dip and found little support. With the dollar rising, the
Treasury market bounced as well, and bonds closed at their highs
for the day. The move in the dollar also gave a kick to stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest propellant for stocks so far this year is the
explosive growth in the supply of money in the United States, a
factor that has contributed to higher stock prices for months.
Money supply is growing at an annualized rate of 11 percent, far
above what's needed to finance the growth in the nation's gross
domestic product. An enormous amount of the excess money is finding
its way into the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   This makes for an interesting dilemma for the Federal Reserve
Board, points out Ned Riley, chief investment officer of
BankBoston. ``The Fed has resurrected the irrational exuberance it
was trying to temper earlier,'' he said. ``The creation of all this
money and lower interest rates have tended to fuel more
speculation.'' The next meeting of the Fed's policy-making
committee, in February, ``is going to draw a lot of attention to
this speculative frothy market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost nobody thinks the federal bank will change its stance on
interest rates, which is toward lower rates, not higher. As long as
the bank isn't going to step in and spoil the party by raising
rates, stocks will likely remain on a power trip.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many professional investors were puzzled by Wednesday's
move in stocks. Frederick E. Rowe Jr., head of Greenbrier Partners,
a money management firm in Dallas, echoed the views of many big
investors when he said: ``I don't pretend to understand it, but I
don't want to get in the way of it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NANJIE, China _ In the center of this well-kept community stands
a giant statue of Mao Zedong, complete with honor guard, that was
erected only in 1993 _ well after many places had torn down
monuments to the late chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Along the surrounding avenues stand tidy apartments and humming
factories. Nearly every wall is freshly painted with slogans from
the 1960s like ``Put Ideology First'' and ``Let Chairman Mao
Thought Radiate Forever.''
</P>
<P>
   In an age often marked by an economic free-for-all, the village
of Nanjie is a dinosaur: Its farm, its factories, its housing are
all collectively owned and managed.
</P>
<P>
   Residents must attend regular study sessions of Mao's teachings,
and their take-home pay does not exceed $30 a month. But each
family receives the needs of life free, including identical homes,
television sets, flour and eggs, busts of Chairman Mao and a daily
bottle of beer per person.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as a socialist success, Nanjie, in the central province
of Henan, is often cited as a paragon by China's ``leftists'' _ the
dwindling, old-guard Communist critics of China's rush from
ideology and state planning. As one admirer recently wrote, Nanjie
is a place of ``truly shared prosperity,'' where people ``uphold
what is public and spurn what is private.''
</P>
<P>
   But the very fame of this strange showcase suggests just how
anomalous it is today _ and how far those leftists have fallen as
President Jiang Zemin leads the country toward a market economy.
China remains under authoritarian one-party rule, led by people who
do not hesitate to arrest anyone who threatens the primacy of the
Communist Party, but who have jettisoned most of Communism's
economic principles, leaving the remaining ``leftists'' in despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamentalist left has lost any influence over Chinese
politics and society,'' said Xiao Gongqin, a historian at Shanghai
Normal University.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the case in Russia, where the economy collapsed and
nostalgia for the cocoon of Communism is powerful, China's economic
boom has largely diluted popular demands for old-line solutions.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the old left fades, new social critics are emerging
who are more democratic in their politics but share many of the
left's social ideals and are appalled by the inequalities and
corruption of China's ``market socialism.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the beleaguered democracy dissidents, these new critics,
sometimes called ``new populists'' or ``new leftists,'' have not
run afoul of the law. They spend more time dissecting the economy
than political trends, and they are more suspicious of free markets
and global capital.
</P>
<P>
   But if the rapid growth that has been China's universal solvent
should stall for long, these critics believe, their ideas _
speaking to everyday complaints of the common people _ could have a
broad and explosive appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The old leftists, in Chinese terms, are a mostly elderly group
of Marxist intellectuals and retired officials who remain deeply
committed to state ownership of key sectors and strong party
control over society. They still worry about threats like
``bourgeois liberalization'' and China's ``peaceful evolution''
into a capitalist society _ code phrases for a steady erosion of
Communist principles, abetted by the West.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of the reform period started by Deng Xiaoping
in 1978 until recently, the leftists' influence undulated, but they
remained a key balancing force in Beijing politics, supported by
powerful party elders.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful leftist bloc came in handy for Deng, for example,
when he felt he had to squelch the rising liberal tide associated
with the Tiananmen Square demonstrations in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Now those elder patrons have mostly died. The current
leadership, led by Jiang, is certainly committed to the Communist
Party's monopoly on power. But especially with the program to
drastically reshape or sell off state industries, party leaders
have abandoned key tenets of socialism, the leftists charge.
</P>
<P>
   The left's chief patron in recent years has been Deng Liqun, a
once-powerful confidant of Mao and then Deng Xiaoping who broke
with the latter over ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Deng Liqun is now 83 and in poor health, and the Contemporary
China Research Institute he founded in Beijing to propagate leftist
views is kept at arms length by a wary government. A journal
associated with the institute, Trends in Contemporary Thought,
remains a leading leftist forum, and its editor, Duan Ruofei, has
gamely tried to carry on the battle.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare interview at the institute, Duan was careful to couch
his objections to China's path in terms of the so-called Deng
Xiaoping Theory _ the same vague catch-all that is used by Jiang to
justify his new directions _ and did not attack leaders directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the real reformers,'' Duan said. ``The problem is that
the upholders of Marxism have a different understanding of reform
than certain liberals, who are trying to transform the defining
role of public ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``A capitalist class has re-emerged in China,'' threatening to
undermine socialist achievements, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Duan and his colleagues suffered a major rout in late 1997, at
the 15th Communist Party Congress, when Jiang formally embraced the
wholesale restructuring of state industries.
</P>
<P>
   Over the previous two years, in a last-ditch effort to drum up
concern, Duan and other leftists had circulated four unsigned
essays exposing the dire threats to socialism.
</P>
<P>
   The essays showed the anguish of people who felt their deepest
beliefs were being betrayed. One, for example, complained of a
``new-born capitalist class that has been raised on the blood and
sweat of four decades of tireless labor by the whole people.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, there is a broad consensus among senior officials and
intellectuals that the path toward market economics is China's best
hope.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these senior officials, Western-influenced economists
and others accept that some hardships and growing inequality may be
a necessary price. Corruption is seen as an unfortunate side effect
that must be fought.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing minority, part of a new populism, assert that
China's current course is inherently corrupt, enriching the
powerful against the interests of workers and peasants.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a unified movement. Some have styled themselves part
of a ``new left,'' but many others resist being pigeon-holed. Some
say there are positive lessons to be gleaned from the disastrous
Mao years _ and have even made pilgrimages to Nanjie in search of
inspiration _ while others abhor that era.
</P>
<P>
   But they share many socialist ideals, and argue that capitalism
and the opening to the global economy, as practiced here, have
allowed an alliance of privileged officials and business executives
to get rich at the expense of the little guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1990s the economy has grown rapidly, but in terms of
morality, things are really rotten,'' said Yang Fan, an economist
at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Yang considers himself part of a growing ``moderate left''
movement, led by intellectuals in their 40s and 50s who spent time
in the countryside during Mao's Cultural Revolution of 1966 to 1976
and share a special concern for workers facing layoffs as state
industries are pruned and peasants whose incomes have lagged.
</P>
<P>
   He said in an interview that the country is in the grip of
``closet rightists'' whose aim is ``to convert political power into
personal wealth.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Similar concerns have even been voiced by an outspoken senior
economist at the central government's think tank, the Development
Research Center. In a recent newspaper article, the economist Wu
Jinglian said China could be in danger of developing ``crony
capitalism'' like that in Indonesia and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   While they call for stronger regulation of business, genuine
worker participation in company management and greater sharing of
wealth, these critics seldom offer detailed plans for curing the
ills they describe. By and large, they have not delved deeply into
strategies for political change, at least in public.
</P>
<P>
   But the potentially broad appeal of their critique, especially
if the economy stalls, has been suggested by the attention given to
a recent book, ``China's Pitfall,'' by economist He Qinglian, who
says economic reforms have been warped by the plundering of a new
bureaucratic and financial elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real struggle today is between reformers out for the
people as a whole, and reformers out for themselves,'' said Cui
Zhiyuan, a political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology who remains active in intellectual debate inside China.
</P>
<P>
   Cui has been described as a ``new leftist'' in part because he
has tried to find positive aspects of Mao's Cultural Revolution of
1966 to 1976 _ putting off many readers. He has also, like the old
leftists, been entranced by Nanjie.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 book, Cui noted that most socialist experiments have
foundered on the problem of incentives. But ``the practice of
Nanjie village shows it can be overcome,'' he wrote, so ``the
superiority of cooperation in a collective economy can be given
free rein.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Nanjie itself claims to combine the best of both worlds. Its
relative prosperity appears to reflect the astute exploitation of
market opportunities opened in the 1980s: The village now runs 26
factories, including printing, plastic wraps, snacks and one of
China's biggest producers of instant noodles. The farming that
brings a poor living to neighboring villages has nearly
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   To run its factories, Nanjie employs thousands of outsiders as
workers. Like the village's permanent residents, these workers must
study Mao texts. They are paid a modest salary and given free
housing in neighboring areas, though not the handsomely equipped
apartments and lifetime benefits given to Nanjie's 3,100 official
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to grab hold of the express train of economic
reform, and at the same time adhere to the construction of
socialist spiritual civilization,'' said Wang Hongbin, 47, who has
been party secretary of Nanjie since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   From a guided tour it was impossible to determine how Nanjie may
have avoided the usual pitfalls of collective enterprise. Wang said
only that proper ideological study and the leadership of party
cadres ``encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang also said the village _ which has spacious, well-equipped
schools and gives its model workers free vacation trips _ receives
no subsidies, only loans as needed. There is no way to verify the
village's finances.
</P>
<P>
   The leftists who praise Nanjie seldom mention aspects that would
be unacceptable to many Chinese today: the lack of opportunity to
amass wealth, the rigid requirements for ideological study, the
required group critiques of neighbors' behavior that are right out
of the Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it appears that many residents are willing to trade
certain freedoms for a modest prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Yao Tonglin, 63, who has lived in Nanjie for 40 years and now
shares an apartment with her husband, daughter and son-in-law,
remembers how poor the village used to be. ``Our men couldn't even
find a bride who would marry them,'' she said, standing in front of
the giant Mao poster on her living room wall. ``Now, outsiders come
running to marry the local people.''
</P>
<P>
   Village officials admit that the national economic slowdown may
hamper its industries. But as the rest of the country struggles
with unemployment and debates the ethics of the free market, Wang,
the village chairman, casts his eyes on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we hope for in the future is that the quality of our
Communist neighborhood will be raised to ever greater levels,'' he
said. ``Material conditions will be extraordinarily prosperous and
in terms of spiritual civilization, life will be equally rich.''

 &HT;    Passages on Nazi horrors deleted from school guide
 &HT;    By Doug Cumming
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teaching students about the Holocaust, which the Georgia
Commission on the Holocaust has been doing since 1986, involves
putting some horrible, obscene facts before children in order that
they understand what can happen when hatred goes unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   So the commission's decision to delete two paragraphs about the
treatment of homosexual victims of the Nazis in a teacher guide
that is being distributed to middle and high school teachers around
the state, has created an uncomfortable but firm disagreement
between the commission and others who otherwise strongly support
the commission's work and goals.
</P>
<P>
   The law firm of Holland &AMP; Knight, which sponsored the
publication of the teacher guide in three states and is funding the
Georgia commission's student contest this year, disagreed with the
commission's opposition to the two paragraphs, but agreed to remove
them in a spirit of cooperation, said Steve Uhlfelder, managing
partner of the firm's Tallahassee office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, if we were not dealing with a state commission that we
had agreed to work with, I would've basically not agreed to do
it,'' Uhlfelder said. The firm, which has a reputation for freedom
of press work and for donating time to the public good, insisted on
restoring the passages for later press runs of the 92-page guide
that went to Florida and San Francisco teachers, although it cost
his firm $14,000 to make the change, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Equality Project, an advocacy group for gay,
lesbian, bisexual and transgendered political equality, admires the
work of the commission, said Harry Knox, director of the Equality
Project. But in this instance, he said after reading the passages
Wednesday, the commission made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The language is horrifying,'' he said. ``But everything about
the Holocaust should horrify us. Erasing persecution of gays from
the history of the Holocaust repeats the tragic silence of most
Germans in the Nazi years. And it's a shame that children in
Georgia would be led to ignorance and silence by the Holocaust
Commission out of an apparent fear that Legislators will punish
them for telling the truth about gays under the Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Wygoda, director and chairperson of the Holocaust
Commission, insisted that the passages had to be removed. ``We felt
that it was our duty to inform the law firm that, number one, it
wasn't even necessary to the content of the book, and number two,
it is not our place to put sexually graphic material into the
schools.'' She said the fact that the commission receives almost
$210,000 a year from the Legislature had nothing to do with the
decision. ``This is a judgment we arrived at as educators,'' she
said. Although it is a teacher guide, she said the commission had
no way of knowing whether students would have access to it.
</P>
<P>
   Wygoda and Uhlfelder both had Jewish relatives killed in death
camps by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Triangles, Badges, &AMP; Stars: Remembering the Mosaic of Victims
of the Holocaust'' gives teachers passages from a variety of
writings on the theme of the variety of groups victimized by the
Holocaust. This is also the theme of this year's student writing
and art contest being held by the commission. In addition to Jews,
six million of whom were systematically murdered, the Nazis
targeted Gypsies, Jehovah's Witnesses, Communists, African-Germans,
the mentally and physically disabled and other groups of people,
including homosexual males.
</P>
<P>
   Homosexuals are mentioned in at least four places that list
victim groups in the 6,000 copies of the guide printed for Georgia.
But the only two extended descriptions of their victimization were
deleted.
</P>
<P>
   Wygoda said the problem with the passages is strictly that
sexuality, even heterosexuality, has no place in the commission's
work when it is not age-appropriate for the classroom. She said the
decision was quite clear and non-controversial to the commission,
and she hoped it would not divert people's attention from the
important message of the dangers of intolerance.

COMMENTARY: LET THE SYSTEM WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: The word ``is'' can be italicized in the last sentence) 
(rl) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House message is plain: If the Senate
dares to call Monica Lewinsky as a witness, the Clinton lawyers
will drag out the impeachment trial clear through to the summer and
blame the GOP for shutting down the government. On Wednesday the
Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, snapped a partisan salute,
announcing ``universal, unanimous opposition to witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Why such hardball against taking Lewinsky testimony in public?
The ostensible reasons are that the young woman's account would
embarrass the president, offend the dignity of the Senate, corrupt
the public morals and take a day or two away from saving Social
Security in 2034.
</P>
<P>
   The real reason is that her testimony cuts both ways. On the
first count of impeachment _ lying under oath before a grand jury _
Monica is a witness for the prosecution. But on the second count _
witness-tampering to obstruct justice _ she can be treated by
Clinton lawyers as a witness for the defense. That makes it awkward
for either side to attack her credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Take the perjury charge first. The President in his civil sworn
deposition claimed never to have touched Ms. Lewinsky intimately,
and before the grand jury stuck to that absurd tale of total
passivity. She testified to the contrary in clinical detail. The
Senate is obliged to decide which one has been _ and still is _
lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   On the obstruction charge, however, Ms. Lewinsky went out of her
way to swear: ``No one ever told me to lie. No one ever promised me
a job.'' The Clinton lawyers made a strong point of this
volunteered assertion before the House, and surely will again at
trial. Prosecutors will counter that although the President never
specifically said ``Lie!'' he suggested a false cover story that
corruptly influenced her testimony. Still, her defense of Clinton
carries weight.
</P>
<P>
   Are senators sitting as jurors duty bound to hear directly from
her, since she is already on the record? Yes. If jurors are sworn
to decide impartially whether to believe her story or the
President's, they are obliged to listen to her testimony (and his,
if he wishes) firsthand, including decorous cross-examination.
House Judiciary members failed to do their duty on this; senators
should not.
</P>
<P>
   When dire warnings of ``national paralysis'' were made before
the House impeachment vote, the majority leader, Trent Lott, set
minds at ease by assuring us that any Senate trial could be
conducted fairly in three weeks or less. Now it's up to him to
deliver on that promise of promptness within constitutional
procedure, and equally up to Senate Democrats not to march in
partisan lockstep with a Clinton filibuster if they don't get their
preferred witness-free trial.
</P>
<P>
   We all know what outcome a substantial majority of the public
wants, and therefore how unlikely is Clinton's removal by
two-thirds of the Senate. But the notion of a quickie trial
prearranged to be aborted after a few days by a vote of one-third
of the senators was a non-starter for good reason: A vote that
stipulated that serial perjury is not cause for removal would set a
terrible precedent.
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice can be trusted to go by the book and move the
proceedings along. Most senators, after the Daschle hissy fit to
bar all witnesses passes, can be trusted to act as serious
participants in a constitutional corrective. We can hope that this
time the impeached will act in the national interest _ which is
also his own best interest _ not to disrupt or delay the trial or
seek to discredit its participants.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the Senate, after a sufficient presentation and
rebuttal of testimony, may well vote to suspend the trial and take
up a resolution of censure. An up-and-down verdict vote would be
more courageous, but a document of disapprobation gives senators
opposing his removal a way to get right with their less forgiving
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Respect the impeachment process; the system will work if we let
it. Senate jurors and the chief justice, not pollsters or pundits
or pressure groups, will set the pace and length of the trial. The
State of the Union address can wait a couple of weeks and then get
a respectful hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Laying out the case in a way that historically justifies stern
Senate censure is not an interruption of the nation's business.
This month, it is the nation's business.

DR. PAUL M. ZOLL, 87; PIONEERED ELECTRICAL HEART STIMULANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``Three dead brought back to life,'' said the headline
when it was announced that Dr. Paul M. Zoll had restarted the
hearts of three patients at Beth Israel Hospital through
noninvasive electrical stimulation.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like science fiction when the headline appeared in The
Boston Globe on Feb. 22, 1953, but the technique has now become an
accepted part of medical practice that has lengthened the lives of
millions of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul M. Zoll of Newton, the cardiologist whose research led
to the first defribrillators and pacemakers for failing hearts,
died of respiratory arrest Tuesday in Heathwood Rehabilitation and
Nursing Center in Newton. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Zoll was a clinical professor at Harvard Medical School and
a physician at Beth Israel Hospital for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Dr. Seigo Izumo, director of cardiovascular research
at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, said Dr. Zoll was a
``revolutionary person'' who was the first to use electricity for
therapeutic purposes.
</P>
<P>
   He said Dr. Zoll's research also led to the development of the
electrocardiogram and made possible open heart surgery, which
requires the stopping the restarting of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Izumo, Dr. Zoll's work led the saving of
millions of lives.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Boston, he graduated from Boston Latin School,
Harvard College, and, in 1936, Harvard Medical School. He interned
at Beth Israel Hospital and at Bellevue Hospital in New York City.
He returned to Boston to join the medical research department at
Beth Israel in 1939. It was then that he started his work in
cardiology.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973 he was a winner of the Albert Lasker Clinical Medical
Research Award, considered the leading scientific prize in this
country, for his many contributions in the treatment of heart
disease. A citation noted that his original and outstanding work
led to the development of the pacemaker, closed-chest
defibrillator, and cardiac monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The citation pointed out that he had demonstrated for the first
time in 1952 that when a human heart stops it can be induced by
electrical stimulation to resume beating. It went on to say:
``Pacemakers, which have saved tens of thousands from sudden and
unpredictable death, are Dr. Zoll's invention.
</P>
<P>
   ``One measure of the good that pacemakers have done and the need
there is for them is the fact that more than 60,000 Americans have
received pacemakers and an estimated 12,000 to 15,000 new
pacemakers are implanted annually.'' That was in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The citation also said: ``In addition, Dr. Zoll developed the
theory and technique of continuous cardiac monitoring of heart
rhythm, and was the first to apply this method clinically. The
coronary care unit now found in every well-equipped hospital is a
further development of this life-saving concept.''
</P>
<P>
   For his invention of the cardiac pacemaker, he also won the John
Scott Award of the City of Philadelphia, the Polytechnic/Wunsch
Prize in Biomedical Engineering, the Ray C. Fish Award, and the
Texas Heart Institute Medal.
</P>
<P>
   He was made a research fellow in medicine at Harvard Medical
School in 1941; served in the US Army Medical Corps in World War
II, first in the Aleutians and later as a cardiologist at an army
general hospital in England; became chief of the Cardiac Clinic at
the school in 1947; and assistant professor of medicine at the
school and visiting physician at Beth Israel Hospital, both in
1954.
</P>
<P>
   He also was made associate editor of the heart journal
Circulation in 1956 and wrote many articles for professional
journals, mostly on coronary heart disease and external electrical
stimulation of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, he founded Zoll Medical Corp., a pioneer in
the manufacturing of defibrillators.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Ann (Blumgart); a son, Ross, of Connecticut;
and a daughter, Mary, of Newton.

DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION ABOUT LEWINSKY WOULD NOT BE ILLEGAL,
STARR SAYS 
</HEADLINE>

(js) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The independent counsel Kenneth Starr told a
federal judge who is investigating his office for possible illegal
grand jury leaks that it would have been appropriate for him to
disclose to reporters information about negotiations with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, in court papers released Wednesday by Judge Norma
Holloway Johnson of U.S. District Court, does not say whether he or
anyone in his office were the sources for news accounts last year
about his office's intense discussions with Ms. Lewinsky over
whether she would testify against President Clinton. But Starr
argued that to have done so would not have been illegal because the
negotiations with Ms. Lewinsky did not involve the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, Clinton's chief lawyer in the leaks
investigation, responded in court papers by saying that Starr had
starkly changed his position. Kendall told Judge Johnson that Starr
had argued earlier that none of his office's operations could be
disclosed but took a new approach when confronted with evidence
that he or his aides had discussed the Lewinsky negotiations with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of whether Starr or someone in his office violated
federal laws prohibiting prosecutors from disclosing matters before
a grand jury has been raised forcefully by the White House as part
of its effort to discredit the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The White House received a major victory last September when
Judge Johnson ruled that 24 news accounts about the investigation
of Clinton appeared to show that prosecutors in Starr's office
repeatedly and knowingly violated federal law by leaking grand jury
testimony or other secret information.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Judge Johnson also appointed a special master to
investigate possible illegal leaks by the prosecutors. The master,
John W. Kern III, a former judge in the District of Columbia, was
given the power to seize and examine the prosecutors' telephone
records and logs along with their appointment calendars,
memorandums and other documents to determine whether they disclosed
information to the press.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what progress, if any, Kern has made, although he
was expected to report to Judge Johnson by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the public knowledge of the leak investigation
comes with a built-in time lag. Judge Johnson has generally sealed
documents in the case, only disclosing them selectively months
later.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the batch of documents disclosed Wednesday reflect the
status of the case only as of Oct. 30.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The last significant development contained in the new batch is
Judge Johnson's rejection of Starr's appeal to her to reconsider
her September ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed on Oct. 15, Starr had argued that 15 of the 24
news accounts did not violate grand jury secrecy rules. He said
that eight of those news accounts concerned the negotiations
between his office and Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer at the time, William
Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   The eight news accounts appeared in The New York Times, The
Washington Post and Newsweek, were broadcast on NBC and CNN and
variously attributed their information about the negotiations to
``prosecutors,'' ``one official'' and ``federal investigators.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly, a press spokesman for Starr, said he could not
comment on the case because much of it is still under seal. He
declined to say if Starr or prosecutors in the office were, in
fact, the source of the eight stories.
</P>
<P>
   But Bakaly has said that ``This office does not disclose grand
jury material.''
</P>
<P>
   He has said that journalists have used information from sources
outside the independent counsel's office. ``The short of the matter
is this: We have at all times conducted ourselves in an appropriate
and ethical manner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr had argued that some of the other news accounts concerned
evidence gathered outside the grand jury process, like Ms.
Lewinsky's stained dress, which was obtained during a search of her
apartment to which she consented.
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting Starr's request for reconsideration, Judge Johnson
has ruled that that the 24 news accounts constitute ``prima facie''
evidence of wrongdoing, leaving the burden on Starr and his fellow
prosecutors to show they were not the source of the articles and
broadcast accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Starr argued in court filings that 15 of the news
accounts could not be violations of grand jury secrecy. The
remaining nine news accounts were not addressed, although Starr has
argued that none involved violations of grand jury secrecy.

SENATE GOP CHIEF WALKS TIGHTROPE IN IMPEACHMENT CONTROVERSY
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Sen. Trent Lott moves from meeting to meeting in
search of an elusive bipartisan plan for an impeachment trial, he
says he wants a formula that is fair to all and speedy enough to
sate a scandal-weary nation.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican majority leader is driven by other concerns,
too. Lott is trying to balance the demands of many conservative
groups, including some back home in Mississippi, who want President
Clinton to suffer a long, embarrassing trial, against what's best
for the 19 Senate Republicans up for re-election in 2000, who could
be hurt by that approach.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Any conservative group that sees an advantage in a lengthy
trial is foolish,'' said Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho, the
fourth-ranking Senate Republican. ``If they've watched what most
perceived to be a conservative Congress' ratings plummet 25 points
in the last month, would you argue it's to our advantage to have a
lengthy process?''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The scrutiny seems to have gotten under Lott's skin. The
normally gregarious Mississippian has been dodging reporters this
week, leaving his office by back doors, and on Tuesday he read a
statement to reporters but refused to answer any questions.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Lott sounded defensive in attacking those who are
already asking whether he is up to the task.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before has so much been reported about what I was
thinking, doing or saying when I said so little,'' Lott said on the
Senate floor. ``I've been accused of holing up in my hometown of
Pascagoula, Mississippi. Where would you expect me to be during the
holidays?''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Lott sounded petulant, he had good reason. With impeachment's
fallout having already incinerated House Speaker Newt Gingrich and
Speaker-elect Bob Livingston, Lott is stepping carefully to avoid
becoming the next casualty in the impeachment minefield.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise he floated as a trial balloon to avert a lengthy
trial has been shot down by his own rank-and-file, and now Lott is
trying to pick up the pieces in the greatest test of his leadership
since he was elected majority leader in 1996.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He's attempting to do what you have to do as a majority
leader, which is to keep the train on the tracks,'' said Sen. Judd
Gregg, R-N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Lott appears motivated both by duty and by pragmatism.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our duty is clear, to demonstrate anew our national commitment
to justice and fair play,'' Lott said Wednesday. ``That is what the
public expects from us regardless of their individual opinions
concerning the president.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lott's unusually close consultations with Sen. Tom Daschle of
South Dakota, the Democratic minority leader, reflect the majority
leader's desire to avoid the partisan battles that plagued the
impeachment proceedings in the House.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to our advantage to make sure that this is a fair,
non-partisan process,'' said Craig. ``That's where we win.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To help advise him, Lott this week hired Michael Wallace, a
Mississippi lawyer and former law clerk to Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist, to be special counsel during the impeachment trial.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with phone calls to senators from his home over the
holidays, to the parade of senators trooping to his Capitol office
this week, to Wednesday's back-to-back meetings with all 55 Senate
Republicans, Lott has been discussing with colleagues a compromise,
crafted in part by his confidant, Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., that
he never publicly endorsed.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He is doing exactly what a leader should do,'' said Sen. Kay
Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who voiced her objections about the plan
to Lott at the Cotton Bowl football game in Dallas on New Year's
Day. ``He started with a proposal, wanted input on that, and is now
getting ready for modifications.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But there are also practical reasons why Lott is gently trying
to steer his colleagues to set limits on a Senate trial. Lott
doesn't believe there are the 67 votes the Constitution requires to
remove Clinton, his confidants say.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lott was chastened by the November elections, and vowed to give
the public real legislative results, colleagues say. A lengthy
trial with numerous witnesses could bottle up his legislative
agenda and even imperil Republicans' hold on the Senate, and with
it, his job.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Trent is a very ordered person,'' said Clark Reed, the dean of
the Mississippi Republican Party. ``Chaos is not his thing.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Lott promised that the Senate would not grind to
halt just because the first impeachment trial in 130 years is
underway. He ticked off goals to increase military spending, shore
up Social Security and revamp the budget process.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have responsibilities that go forward, and we will do our
very best to have a dual-track,'' Lott said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But unlike in the House, where the rank-and-file typically fall
in line behind their party leaders, senators are a more independent
breed who often bridle and bolt when their leaders try to rein them
in.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He's first among equals and he's trying to establish a
consensus,'' said Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore. ``But that's one of the
perils of being the majority leader. It's like herding cats.''  &QL;

CLINTON TOUTS $76 BILLION BUDGET SURPLUS 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton declared the era of budget
deficits over Wednesday as he unveiled new projections forecasting
a $76 billion surplus for the current fiscal year and urged
Congress to let nothing stand in the way of work on Social Security
reform.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton touted the budget surplus as Congress convened a new
session that will focus on an impeachment trial on charges arising
from the president's affair with a former White House intern.
Clinton, however, did not mention the pending trial, instead
calling on the 106th Congress to focus its priorities on issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I am proud to announce that we can say the era of big
deficits is over. We are now entering the second year of an era of
surpluses,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus for the 1999 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, would
be only the second in three decades and likely will be revised
several times through the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics took issue with the bookkeeping by both the
White House and Congress that continues to forecast budget
surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group advocating fiscal
restraint, maintained there would still be a deficit for the 1999
fiscal year. It contends the deficit is covered up because the
White House and Congress use the surplus in the Social Security
fund to paper over the red ink.
</P>
<P>
   The Concord Coalition reported the government would actually
have a deficit of $40 billion for 1999, a larger amount than the
$29 billion for fiscal year 1998. The Social Security fund
currently has a surplus of $117 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Social Security program is legally and officially
off-budget, and the time has come for that fact to be reflected in
the public announcements by the political leadership of both
parties,'' said Martha Phillips, Concord Coalition executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   However, those Social Security surpluses are expected to
evaporate in the next 30 years as the system plunges into
bankruptcy unless steps are taken.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton repeatedly has called on Congress not to spend the
annual federal budget surpluses until it saves Social Security from
going broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must save Social Security for the 21st century, before we
consider new spending or other tax cuts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said last year he would make saving Social Security a
priority. He used his 1998 State of the Union to highlight the
issue. He attended two Social Security events where experts
discussed options. He also intends to appoint a commission to
review alternatives and wants Congress to enact some changes this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot use anything as an excuse not to deal with our most
pressing priorities,'' Clinton said. ``I do not intend to do it; I
do not think the American people expect us to do it, and I think
that we will surprise the skeptics by dealing with the Social
Security challenge over the next several months.''

 &HT;    Coalition will try to reinstate anti-sodomy law
 &HT;    By Kathy Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Georgia Christian Coalition leaders say they'll probably have to
amend the state Constitution to do it, but they're making a push to
reinstate Georgia's anti-sodomy law one of their priorities for the
upcoming legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   Re-enacting the law, which the state Supreme Court this fall
struck down as unconstitutional, is among a list of familiar items
the coalition is pushing as lawmakers converge on the Capitol next
week. Leading Democratic lawmakers have vowed to oppose those
moves, and Republican Party leaders say they won't actively push
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition tapped a familiar figure to lead their charge.
Rep. Ron Crews (R-Tucker), who lost his seat in the November
elections, has accepted a paid position as the coalition's
legislative director. Crews, a minister and six-year lawmaker, was
one of the strongest legislative allies for social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   During a Wednesday press conference, Crews and coalition
chairwoman Sadie Fields blamed negative campaigning, in Georgia and
nationally, for turning off many conservatives. But they downplayed
predictions that the election outcome will make lawmakers less
receptive to their issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pendulum swings one way one time and one way the next,''
Crews said. ``I don't think that necessarily represents turning
away from the traditional pro-family values I hold...and the
families of the state hold. Those values remain intact.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition's legislative wish list, includes passage of the
''women's right to know'' act to provide graphic information about
abortion before the procedure is performed; strengthening of the
1997 ban on so-called partial-birth abortions coalition members say
was gutted by state settlement of a federal lawsuit; and
legislation to make instruction on ``the responsibilities and
sacrifices of marriage'' a part of the high school character
curriculum. Repealing the driver's license fingerprint requirement,
expanding school choice for at-risk students and providing tax
relief round out the agenda.

DELAYS OF GRAYS OVER SOON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Each January sport-fishing landings begin offering
whale-watching charters to compensate for decreased wintertime
angling traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But spotting the big denizens has been as slow as the fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not seeing as many whales as we normally see. We saw
gray whales Saturday and orcas (killer whales) a week ago, but we
haven't seen one since then,'' said Russ Harmon, owner of Cisco's
Sportfishing in Oxnard. ``I don't know if it's the El Nino, but El
Nino gets blamed for a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Harmon isn't far off. But the good news is that the
numbers of gray whales moving from the North Pacific to their
winter home and birthing lagoons of Baja California is likely to
increase soon.
</P>
<P>
   The whales are thought to be delaying their southbound migration
because of extraordinarily warm conditions in the Arctic. The grays
normally wait to swim to Mexico until ice packs form in Alaskan
waters, which occurred late this winter, said Alisa
Schulman-Janiger of San Pedro, coordinator of the American Cetacean
Society's Gray Whale Census and Behavior Study.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if the migration is anything like it's been over the past
two seasons, high numbers of whales will be observed in the coming
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would expect the numbers to be increasing in the next week
and build to a peak in the third or fourth week of January,''
Schulman-Janiger said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1979, volunteer census takers stationed at Point Vicente
Interpretive Center in Rancho Palos Verdes have started their
counts on Dec. 1. Through Monday, 94 southbound whales had been
spotted. The numbers through the same period last year and the year
before set records at 225 and 192, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Schulman-Janiger said that the numbers were so high because
pregnant females were giving birth en route because of the delayed
migration, instead of in Mexican waters. Also, since mother whales
hug the shoreline for protection in kelp beds and to allow their
calves to rest in calmer waters, they are more easily spotted from
shore, increasing the counts.
</P>
<P>
   The same should be true this year as the whales delay their
travels even longer. ``We may see equal to or even greater numbers
than last year,'' Schulman-Janiger said.
</P>
<P>
   What cetaceans that are seen from shore _ or sea _ is merely a
drop in the bucket when compared to the estimated 24,000 gray
whales that make the trip south, then back to their North Pacific
feeding grounds via the same route.
</P>
<P>
   Each viewing option is decidedly different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going out on boats you get the up-close experience and the
better photography opportunities,'' said Schulman-Janiger. ``From
shore you get the bigger picture and more variety _ plus it's
better for the person who gets seasick to watch from shore.''
</P>
<P>
   Other cetaceans that can be spotted include humpback, blue,
killer and minke whales, as well as a variety of dolphins and
porpoises. &QL;

FOUR LEADING DOCTORS CHALLENGE EFFORT TO REDUCE RATE OF CAESAREAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   Four leading childbirth specialists in Boston are challenging
the federal government's goal to reduce the rate of Caesarean
births, saying that the effort could in fact be endangering some
mothers and their babies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
concerned about unnecessary surgery and health care costs, set a
goal to reduce the national Caesarean rate to 15 percent by 2000.
At the time, 23.5 percent of babies were delivered by Caesarean
section. The current rate hovers around 21 percent, down from a
high of 25 percent in 1988 but still way above the 5 percent rate
in 1970 and not likely to reach 15 percent anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston experts, who published their views as an opinion
article in Thursday's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine,
fear that economic forces are driving efforts to reduce the number
of operative deliveries without sufficient study of how a lower
rate of Caesareans would affect the well-being of mothers and
babies in different situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assumption that lowering the Caesarean section rate would
reduce costs and represent better care is too simplistic,'' said
Dr. Benjamin P. Sachs, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center and chief author of the journal
paper. ``To go above the current rate is probably unacceptable, but
if we're going to go below that, we have to have a monitoring
system and safeguards in place to assure the safety of mothers and
babies. Quality of care, not costs, should matter first and
foremost.''
</P>
<P>
   His collaborator, Dr. Frederic Frigoletto, chief of obstetrics
at the Massachusetts General Hospital, said, ``We should begin by
identifying what the rate should be for given conditions _ multiple
births, breech presentation, diabetes in the mother, etc. We need
data to determine this so we can establish rates based on the best
outcomes, not rates set by bureaucrats with economically driven
motives.''
</P>
<P>
   The other collaborators on the paper were Dr. Cindy Kobelin of
the Beth Israel medical center, and Dr. Mary Ames Castro of
Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs and his colleagues agree that a vaginal delivery is better
and cheaper than an operative one, ``but only if it is safe.'' For
example, they said, the use of vacuum extraction to assist in cases
of difficult labor results in brain bleeding in 6 percent of
births.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment on the views of Sachs and his colleagues, Dr.
Roger Freeman, an obstetrician and perinatologist at Long Beach
Memorial Hospital in California, agreed that in some cases,
hospitals had ``gone too far'' in trying to bring down Caesarean
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman said, however, that there was clearly room for
improvement. He pointed out, for example, that in low-risk
patients, ``there is great variability in the Caesarean rate _ from
a low of 5 percent to a high of 40 percent _ from doctor to doctor,
hospital to hospital and region to region.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This tells me,'' he said, ``there is probably an opportunity
to lower the rate of Caesareans, at least among ordinary low-risk
patients. But what that rate should be, I have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services,
Damon Thompson, told The Associated Press that the 15 percent goal
was based on consultation with hundreds of groups, and was only a
target, not a quota. Thompson said studies had shown that hospitals
could lower the C-section rate without compromising safety.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 percent goal, established in the report Healthy People
2000, grew out of concern that far too many operative deliveries
were being performed in this country, often for reasons not
medically justifiable, like the convenience of the doctor or the
pregnant woman. These reasons added to an already rising rate
prompted by the growing use of fetal monitoring during labor.
Monitors reveal when a fetus' health and survival are being
jeopardized by letting labor continue toward a vaginal delivery,
but they also sometimes falsely indicate difficulties, prompting
Caesarean deliveries that turn out to have been medically
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, obstetricians facing skyrocketing malpractice costs
and lawsuits when a delivery went awry, increasingly began
practicing defensive medicine. Rather than take a chance that a
baby would be injured during a difficult vaginal delivery _ for
example, one that required forceps _ many doctors elected to
perform Caesareans when faced with the slightest doubt about the
baby's well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care companies are playing a major role in current
efforts to reduce the rate of Caesarean births, which usually
result in higher hospital and physician costs than a simple vaginal
delivery. While agreeing that vaginal births were generally safer
and cheaper, Sachs and his colleagues said that growing pressures
to avoid Caesareans were resulting in some ill-advised efforts at a
vaginal delivery that often end up costing far more than a
Caesarean and risk the health of mother and baby. They expressed
particular concern about pressures on doctors to encourage every
woman who has had a previous Caesarean delivery to try a vaginal
birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the woman's uterus ruptures, which happens in 1 percent of
these cases, the mom hemorrhages and may need a hysterectomy and
the baby may end up brain-damaged or dead,'' Sachs said. Even if
the baby is OK, he said, the costs would be much greater than if a
Caesarean had been performed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce L. Flamm, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the
Kaiser-Permanente Medical Center in Riverside, Calif., said that
``the cheapest way would be to operate electively in every case,
not that I'm an advocate of more Caesareans.'' Flamm explained that
in calculating the costs of vaginal versus operative deliveries,
experts often failed to take into account the time a woman having a
vaginal delivery spent in the hospital in labor.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors now stand in the way of a sharp reduction in the
Caesarean rate. One is the growing number of women having medically
assisted multiple pregnancies resulting in high-risk births and
those having first babies late in life. Older women are more likely
to encounter difficulties in labor and to have underlying medical
conditions that warrant an operative delivery. In addition, they
and their doctors tend to be less willing to risk fetal injury
during a vaginal delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anxiety definitely plays a part in the decision to do a
Caesarean,'' Sachs said. ``If a woman is having her first child at
46, neither she nor her doctor is willing to take any chances.''

ISRAEL'S `WHO IS A JEW' PERENNIAL SPROUTS ANEW
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The chief judge of the Jerusalem district court
struck a profound nerve last week with a ruling that undermined the
overarching power of the Orthodox Chief Rabbinate to determine who
is a Jew.
</P>
<P>
   The judge compelled the Israeli government to accept and
register as Jews people who had been converted to Judaism in Israel
by Reform or Conservative rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   The conversion issue had been sitting on a shelf in Parliament
all year, but the judge's action provoked the religious faction
there to take it down and dust it off.
</P>
<P>
   What the religious parties want to do is to codify in law the
rabbinate's exclusive authority over conversions _ at a moment when
many Israelis are bridling at the rabbinate's exclusive control
over rituals like marriage.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether Parliament will act now on a conversion
bill or will delay a vote until a new Parliament is elected in May.
But what is clear is that there is a pattern of outright combat
involving the courts, the religious parties and the Israeli public.
</P>
<P>
   In ruling after ruling, the courts are striking at the power and
the privileges of the rigorously Orthodox. After each ruling, the
strong religious factions in the Parliament seek to restore that
power through legislation. And each punch and counterpunch
reawakens the unresolved culture war that episodically rends the
fabric of Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
   Given the ferocity of the battle, many believe that it can only
end in a showdown in which Israel will be forced to reconcile the
contradictions of being the Jewish homeland and a secular
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Some predict that a popular backlash against the new political
power of the strictly Orthodox will find expression in laws that
disentangle religion and state to some degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of the increasing political power in the hands of
the Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox, you're seeing a confrontation
pushing Israel in the direction of getting the government somewhat
out of the business of religion,'' Rabbi Ismar Schorsch, chancellor
of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, said in an
interview in Israel this week.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, the decisions have tumbled fast and
furious from the Israeli courts. In addition to the conversion
decision, the courts have recently ordered the inclusion of Reform
and Conservative representatives on the powerful municipal
religious councils; declared the army service exemptions of
strictly Orthodox yeshiva students to be illegal, and ruled that
kibbutz shops could be open for business on the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   And in each case the religious parties have moved to block the
court's rulings, sometimes with not only the backing but the direct
assistance of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Some here have likened the conflict to the dueling between
Congress and the Supreme Court in the United States over issues
like civil rights and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't this the lesson one recalls from American history?''
asked Rabbi Uri Regev, a leader of the Reform movement here. ``A
recalcitrant Congress motivated by less than noble considerations
and a court that emerges as the beacon of light and defender of
civil liberties.''
</P>
<P>
   But here the core issue, the relationship between religion and
state, is central to the identity of the country and of modern
Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   It rubs at two key frictions _ that between secular and
religious Israelis and that between different kinds of practicing
Jews: the observant but modern, be they Reform, Conservative or
Orthodox, and those who dedicate their lives to strict observance
of centuries-old Jewish laws.
</P>
<P>
   By their very existence, the courts are a threat to the strictly
Orthodox when they rule on religious matters. The laws they
interpret are secular and not religious, and the principles that
they uphold are democratic and not theocratic.
</P>
<P>
   But an active court, like the Supreme Court under Chief Justice
Aharon Barak, is particularly offensive to religious purists
because, in their view, it seeks to mandate a reconciliation of the
irreconcilable. Strictly Orthodox Jews think that submitting
Judaism to a civil liberties test subverts the essence of the
religion. They believe Judaism to be built on God-given rules that
should not be bent. To the strictly Orthodox, Judaism is both a
privilege and a yoke. They see beauty in rigid observance of Jewish
law, or halacha, even or especially when obedience is taxing.
</P>
<P>
   Many feel misunderstood in what they see as their belief in
standards, which leads them to consider Reform and Conservative
Judaism a dilution of the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The modern Jew understands why in baseball the base paths
cannot be shortened for the slow runners and the outfield fences
brought in for weaker hitters,'' Jonathan Rosenblum, an Orthodox
intellectual, wrote in The Jerusalem Post, ``but not why anyone
should ever be told they are not Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is important; it rules are sacrosanct. Judaism
isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the strictly Orthodox view, only rabbinical leaders are
qualified to issue rulings that affect Jewish life. And secular
judges like Barak personify what the strictly Orthodox see as
incomprehension of Jewish law.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is a secular democracy with secular laws, but it is
vastly different from the United States. Clearly, for instance, the
relationship between religion and state is an inherently cozy one,
given the fact that citizenship is automatically granted to any
Jew. It is one that few Israelis would want completely disengaged.
</P>
<P>
   What the courts have been trying to do is define and refine the
boundaries as the Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox have used their
growing political power to assert a greater role for religion and
to demand privileges like state-subsidized religious education.
</P>
<P>
   The army issue is the one that most stirs the secular Israeli
public. Many resent a system that not only exempts 30,000 strictly
Orthodox teen-agers from the mandatory three-year service, but also
pays their yeshiva bills while university students are left to
finance their own educations.
</P>
<P>
   To most Israelis the conversion issue is more abstract, and most
are unfamiliar with Reform and Conservative Judaism. But here and
especially in the diaspora, that issue has most galvanized the
religious community, because it touches directly on its concern
about who can and should be called a Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Schorsch flew to Israel this week specifically to lobby
Parliament on what he considers ``a supremely important matter.''
American Reform Jews placed a quarter-page advertisement in
Wednesday's New York Times warning the Israeli Parliament,
``History will be your judge.''
</P>
<P>
   And a coalition of liberal groups here began a ``Freedom of
Religion in Israel'' campaign this week with its own newspaper
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Following Supreme Court rulings, the government has been
accepting as Jews those who were converted to Judaism abroad by
Reform or Conservative rabbis, then immigrated here.
</P>
<P>
   But a surge of immigration from former Soviet republics and
Ethiopia, including many non-Jewish relatives, forced the country
to deal with conversions in Israel too.
</P>
<P>
   Many turned to the Reform and Conservative synagogues for
conversion, only to find their conversions invalid in the eyes of
the government, which grants a good deal of control over religious
affairs to the Orthodox chief rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   The strictly Orthodox see Reform and Conservative conversions as
``quickies,'' or as some put it, ``snip and dunk'' conversions that
ask little more than circumcision from the men and immersion in a
ritual bath from the women.
</P>
<P>
   But their basic complaint is with the more liberal movements
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about converts who underwent a conversion
process by Reform `rabbis' who themselves are prepared to betroth
single-sex couples and mixed Jewish and Christian couples,'' one of
Israel's two chief rabbis, Yisrael Meir Lau, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   A series of lawsuits drew attention to the issue two years ago.
The courts and Parliament agreed to back off while a government
commission tried to find a compromise solution.
</P>
<P>
   But the compromise _ the creation of a conversion institute with
Reform, Conservative and Orthodox teachers, whose graduates would
be judged by the Orthodox religious courts _ was deemed
unacceptable by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The situation remained frozen until the chief judge of Jerusalem
ruled last week, ordering the government to register as Jews 23
immigrants who had undergone Reform or Conservative conversions,
some in Israel and some abroad. The issue is due to go before the
Supreme Court in February.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israelis say the courts have proceeded gingerly on
decisions affecting religious issues, not compelling government
action until it became clear that the government would not act on
its own.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the army exemptions, for instance, the Supreme
Court asked Parliament to make the next move.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say that the conflict is heading toward some kind
of denouement, in which the relationship between religion and state
could be altered.
</P>
<P>
   On a grass-roots level, for instance, many Israelis are
beginning to demand the legalization of civil weddings, which are
not recognized by the government.
</P>
<P>
   If the coming elections bring in a centrist or leftist
government, the strength of the religious parties could be hobbled
and the edge could be taken off these issues. Court decisions would
certainly not face the same opposition from the government.
</P>
<P>
   But close observers of religion and society here say the
passions raised are too deep-seated to be resolved easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see here is a clash between two codes, between Jewish
law and Western law,'' said Avirama Golan, a religion writer for
the newspaper Haaretz. ``Can we solve it? I don't know. It's a test
for us. But I'm not sure we're able to live in a normal state.''

MILLIONS OF LOST DOLLARS LATER, NBA PLAYERS AND OWNERS SETTLE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ National Basketball Association players and owners
brought to an end the most calamitous and costly labor dispute in
league history, agreeing to an 11th-hour deal that saved the
1998-99 season from termination and perhaps the sport from
incalculable ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiating for 12 hours and trading concessions until 6 a.m.
Wednesday morning at the league offices in Manhattan, NBA
Commissioner David Stern and Billy Hunter, the union executive
director, led a group of six people in hashing out a seven-year
collective bargaining agreement that ended the 194-day lockout.
</P>
<P>
   An abbreviated regular season of 52 games is expected to begin
Feb. 2 with a full compliment of playoffs beginning in early May.
The regular season could be extended one to two weeks, but the
playoffs will not spill over into July.
</P>
<P>
   Training camps and the signing of 200 free agents will not begin
until Jan. 18, when the deal is expected to be reduced to writing
by lawyers. The 30 regular season games lost translate total player
salary losses to about $400 million, and leaguewide revenue losses
were also huge.
</P>
<P>
   In divvying up $2 billion in annual revenue _ the crux of their
disagreement the past six months _ the league achieved its primary
goal of containing the contracts of high-salaried players and the
union significantly bettered the economic position of its middle
class, it's stated No. 1 priority.
</P>
<P>
   They split their differences in total revenue percentages, with
the union receiving 55 percent in the last three years of the deal.
The feeling among some of the union membership was that the players
had given in to many of the league's demands at the last possible
moment, but that some major concessions were achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the NBA came perilously close to becoming the first
major sports league to lose an entire season to labor strife after
having never lost a game to work stoppage in 52 seasons, few
considered Wednesday morning's surprise announcement anything but
fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call at 6 a.m. in my hotel room this morning and I
couldn't believe it,'' the free agent center Joe Kleine said. ``We
will finally play again. Now we have a bigger job ahead of us:
getting our fans back.''
</P>
<P>
   Kleine was one of 179 players who came to Manhattan the day
after Hunter said he would put the owners' final offer to a vote of
the general membership, a development that created major disruption
and near chaos in the union, as players flocked to New York unsure
of the parameters surrounding a vote.
</P>
<P>
   But after Hunter asked one of the union's outside counsels to go
over to the league's offices at 6 p.m. Wednesday night to meet with
the deputy commissioner Russ Granik and present several concessions
to the league, the bargaining began.
</P>
<P>
   The league announced that its labor relations committee had
unanimously approved the deal. The agreement was also approved
Wednesday by the membership of the union, upon the unanimous
recommendation of its negotiating committee, by a vote of 174-5.
Details will not be released until after the league ratifies the
agreement at its board of governors meeting Thursday at 11 a.m. at
a Manhattan hotel, but apparently both sides had their key concerns
met in the wee hours of Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did we blink?'' Hunter asked rhetorically. ``I guess we both
blinked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect the agreement to be ratified by the Board of
Governors at tomorrow's meeting,'' said David Stern in a prepared
statement ``I have agreed with Billy Hunter that I will not discuss
the agreement in detail until after its approval by the board. I
will say that I am elated that we will be playing basketball this
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiating secretly in a conference room at the league's
Olympic Tower offices, the two sides gave each other a list of
their desires. When they came across a disagreement, Hunter said,
they moved on.

106TH CONGRESS OPENS AS CLINTON TRIAL LOOMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The 106th Congress opened Wednesday with new
pledges of bipartisanship, but the impeachment trial of President
Clinton threatened to upset the cooperative tone that new House
Speaker Dennis Hastert tried to set on his first day on the job.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks following his formal election as speaker, the
Illinois Republican told lawmakers that he wanted the 106th
Congress to be remembered for its accomplishments rather than the
partisan bickering that so divided the last House.
</P>
<P>
   So he called on Republicans and Democrats alike to put aside
their ill feelings over the impeachment proceedings and go to work
on ``the people's business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Solutions to problems cannot be found in a pool of bitterness.
They can be found in an environment in which we trust one another's
word,'' Hastert said, adding that it was long past time for members
to ``respect one another.''
</P>
<P>
   His plea for more civility from members followed an earlier
appeal from House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., for more
cooperation between Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's bury the hatchet,'' he told Hastert as he handed over
the gavel during the traditional swearing-in ceremony for the new
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put to rest the poisonous politics which have infected
this place,'' Gephardt added.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks by the leaders drew a standing ovation from the
lawmakers assembled in the chamber along with family and friends
for their own swearing-in ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   But less than two hours later, the spirit of bipartisanship gave
way to divisiveness as the House moved on to one of its first
chores of the new year _ approving a resolution naming House
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and several of his
GOP colleagues as managers of the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   While Hyde argued that the managers, who will serve as
prosecutors, would ensure that fairness prevails and the ``rule of
law'' is upheld in the Senate trial, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee,
D-Texas, contended that appointing managers would merely ``give
credence to the partisanship of this impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote of 221-197 that appointed the managers broke down along
party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Like the House, the Senate also opened for business Wednesday
with with swearing-in ceremonies for 34 new or re-elected senators.
But the normally celebratory spirit of the occasion was also marred
somewhat by the turmoil surrounding the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   In his address following his formal re-election as Majority
Leader, Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he was hopeful that impeachment
proceedings could be completed in reasonable time and without
upsetting regular business.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that the seriousness of the matter could
preoccupy the chamber for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our responsibilities under the Constitution and we
will meet those responsibilities in an orderly fashion,'' Lott
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott went on to outline a legislative agenda similar to that
offered by Hastert in his swearing-in speech. Both Republican
leaders said they wanted Congress to concentrate on preserving
Social Security, improving education, boosting defense spending and
reducing taxes over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the impeachment controversy, many Republicans still
insist that Congress can get back to work in a bipartisan way.
House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, even predicted
in a recent interview that Clinton would be cooperative in dealing
with the Republican-controlled Congress on Social Security and
other important legislative matters because ``all of us still want
to put the business of the American people first.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I will be surprised if any of this carries over into
the substantive issues,'' Archer said, adding that he hopes to
continue work on tax matters and other issues with the full
cooperation of his Democratic colleagues on the Ways and Means
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that we didn't get much accomplished (in the
105th Congress) because we were so focused on the impeachment
proceedings,'' Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said recently. ``But now
we won't be able to use impeachment as an excuse not to get
something done.''
</P>
<P>
   That was clearly Hastert's hope as he broke with tradition and
delivered his opening remarks from the well of the House rather
from the lofty perch of the speaker's chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am breaking tradition this once,'' he said, appealing for
more cooperation among members, ``because my legislative home is
here on the floor with you, and so is my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   He called on his colleagues from both sides of the aisle to
focus less on politics and more on producing major legislation,
saying he would be ready to meet his Democratic counterparts
``halfway'' in order to compromise on difficult issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stalemate is not an option,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of bipartisanship, Hastert was sworn in by Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich., the senior member of the House. Minutes
later, the new speaker administered the oath to the other 221
Republicans along with the 211 Democrats and one independent.
</P>
<P>
   The House is still one member short because of the retirement of
former Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. A special election will be held
soon to select a replacement for Gingrich, who resigned in the wake
of GOP election losses in November.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to approving the prosecutors for the impeachment
trial, the House also passed a change in the gift ban rule that
will allow members and their aides to accept free meals and other
gifts under limited circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The change will make the rules governing House members the same
as the those that senators are required to observe. The new rule
will allow noncash gifts up to $50. The old House rules barred
members from accepting any free gifts or meals.

JAMES C. MULLEN TO BECOME BIOGEN PRESIDENT, CEO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Biogen Inc. Wednesday called James C. Mullen, a 10-year
company veteran, back from Paris to be its president and chief
operating officer and, potentially, its next chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Mullen, 40, had headed the Cambridge-based biotechnology giant's
European operations since 1996. The appointment follows the abrupt
resignation of chief executive James Tobin on Dec. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin, 54, said he resigned over an unspecificed conflict with
Biogen's longtime board chairman and former chief executive, James
L. Vincent, 59, who has since served as interim chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent repeated Wednesday that he plans to remain in that job
for at least a year, but that Mullen is a front-runner to take over
after that. ``He certainly is leading the pack,'' Vincent said. ``I
think Jim will move in and take over responsibility at this company
in a very short period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Mullen, who had been vice president, international, and
based in Paris, had been tapped already by Vincent and Tobin to
return to Cambridge later this year as chief operating officer, a
post vacant since Tobin was elevated from it in 1997 to chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been working on this game plan for the last six to
eight months. We were going to be implementing it four or five
months from now,'' Vincent said. Along with Mullen's promotion
Wednesday, Biogen also named five new vice presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Mullen, despite his youth, described himself in a brief phone
interview Wednesday as ``one of the older guys on the management
team,'' familiar with most facets of Biogen's business.
</P>
<P>
   He said the organizational changes are designed to deal with
growth from ``a company that had gone from no sales only a few
years ago to $600 million to $700 million, as we add products to go
into the multibillion-dollar range.''
</P>
<P>
   Biogen reported sales of $389.2 million for the first nine
months of 1998, following full-year sales of $411.9 million in
1997. A First Call Corp. analyst survey last November reported an
average earnings estimate for 1998 of $1.80 per share, versus $1.17
in earnings for 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Mullen joined Biogen in 1989 as director of facilities and
engineering. He was promoted to vice president for operations in
1992 and was responsible for opening manufacturing operations in
Cambridge and in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Named vice president, international in 1996, he was stationed in
Paris and responsible for introducing Biogen's flagship drug for
multiple sclerosis, Avonex, to the European market _ a job that
thrust him into marketing and regulatory affairs roles.
</P>
<P>
   Biogen shares leapt 2 points Wednesday after Mullen's promotion
was announced, but ended the day on Nasdaq at 80 5/16, down 1/4.
Donald Stone, an analyst at Cowen &AMP; Co. in Boston, said these
fluctuations meant little, and called the appointment ``a positive
(that) resolves the uncertainty investors faced in not knowing who
was going to run the company.''
</P>
<P>
   While describing Biogen as on a solid business course, some
analysts said the company, and Mullen, must be prepared to deal
with Vincent's strong personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope is that this will be a permanent choice,'' Viren
Mehta, of Mehta Partners in New York, said. But, Mehta added,
``This will require an adjustment on both their parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg News Wednesday reported Vincent confirmed that Tobin
had told the Biogen board, on Dec. 11, that he intended to resign
if Vincent, who had earlier indicated plans to retire, remained
with the company any longer. The board sided with Vincent.

<P>
   It was the hottest ticket to the biggest show in town, a pink
piece of pasteboard about the size of a dollar bill but worth much
more that fevered spring of 1868.
</P>
<P>
   ``Admit the Bearer,'' it read in feathery script, to the
impeachment of the president of the United States, Andrew Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Over a period of three months, as the snows of the capital's
harsh winter gave way to spring flowers and the typically combative
Johnson kept a quiet vigil in the White House, the coveted tickets
were doled out, day by day, for seats in the airless galleries of
the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The draw was a dramatic political spectacle, as much high
theater as a political stumble in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Like today's impeachment trial of Bill Clinton _ only the second
presidential impeachment in the country's history _ the trial of
Andrew Johnson posed unique procedural and constitutional questions
for the Congress. The Senate, the chief justice of the Supreme
Court, and the impeachment managers from the House of
Representatives all gingerly picked their way through uncharted
constitutional territory.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Johnson ultimately survived the ordeal, holding onto his
presidency by a one-vote margin in the Senate vote on May 16, after
37 days of speeches and testimony stretched from March to mid-May.
But his trial, conducted partly behind locked doors and partly in
public on the stage of the Senate chamber, changed the course of
reconstruction after the Civil War, held official Washington in
thrall and recalibrated the balance of power between Congress and
the executive.
</P>
<P>
   What saved Johnson, many historians say, were smart lawyers, a
pretty good case on legal grounds and the fact that some Republican
senators who started out undecided eventually allowed themselves to
be swayed by the defense arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear most senators wanted the impeachment to be a
serious event and took it very seriously,'' said Michael Les
Benedict, a political scientist at Ohio State University who has
written a book about the Johnson impeachment. Both houses, however,
had been at constant war with the president since he took office on
the death of Abraham Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   A politician who presented himself as the defender of the common
man, Johnson had risen from the post of a Democratic city alderman
in Tennessee to a seat in the House. Alone among southern
congressmen, he remained there after the secession of the
confederate states. Lincoln, a Republican, made him his
vice-presidential candidate on a Union ticket. But once he became
president in 1865, Johnson broke with the Republicans, chiefly over
how to treat the defeated South. The Radical faction within the
party wanted the confederate states kept out of the Union until
they guaranteed full civil and voting rights to freed slaves.
Moderate and conservative Republican factions had similar views,
although they did not go as far as the Radicals.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson sided with the Democratic minority, in favor of swift
reunification of the country without conditions on the southern
states. House Republicans in 1867 twice tried to impeach him, but
were foiled by internal party squabbles. They jumped at the chance
again in late February 1868, when Johnson dismissed Secretary of
War Edwin M. Stanton, a close ally of the Radical Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   After only three days of debate, the House voted 126-47 to
impeach.
</P>
<P>
   In 11 articles of impeachment written after the vote , the House
majority accused Johnson of violating the Tenure of Office Act,
which had passed over the president's veto the year before. The law
barred the president from firing any government official who had
been appointed with congressional advise and consent. Some of the
articles also charged Johnson had shown disrespect to the Congress
in speeches and comments.
</P>
<P>
   On March 6, the Senate was sworn in as a court to hear the
impeachment case and issued a summons to Johnson to appear the next
week _ a Friday the 13th, as it happened.
</P>
<P>
   An illustrator for Harper's Weekly (``Journal of Civilization,''
the magazine called itself) imagined how the scene played out when
the Senate's sergeant-at-arms called on the president. In the
drawing, Johnson, clean-shaven and dressed in a dark waistcoat,
wears a characteristically dour expression. Top hat in his hand,
the official hands him the summons. Johnson, it was reported at the
time, said only that he would ``attend to the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   When the day for Johnson's appearance arrived, the galleries
were packed with diplomats, congressional wives and others with
enough clout to secure a ticket. Many in the crowd and on the
Senate floor apparently believed that Johnson would indeed appear
in person.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant-at-arms called out, ``Andrew Johnson, president of
the United States! Andrew Johnson, president of the United States!
Appear and answer the articles of impeachment exhibited against you
by the House of Representatives of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The doors to the Senate chamber were thrown open. But Johnson
never appeared. Instead, his four lawyers entered through a side
door and proceeded to ask for a 40-day delay to prepare the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty days!'' declared Thaddeus Stevens, a Pennsylvania
representative and ardent Johnson enemy who had led the impeachment
drive in the House. ``As much as it took the Lord to destroy the
world by flood?'' The defense was given 10 days.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After another delay, the substantive part of the trial opened on
March 30. The House impeachment managers ran the show, calling 19
witnesses. Benjamin Butler, one of the managers, opened the
proceeding with a speech on the British legal precedents concerning
high crimes and misdemeanors and the powers of a tribunal.It was an
oddly legalistic speech for the former general, who as the
administrator of New Orleans after its fall to federal troops had
once warned the city's women that if any one of them again voiced
``contempt'' for Union soldiers she would be treated as ``a lady of
the town.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler soon switched to his well-known flamboyant and colorful
personal-attack style. ``By murder most foul he succeeded to the
presidency,'' Butler cried, ``and is the elect of an assassin to
that office!''
</P>
<P>
   Among the congressmen, there were squabbles. Should Benjamin
Wade, the Senate president, be allowed to vote since he stood to
succeed Johnson as president? It was decided he could. There was,
after all, one other known conflict of interest. One of the
Tennessee senators was Johnson's son-in-law. Then there was the
issue of the role of the chief justice of the Supreme Court, Salmon
T. Chase. Should he decide questions of law and procedure or simply
refer them to the senators for decision? After a vote, Chase was
given the power to decide questions of law, although they could be
appealed to the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The president's defense, as put forth by his lead lawyers, Henry
Stanbery, former attorney general, and William M. Evarts, the head
of the New York bar association, was multi-tiered. They argued, on
one hand, that Stanton was not covered by the Tenure of Office Act.
On the other, they said that a president in rare cases can violate
a law if that is the only way to force it before the courts for a
ruling on its constitutionality. If the senators did not agree, the
lawyers also argued, they should accept that Johnson believed he
had that right when he dismissed Stanton.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, after 37 days of hearings, the Senate voted. During
the trial, the senators had said little, speaking only to raise
points of order or object to witnesses. When they had something to
discuss, they left the chamber and huddled in what was called the
ladies' parlor. What was said during these private sessions was
never recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, meanwhile, secretly sought a compromise with moderate
Republicans, promising that if acquitted he would no longer stand
in the way of their reconstruction plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before that he had never compromised with these moderates,
although he could have long before,'' said Hans L. Trefousse, the
author of books on the impeachment and several of its major
figures. ``If he had done so, he would not have been impeached.''
</P>
<P>
   When the vote took place, on May 16, Johnson's conciliatory
attitude and the legal arguments had their effect. Seven
Republicans joined the Democrats. To impeach, the majority needed
36 senators united. The vote was 35-19 and Andrew Johnson remained
in the White House.

PLAYERS FACE WEIGHTY ROAD BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Walter McCarty knows what to expect now. Simply, the
Celtics forward is about to lose weight. He gained 15 pounds in the
extended offseason, but McCarty understands that newfound weight _
all muscle, by the way _ will have a tough time surviving the Rick
Pitino Test.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know I'm not going to be able to keep this weight on,''
McCarty said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke from the raucous lobby of the GM Building, where many
NBA players had come to express their feelings on the lockout. Some
had traveled to vote on the owners' final proposal, only to be
surprised to learn that a deal in principle had been struck
overnight between their union and the NBA's Board of Governors.
McCarty knows he doesn't have time to be surprised now because
there's a coach in Boston who is ready to put him to work. Greg
Minor, Kenny Anderson, Dana Barros, and Andrew DeClercq, who were
all here Wednesday, can tell you about that, too.
</P>
<P>
   So the NBA lockout is over. What that means for fans nd
television executives is that their normal routines can resume.
What that means for the Celtics is that they will now be
accountable for the previous six months. They will go to training
camp, most likely on Jan. 18, and be drilled by Pitino. This is not
a good thing. The coach has spent the past months wrestling with
severe boredom. He zipped through a 1,000-page book on Harry Truman
and even found time to start writing a book. He went to the office
a few times during the lockout, pretending that workouts were
starting the next day. He'll be eager to put some real live players
through workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be ready,'' McCarty said. ``I was just playing ball a few
days ago.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Celtics do begin to train, they will not be at Brandeis
University for long. Their new facility in Waltham, Mass., is only
about eight weeks away from completion. But that's for the Celtics.
Here is what their fans can expect as a result of the resolved
dispute:
</P>
<P>
   --Antoine Walker _ maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Put it this way: If the Celtics trade their 6-foot-9-inch
forward now, it will not be because of an inability to sign him.
Before the lockout, there had been talk of Walker getting a
contract in the $100 million range. He can't get that now. It's
illegal. The new collective bargaining agreement, when finalized,
will state that players in Walker's class (0-6 years of experience)
can earn a maximum of $85.68 million over seven years. That's a
long way from $100 million, but it's still a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   When training camp begins, the Celtics will be able to talk
about a contract with Walker. He said last summer that if the team
doesn't sign him before the season, he will most assuredly leave
when his deal expires.
</P>
<P>
   --Paul Pierce _ for more years.
</P>
<P>
   Under the previous agreement, rookies were signed to three-year
guaranteed contracts. Now it's five years. The difference is that
teams have an option in the fourth year, and in the fifth, they
have the right of first refusal. So now teams can evaluate young
players for five years rather than three. Rookie Pierce, the 6-7
forward from Kansas, only has to worry about competing for a
starting job at small forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't conceding a thing,'' said McCarty, the starter there
most of last season.
</P>
<P>
   --A familiar roster _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   Some teams, like the Bulls, were loaded with free agents. Not
the Celtics. Take a look at their players under contract: Walker,
Anderson, McCarty, Barros, Minor, DeClercq, Pierce (in a few
weeks), Pervis Ellison, Travis Knight, Ron Mercer, Bruce Bowen.
Popeye Jones is the lone free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The team would like to sign free agent center Matt Geiger. But
they would have to do some roster shuffling to get him and they
will almost certainly have to part with Jones, whom Pitino loves.
Another way to secure free agents is through salary cap exceptions;
one of the two can be extended six years.
</P>
<P>
   --PitinoBall _ at 78 rpm.
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that the Celtics will be hurt by the 52-game
schedule because Pitino's scrambling system is heavily linked to
conditioning. But that assumes his players are in woeful shape.
Most of them are not. A half-dozen Celtics were working out
together less than a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that other teams will be hurt by the Celtics' style
more than the Celtics. Pitino knows he can use this short schedule
to his advantage. Some of the more experienced teams may be rested,
but none want to play this style right now. The Celtics? They are
going to play how they play, lockout or not. Anyway, you can be
sure Pitino will remind them that it won't take much to get them a
taste of the playoffs. Thirty wins might get a division title.

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, said
Wednesday night that the Senate was getting ``closer and closer''
to a plan for an impeachment trial of President Clinton that could
last as long as six weeks, and end with an actual vote on the two
articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   His announcement Wednesday on the Senate floor, just hours after
the 106th Congress convened, appeared to put an end to any hopes by
Democrats and the White House for a bipartisan compromise plan that
would have dispensed with a trial in little more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, Lott had conceded to senators that the emerging
plan for the first impeachment trial of a president in 130 years
would be one ``that neither the House nor the White House will just
necessarily think is wonderful but will give all parties a fair
chance to make the case and get to a conclusion that's an equitable
one.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist set to swear in
Senators for the trial on Thursday, the two parties remained split
over whether to allow witnesses to testify. House Republicans want
to call such key witnesses as Monica Lewinsky and perhaps Vernon
Jordan, but Democrats have adamantly opposed calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Lott did not say how the volatile issue of witnesses would be
handled, calling that question ``one of the critical points.''
Other lawmakers said the Senate might control the calling of
witnesses by taking a vote on whether to allow each one.
</P>
<P>
   ``All sides of this Rubik's cube have been talked about,' Lott
said Wednesday evening. ``We hope to have this all resolved
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was not clear Wednesday that Democrats would agree
with whatever plan emerged and Lott was careful not to suggest he
had yet found the magic formula. ``I don't think it's safe to
assume anything right now,'' he told reporters, ``so don't be
trying to read my body English or anything else. Nothing is written
in stone.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides declined to respond to Lott's brief
announcement of a possibly lengthier trial, saying that they still
did not know what procedures the Senate would adopt. ``I'm not
going to try to decipher the meaning of that,'' said Joseph
Lockhart, the White House spokesman. ``We will await an
announcement of what their process is before commenting further.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the Capitol in the House, lawmakers elected a new,
little-known speaker, Rep. Dennis Hastert, 57, who appealed for the
House to put aside the deep divisions that had engulfed it late
last year in the final days of its impeachment proceedings.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Only minutes after he was elected speaker of the
House on Wednesday, Dennis Hastert flashed the regular-guy charm
and Midwestern sensibility that his backers hope will insulate him
from the partisan warfare that toppled the previous speaker and a
would-be successor in less than two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, Speak...'' Hastert said, as Democratic Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt handed him the speaker's gavel, a slip of the
tongue that spoke volumes about his quest for bipartisanship and
perhaps, Democrats wish, an ability to see the future.
</P>
<P>
   Then Hastert handed Gephardt the gavel for safekeeping, stepped
down from the speaker's lofty perch and ambled back down to the
well of the House. ``Customarily, a new speaker gives his first
remarks from the speaker's chair,'' Hastert said as he addressed
his colleagues in the 106th Congress. ``While I have great respect
for the traditions of this House and the institution, I am breaking
tradition this once, because my legislative home is on the floor
here with you, and so is my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 12 years in Congress, Rep. John Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., a
bear-like lawmaker who was catapulted from obscurity and drafted
for the job of speaker only three weeks ago, has earned a
reputation as a ``nice guy.'' He is the kind of rare Washington
commodity who knows how to listen, stifles his temper and keeps his
word, members say, which is why he swiftly received the backing of
moderate and conservative Republicans alike.
</P>
<P>
   But, no matter how congenial and hard working, Hastert faces a
daunting double-barreled challenge: He comes to the job of speaker
as one of the most untested leaders in memory, a no-name
congressman new to to the battles of top- tier politics, and he
confronts one of the most sharply divided, least forgiving,
Congress' in years.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with only a slim, 10-vote Republican majority in the
House, Hastert will have to tread carefully between Republicans and
Democrats, conservatives and moderates, chairmen and ranking
members to sidestep last year's damaging tag of a ``Do Nothing
Congress'' and get legislation passed.
</P>
<P>
   High on his list are a host of prickly, but popular, issues:
Shoring up Social Security, passing tax cuts, fixing schools,
pumping up the nation's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative ideologues, most of them from the rebel class of
1994, will watch Hastert closely for any tarnishing of the
impeccable conservative credentials that his votes have displayed.
</P>
<P>
   But, at the same time, he must work with Democrats who are both
emboldened by their gains in the November elections and embittered
over the impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are also the first to raise their suspicions about
Hastert's close ties as chief deputy whip to Rep. Tom DeLay,
R-Texas, the House's top vote counter and a powerful conservative.
DeLay locked up the votes for Hastert only hours after Rep. Bob
Livingston, R-La., who had been designated the next speaker,
announced his resignation Dec. 19. Democrats now wonder about
Hastert's independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a question mark,'' said Rep. Thomas Barrett, D-Wis.,
who has worked closely with Hastert on the Committee on government
Reform and Oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got his work cut out for him,'' Barrett said, alluding to
the narrow Republican majority in the House. He cited ``a deeply
divided Republican caucus, and a Democratic caucus that feels that
it has just been burned royally,'' adding, ``It's not an enviable
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans roll their eyes at the presumption that Hastert's
relationship with DeLay, his inexperience and his soft edge make
him a pushover. ``I've never seen anyone step on Denny,'' said Rep.
Chris Shays, R-Conn., a moderate who clashed with DeLay over
campaign finance legislation. ``I haven't seen anyone even get
close to it. And if anyone has tried, he got him in a good
headlock. It's probably that very few people saw it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Republicans in the House call it getting ``Dennyized.''
</P>
<P>
   A bulky arm would suddenly drape over their shoulders and,
before long, they would pour their hearts out about an upcoming
vote on the House floor. Hastert, his thick glasses framing his
face, would genially press them to be part of the legislative team,
all the while making sure they they leave with their egos intact.
</P>
<P>
   It is a style that Hastert, 57, honed as a high-school wrestling
coach in the rural town of Yorkville, Ill., in the 1960s and 1970s.
Bob Evans, a friend and fellow coach, said Hastert knew instantly
what each boy would be good at, and knew how to talk to the boys
about their weaknesses and still ``make them feel good about
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He just knows how to get along with people,'' said Rep. Ray
LaHood, R-Ill., who has known Hastert since 1982. ``He has the
ability to sit down and listen 80 percent of the time. And when you
listen 80 percent of the time, you give people the feeling you are
concerned about what they are concerned about, and that endears you
to people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the vitriolic atmosphere that has pervaded the House in the
past two years, colleagues say Hastert's approach to politics,
which he has vowed to keep intact as speaker, could usher in
gentler time. Many saw him as the ideal antidote to the bitterness
and controversy that marked last year's turn of events: the
election losses, Rep. Newt Gingrich's ouster as speaker, followed
by Livingston's resignation under the cloud of a sex scandal and
then President Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that moment, people were really tired of controversy and
the high drama that had been going on,'' LaHood said of the hours
that followed Livingston's announcement. ``He is the most
noncontroversial person in the House.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Hastert's style could not be more different than
Gingrich's, something that members note with a sense of relief.
</P>
<P>
   Cast as the regular guy, Hastert is a plain-talker, more
comfortable working in the shadows than before the camera lights.
He has no plans to become a national party spokesman, leaving that
task to other members. He does not easily go off on tangents,
intellectual or otherwise. And he is not a talker.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert did not work his way up to speaker through the ranks of
the top leadership; he was never a majority leader or a whip or a
conference chairman. He doesn't even have a leadership PAC yet,
which is an invaluable tool to raise money and build support.
</P>
<P>
   Many people would see that as a liability. Most House
Republicans do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a clean start, a new beginning,'' said Rep. David
McIntosh, R-Ind., echoing the conventional wisdom among House
Republicans. ``Here is a guy who is a family man, who is hymble,
not flashy, who connects with real people. He's not a Gingrich
figure, or a Ronald Reagan figure, but a good solid person in our
leadership.''

NBA, UNION SETTLE; 52-GAME SEASON SET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The National Basketball Association and its players'
union, locked in a contentious six-month labor dispute and 36 hours
from a drop-dead date, finally reached agreement early Wednesday to
save what remains of the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David Stern and union executive director Billy
Hunter staged an all-night bargaining session which produced an
agreement in principle at 6 a.m. It was approved by the players
Wednesday afternoon, should be ratified by the owners Thursday; it
will result in a reduced season of 52 games commencing on or about
Feb. 2. No schedule was released.
</P>
<P>
   The league did not comment, other than to note that an agreement
was reached ending the lockout that began July 1. Had no agreement
been reached, Stern would have recommended Thursday that the owners
cancel the season. Hunter, who had invited all NBA players to a
meeting here ostensibly to support the union, said, ``They gave a
little and we gave a little. The deal overall is pretty balanced.''
The new deal will run for six years.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials told players that training camps will open in
7-10 days, or once the agreement has been reduced to writing. There
will be roughly two weeks of practice before games begin. Most of
the 52 games will be played against conference opponents, with
perhaps a half-dozen against nonconference foes. The regular season
will end the first week of May _ a two-week extension _ and the NBA
Finals may even stretch into the first few days of July. But there
will be basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's get it started,'' said Laker phenom Kobe Bryant, one of
about 200 players who attended Wednesday's union meeting. ``I think
this is a good deal for most of the players.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no word from the game's most important player, Michael
Jordan, who is considering retirement. His agent, David Falk,
released a statement saying Jordan would continue to mull his
options. ``I'm not certain what his time frame is,'' Falk said.
</P>
<P>
   Most players familiar with Jordan think the Chicago superstar
will retire. Jordan was not at Wednesday's meeting; former teammate
Ron Harper said Jordan was playing golf in the Bahamas. Under the
terms of the new deal, Jordan could sign for 105 percent of what he
made last year, a deal which would earn him almost $35 million.
Only the Bulls could pay him that amount.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the new deal does not really help the Celtics. The
salary cap for this season was set at a lower-than-expected $30
million per team, which does not give Rick Pitino enough money
(less than $2 million) to sign even a mid-range free agent center.
However, the deal does mean that free agent-to-be Antoine Walker
will be limited to what he can earn. Once thought to be a player
worth $115 million or more, Walker can now receive no more on a
six-year extension (he has a year left on his contact) than $85.68
million. He still might be traded, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Most players arrived at Wednesday's meeting thinking there would
be some undefined vote supporting the union's executive committee,
which had rejected the owners' so-called ``final offer.'' All they
knew was that they already had lost half their salaries, their
season was on the brink of elimination, and their futures were
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they were asked for reactions to a deal they knew
nothing about as they entered the General Motors Building on 5th
Avenue, fittingly adjacent to F.A.O. Schwartz. It was a pleasant
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing to see the atmosphere in that room once the
guys realized that there was a deal,'' said Dee Brown, the player
representative for the Toronto Raptors. ``There were a lot of
smiling faces. I think it was so different because the agenda was
now different. If we didn't have a deal to vote on, I'm not sure
what would have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Detroit's Jerome Williams put it, ``There was going to be
some blood on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter presented the deal and asked that it be endorsed. Union
president Patrick Ewing then spoke briefly and the players voted.
It was a no-brainer. The players put their name on a piece of paper
and voted, and the result was overwhelming _ 179-5, according to a
union official.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone came out of the room smiling,'' said longtime NBA
player Rick Mahorn. ``The majority won.''
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Stern and several NBA officials arrived at the
meeting in yet another attempted display of newfound community.
Stern spoke for about 10 minutes and said it was time to forget the
often bitter tone of the negotiations and work on rebuilding the
league and the partnership between players and management. Many
players left the meeting wearing small blue buttons saying,
``SOLID,'' as well as big smiles.
</P>
<P>
   The new deal is more beneficial to the so-called ``middle
class,'' which is what the union said it wanted. It also has limits
on what players can earn, depending on length of service. The union
lowered the percentage of what it wants from overall income in the
final three years of the deal. Rookies now will be eligible for
free agency after four years instead of three, and minimum salaries
have been increased and scaled, again according to length of
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is an extremely fair deal for most of the
players,'' said agent Steve Kauffman, most of whose clients are
mid-range earners. ``We didn't have any leverage. And Billy was in
a difficult situation with certain agents and high-end players. He
had to walk a fine line.''
</P>
<P>
   Many NBA and club officials withheld comment. However, John
Calipari, former coach at the University of Massachusetts and
currently coach and head basketball honcho for the New Jersey Nets,
said he was ``giddy'' when he woke up in the morning and heard the
news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was enjoying the time with my family, but it was time,''
Calipari said. ``I was going to college games, but it was like
studying without having any tests. Those are the games.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of the union's critics, Toronto's Kevin Willis and New
Jersey's Jayson Williams, also were present. Both had called for a
secret ballot of the rank-and-file when it appeared that the sides
were not going to get a deal done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't against the union,'' Williams said. ``I said what was
on my mind. I always say what's on my mind. But we owe an apology
to the fans and to the people we've hurt whose livelihood depends
on us playing. We hurt these people at Christmas. Maybe we should
sit down with the league and do something for them. I just hope
they forgive us.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning back the fans could be the real test. Virtually every
poll conducted on fan reaction during the lockout registered
universal apathy. No one cared. One person wrote a letter to an
Atlanta newspaper two weeks ago saying, ``Thanks, NBA, for the best
season I've ever had. Keep it up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough,'' said free agent center Joe Kleine.
``They're not going to welcome us back with open arms. We know that
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Agent Keith Glass, whose clientele also consists of mid- and
minimum-level earners, said the fans are the ones now in control.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't like the way things are being done, now is your
chance to be heard,'' Glass said. ``Speak up. Don't go to games.
Don't buy the jerseys. I'm already sick of reading my quotes in the
paper. Imagine how the fans feel. It's absurd.''

 WASHINGTON: our leadership.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The son of working-class parents in Illinois' corn country,
Hastert clutches tightly to his Midwestern sensibilities. Every
weekend, he flies home to his modest ranch house on the Fox River.
He shops for his own groceries and eats in the Cozy Corner diner om
Yorkville. To relax, he carves wooden ducks and collects antique
cars, including a red firetruck that he takes to parades. And he
drives around with Max, a Labrador retriever, in the front seat of
his car. Hastert and his wife, Jean, have two grown sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get in his car and you get out, you got dog hairs all over
your suit,'' said state Rep. Tom Cross, who now holds Hastert's old
state House seat. ``But that's Denny.''
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of three sons, Hastert grew up about 45 miles
southwest of Chicago, in a heavily Republican area that includes
Ronald Reagan's boyhood home of Dixon. The district, which Hastert
represents, is now an amalgam of rich cornfields and suburban
bedroom communities.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Jack, was an embalmer for funeral homes during the
Depression and later operated a farm supply store near the family's
hometown of Oswego. Jack Hastert also owned a restaurant called the
Clock Tower.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, Hastert delivered feed to farmers, and in
college, he got up at 3 a.m. to deliver milk.
</P>
<P>
   Religion was a strong force for Hastert, from his involvement
with his church's youth groups to his days at Wheaton College, an
evangelical Christian school near his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   In his professional life, Hastert says little about his
religious beliefs, but it is not unusual to find a Bible open in
his Capitol Hill apartment or see him thumbing through Scripture
before important votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religion is in his heart and mind, and not on his sleeve,''
Shays said. ``We need a little more of that kind of religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps three of Hastert's most talked about traits are his
integrity, patience and his ability to forge a compromise, all of
which he will need in abundance to handle the year's twist and
turns. ``He has been the most well-kept secret in the House,'' said
House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Gingrich appointed Hastert to head a task force
assigned to cobble together a Republican bill that would address
the concerns of voters fed up with managed health care. It was an
issue that had divided the Republican caucus and left the party
vulnerable to Democratic accusations that they were turning their
backs on patients.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, who has always been interested in health care, decided
early on to gather every shred of evidence he could find about
managed care, compile it for the group, and then just talk it out
for a few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He held his tongue, he held his patience,'' said Rep. Charles
Norwood, R-Ga., who wanted to permit all patients to sue their
managed care companies as a way of keeping them in check, an idea
unpopular with most Republicans. ``He managed that group by
listening more than talking. But when he needed to be firm, he was
firm. He would slam down his hand on the table _ that's it, wait a
minute, everybody is off track, everybody is wrong. He did it in
such a way that isn't offensive. Being a nice guy helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert filled the managed care legislation with a little bit of
everything. The strategy got him a bill that he managed to get
passed on the House floor, which were his orders from Gingrich, but
the bill angered Democrats, who saw it as a weak Republican
grab-bag. They voted against the bill and it died in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker also handled another contentious issue that
frequently angered Democrats and some moderate Republicans. Rather
than risk a battle with Shays, a moderate, over the 2000 census,
Hastert simply moved the issue away from Shays to another
subcommittee. Shays did not mind, he said. It was the
common-sensical thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never loses sight of his goal,'' said Rep. Sue Kelly,
R-N.Y., who was part of the managed care panel and is a member of
the whip team. ``He never loses sight of the ball; maybe that's the
old coach coming out in him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the internecine wars among Republicans, Hastert has not only
survived, but gained a reputation as a man of his word. After the
November elections, as Republican losses shook the party
leadership, about 50 House members wanted to draft Hastert for
majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   But Hastert had already promised his vote to the current
majority leader, Armey. He asked Armey if he could withdraw his
support, but when the Texas congressman refused, saying he wanted
to keep the post, Hastert decided to abide by his earlier pledge.
</P>
<P>
   He was also called into action to smooth tensions between DeLay
and Gingrich, after the whip and a group of young conservatives
sought to oust the speaker in a 1997 coup.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's voting record put him squarely in the camp of
conservative Republicans, and he recently received a 100 percent
approval rating from the Christian Coalition. He is also good at
steering money into his Illinois district; last September, he
funneled $250,000 of the defense budget to a Yorkville company for
a study of its caffeinated chewing gum.
</P>
<P>
   But his affable attitude often has the disarming effect of
making moderates and even some Democrats believe he agrees with
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who'd he be similar to as a speaker?'' said former Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., who was chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee. ``I'd say it'd be Tip O'Neill'' _ a liberal whose
congeniality often won over members of both parties. O'Neill,
D-Mass., retired in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert never shies away from a sports metaphor, and Wednesday
was no different. ``A good coach knows when to step back and let
others shine in the spotlight,'' Hastert told the House. ``A coach
worth his salt will instill in his team a sense of fair play,
camaraderie, respect of the game and for the opposition. Without
those, victory is hollow,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   A short distance away, DeLay beamed. His old friend, the man who
helped him get elected as whip in 1994, was assuming the speaker's
chair.
</P>
<P>
   And just across the room, former Republican Minority Leader Bob
Michel, R-Ill., who is known for his civility and amiability, also
watched his protege take the gavel. Hastert has been seeking advice
from his mentor, sometimes over a glass of bourbon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denny, always be mindful of the minority and their rights
under the rules of the House and you'll be better for it, you'll be
respected,'' Michel told Hastert recently. ``The speaker is speaker
of the whole House.''
</P>
<P>
   In a House that has changed dramatically since Michel retired in
1994, ``It isn't going to be easy, but I think he understands
that,'' said another friend, Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla.

SOME IRANIANS CALL FOR OVERHAUL OF INTELLIGENCE MINISTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Iranian political leaders said Wednesday that an
extraordinary admission that rogue intelligence officers had
carried out a wave of political killings showed that their
fractured government was capable of cleaning house.
</P>
<P>
   President Mohammed Khatami and a chief rival, Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri, said the acknowledgment by the Intelligence Ministry
proved that even the most feared security organ would be subject to
the law.
</P>
<P>
   But in other quarters there were hints of skepticism about the
official account that the ministry issued on Tuesday. The ministry
faulted an undisclosed number of rogue intelligence agents for the
serial killings late last year of five dissident writers and
opposition figures.
</P>
<P>
   An influential party that supports Khatami called for an
overhaul of the ministry, saying its failure to prevent and halt
the killings showed ``its weakness and incompetence.'' The group,
the Islamic Iran Partnership Party, called on Iranian authorities
not only to guarantee that those responsible for the killings were
put in trial, but also to ``follow up the case forcefully and
courageously and to abolish it from the roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Several prominent writers said despite the arrests they believed
that their lives were in danger.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were killed in November and December. They included
Daryush Foruhar, leader of a banned nationalist opposition group,
who with his wife, Parveneh Eskandari, was stabbed to death in his
house in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   The others were writers who disappeared one by one, to be found
dead in suburbs of the capital. Two, Mohammed Mokhtari and Mohammed
Pouyandeh, had had trouble with the authorities earlier in trying
to reinvigorate a banned writers' association. The third writer,
Majid Sharif, was not a member of that group, but like the other
two had written critically of the conservatives.

   In reaching an agreement with the league, Hunter avoided the
heated confrontations that could have taken place with 210 of the
league's 430 players in one room and under so much strain. With
financial futures and playing careers dependent on the outcome of a
vote, players entered the day concerned that teammates would be
pitted against each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we got everything settled before there was a
free-for-all,'' free-agent forward Charles Barkley said. ``It could
have been bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The carnage was saved. But the damage of this labor dispute on
the union could linger. After agreeing to a deal that many believed
was only minimally better than the one the league had been offering
all along _ and at a cost of almost $600 million in player salaries
_ Hunter's leadership has been put into question and his future is
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy negotiated them right into a hard cap and an escrow
system,'' Thomas said. ``There was a better deal on the table in
the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   No deal could be reached over the last three months during
negotiating sessions between the league and the union's leadership
that had been filled with finger-pointing and personal remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Often, Ewing was perceived as the extended arm of agent David
Falk, someone seen by the league as an impediment to completing a
deal. Although he had been apart of the negotiations, Ewing was
kept out of Tuesday night's crucial meeting. Any Falk influence had
been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys felt that maybe I've been too tough,'' said Ewing,
referring to members of the union's executive committee. ``So we
gave Billy the OK to go in and get it done by himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Alone, Hunter came to an agreement with Stern less than 30 hours
before the league's board of governors was to vote on canceling the
season. Although their potential to earn the astronomical salaries
of the past will be limited by maximums on the high-end players,
the six-year deal was approved, 206-4, by the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players have to take control and get the agents out,'' Thomas
said. ``That's what cost them $600 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, 250 players descended on Las Vegas and voted to
give the negotiating committee the authority to approve or reject
any proposals by the owners. The players sounded united. Any
players who spoke up, as did John Stockton and Jeff Hornacek, were
shouted down.
</P>
<P>
   This pattern of behavior by the negotiating committee continued
through the summer and fall and even this week. Several players who
spoke out over the past week were immediately reprimanded and
publicly scolded by the union's leadership. When Williams asked for
a vote on the owners' proposal and questioned the negotiating
team's ties to Falk, Ewing fired back. Alonzo Mourning, also a Falk
client and member of the negotiating committee, also took issue
with Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tense,'' Williams said. ``Me and Patrick talked. I
talked to Alonzo. I've been taking a little heat from guys over how
I should have said what I did to their faces. But I did say it to
their faces. They got the message, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Just in time. As the voices of disapproval grew louder, Hunter
could not put the owners' proposal up for vote Wednesday without
knowing what the outcome would be. If the players repudiated the
negotiating committee and accepted the owners' offer, Hunter and
Ewing could have been overthrown and Thomas might have been asked
to step forward to lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had come into the room, he was going to be thrown out of
the building,'' one union official said.
</P>
<P>
   But several star players would have been behind Thomas. And
superstars like O'Neal were ready to take charge and show
leadership to get a deal done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to hear his name,'' said Hawks' center Dikembe
Mutombo, who is a Falk client and on the negotiating committee.
``Enough of that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's over now. Although a once solid union nearly collapsed in
the process, the season has been saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has a right to their opinion,'' said Askins, who was
in opposition to his teammate, Mourning. ``Once we step on the
court together, we're brothers.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The chief judge of the Jerusalem district court
struck a profound nerve last week with a ruling that undermined the
overarching power of the Orthodox Chief Rabbinate to determine who
is a Jew.
</P>
<P>
   The judge compelled the Israeli government to accept and
register as Jews people who had been converted to Judaism in Israel
by Reform or Conservative rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   The conversion issue had been sitting on a shelf in Parliament
all year, but the judge's action provoked the religious faction
there to take it down and dust it off.
</P>
<P>
   What the religious parties want to do is to codify in law the
rabbinate's exclusive authority over conversions _ at a moment when
many Israelis are bridling at the rabbinate's exclusive control
over rituals like marriage.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether Parliament will act now on a conversion
bill or will delay a vote until a new Parliament is elected in May.
But what is clear is that there is a pattern of outright combat
involving the courts, the religious parties and the Israeli public.
</P>
<P>
   In ruling after ruling, the courts are striking at the power and
the privileges of the rigorously Orthodox. After each ruling, the
strong religious factions in the Parliament seek to restore that
power through legislation. And each punch and counterpunch
reawakens the unresolved culture war that episodically rends the
fabric of Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
   Given the ferocity of the battle, many believe that it can only
end in a showdown in which Israel will be forced to reconcile the
contradictions of being the Jewish homeland and a secular
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Some predict that a popular backlash against the new political
power of the strictly Orthodox will find expression in laws that
disentangle religion and state to some degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of the increasing political power in the hands of
the Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox, you're seeing a confrontation
pushing Israel in the direction of getting the government somewhat
out of the business of religion,'' Rabbi Ismar Schorsch, chancellor
of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, said in an
interview in Israel this week.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, the decisions have tumbled fast and
furious from the Israeli courts. In addition to the conversion
decision, the courts have recently ordered the inclusion of Reform
and Conservative representatives on the powerful municipal
religious councils; declared the army service exemptions of
strictly Orthodox yeshiva students to be illegal, and ruled that
kibbutz shops could be open for business on the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   And in each case the religious parties have moved to block the
court's rulings, sometimes with not only the backing but the direct
assistance of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Some here have likened the conflict to the dueling between
Congress and the Supreme Court in the United States over issues
like civil rights and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't this the lesson one recalls from American history?''
asked Rabbi Uri Regev, a leader of the Reform movement here. ``A
recalcitrant Congress motivated by less than noble considerations
and a court that emerges as the beacon of light and defender of
civil liberties.''
</P>
<P>
   But here the core issue, the relationship between religion and
state, is central to the identity of the country and of modern
Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   It rubs at two key frictions _ that between secular and
religious Israelis and that between different kinds of practicing
Jews: the observant but modern, be they Reform, Conservative or
Orthodox, and those who dedicate their lives to strict observance
of centuries-old Jewish laws.
</P>
<P>
   By their very existence, the courts are a threat to the strictly
Orthodox when they rule on religious matters. The laws they
interpret are secular and not religious, and the principles that
they uphold are democratic and not theocratic.
</P>
<P>
   But an active court, like the Supreme Court under Chief Justice
Aharon Barak, is particularly offensive to religious purists
because, in their view, it seeks to mandate a reconciliation of the
irreconcilable. Strictly Orthodox Jews think that submitting
Judaism to a civil liberties test subverts the essence of the
religion. They believe Judaism to be built on God-given rules that
should not be bent. To the strictly Orthodox, Judaism is both a
privilege and a yoke. They see beauty in rigid observance of Jewish
law, or halacha, even or especially when obedience is taxing.
</P>
<P>
   Many feel misunderstood in what they see as their belief in
standards, which leads them to consider Reform and Conservative
Judaism a dilution of the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The modern Jew understands why in baseball the base paths
cannot be shortened for the slow runners and the outfield fences
brought in for weaker hitters,'' Jonathan Rosenblum, an Orthodox
intellectual, wrote in The Jerusalem Post, ``but not why anyone
should ever be told they are not Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is important; it rules are sacrosanct. Judaism
isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the strictly Orthodox view, only rabbinical leaders are
qualified to issue rulings that affect Jewish life. And secular
judges like Barak personify what the strictly Orthodox see as
incomprehension of Jewish law.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is a secular democracy with secular laws, but it is
vastly different from the United States. Clearly, for instance, the
relationship between religion and state is an inherently cozy one,
given the fact that citizenship is automatically granted to any
Jew. It is one that few Israelis would want completely disengaged.
</P>
<P>
   What the courts have been trying to do is define and refine the
boundaries as the Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox have used their
growing political power to assert a greater role for religion and
to demand privileges like state-subsidized religious education.
</P>
<P>
   The army issue is the one that most stirs the secular Israeli
public. Many resent a system that not only exempts 30,000 strictly
Orthodox teen-agers from the mandatory three-year service, but also
pays their yeshiva bills while university students are left to
finance their own educations.
</P>
<P>
   To most Israelis the conversion issue is more abstract, and most
are unfamiliar with Reform and Conservative Judaism. But here and
especially in the diaspora, that issue has most galvanized the
religious community, because it touches directly on its concern
about who can and should be called a Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Schorsch flew to Israel this week specifically to lobby
Parliament on what he considers ``a supremely important matter.''
American Reform Jews placed a quarter-page advertisement in
Tuesday's New York Times warning the Israeli Parliament, ``History
will be your judge.''
</P>
<P>
   And a coalition of liberal groups here began a ``Freedom of
Religion in Israel'' campaign this week with its own newspaper
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Following Supreme Court rulings, the government has been
accepting as Jews those who were converted to Judaism abroad by
Reform or Conservative rabbis, then immigrated here.
</P>
<P>
   But a surge of immigration from former Soviet republics and
Ethiopia, including many non-Jewish relatives, forced the country
to deal with conversions in Israel too.
</P>
<P>
   Many turned to the Reform and Conservative synagogues for
conversion, only to find their conversions invalid in the eyes of
the government, which grants a good deal of control over religious
affairs to the Orthodox chief rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   The strictly Orthodox see Reform and Conservative conversions as
``quickies,'' or as some put it, ``snip and dunk'' conversions that
ask little more than circumcision from the men and immersion in a
ritual bath from the women.
</P>
<P>
   But their basic complaint is with the more liberal movements
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about converts who underwent a conversion
process by Reform `rabbis' who themselves are prepared to betroth
single-sex couples and mixed Jewish and Christian couples,'' one of
Israel's two chief rabbis, Yisrael Meir Lau, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   A series of lawsuits drew attention to the issue two years ago.
The courts and Parliament agreed to back off while a government
commission tried to find a compromise solution.
</P>
<P>
   But the compromise _ the creation of a conversion institute with
Reform, Conservative and Orthodox teachers, whose graduates would
be judged by the Orthodox religious courts _ was deemed
unacceptable by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The situation remained frozen until the chief judge of Jerusalem
ruled last week, ordering the government to register as Jews 23
immigrants who had undergone Reform or Conservative conversions,
some in Israel and some abroad. The issue is due to go before the
Supreme Court in February.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israelis say the courts have proceeded gingerly on
decisions affecting religious issues, not compelling government
action until it became clear that the government would not act on
its own.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the army exemptions, for instance, the Supreme
Court asked Parliament to make the next move.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say that the conflict is heading toward some kind
of denouement, in which the relationship between religion and state
could be altered.
</P>
<P>
   On a grass-roots level, for instance, many Israelis are
beginning to demand the legalization of civil weddings, which are
not recognized by the government.
</P>
<P>
   If the coming elections bring in a centrist or leftist
government, the strength of the religious parties could be hobbled
and the edge could be taken off these issues. Court decisions would
certainly not face the same opposition from the government.
</P>
<P>
   But close observers of religion and society here say the
passions raised are too deep-seated to be resolved easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see here is a clash between two codes, between Jewish
law and Western law,'' said Avirama Golan, a religion writer for
the newspaper Haaretz. ``Can we solve it? I don't know. It's a test
for us. But I'm not sure we're able to live in a normal state.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With left hand on his silver-and-jade-trimmed bar
mitzvah Bible, Charles Schumer was sworn in Wednesday as New York
state's newest senator, vowing to be a legislator who not only
passes bills but also _ in the tradition of the man he defeated,
Alfonse D'Amato _ delivers money and services to the state.
</P>
<P>
   On a bracingly cold and brilliantly clear day, Schumer, a
Democrat from Brooklyn, also vowed not to let ``the cloud of
impeachment'' distract him from working on what he considers the
state's top issues: health care, crime, jobs, Social Security,
education and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether the trial lasts six days, or six weeks or even six
months, I have six years to do the things that I want to do,''
Schumer told a group of about 50 friends and relatives at a
cookies-and-coffee reception sponsored by the National Soft Drink
Association on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Though he served nine terms in the House, Schumer sounded every
bit the freshman legislator on Wednesday, looking wide-eyed as he
pumped well-wishers' hands and confessing to feeling ``tingles down
my spine'' after passing the lighted Capitol dome the night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready, excited and awe-struck at the chance to
legislate,'' Schumer, 48, said at a news conference before he was
sworn in by Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, already known for his prowess as a bill writer, said
that he would work hard to help individual communities with their
problems, echoing a theme President Clinton raised while
campaigning for him in New York last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I never did was demean the title `Senator Pothole,'
'' he said, referring to D'Amato's sobriquet. ``I think that is an
important role for a senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer was one of eight new senators, four Democrats and four
Republicans, sworn in to Congress on Wednesday. On the House side,
40 new members were sworn in, 23 of them Democrats and 17
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer is the only new senator from New York, New Jersey or
Connecticut. There are six freshmen representatives from the
region: four from New York and one each from the other two states.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was a bit like homecoming week for several of the new members
from the New York metropolitan region Wednesday outside the
ceremonial room where the freshman representatives were being
photographed with the newly elected speaker of the House, Dennis
Hastert, a Republican from Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   New York's four newest members of Congress are Anthony D.
Weiner, a Democrat from Brooklyn who was elected to Schumer's old
seat; Thomas M. Reynolds, a Republican from the Buffalo, N.Y.,
area; Joseph Crowley, a Queens Democrat; and John E. Sweeney, a
Republican from Troy. The last three had been in Albany until they
were elected last November, Reynolds and Crowley in the state
Assembly, and Sweeney as an aide to Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be working again,'' Crowley said as he exited the
House chamber after casting his first vote. ``I had been unemployed
for five days.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiner, 34, also gave his inaugural floor speech Wednesday,
urging his colleagues to vote against reappointing the House
managers who will argue the impeachment against the president in
the Senate. But Weiner tripped a bit by calling for a no vote on
the motion when he wanted a yes one. (The managers were
reappointed).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame I'll be revising my first remarks, but it was a
bit of a nerve wracking experience,'' Weiner said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new members brought bus loads of friends, relatives
and former campaign workers to Washington to witness their solemn
oaths, and then party afterward.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest contingents _ about 350 people _ came from
New Jersey with Rep. Rush D. Holt, 50, a physicist from the
Princeton area who upset a Republican incumbent last November.
During a mid-day reception, Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., quipped
that 60 years after the Manhattan project was inaugurated to build
an atomic bomb, ``We finally have someone in the House who
understands it.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's only new member of the House is Rep. John Larsen,
a Democrat from East Hartford.

U.S. SPIED ON IRAQ, USING U.N. COVER, AMERICAN OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. officials said on Wednesday that American spies had worked
undercover on teams of U.N. Special Commission inspectors ferreting
out secret Iraqi weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi leadership has long condemned the weapons inspectors
as tools of American intelligence. In October, it issued a formal
statement saying it would never cooperate with U.N. inspection
teams riddled with ``American spies and agents.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials also said American intelligence agencies provided
information and technology to the special commission, known as
Unscom. In turn, they said, the United States and other nations
routinely received information on Iraqi weapons programs uncovered
by the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence-gathering devices supplied to the inspectors by
American agencies gave the United States a better understanding of
the secret weapons sites being hidden by Iraq, American officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   UNSCOM has been a unique attempt by the United Nations to create
an international intelligence unit. Its mission was to uncover
Iraqi weapons programs after the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure that American intelligence officers had worked as
U.N. inspectors came after The Boston Globe reported charges that
American intelligence agents had used the U.N. inspection effort as
a cover to spy on President Saddam Hussein. The Washington Post
also reported that Unscom worked with American spy agencies to
collect intelligence used by the United States to spy on Saddam or
undermine the Iraqi regime.
</P>
<P>
   American officials also said a former U.N. weapons inspector was
misinformed when he charged that the United States took over a U.N.
intelligence-gathering operation in Iraq and made it into an arm of
American espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Top U.N. officials said they had no evidence to support the
charge. A senior administration official said the former inspector,
Scott Ritter, was doing ``unconscionable'' damage to the United
States and the United Nations with the accusation and playing into
the hands of Saddam and his allies.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that while the United States had
participated in the U.N. teams' intelligence-gathering operation,
they had not taken it over. They strongly rejected reports that the
U.N. inspection teams had been used as a tool of American
intelligence, as did Secretary General Kofi Annan and UNSCOM's
present and former chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We not only have no convincing evidence of these allegations,
we have no evidence of any kind,'' said Annan's spokesman, Fred
Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unscom does not have an indigenous intelligence capability,''
said a senior administration official. ``That was provided by
member states. The information it gathered was used to help break
Saddam's concealment effort, and the information was passed on to
United Nations Security Council members.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ritter, a former U.S. Marines intelligence
officer, raised the question of whether Unscom improperly aided
U.S. intelligence in ways that threatened the international
inspectors' independence, or opened them up to charges of spying on
behalf of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said on Wednesday that Ritter was describing
a secret U.S.-assisted Unscom intelligence-gathering program which
he did not fully understand.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter said the inspectors had developed ``methodologies,''
which he refused to describe, that helped them understand how Iraqi
security services concealed Baghdad's programs to build biological
and chemical weapons. These same security services and concealment
methods were used to protect Saddam.

 &HT;    High-flying Netcom lost ground as ISP rivals grew
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Netcom was the MindSpring of the early 1990s, a high-flying
Internet pioneer with a stock that was flying even higher.
</P>
<P>
   Its stock soared to $90 in 1995 as it served nearly 600,000
subscribers. Netcom, a Silicon Valley start-up, was the first
Internet provider to go public, doing so in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked them a lot,'' says Atlanta user Joe Thompson. ``Netcom
offered good, fast connections and its system was never down. The
company was a heck of lot better than America Online at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the second half of the '90s, America Online has soared
while Netcom has peaked and fallen back. The San Jose, Calif.-based
company's number of subscribers has declined to 500,000 and it has
now changed ownership twice in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netcom was one of the original Internet providers to serve the
average Joe, but it had a hard time when competition came in,''
says Brad Grimes, a senior editor at PC World magazine. ``It was a
bloodbath and MindSpring is one of the reasons why Netcom faded.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its decline, Netcom retains a strong reputation,
especially as a network. ``Netcom has maintained its own Internet
backbone and there aren't many companies that do that,'' says
Grimes.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, some of Netcom's longtime customers have noticed a
decline in its service. Thompson says after Denver-based telephone
company ICG bought Netcom a year ago, his service declined sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten to be an infrequent user, the service has become
such an irritating experience,'' says Thompson. Especially bad, he
says, is the reliability of Netcom's e-mail service.
</P>
<P>
   Netcom was started by Bob Rieger, whose vision was to provide a
low-cost, easy-to-use Internet connection for regular people.
</P>
<P>
   The business took off, with Netcom quickly becoming one of the
first big names in the consumer Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   The company went public in 1994 and then sold itself to ICG in
1997 for $225 million, with the deal closing in January of last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven months later, ICG announced it was putting Netcom up for
sale. ``We're not selling the part that we always wanted in
Netcom,'' says ICG President J. Shelby Bryan, referring to Netcom's
Internet backbone network.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, we realized that it would be better to sell
Netcom's customers,'' explains Bryan. ``Values for this type of
business were going up, so we took this opportunity to sell the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan said he hired investment banker Salomon Smith Barney to
shop Netcom, a process that eventually led to MindSpring.

   Through the 191-day National Basketball Association lockout, the
economic losers weren't only the players and owners who made a
tentative deal Wednesday to bridge their financial chasm and split
$2 billion in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   There are the TV networks that lost lucrative programming and
advertisers who temporarily lost a key way to reach their ideal
audience, young male viewers.
</P>
<P>
   There are the companies that make T shirts, jackets and replica
uniforms licensed by the NBA, a potential $3 billion retail
business.
</P>
<P>
   There are the concession workers, vendors, novelty-sellers,
security guards and ushers _ some paid hourly wages, some who work
for commissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't rely on this income,'' said Ed Piseck, 30, who made
about $100 a month as a bartender at McNichols Arena, home of the
Denver Nuggets. ``I just used it to pay off debt and for the new
baby's college fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Millions of dollars have been rebated to season ticket holders
for unplayed November and December games. More will be refunded
next month for January. Millions more were lost by retailers who
cut back on NBA-licensed merchandise fans were avoiding. ``All
over, there were double-digit drops in sales,'' said Chris McEvoy,
editor-in-chief of Sporting Goods Business.
</P>
<P>
   The television networks that carry NBA games refocused their
programming. TNT and TBS, the Turner Sports cable network lost
about 40 telecasts, filling the gaps with films. NBC replaced its
Christmas Day games with ``It's A Wonderful Life.'' The Fox Sports
Net, which carries 700 games through local cable deals with 26 of
the 29 NBA teams, plugged in other sports, and would have added
more hockey and spring training games if the season were axed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been hard to replace the Bulls in Chicago and the Lakers
in Los Angeles, and the ratings that come with them,'' said Arthur
Smith, the executive vice president of the Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   How much fan apathy will affect viewership is unknown. The
uncertainty of post-lockout viewing is compounded by worries about
Michael Jordan's return.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's Nielsen rating average last season was a 4.8, and the
finals won by the Bulls hit an an 18.7, an NBA television record.
TNT and TBS combined for a 1.7 regular-season rating and a 3.4
playoff average.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a down year, but better to have a down year that's
a half season than no season at all,'' said Neal Pilson, a sports
industry consultant.
</P>
<P>
   NBC and Turner paid their full season's rights fees _ a combined
$465 million _ knowing the season could be canceled. FSN paid
nothing in advance. NBC will pro rate its payments over the next
three seasons; Turner will get more games.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of advertising is at stake. Last season, gross advertising
sales to NBC totaled an estimated $427.7 million, according to
Competitive Media Reporting, an ad-tracking service. An estimated
$138.9 million flowed to TNT and TBS. Wednesday's settlement will
keep a lot of that money from fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   But during the lockout, some advertisers shifted their
commercial purchases to other programs on NBC, TNT, TBS and the
local FSN services like the MSG Network. But some advertisers,
about one-quarter of Turner's, left entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shifted to college basketball and football,'' said Vizhier
Mooney, a spokeswoman for Nike, an NBA sponsor, official outfitter
of 10 teams and licensed apparel manufacturer. ``Now we'll go back
to our usual plans.''
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Penney, the largest retailer of NBA-licensed merchandise,
will wait until the season starts to advise its stores on stocking
up its goods. Business fell 70 percent in markets with NBA teams,
leading stores to drastically cut back space devoted to
league-licensed goods.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Sporting Goods Business reported that the NBA-licensed
business was down nearly 50 percent for the fall and holiday season
and orders would tumble 80 percent for the spring. The magazine
forecast a smaller drop for basketball sneakers, which were already
in a recession for the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok's basketball sales, led by Allen Iverson's $115 signature
brand, are down eight to 10 percent, less than the market's 10 to
15 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We produced 40 percent less of the Iverson product than last
year,'' and accelerate its focus on popular lines lines, like
running shoes, said Shawn Neville, senior vice president and
general manager of Reebok North America.
</P>
<P>
   Those markets may take a while to recover. ``When there are no
games, retailers don't reorder, they discount and get the
merchandise the heck out,'' said Frank Vuono, a former NFL
Properties executive who is the president of Integrated Sports
International, a New Jersey-based sports marketing firm. ``After
the NFL strike in 1981, it took three years to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as the lockout compelled fans, owners, players, TV
executives, capmakers, retailers and shoe retailers to contemplate
a season without the NBA, it made part-time workers contemplate
their supporting roles.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Morgan, 46, a part-time luxury suite attendant at America
West Arena in Phoenix, earned extra money to give to her daughter,
a college student, said Tuesday night at a Coyotes hockey game,
``If they don't care about the little peon, they sure should. If it
wasn't for us, they wouldn't be employed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Gottlieb, 28, said his family's four parking lots near the
Fleet Center in Boston has lost $200,000 without Celtics games.
``Everyone loses,'' he said. ``You just go on, you know? You hope
it comes back.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the lockout's settlement caused NBA-related stocks to
stage a comeback, on a day of broad market gains. Shares of Ascent
Entertainment, which owns the Nuggets, rose $.625 to $8.625. The
Boston Celtics Partnership jumped $4.125 to close at $14.625. And
Nike jumped $2.9375 to close at $43.625.

&HT;        SPECTER POPS UP AS IMPEACHMENT SPOKESMAN, OFFERS EXPERTISE
ON TV
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 6, -- Just hours after being sworn in for his
fourth term in the Senate, Pennsylvania Republican Arlen Specter
was off to CNN's bureau to be interviewed yet again about
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Never-shy, Specter has used the impeachment of President Clinton
to vault into the national spotlight, appearing in recent weeks on
a dozen television talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   He's been on NBC's Meet the Press, CBS's Face the Nation, and a
slew of CNN programs, including Wednesday night's edition of
Crossfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen such a public and media interest in any issue
before,'' Specter said in an interview. ``This trial will be looked
at under a microscope for centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am viewing this as a heavy responsibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With no consensus in the Senate on how to proceed with the
impeachment trial against President Clinton, political observers
say Specter is in a prime position to assert himself as a leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a moderate Republican who has a stellar legal
background,'' said Tom Yu, a spokesman for the Republican National
Committee. ``I think he has realized that this is an opportunity.
He has in the past been very outspoken when appropriate. It doesn't
surprise me that he recognized this as a chance to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter, a Yale-educated attorney, was an assistant counsel on
the Warren Commission investigating the assassination of President
John F. Kennedy. He also was an assistant attorney general in
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Specter's spokesman John Ullyot said the Senator is in demand
because he can reach across party lines. He said when Specter
announced his presidential candidacy in 1995, he got support from
pro-choice activists for his liberal stance on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Specter is in demand because he speaks his mind and
appeals to many people,'' Ullyot said. ``Couple that with his being
a legal expert and he's the perfect spokesman or guest on a show.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Specter, R-Pa, didn't think Clinton should face
charges until after his term. But since the House impeached the
president, he's been among the Senate's most outspoken members on
the subject of how the trial should be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said there should be a full Senate trial with witnesses.
He said he doesn't support censure because he thinks it is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here to punish the president,'' he said. ``We have
to convict him or not convict him.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter said the trial won't derail other issues and could be
limited to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He said witness testimony is necessary because, unlike some of
his colleagues, he thinks there are facts ``in dispute'' in the
case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, Specter has written to Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Mississippi, outlining his views on the impeachment
trial, but he declined to make those letters public.
</P>
<P>
   Specter is no stranger to high profile and controversial legal
issues.
</P>
<P>
   When he was assistant counsel to the Warren Commission, he
pushed the ``single bullet theory'' in the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy. He is remembered for his
prosecutorial-style cross-examination of Anita Hill during the
Senate Judiciary Committee hearings into whether she was sexually
harassed by Clarence Thomas. He also helped block the appointment
of Robert H. Bork to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   While Specter is in a prime position to speak out on the
impeachment matter, the trial may make his more conservative
colleague Sen. Rick Santorum vulnerable in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum's support for a full trial with witnesses could make
him a target of Democratic attacks in future elections, according
to Yu, the RNC spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But Specter said he doesn't think his colleague will have any
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be able to win and has a very strong record,'' Specter
said. ``He is handling this fine and being interviewed heavily on
the subject.''

CLINTON SEEKS $400 MILLION FOR AFTER-SCHOOL AND SUMMER SCHOOL
PROGRAMS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 - NYT   By JOHN M. BRODER  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The &UR;  &LR; Clinton administration is seeking a $400
million increase in funding for after-school and summer school
programs to tutor struggling students and to keep children of
working parents off the streets after school hours, the White House
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in an announcement planned for Thursday at
the White House, will ask Congress to increase spending for such
programs to $600 million from $200 million this year. The Education
Department would give the money to some of the school districts
that have adopted programs to end so-called social promotions, the
automatic passing of students to the next grade without regard to
academic progress, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is one of several unveiled this week intended to
showcase items in the president's agenda that polls have shown are
popular with the public and that demonstrate the White House staff
hard at work on policy matters as the senate opens the impeachment
trial of the president. Earlier this week, Clinton announced a plan
to subsidize long-term care for the elderly and a proposal to test
and treat federal prisoners for drug abuse.
 &UR;  &LR;  Officials have not yet specified how they intend to pay for these
proposals without dipping into the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The after-school program, started two years ago on a small
scale, has grown to benefit 380,000 students in 800 school
districts around the country this year.
</P>
<P>
   The new money, if approved as part of the budget for the fiscal
year beginning next Oct. 1, would expand the program to serve 1.1
million children.
</P>
<P>
   The Education Department estimates that 5 million to 15 million
``latchkey'' children of working parents are left unsupervised
after school hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the peak hours for juvenile crime,'' said Bruce N.
Reed, the president's chief domestic policy adviser. ``That's the
time when kids get into trouble with crime, alcohol, drugs and
tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal program allows schools to remain open into the
evening to provide tutoring and recreational activities.
</P>
<P>
   The government will give priority in distributing the money to
school districts that have adopted policies to end social
promotions. Such policies include special attention for failing
students, objective standards and tests to insure that students
have mastered grade-level work before being promoted, and the use
of extended school hours and summer schools to bring students up to
acceptable performance levels.

BALTIMORE'S PUSH ON CRIME CREATES BACKLOG OF CASES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ More aggressive efforts by the Baltimore police to
reduce the rate of homicides and other serious crime in the city
has created such a backlog of cases that a circuit judge has
dismissed first-degree murder charges against four men who had been
awaiting trial for almost three years.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy State's Attorney Haven Kodeck said Wednesday that his
office intended to appeal the decision. But Kodeck also said the
ruling, by Judge Roger Brown, reflects ``an overburdened court
system'' and an unintended consequence of recent efforts by Police
Commissioner Thomas Frazier to drive down crime rates as the city
tried to polish its image to attract new residents and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
   Kodeck applauded the police work but conceded: ``There's not a
whole lot we can do, and when the system fails, it's regrettable.
We feel that that judge's decision was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, issued on Tuesday, followed a decision last month by
a Maryland appeals court to overturn a sex-charge conviction
against a man whose trial had been postponed nine times over 13
months because no judge was available on the next scheduled day for
the trial to begin. In general, a felony trial is supposed to begin
six months after arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Baltimore police grapple with about 300 homicide
cases a year, up to 1,500 nonfatal shootings, and thousands of drug
cases, the demand for judges, prosecutors and public defenders has
grown to an overwhelming level.
</P>
<P>
   The case on which Brown ruled involved four men _ Jay Anderson,
30; William Harrison, 21; Donte Spivey, 22, and Stacey Wilson, 29 _
who were accused of shooting to death Shawn Suggs in October 1995,
when he was 21.
</P>
<P>
   The four men spent several months in jail and then were released
on bail. While free, Spivey was arrested in another killing and was
held pending trial.
</P>
<P>
   Brown dropped charges against the men in the Suggs case after
the trial date was postponed 12 times because of the unavailability
of a judge, a prosecutor or a defender.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Joseph Kaplan, chief judge of the Circuit Court for
Baltimore, said in an interview that the current backlog of felony
cases exceeds 5,000, ``and it is not inconceivable that some of
them go back more than a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Contributing to the backlog, Kaplan said, is the availability of
only 11 courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Kodeck said that of the 170 lawyers in his office, only 18 were
assigned to violent crimes and each was carrying as many as 18
homicide cases.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gambrill, the public defender for Baltimore, said his
office had 109 lawyers, with 31 of them assigned to felony trials.
Their average caseload, Gambrill said, is 67 open cases, and some
of the defenders are handling more than 100 open cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to cover district courts, circuit courts and central
booking,'' he said. ``The need is tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan said he tried to ease the pressure last May by adding two
courtrooms for felony cases, only for them to go unused because the
public defender's office, which is financed by the state, did not
have the personnel to take advantage of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a shortage on both sides,'' Kaplan said. ``It's more
critical on the public defender side, but it's certainly a serious
situation. It's like trying to put 10 gallons in a 2-gallon jar.''
</P>
<P>
   Gambrill and Kaplan agreed that much of the backlog had evolved
from aggressive efforts by the police to reduce the level of
illegal drug activities.
</P>
<P>
   But problems arise, they said, when the police make sweeps,
arresting dozens of people at one time and charging all of them
with felony-level crimes, when the offenses by some might only be
misdemeanors. Unlike in some other jurisdictions where prosecutors
determine the charges, in Baltimore the police do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one addict is passing a capsule to another addict, the
police charge both with distribution, a felony,'' Gambrill said.
``Technically, it is distributing, but the question is, do you want
to put that case on the circuit court docket? We've got 60,000 drug
addicts in the metropolitan area. You can't arrest all those people
and not clog the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Weinhold, a spokesman for the police department, said,
``Officers are charging individuals within the legal framework set
forth by state legislators.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinhold also said the police found it extremely frustrating
that an overworked criminal justice system was allowing suspects to
go free.

 UNDATED: protect Saddam. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ritter said his inspection team ``had a tremendous success using
these methodologies'' in March. A few weeks later, he said,
American officials approached Richard Butler, the chief of the U.N.
special commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``In April, the U.S. went to Butler and wanted to take over a
certain portion of the system of how we track these weapons,'' he
said. ``I wanted to make sure it was only for tracking weapons, but
the U.S. wanted to cut me out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could no longer guarantee that the methodology would be
used'' for weapons inspections alone, and not to the benefit of
United States military and intelligence agencies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Butler will have to convince people that what the U.S. did was
for Unscom,'' said Ritter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were given assurances the information would not be
misused,'' he said. But, he added, he believed that the United
States ``used Butler.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they set him up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter resigned in August, saying the United States and the
United Nations had undermined the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   A government official familiar with the dispute said that Ritter
was ill-informed. He said there had been a shift in Unscom's
intelligence-gathering methods last spring which the former
inspector did not fully understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unscom's efforts to collect information have gotten better,''
the official said. ``There was a period when Mr. Ritter was
familiar with these methods. The methods have since gotten better,
but Mr. Ritter wasn't totally witting of what was done. He may
think we were taking over. We weren't. But he felt cut out.''
</P>
<P>
   And a White House official lashed out at Ritter on Wednesday,
saying his allegations had delivered a pointless propaganda victory
to Iraq. ``The damage Scott Ritter has done to Unscom and U.S.
national security is unconscionable,'' said the official, who spoke
on the condition of anonymity. ``He should stop worrying about how
to get his face on the evening news and start worrying about the
harm he has caused.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler said the commission had asked for more advanced
technology after discovering in 1995 the sophisticated lies and
methods of concealment that Iraq had used to hide its nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons programs and its missile projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say this with all the force that I can: We have
never accepted or used any of that assistance for any other
purpose'' than disarming Iraq, Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have we facilitated spying?'' he said. ``Are we spies?
Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler's predecessor, Rolf Ekeus, now Sweden's ambassador to the
United States, said that Unscom's teams had ``exclusively devoted
their activities in Iraq to identifying Iraq's holdings of weapons
of mass destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ekeus also said that no eavesdropping equipment
had been installed by the United States to spy on Saddam or the
Iraqi special forces who protect him. Butler also denied that any
such eavesdropping or telephone-tapping took place.
</P>
<P>
   But Ekeus said that monitoring the efforts of Iraq's Republican
Guard and Special Security Services to conceal clandestine weapons
programs led to Iraqi protests that these troops were being spied
on for other reasons. These same forces protect Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   The Unscom inspectors were withdrawn in December, hours before
American and British attacks on Iraq. Saddam has said that they
will not be allowed to return unless the Special Commission is
restructured and Butler is replaced.

US SPY EFFORTS NOT ENOUGH TO TOPPLE SADDAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Despite the US penetration of Saddam Hussein's
inner sanctum, the United States faced a daunting task in achieving
the stated policy of toppling the Iraqi leader's regime,
intelligence analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The tools used by the United States to crack Hussein's security
fortress _ radio scanners, spies, and U2 photographs _ are
insufficient to overthrow the government, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Their comments came a day after The Boston Globe reported that
the UN weapons inspectors were sharing intelligence with the United
States, a report that the State Department confirmed Wednesday. The
US officials would not detail the precise information gleaned from
the UN weapons inspection team, but said it emerged naturally from
the inspectors' mission.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the American intelligence officials seeking to
interpret the UN information faced several obstacles: Overhead
imagery from U-2 spy planes takes countless man-hours to interpret,
radio intercepts are often degraded by the electronic noise that
courses through any city, and it isn't easy for a foreign spy to
get close enough to a secretive head of state like Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The US hunt for Mohammad Farah Aidid in Somalia in 1993 failed
to nab the Somali warlord, but succeeded in undermining American
goals. In Panama, the US military, with a massive presence in the
country, was only able to seize former Panamanian strongman Manuel
Noriega when he checked into the Vatican embassy after days of
fruitless pursuit by US troops. Thousands of NATO troops in Bosnia
have been unable to arrest Bosnian offiicials indicted on war
crimes charges, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very difficult thing to do,'' said William Arkin, a
former army intelligence analyst who tracks Iraq's mlitary. ``There
is probably no regime that is more security conscious than Saddam
Hussein's, because it faces internal and external opposition and
attempts by other countries to overthrow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the US intelligence operation in Iraq said
the UN inspectors eavesdropping on the Iraqi military had enormous
difficulty penetrating the white noise that clogged their scanners
with everything from car radios to chats between military officers.
</P>
<P>
   One source said that the radio intercepts provided coded,
elliptical conversations and clues that had to be painstakingly
analyzed before they would make sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to penetrate the noise and find out what you're
looking for,'' said Rolf Ekeus, the former executive chairman of
the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) responsible for ridding Iraq of
its weapons of mass destruction. Ask to elaborate, Ekeus said,
``I've already said too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Relying on such information to plan to hit a target in a city
twice the size of Paris is pure fantasy, said Arkin. ``You would
need a golden BB to hit the target,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The news that the United Nations and the United States were
sharing intelligence on Iraq has provoked a feud between UN
Secretary General Kofi Annan and Washington, which suspects that
Annan's aides leaked details of the operation to reporters to
undermine the chief UN weapons inspector, Richard Butler. US air
strikes were launched on Iraq last month after a report by Butler
concluded that Iraq violated its obligations to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, after reading the newspaper reports of
intelligence-sharing by the UN and the United States, US Secretary
of State Madeleine K. Albright telephoned Annan ``and read him the
riot act,'' according to a US official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Following the phone call, Annan released a statement: ``We have
no evidence of any kind. We have only rumors'' of shared
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, were these charges true, it would be damaging to
the United Nations disarmament work in Iraq and elsewhere,'' Annan
said. Aides to the UN chief have been considering a series of
proposals that would dismantle UNSCOM and would replace the current
economic embargo on Iraq with sanctions directly targeting senior
Iraqi officials.
</P>
<P>
   Countering Annan, US officials said Wednesday that the Clinton
administration would continue to back Butler and UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Clinton administration has urged Hussein's
overthrow, and senior US officials have met with Iraqi opposition
groups and promised to provide them with surplus American military
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
Wednesday, ``At no time did the United States work with anyone at
UNSCOM to collect information for the purpose of undermining the
Iraqi regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin acknowledged that the purpose of intelligence-sharing was
to aid UNSCOM in its efforts to destroy Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction. Butler, the UN inspection chief, said Wednesday that
UNSCOM has received assistance from the United States and some 40
other member states. But he flatly denied allowing the United
States to use UNSCOM to spy on Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never conducted spying for anybody,'' he said. ``Have
we facilitated spying? Are we spies? Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, US officials acknowledged that Washington used the UN
information to track Saddam Hussein's movements and to penetrate
Iraq's intelligence apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   US officials in the Clinton administration and on Capitol Hill
said the incident was likely to damage relations, already chilly,
between Washington and Annan, who has consistently favored a more
diplomatic approach to dealing with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Annan was clearly trying to pull the rug out from us a
little bit,'' said one congressional aide who closely follows UN
policies, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``I'm sure Annan did
not support the military strikes. My guess is he was not happy with
us going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures of intelligence sharing are likely to sharpen
divisions in the UN Security Council, which is preparing to debate
Iraq's future relationship with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, France, and China are seeking to ease economic sanctions
on Iraq and remove Butler, an Australian they consider too close to
Washington, as UNSCOM chief. Wednesday's disclosures reinforced
suspicions that Butler intentionally gave Washington a green light
for launching the air strikes last month.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it was natural for Washington to take advantage of
the UN information. ``I would like to know the country that would
do all these things and then not read the results and employ the
results for their own ends,'' said Richard Shultz, codirector of
the International Security Program at the Fletcher School of Law
and Diplomacy at Tufts University.

<P>
   Pity the pin boys. They were the shadowy tough guys at the ends
of the bowling lanes who risked life and limb to line up the pins,
sometimes for as little as a nickel a game. Extinct for decades,
they are the dodo birds of bowling.
</P>
<P>
   Bowling, said to date from ancient Egypt, has grown increasingly
high-tech in recent years as bowling equipment manufacturers have
sought to transform it into a faster game for the digital age. At
high-tech lanes like Chelsea Piers in Manhattan, mechanics now tend
digital cameras and the software of the electronic pin boys.
</P>
<P>
   The sport has come a long way since 1946, when AMF Bowling
introduced the first automatic pin spotter in Buffalo, N.Y. The pin
spotter used a mechanical suction system to lift the pins and set
them back down. Newspapers marveled. ``Robot Pin Boy Never Shows
Fatigue,'' said a headline in The Brooklyn Eagle.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the pin spotter is one part of a digitally networked
system that bowlers interact with soon after they step through the
door at most bowling alleys. When bowlers check in, clerks use a
Windows NT Ethernet local area network to assign lanes and make
changes if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping score with pencil and paper is a thing of the past.
Automatic scoring has become the norm. Players punch in their names
at a scoring terminal and the system takes over, displaying and
updating the information on monitors hanging overhead. Computer
animations sometimes illustrate the best angles for the next shot.
System crashes are rare.
</P>
<P>
   A typical bowling cycle, which runs from the moment a ball is
released until it is returned, lasts only about 8] seconds,
according to AMF, which has its headquarters in Richmond and is one
of the leading producers of bowling equipment around the world.
That's half the time a cycle took 50 years ago. Speed has become a
major selling point for competing manufacturers like AMF and the
Brunswick Corporation of Muskegon, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   To make lanes more consistent and quick, pine and maple boards
have been replaced by synthetic surfaces (a covering made from
digital images makes the floor look like wood). The first
two-thirds of the lane is lubricated with a viscous oil-based
conditioner; the last third is kept dry to increase the ball's spin
near the pins.
</P>
<P>
   Just before striking the pins, the ball passes a ball trigger,
an electric eye that tells the pin spotter to begin cycling in
three seconds. That is the amount of time designated by the
American Bowling Congress to insure that the pins have had enough
opportunity to fall down and spin. After the ball strikes the pins,
an infrared camera takes a digital image that tells the spotter
which pins to lift and replace.
</P>
<P>
   After the second ball (if necessary) is played, the 10 pins are
replaced and the score updated on the screen. A printout of the
game can be picked up at the front desk. The process is efficient,
and that speed and ease translate into increased profits, said
Randy Daniel, vice president for manufacturing at AMF, which has
sales of about $700 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   AMF reports that the price of bowling equipment has decreased by
15 percent in the past decade. Installation and equipment costs
reach $40,000 per lane (most bowling centers have 20 lanes);
software and other product upgrades are about $1,000 per lane each
year.
</P>
<P>
   (High-tech lanes aren't the only places to combine bowling with
technology - bowling games can be found at
www.bowltech.com/games.htm.) Both AMF and Brunswick have injected
some razzle-dazzle into their high-tech innovations. Brunswick came
first with Cosmic Bowling, which features thumping dance music and
fluorescent pins and balls.
</P>
<P>
   AMF followed with Xtreme bowling, its own version of what Mr.
Daniels described as disco bowling; bowlers hurl glow-in-the-dark
boogie balls, as they are called, as music plays. On either side of
the lane, blinking red bumpers flash like airline runways. The
bumpers keep every ball in play.
</P>
<P>
   Is anyone nostalgic for the days of pin boys and pencil-smudged
scorecards? ``Only the motion picture scouts,'' said Bill Lemon,
owner of Bowlmor Lanes, a 60-year-old bowling alley in the
Greenwich Village area of Manhattan, which moved to automatic
scoring two years ago. ``They love to find those old scoring desks
for their films. Other than that, I don't think anyone misses
them.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``He was the Pavarotti of his age.'' Thus Thomas
Hampson describes Mattia Battistini, whose nearly five-decade reign
as Don Giovanni and Rigoletto, as the William Tell of Rossini and
the Hamlet of Ambroise Thomas in opera houses from Rome to London
by way of St. Petersburg at the turn of the century featured no
episode stranger than his assumption of the title role of Jules
Massenet's ``Werther.''
</P>
<P>
   Goethe's manic-depressive standard-bearer of Sturm und Drang,
you see, entered the operatic realm as a tenor, while Battistini
was a baritone: ``the king of baritones,'' according to a phrase
that stuck. Hampson is a baritone, too, and it is Battistini's
Werther that he introduces at the Metropolitan Opera in the revival
opening Jan. 11. Massenet would no doubt approve, having prepared
this version himself.
</P>
<P>
   How singular is this case? In some ways, not at all. Since the
dawn of opera in the early 17th century, with or without
authorization from the creators, scores have been adjusted every
which way to capitalize on performers' gifts or to accommodate
their limitations. In the original printed score of Monteverdi's
``Orfeo,'' the genre's first lasting masterpiece, we discover the
hero's climactic address to the king of hell in two parallel
settings. One is plain, the other flamboyantly embellished. In the
mouth of the right singer, either stirs the heart. Stars of
Handel's and Mozart's day studded revivals of past seasons'
novelties with arias custom-tailored for them, often by hands not
the original composer's.
</P>
<P>
   As for switched vocal categories, they are scarcely rare. To
look no farther than the stable of warhorses, light sopranos
monopolized Rosina in ``Il Barbiere di Siviglia'' for generations,
never mind that Rossini intended the role for a mezzo-soprano.
Still, none of these instances match that of the baritone Werther,
whose lines Massenet's pencil rethreaded into the surrounding
musical fabric, leaving the rest untouched.
</P>
<P>
   We may never find out just how and why this curio came to be.
Paul Thomason's article ``Darkening `Werther,''' in the current
Opera News, summarizes the tale of its genesis, recent rediscovery
and only previous modern revival, by the Seattle Opera in 1991,
starring Dale Duesing. Rodney Milnes, the great Massenet champion,
provides other background in his article on the work for The New
Grove Dictionary of Opera. But mysteries remain.
</P>
<P>
   Some key points on the time line are these. Massenet completed
``Werther'' in 1887. Leon Carvalho, the director of the
Opera-Comique in Paris, dashed the composer's hopes for a premiere
at that most desirable of houses, finding the subject too morose.
</P>
<P>
   Not until 1892 did the work reach the stage, in Vienna, on the
coattails of the local premiere of ``Manon.'' The first Werther was
Ernest Van Dyck, a Belgian renowned as Wagner's Parsifal and
Lohengrin, though he failed to win Massenet's approval as Goethe's
Byronic suicide, shipwrecked on the reefs of bourgeois
respectability.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next decade, productions followed in Paris, the French
provinces, the United States and Italy, but the work began really
to catch on only when the Opera-Comique (now directed by Albert
Carr) revived it in 1903.
</P>
<P>
   Massenet felt that among the early exponents of the title role,
only Jean de Reszke, of Poland, was on the right track. In 1894,
his Werther made the rounds in Chicago, New York and London.
Another prize Wagnerian but less prone than the rest to
demonstrative operatic convention, de Reszke, at 44, captured the
character's unhinged quality, his vulnerability. The singer's
timbre _ dark and seductive _ was greatly admired, too; as it
happens, he began his career as a baritone.
</P>
<P>
   The Battistini version, a footnote in the performance history,
dates from 1902, when the dedicatee was 46. Who knows? If the Paris
audience, which never heard de Reszke as Werther at all, had heard
him perform the part in his prime, the baritone version might not
exist. But should the role ever have been entrusted to Wagnerians
in the first place? (Nowadays impresarios cast Werther no heavier
than a spinto; the most distinguished interpreter of the role in
the last quarter-century was Alfredo Kraus, of Spain, a lyric tenor
and proud of it.)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Battistini experiment represents Massenet's last-ditch
attempt to rescue a score he loved from encroaching oblivion. Maybe
once the original found its place in the affections of the public,
the alternative lost its raison d'etre. In any case, it vanished
with Battistini, unperformed and unsought until Duesing learned of
it by chance. Hampson will be only the third singer to perform it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Onstage, the more you suffer, the better,'' Placido Domingo
has said. ``It's what I like best.'' Suffering is Werther's stock
in trade, as Goethe's title, ``The Sorrows of Young Werther,''
attests. The novel, in epistolary form with editorial
interjections, contrives to present the hero both from his own
tempestuous point of view and with chilling clinical detachment:
understandably so, since, as the young Goethe knew all too well,
Werther's fate might have been his own. The hallmark of Massenet's
portrayal is compassion, yet he does not play Goethe false.
</P>
<P>
   Few roles in opera, and fewer still for baritone, combine
Werther's charismatic sheen, romantic tenderness and morbid gloom.
It stands to reason that a star among baritones would thrill to its
masochistic allure no less than the great Domingo. ``A good death
scene always helps,'' Hampson allowed recently between rehearsals
at the Met. But is grief as such what attracted him to Werther?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he replied. ``What attracts me are his ambiguities, the
demonstrative flaws. He's a very trying personality. Can you
imagine how intense this young man is? And there's the very complex
question of suicide as a response to one's fate.'' Like Hamlet,
another literary icon Hampson has embodied in the opera house,
Werther broods at the edge of the abyss, weighing whether to be or
not to be.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A matinee idol of deeply scholarly bent, Hampson acknowledges
certain scruples about his latest project: ``I don't want to be
busy doing `clever,' `novel' things. If there's an artistic
legitimacy that brings with it a certain novelty, fine. What
concerned me was that I would find that the baritone Werther was
just a transposition. In fact it's something else: a rewrite of the
character's psychology for a different kind of voice.''
</P>
<P>
   A comparison of the two versions bears out the subtlety of the
revisions. Given the decision to preserve the orchestration as it
was, Massenet had, note for note, fairly limited options. The
pitches in the middle range that he uses for conversational
passages could often be left alone; and in fact, they often are,
notably at the start and end of a longish musical paragraph. Where
the tenor's line soars, Massenet at times drops the pitches by two
or three steps, running the baritone's line as nearly parallel to
the tenor's as the harmony permits.
</P>
<P>
   On rare occasions, he drops the baritone's pitches an entire
octave, surrendering the tenor's mounting excitement for a sense of
sudden emotional exhaustion in the baritone. This happens at the
very end, when the expiring hero imagines a woman coming in secret
to weep over his grave: ``and by that sweet tear, shed upon his
shade, the dead man, the poor dead man, will feel that he is
blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   From Van Dyck on, interpreters of Werther have sung this on a
rising phrase, as if yearning toward that bittersweet rapture.
Battistini was asked to depart on a bleak, dying fall.
</P>
<P>
   As this instance suggests, the accumulation of microscopic
decisions indeed lends Werther a new complexion, perhaps even a new
temperament. As a general matter, of course, the phrases for
Battistini peak lower. More significant, they also tend to peak
later and more briefly, as if with greater psychic effort.
Conversely, the unaltered parlando episodes may sound more
``songful'' and less ``spoken'' _ thus more immediately emotional _
in the voice of a baritone, lying, as they do, somewhat higher in
his register and farther from neutral speech.
</P>
<P>
   On the page, the most haunting passages are those in which
Massenet seems to be rethinking the very purpose of song in
relation to words. At the climax of Werther's outburst ``Lorsque
s'ouvrait le ciel,'' the tenor hangs on to a high A flat for two
whole bars and into a third. Battistini's notes fall within the
chord, where the harmonic action is, wavering in a sob between E
flat and F flat: a far more jagged, anguished reading, and far less
concerned with vocal show.
</P>
<P>
   Werther's very first line is transformed in quite a different
way. ``Je ne sais si je veille ou si je reve encore'' is the gentle
text: I know not if I wake or if I'm dreaming still. As originally
set, it had an arching phrase: a tune. For Battistini, Massenet
stripped it down to a virtual monotone: a monotone left to the
singer's fantasy to shape and color.
</P>
<P>
   Massenet adopted this strategy of refinement by subtraction on
several later occasions, nowhere more tellingly than during
Werther's final agony, when a serene moonlit melody from the first
act returns in the orchestra. Tenors get to sing along, as if
consoled by the reminiscence. Battistini's Werther sings an
unrelated phrase, apparently deaf to the echo.
</P>
<P>
   Such passages support Hampson's belief that Massenet's
adjustments converge remarkably with Debussy's revolutionary
``Pelleas et Melisande,'' which pushed operatic expression still
farther away from vocal display into the realm of pure inflection.
Perhaps such developments were simply in the air. Debussy began
work on ``Pelleas'' in 1893, the year of the ``Werther'' premiere.
More striking still, the unveiling of ``Pelleas,'' at the
Opera-Comique, came in 1902, the year of the modified Werther.
</P>
<P>
   Truth to tell, we may wonder whether Battistini sang the role as
Massenet reimagined it for him. Two souvenirs of the great divo's
performance exist, both sung in Italian. The robust vocalism is
mightily impressive, though as evocations of the character, the
readings seem totally off the mark. What is lacking, in this king
of baritones, is the sensitivity of a sweet (tenor) prince.
Massenet's appreciation was heartfelt all the same, though he may
have wondered why Battistini sang the opening of ``Pourquoi me
reveiller,'' Werther's best-known line, not in the strangely
dipping phrases invented just for him but in the impetuous surges
of the original.
</P>
<P>
   Bo Skovhus, the Danish baritone whose recent album of arias on
Sony Classical also includes a tender account of this excerpt,
follows Battistini's precedent, reasoning (as Battistini may well
have done) that the bit was simply too familiar to tinker with.
Duesing took liberties, too.
</P>
<P>
   Hampson promises to respect the composer's second thoughts
throughout. ``I admire Battistini endlessly,'' he declares, ``but
I'm singing what Massenet wrote.''

FRENCH PREMIER ASSAILS U.S. OVER IRAQ AIR STRIKES
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin criticized U.S. and
British air strikes against Iraq in an interview published
Wednesday and said that France would soon be ready to propose ways
for ending the impasse with Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin told Le Monde, ``The United States often acts in a
unilateral way that undermines its ambition of mobilizing the
international community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was clear in the conflict with Iraq,'' he said. ``What's
the reality after the Anglo-American strikes? We've gone from a
situation where the entire international community, with the United
Nations, was reminding Iraq of its obligations, to a direct
confrontation between the Baghdad regime and our American and
British friends. I don't see how that's progress.''
</P>
<P>
   France, he said, was working on ideas to end the crisis in a way
that would insure ``lasting regional security'' but permit Iraq to
resume oil exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general,'' Jospin said, ``I believe there is a need for
France to assert itself more on the international scene, not
because of its power or wanting to teach anybody lessons, but
because it has a different way of seeing a certain number of
international realities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``France, a friend of the United States, does not automatically
share that great country's point of view,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac and other French officials expressed
disappointment at the British and U.S. decision to bomb Iraq in
December after it stopped cooperating with U.N. arms inspectors,
but the official French reaction held Saddam to blame for the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin, a Socialist, observed in the interview with Le Monde
that presidential pronouncements on policy did not carry the same
weight now as they did when Chirac's conservatives controlled both
the presidency and the government, from 1995 to mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin is widely expected to run against Chirac in the next
presidential election, in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Put on the defensive by Le Monde about what effect his
government's plan to move to a 35-hour workweek would have on
France's 11.5 percent unemployment rate, Jospin replied that
joblessness stood at 12.6 percent when he was elected, with 190,000
more people on the unemployment rolls than at the end of last year.
Healthy economic growth stimulated by government measures created
350,000 jobs in 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the 35-hour week, he said it would encourage negotiations
between workers and managers at all levels of the economy on all
kinds of questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the 35-hour week is not the only way to reduce
unemployment,'' he said, adding that the government would use
government money to create jobs for young people who have the most
trouble finding work.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin said that reducing juvenile delinquency and crime would
be his highest priority this year, after jobs. And asked about
growing strains within his leftist coalition, which includes
Communist and Greens ministers as well as Socialists, he said,
``Maybe we've accomplished more in 19 months than wearing ourselves
out.''

   NEW YORK _ While the question that haunted the world of
professional basketball for the past six months has now been
answered, the National Basketball Association has by no means
returned to being the calm, settled and fantastic entity it once
was. Plenty of questions remain for Commissioner David Stern,
perhaps the most pressing being how to cram a six-month season into
three months while maintaining its legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   League officials were at the NBA office in Manhattan late
Wednesday night trying to work out a new schedule that will be a
mixture of the old and the new. Nothing has been solidified yet and
the league does not expect to release revamped schedules for its 29
teams until next week.
</P>
<P>
   Several players said they were told by Stern in Wednesday's
meeting that training camps probably would not open before Jan. 18.
That is also the date that players said teams will be able to start
signing the league's nearly 200 free agents. People within the
league say teams will begin playing either a 50- or 52-game
regular-season schedule the first week in February, most likely
Feb. 2. On the 82-game schedules that were released last fall,
teams play less than half of their games after Feb. 1, so 10 to 14
days will be added onto the regular season in order to play the
extra games. Thus, instead of ending the season on April 21, teams
might play into the first week of May.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the extra time, teams will be forced to play four and
sometimes five games a week rather than the typical three. Many
times, clubs will play three games in three nights. Such a format
was typical in the 1970s and early 1980s, but NBA teams have not
played on more than two consecutive days for the past decade or so.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous players admitted Wednesday that playing three straight
games would be hard on their bodies, especially after the extended
offseason. ``It's going to be tough to play back to back to back
games, but that's something we have to do as athletes,'' said
28-year-old Jimmy Jackson, one of the league's nearly 200 free
agents. ``But if you love this game, you'll do whatever it takes to
be ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Johnson, who will be 40 by season's end, doesn't mind the
increased workload. ``Welcome to the old school _ that's what I
tell these young guys,'' said Johnson, who entered the league in
1981. ``I used to tell guys stories about playing three games in
three nights. Now they're going to get a taste of it for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Home games listed on the current schedules will most likely
remain the same as far as the dates are concerned, but the
opponents could change. For instance, the Knicks are scheduled to
host Orlando at Madison Square Garden on Feb. 2, but the Magic
could be replaced by another team on the new schedules that come
out next week. In an effort to retain as much equity as possible,
the league is working to insure that no team has more games on the
road than at home.
</P>
<P>
   While games that pit Eastern conference teams against Western
conference teams will be limited, the league wants to maintain
inter-conference play because of the many compelling individual
matchups that span the Eastern and Western conferences. For
example, if cross-conference games were eliminated, the Los Angeles
Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal would not face Miami's Alonzo Mourning, or
Philadelphia's Allen Iverson would not go against Minnesota's
Stephon Marbury.
</P>
<P>
   The playoff format will remain unchanged with eight teams from
each conference qualifying. Because they will start later, the
playoffs could run throughout June and into the first week of July.
They will not, however, extend to the fourth of July. Last year's
NBA finals series between Chicago and Utah ended on June 14.
</P>
<P>
   The schedules are not the only thing that will be different.
Most players said Wednesday that fans should not expect great
NBA-level basketball until March at best. ''When it starts out it's
going to be ugly, real ugly. Believe me,'' Orlando guard Nick
Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons why play will be many notches below
normal. While most players have been working out on their own
throughout the lockout, few, if any, of them are in game condition.
In addition to sullying the level of play, that could add to an
increase in injuries such as pulled hamstrings and sprained knees.
</P>
<P>
   Also, because almost half of the league's players are free
agents, teams will have problems with their chemistry. Teams such
as the Houston Rockets and Phoenix Suns have fewer than six players
under contract. With as many as eight or nine new faces on their
ballclubs, they will almost certainly struggle early on. ''It would
take something like a miracle to really get together on the floor
with eight new players,'' Miami's P.J. Brown said. ``It takes
longer than a couple of weeks to get chemistry and that's all the
time you're going to have.''
</P>
<P>
   In a shortened season, veteran teams that have been together for
awhile have the advantage. That's why many players feel that if
Michael Jordan retired from Chicago, the Indiana Pacers would be
the team to beat in the East. The Pacers' only free agents of note
are Rik Smits and Travis Best, and Smits is expected to resign with
Indiana. They have practiced together during much of the lockout
and are poised for a strong season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have a great chance to win the championship,''
Pacers forward Antonio Davis said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Utah is again a favorite in the West, with only two free agents
in Chris Morris and Antoine Carr. But San Antonio, with a nucleus
of veterans such as Avery Johnson, David Robinson and Sean Elliot
wrapped around second-year phenom Tim Duncan expects to challenge.
Johnson played with his teammates throughout the summer and fall
and hopes it pays off. ''I'm praying that the time we put in gives
us an advantage because I'll take a championship after a 10-game
season or an 80-game season,'' Johnson said.

``CIVIL ACTION'' PREMIERES AMID STAR POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Boston put on the fur and frills Wednesday night for a
transfusion of Hollywood star power that added a splash of Left
Coast glamour to a city facing a long New England winter.
</P>
<P>
   Searchlights swept the snowy skies above Tremont Street and
police barriers held back several hundred cheering onlookers as the
Wang Center played host to the world premiere of ``A Civil
Action,'' a $60 million film version of the best-selling book by
Northampton writer Jonathan Harr.
</P>
<P>
   Among the celebrity guests parading down a 100-foot red-carpeted
walkway and into the lavishly appointed Wang lobby were ``A Civil
Action'' costars John Travolta and Robert Duvall, one an A-list box
office draw and the other an acclaimed Academy Award winner.
</P>
<P>
   Travolta arrived, unescorted and wearing a topcoat, just before
the film's scheduled 7:30 p.m. start. The actor, who portrays
crusading Boston attorney Jan Schlichtmann in the movie, was given
a megastar's reception as he strode into the theater lobby, pausing
to give impromptu interviews and sign autographs for a crush of
admirers.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he had bothered with the coat, Travolta quipped, ``I'm
from Maine. When I left this morning, it was 9 below.''
</P>
<P>
   About the Boston opening, he added, ``I think it's great. I love
the atmosphere here. And I feel connected to both the movie and the
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Duvall made his entrance, also unescorted, roughly 30 minutes
before Travolta. Dressed in a dark-blue suit, Duvall, who portrays
Hale and Dorr attorney Jerome Facher onscreen, waved warmly to the
cheering throng.
</P>
<P>
   Facher himself had an awkard moment when he arrived at the
theater and after fumbling around could not locate his ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will a stub from Fenway Park do?'' asked the attorney whose
obsession with the Red Sox is one of the film's leitmotifs.
</P>
<P>
   The film's two marquee stars, both mentioned in early reviews as
possible Oscar nominees for their performances, rubbed elbows with
many of the real-life players in the Woburn chemical-spill case.
More than 850 invitees, some paying as much as $5,000 per table,
jammed into the Wang Center to nibble on smoked salmon and beef
tenderloin, sip Chardonnay, and mingle with the cast and crew of
the film, which shot location scenes in and around Boston last
year.
</P>
<P>
   To a city whose last brush with Hollywood stardust came almost a
year ago, when local heroes Matt Damon and Ben Affleck copped an
Oscar for ``Good Will Hunting,'' these were heady times indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Computer honcho William Podeska and his wife Susan glided
into the Wang Center saying, ``We're just here to see a movie.''
Which sounded a bit like going to L'Espalier just for the dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Ricci of Sharon, draped in a lush white mink coat with
fox trim, said she had bought her ticket to support the Jimmy Fund,
one of three local charities benefitting from the event. The others
are the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Boston's Ronald McDonald
House, which serves children with cancer and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Most attendees no doubt showed up for some combination of all
three elements: to see the stars, to view the film, and to eat,
drink, and be merry on behalf of a worthy cause. The buffet dinner,
staged on all four levels of the Wang Center lobby, did not get
under way until well after 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of protestors outside the Wang Center made their
presence felt. Signs were held aloft calling attention to other
toxic-waste sites around the Commonwealth. W.R. Grace's proposed
expansion into North Cambridge was also the object of protest.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's event and its posh trappings stood in marked
contrast to the years of personal suffering and legal maneuvering
that marked the Woburn case. Among the families that brought suit
against W.R. Grace and Beatrice Foods for allegedly contaminating
their drinking water, five children and one adult died of leukemia.
Harr's book chronicled the decade-long effort to hold the companies
accountable for the contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``A Civil Action'' opened late last year for limited
runs in New York and Los Angeles, Wednesday night's screening was
considered the film's official world premiere. For Boston, that is
indeed a rarity. And when Hollywood designates an event as such,
all the stops _ plus plenty of champagne corks _ are typically
pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   A robust contingent of national media did turn out to cover the
premiere, however. Correspondents from CNN, ``Access Hollywood,''
``Entertainment Tonight,'' and the E! Channel beamed their
broadcasts to a national audience. WRKO radio host Howie Carr, who
plays himself in a brief scene opposite Travolta, basked in the
media spotlight as well.
</P>
<P>
   It was a friendly crowd, too. As the curtain went up on ``A
Civil Action'' and the screen was filled with a sweeping shot of
the Charles River, the roar was loud enough to hear all the way out
in Hollywood.

FINDINGS OF TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER PANEL RAISE DISCLOSURE ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House extended Wednesday the life of a special
committee in order to expedite the release of the committee's still
secret report on Chinese acquisition of U.S. technology.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will consult with the Clinton administration and
intelligence agencies over how quickly parts of the report can be
made public. Congress said the select committee would continue
until April 1 in order to get out the report soon, but already
there are complications.
</P>
<P>
   The White House received the 700-page report Monday night but
has allowed the rest of the government to read only the report's 38
recommendations, not its findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bulk of the report is being reviewed by law enforcement
officials to insure that no ongoing criminal investigation is
affected by circulation of the report,'' a White House spokesman,
David Leavy, said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee gave immunity to some witnesses who had been
involved in the transfer by U.S. satellite makers of space know-how
to China, administration officials said. These transfers are being
investigated by a federal grand jury here.
</P>
<P>
   The identity of the witnesses could not be learned. But lawyers
familiar with the investigation said that the Justice Department
had reviewed the immunity arrangement and was working to insure
that federal investigations were not tainted by congressional
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the report focused on areas that overlap with federal
law enforcement responsibilities, including China's diversion of
machining equipment and the theft of nuclear design secrets from
U.S. weapons laboratories, officials who worked with the committee
said.
</P>
<P>
   The report's findings can be declassifed by a vote of the House
after consultation with the administration and the House Permanent
Select Committee on Intelligence. The White House has pledged to
work with the special China committee, whose five Republicans and
four Democrats unanimously approved the report last week.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that the report relies on highly classified data
and intersects with continuing criminal investigations will
complicate the balancing of the public's right to know with the
needs of law enforcement and intelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's chairman, Christopher Cox, R-Calif., said the needs
of national security shift the balance toward public disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very much in the national security interest to
declassify these findings,'' Cox said. ``There is no advantage
gained from covering up the findings.''
</P>
<P>
   The special committee, formally called the Select Committee on
United States National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns
with the People's Republic of China, was created last June and was
due to expire last week. It held 33 closed hearings and took
testimony from more than 100 witnesses, some of whom told the
members that much of their findings, while potentially explosive
and sensitive, could be declassified, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of what to disclose is usually resolved by the release
of general findings and the withholding of details that might
reveal how the sensitive information was acquired.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's recommendations include ways to strengthen the
export control process, tighten security at American nuclear
laboratories and improve the handling and distribution of sensitive
intelligence data.

FINANCIERS PLAN TO PUT CONTROLS ON DERIVATIVES
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: Conn., Texas) 
 (nk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON and TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the blessing of the federal government, some
of the world's largest financial institutions reached an agreement
Wednesday to try to set their own industry-wide standards in the
huge and volatile market of complex securities known as
derivatives.
</P>
<P>
   By setting its own voluntary guidelines, the industry hopes to
both prevent recurrences of the problems that have arisen in the
derivatives markets and keep stricter regulations from being
imposed by Washington. But previous attempts at self-regulation in
the derivatives markets have met with limited success. They did
little to stave off the near-collapse last September of Long-Term
Capital Management L.P., the huge Connecticut hedge fund. Long-Term
Capital had invested heavily in derivatives, which are financial
contracts that are supposed to manage a company's risks,
particularly during turbulent changes in the economic climate.
</P>
<P>
   Executives involved in crafting the agreement, which will be
formally announced on Thursday, said the group would begin to write
a set of industry guidelines by late spring, governing everything
from trading practices to lending standards and disclosure
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was reached in Manhattan at a meeting of top
executives from 12 leading foreign and domestic institutions and
senior federal officials including Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of
the Securities and Exchange Commission. The agreement was warmly
embraced by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury
Secretary Robert E. Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin heads an interagency group that is considering what
changes may be necessary in the largely unregulated and steadily
growing market in derivatives, so named because their value is
derived from underlying products such as stocks, bonds or
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   It also illustrates a decided policy position by the Treasury
Department and regulators that both the underwriters and the
traders of these financial instruments have a pivotal role in
policing themselves, a view shared by Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will enable practitioners to implement the latest
improvements in risk management and to begin the cycle of
innovation all over again,'' said one senior executive on the
committee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas A. Russo, an authority on derivatives regulation and
managing director at Lehman Brothers, one of the companies serving
on the group, said the formation of the group ``is highly
significant and a credit to the government regulators for
encouraging a private initiative to have global best practices in
the risk-management area.''
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts disagreed and were either critical of the
effort or skeptical of what it would ultimately achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the fox guarding the henhouse,'' said Charles
Peabody, a banking analyst with Mitchell Securities Inc. in New
York. ``There's an inherent conflict because you won't police
something too carefully if you're making a lot of money on it. That
was the lesson of Long-Term Capital, and that's why you need an
independent outside regulator.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Hu, a derivatives expert and professor at the University
of Texas Law School, said: ``To the extent that it establishes
norms about how people should behave, I think it is a good thing
because the people being regulated know more about the products
than the regulators. But a lot depends on whether it's merely
aspirational or meant to be mandatory.''
</P>
<P>
   Others questioned whether a group of companies with deeply
conflicting financial interests would be capable of mustering
consensus on the kinds of regulatory issues where agreement has
proved to be elusive.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials and industry executives praised the idea
Wednesday. Administration officials involved in an interagency
group set up after the collapse of Long-Term Capital and led by
Rubin said that its conclusions would not be affected by the
industry's work. Washington has so far moved cautiously in
formulating any new regulations on the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the industry group's members were involved in the
bailout of Long-Term Capital. The hedge fund, which borrowed
heavily and threatened to wreak havoc on the financial markets when
its investments began to sour, was rescued by Wall Street at the
intervention of officials from the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the companies involved in the new group have recently
taken significant hits on their earnings from either their
investments in Long-Term Capital or their investments in
derivatives, despite the intended role of derivatives as a tool of
risk management.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An American company doing business in Great Britain, for
example, might buy an option on the pound to protect itself against
a decline in the currency that could hurt its profits, posted in
dollars. Such a derivative is a standardized contract that trades
on regulated financial exchanges. But many other kinds of
derivative contracts are tailored for specific parties. In interest
rate swaps, for example, one party agrees to exchange a fixed
interest rate for a floating rate with another specific party for a
specified period. These kinds of contracts are traded over the
counter and remain off banks' balance sheets, making them difficult
for regulators to handle.
</P>
<P>
   The derivatives market has boomed over the last decade to become
one of the most lucrative activities on Wall Street. About $37
trillion worth of privately traded derivatives contracts are
outstanding, up from $865 billion in 1987, according to the
International Swap and Derivatives Association. That figure,
however, represents the paper, or ``notional,'' value of all of the
underlying financial products used to create a derivatives
contract. The actual exposure of most banks to the derivatives
contracts they carry is only a small percentage of the paper value,
in most cases well less than 1 percent of that amount.
</P>
<P>
   E. Gerald Corrigan, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York who is now a senior executive at Goldman, Sachs, and
Stephen G. Thieke, a top official at J.P. Morgan, will be
co-chairmen of the industry group. The other members of the group
are Barclays, Bear Stearns, Chase, Citigroup, Credit Suisse,
Deutsche Bank, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter and UBS.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for the banks' derivatives proposal was a meeting
convened in December by Levitt at Morgan Stanley's New York
headquarters. Two other investment banking firms _ Goldman, Sachs
and J.P. Morgan _ also were represented at that meeting, where it
was decided that Corrigan and Thieke would oversee the working
group assigned to create the self-regulatory proposal. Wednesday's
meeting was also held at Morgan Stanley's headquarters, and many of
the group's chairmen attended.

REPUBLICANS TO PUSH FOR A TAX CUT OF UP TO $500 BILLION
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: $1.8 trillion CQ in 6th graf.) 
 (nk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Key Republicans in the House and the Senate said
Wednesday that they planned to push for a tax cut of as much as
$500 billion over the next decade, including cuts in income tax
rates, to take advantage of federal budget surpluses that appear to
be growing faster than previously projected.
</P>
<P>
   Even a general agreement on an approach would be a marked change
from the bitter fight among House and Senate Republicans last year
over how hard to push for tax cuts. The proposals are still in
tentative form, and aides said working out the details would be
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But the effort represents a concerted challenge to President
Clinton's strategy of blocking any substantial tax cuts until after
Congress and the administration settle on a plan to shore up Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cuts would probably be dependent on the surpluses
actually materializing, and would be financed only by that part of
the surpluses that do not come from excess Social Security tax
revenue, members of Congress and their aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, nearly all of the surpluses over the next decade have
been projected to come from Social Security taxes beyond what is
needed to pay current beneficiaries. As a result, Republican
tax-cutting plans have been attacked by the president and
congressional Democrats on the ground that they would endanger the
retirement system, which is already facing long-term financial
problems.
</P>
<P>
   But new estimates of the surplus being developed by the
Congressional Budget Office suggest that about $500 billion of the
$1.8 trillion in surpluses likely to materialize in the next decade
could come from outside Social Security, and that the non-Social
Security surpluses could begin showing up in sizable amounts as
soon as 2001, Republican aides said.
</P>
<P>
   There is also mounting political pressure on Republicans. With
their poll ratings plummeting as they pursue the ouster of Clinton,
Republicans are scrambling to present a positive agenda. Most of
the party's leaders see tax cutting as the most potent tool
available.
</P>
<P>
   But if they press ahead, they could find themselves in a heated
battle with the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The president announced Wednesday that the White House now
expected the surplus for the current fiscal year to be $76 billion,
as compared to the last estimate from the Congressional Budget
Office of $63 billion. But Clinton vowed to continue opposing tax
cuts and spending increases that use the surplus until the
government deals with Social Security's looming financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any family with long-term financial needs and a little
more earnings than expected, we can't go out and spend the surplus
today,'' the president said in announcing the surplus forecast at
the White House. ``We have to plan for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   If the 1999 fiscal year ends in a surplus, it will be the second
consecutive year after 29 years of deficits. In the fiscal year
1998 the government recorded a surplus of $70 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, whose tax-cutting efforts were paralyzed last year
by Clinton's Social Security strategy, now say they are
increasingly comfortable that they can cut taxes while assuring
voters that they are setting aside more than enough money for any
overhaul of Social Security. The White House had hoped to reach a
bipartisan agreement early this year on dealing with Social
Security, but negotiations on the issue have all but ceased because
of the impeachment proceedings against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Under a plan being considered by Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M.,
chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, across-the-board
reductions in income tax rates could be phased in as the non-Social
Security surplus grows in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said one idea under consideration was to create a
``trigger'' that would put the tax cuts into effect only when the
surpluses actually materialized, so the cuts would not push the
budget into deficit if the economy and tax revenue faltered. The
Congressional Budget Office will release updated surplus estimates
at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans pushed hard last year for a big tax cut, but
found little support from their colleagues in the Senate, who were
more cautious about crossing Clinton on Social Security. Domenici
and his counterpart in the House, Rep. John R. Kasich, R-Ohio,
chairman of the House Budget Committee, were at odds throughout
much of the year. Because of the impasse, Congress failed for the
first time in 25 years to adopt a basic tax and spending blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   But the approach being developed by Domenici and his staff
appears to have support in the House as well. Kasich said in an
interview that he had spoken with Domenici about the plan on
Tuesday, and that although it was too early to say how House
Republicans would respond, he was encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that Senator Domenici wants not only to reform Social
Security but to have substantial tax relief is music to my ears,''
Kasich said, adding that an across-the-board cut in income taxes of
as much as 10 percent ``is something I believe in very strongly.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, has argued since last year that there is enough money to
deal with Social Security and cut taxes at the same time. Although
they would not be specific, aides to Archer said he wanted to focus
this year on tax cuts that would promote economic growth, a phrase
usually used to refer to rate reductions.
</P>
<P>
   There is likely to be continuing tension among Republicans,
though, over how hard to push for across-the-board tax cuts at the
expense of tax breaks favored by social conservatives, particularly
a reduction in the marriage penalty paid by many two-income

SIDELINE OR COACHES' BOOTH? REEVES WILL DECIDE SOON. 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since he needed just two years to turn a franchise best known
for losing into a division champion with Super Bowl aspirations,
perhaps it's no surprise that Atlanta Falcons coach Dan Reeves
plans another extraordinary comeback this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six days after quadruple-bypass surgery, and just 16 days
after his release from the hospital following minor complications
from that surgery, Reeves plans to be on the Falcons' sideline for
Saturday's playoff game with the San Francisco 49ers in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves will wait until Thursday or maybe even as late as
Saturday morning to make a final decision on whether he will watch
the game from the sideline or from the assistant coaches' booth
above the field, but Reeves said he was leaning toward assuming all
his normal coaching duties _ calling plays and patrolling the bench
area.
</P>
<P>
   The former New York Giants and Denver Broncos coach, however,
will make one concession to the circumstances of the last four
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to go out there screaming like I do sometimes,''
the 54-year-old Reeves said. ``But there are still going to be
times I'll holler _ if my heart allows me, which I hope it will.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last two days, Reeves has supervised his first Falcons
drills since his heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta safety Eugene Robinson said Reeves acted the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like he never left,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, meanwhile, acknowledged he has felt better than he
expected to feel this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting more energy every day and that's really what will
be the determining factor in any decision I make,'' Reeves said.
``I'll gauge my energy level after our three practices this week.
I've been cleared medically to try to be on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't lift more than 30 pounds but I don't plan on my game
plan weighing that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves has prepared for the 49ers with his coaching staff as he
normally would _ again, with minor concessions. As other coaches
watch film and analyze 49er tendencies, Reeves has occasionally
reclined on a couch in his office to relax as he watches the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't normally do that,'' said Reeves, whose daily
exercise has also included two 15-minute treadmill workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Reeves insists he anticipates a normal recovery. And
he denied rumors that his health may force a retirement from
coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has changed,'' he said. ``There was no damage to the
heart. I've been assured that if anything, I'll feel better. I feel
good about the prognosis and about what the future holds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There probably would be more stress to be out of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is also how Reeves feels about Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have wondered if I should go to the game,'' he
said. ``But it would be more stressful not to be there wondering
what's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Convalescing at home and in Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta, he did
watch his Falcons win their final two regular-season games without
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't miss me, that's for sure,'' Reeves said with a
laugh. ``That actually was kind of fun for me because I stepped
away from it and watched the game like an outsider looking in. I'd
rather have been there, but there was some benefit to observing
from the outside, too.''
</P>
<P>
   His Falcons finished 14-2, an astounding 11-victory improvement
over the 1996 team Reeves inherited.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's beyond my wildest expectations,'' Reeves said. ``Our
goal was to get to 10-6. There was no way I thought we'd be 14-2.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not only the best record in franchise history, it is also
the Falcons' 10th winning season since joining the National
Football League 33 years ago. Atlanta won the National Football
Conference West title for the second time and for the first time
since the 49ers began their run as the dominant team in the
division in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Falcons find themselves favored to defeat the
famed 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we beat them at home earlier this year, it gave us a huge
boost of confidence,'' Reeves said. ``Because they had beaten us
before and beaten us badly. When we got past that, our fans
believed in us, too. There's no question there will be an
electricity in the stadium Saturday and that's because it's the
49ers we're trying to get past.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said: ``Who would have thought the Falcons would be
playing for the Super Bowl? It starts with San Francisco. That's a
great story.''
</P>
<P>
   A great story with an added twist, since the architect of the
turnaround plans to lead his charges just days since leaving his
hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to take total responsibility on the sideline,''
Reeves said. ``I just have to be smart when I'm out there.''

LACK OF ACCORD MAY MEAN LENGTHY IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate will embark on a new course in modern
history Thursday as President Clinton goes on trial for alleged
``high crimes and misdemeanors'' amid widespread confusion and
rising anxiety about how the momentous proceedings will unfold and
when they might end.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton's presidency at stake, Senate leaders remained
stymied Wednesday night in their attempts to forge a pretrial plan
to conduct the potentially explosive proceedings in a reasonably
swift, fair and dignified manner.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Senate is likely to hold ``a full trial'' that
will last a month or longer, said the majority leader, Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   The stalemate left in limbo nearly every key player in the
drama, as Representative Henry J. Hyde, chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, prepared to launch the process by reciting the
two articles of impeachment to the divided Senate.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate convicts Clinton, on charges that he committed
perjury and obstructed justice in trying to cover up his sexual
affair with a former White House intern, Monica S. Lewinsky, he
would be the first president to be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Fracturing the Senate was intense disagreement over whether Hyde
and 12 other House Republicans who will serve as managers, or
prosecutors, in the impeachment trial will be permitted to present
a relatively lengthy case by calling as many as 15 witnesses,
including Lewinsky, Clinton's friend, Vernon E. Jordan Jr., and
several White House aides.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Senate's 55 Republicans support calling at least
some witnesses, according to several GOP senators. But the Senate
minority leader, Thomas A. Daschle, said Democrats share
``universal, unanimous opposition'' to calling witnesses, which he
said could prolong the trial for ``a matter of months.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott was pushing a possible compromise Wednesday night that
would permit senators to debate and vote on each prospective
witness requested by the House managers. A majority of 51 senators
would be required to approve each witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would want to know, `What is that witness going to do?' ''
Lott told reporters. He said the plan could allow the Senate to
complete the trial by Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Barring an agreement on that plan, several GOP senators said,
Lott was circulating a proposal that would permit the House
managers to call between five and eight witnesses during a trial
that also could last about a month.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties said there was no hope left of reviving
a plan to hold a four-day proceeding next week, followed by a
``test vote'' that would end the process unless 67 senators voted
to continue to a full trial.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the standoff, Lott and Daschle waged an exhaustive struggle
to build support for any feasible compromise in the face of
enormous pressures on many fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators from both parties in the House and Senate continued
to haggle behind closed doors Wednesday night. And party leaders
said the talks could go on until 1 p.m. Thursday, when Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist is sworn in as the presiding officer
and all 100 senators take an oath to deliver ``impartial justice''
as they serve as jurors and judges in the historic case.
</P>
<P>
   The trial will be recessed after Thursday's swearing-in ceremony
and will resume next week at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to continue to talk and narrow the list of questions
and come forward with a proposal,'' Lott said Wednesday night on
the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said the plan could be ``one that neither the House nor the
White House will necessarily think is wonderful, but will give all
parties a fair chance to make a case and get to a conclusion that
is an equitable one.''
</P>
<P>
   But resistance from nearly all 45 Senate Democrats and a small
number of Republicans is expected to remain a major roadblock to a
full trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the preference of the majority of the US Senate is not
to have witnesses,'' said Senator John F. Kerry, who is chairman of
the Senate Democratic Steering and Coordination Committee. ``I
don't think this will be resolved by tomorrow,'' he said Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy also objected strongly to the
possiblity of a prolonged trial. ``The House process was tainted by
partisanship,'' Kennedy said. ``The Senate has no obligation to try
to validate what the House did by holding a full trial.''
</P>
<P>
   If a potentially lengthy trial begins Thursday, Kennedy said, a
motion to effectively dismiss the charges could be filed as early
as next week. The motion would require 51 votes for passage.
</P>
<P>
   For senators and their parties, the stakes were extraordinarily
high as the trial drew closer. A number of senators expressed
concern as they shuttled between impeachment meetings and
festivities marking the opening of the 106th Congress. At times,
the scene was surreal as many lawmakers celebrated over Chardonnay
and canapes amid the tense buildup to the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nervousness among everybody here that this has to be
done right and the American people have to have some confidence in
it,'' said Senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican. ``The sense
among most of us is that it would be very dangerous to go forward
without a pretrial agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton's legal team expressed frustration
over the lingering uncertainty in the final hours before the trial.
Although Clinton's aides and attorneys said they are preparing for
the possibility of a full-scale trial, including calling their own
witnesses, they said the Senate's failure to provide any ground
rules has seriously impaired their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult when you are on the eve of the trial and
wanting to know what lies ahead and...it's a moving target,'' said
James Kennedy, a spokesman for the White House special counsel.
</P>
<P>
   This much was certain Wednesday night, according to Lott and his
aides:
</P>
<P>
   After Hyde and his House colleagues recite House Resolution 611,
which contains the articles of impeachment, the Senate sergeant of
arms will deliver a summons to the White House, notifying Clinton
that the trial has begun.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist also will be formally notified, then will be escorted
into the Senate chamber by a battery of five senators, three
Republicans and two Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Strom Thurmond, the 96-year-old South Carolina
Republican who serves as president pro tempore of the Senate, is
scheduled to swear in Rehnquist. The chief justice then will
administer the oath to the senators, who will swear ``to do
impartial justice according to the Constitution and the laws, so
help me God.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, ``there are a lot of gaps around,'' Lott
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Notable among the lawmakers trying to resolve the impasse was
Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a Maine Republican who urged Lott
Wednesday to push a plan that would require the House managers and
Clinton's lawyers to submit written briefs between Jan. 11 and Jan.
15 so senators can better decide how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In particular, it will enable the senators to make an informed
decision regarding the need for the submission of additional
evidence and, if so, in what form and over what period of time,''
Snowe wrote in a letter to Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Several other Republican senators from New England said Snowe's
plan was part of a broad mix of possible alternatives under
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Judd Gregg, a Republican who lives in maple syrup
country in New Hampshire, said lawamkers were engaged in a
``sugaring off'' process to distill the issues and reach a possible
consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters was the insistence of some House managers
that such current and former White House advisers as Bruce E.
Lindsey, Sidney Blumenthal and Dick Morris be compelled to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said
calling such witnesses would help determine Clinton's state of mind
during the circumstances surrounding the obstruction of justice
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat who
cosponsored the unsuccessful, bipartisan plan to complete the
impeachment process next week, echoed many other Democrats in
asserting there is no need to hear witnesses because of the breadth
of sworn testimony that already has been taken. And he clung to a
hope that a compromise based on his plan could still be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still broad bipartisan interest in achieving a kind
of open trial that will not get out of control and damage the
country and divide the Senate,'' Lieberman said. ``I think it's
still viable.''

 THE HOG GAP: IF HOG PRICES ARE LOW, WHY ARE STORE PRICES HIGH ?(ART

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARK RIDGE, Ill. _ Inside a giant Dominick's Supermarket here,
Sam Ventura was buying some high-grade pork chops.
</P>
<P>
   At $3.99 a pound, Ventura was not fretting. ``This isn't a
steal, but the price is fine,'' he said, unloading a cart of
groceries at the checkout counter as his five-year-old son, Vinnie,
looked on. ``We eat pork every week, and you never hear bad things
about it _ none of that mad-cow stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But to Rick Dean, a hog farmer in Leroy, Ill., two-and-a-half
hours south of this Chicago suburb, the price was a disgrace. While
the pork products from one of his hogs yields about $304 at the
supermarket, he was paid just $29 apiece when he took his hogs to
market a few weeks ago _ down from about $110 a year ago. ``We've
got a lot of financial stress,'' said Dean, a third-generation hog
farmer. ``It's pretty discouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   What is happening to all that money? Federal officials are
looking into that question after hog farmers around the nation
complained that something unusual was going on, something unfair _
perhaps even illegal.
</P>
<P>
   For more than six months, a glut in the number of hogs being
raised sent hog prices plummeting to Depression-era lows. Yet the
price of pork at the meat counter has barely budged.
</P>
<P>
   So while much of the nation is splurging on pork chops, ham and
bacon, allegations of price-gouging are being leveled against the
meatpackers who turn hogs into pork products, and to a lesser
extent against the giant supermarket chains that sell them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very concerned about the prices producers are getting
paid,'' said Cynthia Cunningham, a spokeswoman at the National Pork
Producers Council in Des Moines. ``Something isn't right.''
</P>
<P>
   Meatpackers and retailers counter that government figures fail
to reflect a significant drop in prices because they do not measure
the amount of pork sold at a discount.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost everything we sell moves at a special price,'' said Tim
Hammonds, president of the Food Marketing Institute in Washington,
a trade group that represents some of the nation's largest grocery
chains. ``Retailers are aggressively featuring pork.''
</P>
<P>
   They also argue, with the support of many economists, that the
traditional market forces of supply and demand largely explain why
hog prices have plunged even though the price of pork has not
fallen anywhere near as much.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for live hogs have bounced off their lows in recent days,
with prices reaching 19 cents a pound on Tuesday, according to the
Department of Agriculture _ up from a low of 10 cents a pound in
December. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise that the farmers' crisis has caught
Washington's eye. Federal officials acknowledge that some pricing
data could be faulty, but they are also concerned about the growing
gap between hog prices at the farm level, which are down 65
percent, and pork prices at the retail level which are down just 2
to 3 percent _ a spread that economists say is one of the widest on
record.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has asked the Justice
Department and the Federal Trade Commission to look into possible
price-fixing or anticompetitive pricing by meatpackers.
</P>
<P>
   The National Farmers Union is urging federal officials to
investigate competition in the pork industry, where 75 percent of
the packing is controlled by just six companies _ Smithfield, IBP,
Swift, Excel, Farmland and Hormel Foods.
</P>
<P>
   Several large meatpackers say that they have cut prices about 30
percent from a year ago, and that they are working overtime to
slaughter and process a record number of hogs, more than 2 million
a week _ 10 percent more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hogs everywhere,'' says Jens Knutson, a spokesman
for the American Meat Institute in Washington, which represents
meatpackers. ``The prices are really what is necessary to clear the
market; these are market forces at work.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of that glut, meatpackers are bidding down the prices
when farmers call to say they want to deliver a truckload of pigs.
Some farmers say they no longer shop around; they ask if and when a
packer will take delivery. This gives packers tremendous leverage _
leverage that industry officials say may be battering farmers and
enriching packers.
</P>
<P>
   Several big meatpackers acknowledge that, for them, these are
good times. ``There's no question packers are making good money,''
said Gary Mickelson, a spokesman at IBP in Dakota City, Neb., one
of the nation's largest meatpackers. ``But ultimately it's the law
of supply and demand.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, after two years of losses, IBP has been posting
record profits, up more than 125 percent in the third quarter of
1998, and its shares jumped more than 37 percent in 1998. Hormel,
the large meat processor based in Austin, Minn., also reported
record profits of nearly $140 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Pure greed is hardly the issue, though. Economists say that a
more complicated set of factors is at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The probability of collusion or anything like it is near
zero,'' said Glenn Grimes, a professor of agricultural economy at
the University of Missouri at Columbia. ``I just think the American
people aren't that price-conscious.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason retail prices have not fallen sharply, economists
say, is that soaring demand for pork means retailers are under less
pressure to lower prices. But that is only part of the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the dispute can be traced to the data. According to the
Agriculture Department, the price of live hogs _ which the farmer
sells to the meatpacker _ has fallen as much as 65 percent from a
year ago. The wholesale prices that the meatpackers get for their
pork products, though, is down 30 percent. The retail price of pork
(an average of several products: ham, pork chops, sausage, bacon
and pork roast) is down just 2 to 3 percent from a year ago, at
$2.26 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers said that the grocery-store data fail to reflect that
most pork is sold at discount. Pork prices, they said, are down 13
to 19 percent from a year ago. Even so, the dropoff is nowhere near
the plunge in farm prices.
</P>
<P>
   Economists noted that farm and retail prices don't usually move
in lockstep, because the cost of the raw commodity is only one
component in the cost of delivering meat to consumers. But _ even
if the retailers' figures are correct _ economists also said that
the spread between the two does not usually bulge as large as it
has been.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is reason to be concerned that retail prices are not
behaving as they have in the past,'' said John Lawrence, a
professor of agricultural economics at Iowa State University.
``There's usually a two- to four-month lag in the change in prices.
But it's been over a year now and it's still not following.''
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Department officials acknowledged that their data
are incomplete, possibly even flawed. But economists said that data
for 1994 _ when farm prices also declined sharply _ show that the
spread between retail and farm-level prices was far narrower, and
the two sets of prices moved more in tandem than now.
</P>
<P>
   What really bothers hog farmers _ even those who say that their
production boom sparked this crisis _ is the way revenue has been
divided.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, retailers received about 47 cents for every
dollar of pork sold, while meatpackers took in 16 cents and hog
farmers, who were enjoying hefty profits, 37 cents. But now, with
live hog prices down from about 35 cents a pound a year ago to
about 11 cents today, those percentages have been turned on their
head.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers now get about 60 cents of that dollar, meatpackers 22
cents and hog farmers just 18 cents, according to the Agriculture
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers dispute any suggestion of price-gouging. ``We don't
see anyone taking excess profits,'' said Hammonds of the Food
Marketing Institute. ``And the exercise in finger-pointing is not
the way to solve the problem. We are conscious of what pork
producers are going through. And we're trying to move pork.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are saying to consumers: `add ham and pork.'''
</P>
<P>
   When retailers met not long ago with Glickman, the Agriculture
Secretary, they brought a large supply of grocery-store circulars
promoting pork specials.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It's the same at many stores. At a Hyvee Foods supermarket in
Iowa, for example, the meat section was plastered during the
Christmas weekend with hand-written signs urging shoppers to ``Try
Our New, Low, Low, Low Pork Prices!''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a Fareway's supermarket initiated ``Operation Pork,''
offering pork loins with bones for 69 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
   But some shoppers here in the Midwest _ where hog farms are
integral to the economy _ have begun to ask why the price of pork
hasn't fallen as sharply as, say, the price of gas, which is now as
little as 80 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us understand why they haven't lowered their price
even more,'' said Jan Kline, who was shopping with her family at a
Cubs Food outlet in Ames, Iowa, shortly after Christmas. ``I guess
they're just keeping the price up to make a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   John McMillin, a food-industry analyst at Prudential Securities,
said prices may fall now that the holiday rush is over. But he also
said supermarkets have every right to profit in good times, because
they suffer when the meat or dairy or poultry equation turns
against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hog growers of America have made inordinately high returns
for several years,'' he said. ``One reason there are so many hogs
right now is that returns have been so high.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason retailers have not been cutting prices more
aggressively, McMillin said, is that consumers dislike price
volatility, particularly in the meat aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the pork industry finds itself in a quandary. While
officials would like to see lower prices help sell more pork _ and
thus eliminate it from the supply chain _ pork consumption is
soaring even at high prices.
</P>
<P>
   If pork industry officials press too hard for lower prices, some
economists say, it could move the supply faster, but consumers
could also get used to cheap pork _ pork that is less profitable
for farmers and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   So industry officials have been careful about attacking the
retailers who are helping push pork consumption to record levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to buy pork because they like it and because
it's a good value,'' said John Hargerla at the National Pork
Producers Council. ``We don't want to be the cheapest meat on the
block.''

MARKET INDEXES REACH NEW HIGHS IN BROAD ADVANCE 
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK _ Stock prices rocketed to new heights Wednesday, with
the Dow Jones industrial average breaking the 9,500 mark as it
climbed 233.78 points, the biggest gain since Oct. 15, to pass its
previous record set just before Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-chip gauge joined the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock and
Nasdaq composite indexes in uncharted territory as investors threw
bonuses, dividends, holiday gifts and retirement and reinvestment
money into the market at the beginning of the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas markets also powered ahead, with gains in Europe, the
Far East and Brazil mostly equaling the American performance.
Mexico, however, fell slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new-year rally has got real legs,'' said David Dietze,
president of Point View Financial Services in Summit, N.J.
``Instead of just big-cap and tech stocks doing well, the sectors
broadened out to include financials, energy and some deep
cyclicals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, which rose 2.51 percent, to 9,544.97, was paced by
American Express, up 4 5/16, to 103|, and J.P. Morgan, up 3~, to
111\. But four other components surged more than 3 points, six rose
2 or more and only IBM, off ~, at 188}, was lower.
</P>
<P>
   Even steel stocks, which by some measures are at their lowest
point in a generation, caught fire Wednesday after an analyst at
Merrill Lynch raised his ratings and price targets for various
companies. USX-U.S. Steel jumped 2 15/16, to 27 7/16, and Bethlehem
Steel added 1 5/16, to 10 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar Tree Stores, which paced the retail group, soared 5 5/16,
to 48{, after the discounter reported a big gain in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Among the stocks benefiting from the settlement of the National
Basketball Association labor dispute, which will salvage more than
half the season, were Boston Celtics, up 4[, to 14|, and Nike, up 2
15/16, to 43|.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was heavy as the market started strong and worked
steadily higher until just after 3 p.m., when it reached a Dow peak
of 9,608.05 before plateauing to the close.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 986.9 million shares,
the fifth-busiest day on record, while 1.2 billion shares changed
hands on Nasdaq, the most in a month.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues on the Big Board, whose own composite index
also set a record at 611.01, outnumbered declining issues by 2,009
to 1,120, with 154 stocks making new highs and 15 new lows.
</P>
<P>
   The gain for the S&AMP;P 500 was 27.56 points, to a new high of
1,272.34, or 2.21 percent, somewhat less than the blue-chip Dow
industrials. The Nasdaq gain was 69.59, to a new high of 2,320.86,
or 3.09 percent. Microsoft, up 4}, to 151\, and Intel, up 6\, to
129{, contributed to the jump, but Yahoo, up 33[, to 291, and
Amazon.com, up 13{, to 138, had the more eye-popping moves.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines also saw prominent gains as Delta Air Lines climbed 5,
to 59{; UAL rose 4], to 68, and AMR added 3 13/16, to 67~. Brokers
also thrived, the biggest gains being 4 7/16, to 53|, for Lehman
Brothers; 4|, to 58~, for Charles Schwab, and 4 9/16, to 41 15/16,
for Paine Webber.
</P>
<P>
   Gains in leading foreign markets amounted to 3.41 percent in
Frankfurt, 3.2 percent in London, 2.24 percent in Paris, 3.09
percent in Sao Paulo, 3.47 percent in Hong Kong and 1.78 percent in
Tokyo.

PEPPERDINE BELIEVES TIME IS RIGHT TO WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ Rhode Island coach Jim Harrick returned to
campus recently and reminded Pepperdine of what the basketball
program used to be. Not maliciously, but rather with great pride.
</P>
<P>
   It was during an era when NIT appearances were considered a
disappointment and an NCAA bid brought expectations of an upset.
</P>
<P>
   But it's been five seasons since the Waves made the postseason,
the longest drought since the mid-1970s. There is pressure, mostly
from within, to restore Pepperdine's basketball glory. And to do so
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get that Pepperdine tradition back,'' sophomore
guard David Lalazarian said. ``We have to start winning
championships here to get that tradition back. Not just this year,
but for a few years.''
</P>
<P>
   That biggest step can be taken with three straight wins at the
West Coast Conference tournament in seven weeks. But the process of
manicuring the path to a top seed, and subsequently an easier draw
in the conference tournament, begins today.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves, selected to finish second in the WCC by the coaches,
open league play at Portland at 7 p.m. before heading to preseason
favorite Gonzaga on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a chance to put ourselves back up there, and we have
the team to do it,'' Pepperdine guard Jelani Gardner said. ``The
history here is something we know.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine used to be a regular participant in the postseason,
especially during the Harrick years. From 1979 until 1994, the
Waves reached the NCAA Tournament eight times and played in the NIT
on four occasions.
</P>
<P>
   During that run the Waves never went more than one season
without a postseason appearance. But not since an overtime loss to
Michigan in the first round of the 1994 NCAAs have the Waves played
after the West Coast Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The program bottomed out in third-year coach Lorenzo Romar's
first season, a dreadful 6-21 campaign, but is now cresting.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the talent we have, with the defensive pressure we can
apply, we can get back to the days of when Pepperdine played
against Michigan in the first round and almost won,'' said
sophomore forward Kelvin Gibbs, a Bellflower High graduate. ``I
didn't learn about the tradition until I came here, and then all
the old players would come back and play with us, and we got to
know them.''
</P>
<P>
   It's when Gibbs, along with most of the other Waves, became
aware of the program with the second-best winning percentage (.604)
in Southern California over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   It's how the current Waves learned about the 38-game conference
winning streak in the early 1990s, and about the 30-game home
winning streak in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is one of the best teams Pepperdine's had in a
while, and we feel we should be able to achieve the same things
they did,'' Gibbs said. ``It'll be a disappointment if we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   It's why there's urgency to win this season. Because Gardner,
defensive stalwart Tommie Prince and forward Marc McDowell _ the
core of the Waves _ are seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Romar wanted to toughen his team for conference play so he put
Kansas, Rhode Island, Michigan State and Wisconsin on the preseason
schedule. The Waves (9-6) lost three of those games, but each was a
one-possession game in the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the pieces are coming together, we like our team and
we think we have a nucleus to do well in the conference,'' Romar
said. ``It's whether we want to work hard enough.''

(ATTN: Va.) JEFFERSON'S DEFENDERS RENEW CRITICISM OF DNA ANALYSIS  By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DNA evidence of Thomas Jefferson's presumed affair with his
slave, Sally Hemings, continues to reverberate, with defenders of
the third president arguing that others in Jefferson's family could
have fathered her children.
</P>
<P>
   A DNA analysis of living descendants of Thomas Jefferson,
reported in November last year, was interpreted to show that
Jefferson had fathered at least one child with Hemings. Unease
about the certainty of that conclusion has been expressed by an
amateur historian who has had a rival theory and by the principal
author of the DNA study.
</P>
<P>
   The historian, Herbert Barger, whose wife is a Jefferson
descendant, said at a news conference in Washington Wednesday that
any of several of males in the Jefferson family could have fathered
Eston Hemings, the child whose descendants bear the Jefferson Y
chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the DNA analysis, Dr. Eugene A. Foster, complains
in a letter published in Thursday's issue of Nature that the
headline the journal put on his original study _ ``Jefferson
fathered slave's last child'' _ was misleading. Foster, a retired
pathology professor, said he concluded only that it was more
probable that Thomas Jefferson was Eston's father, rather than
other individuals suspected at the time, two of Jefferson's nephews
on his sister's side.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Joseph J. Ellis, author of a recent biography of
Jefferson, said the arguments of Barger and others had not changed
his view of the persuasiveness of the DNA evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In his book on Jefferson, Ellis, like a long line of
Jeffersonian scholars, rejected the story of a liaison with Sally
Hemings, a charge first made during Jefferson's lifetime by a
political opponent. But he changed his mind after reading Foster's
study.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had originally believed the likelihood of a relationship was
remote,'' Ellis said. ``The new evidence persuaded me that I had
been wrong, and I felt a kind of moral and professional obligation
to say that.''
</P>
<P>
   The suggestions being made by Barger and others are
scientifically possible, Ellis said. They hinge on analysis of the
Y chromosome, which is passed unchanged from father to son,
allowing male lineages to be traced far back in history.
</P>
<P>
   But the available historical evidence does not match up with any
of the other candidates as tightly as it does with Thomas
Jefferson. The salient piece of evidence, gathered by the historian
Dumas Malone, is that Jefferson was present at Monticello at the
times of conception of all of Sally Hemings' children.
</P>
<P>
   The people arguing against Jefferson's liaison ``believe it
undermines his historical reputation,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel they are running against the steady current of the
evidence,'' Ellis added. ``The DNA study by Dr. Foster has
fundamentally altered the character of the debate in such a way as
to persuade me beyond a reasonable doubt that Jefferson fathered at
least one and as many as four of Hemings' children.''
</P>
<P>
   How could so many distinguished historians, from Malone to
Ellis, have misread the evidence when others interpreted it
correctly? For example Annette Gorden-Reed, an associate professor
at New York Law School in her book ``Thomas Jefferson and Sally
Hemings: An American Controversy'' marshaled the evidence from a
lawyer's point of view and concluded the historians were probably
wrong, a view subsequently confirmed by the DNA evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gordon-Reed, who is African-American, asserts that the
historians erred because they approached the question from a racist
point of view, discounting the testimony of Eston Hemings that
Thomas Jefferson was the father of Sally Hemings' children and that
he had promised her the children would be freed, as almost uniquely
among Jefferson's slaves, they were.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said that Gordon-Reed's diagnosis of some of the
historians was correct but that ``it doesn't correctly and
accurately assess most of the scholarship on Jefferson of the last
20 to 25 years, which has been much more critical of Jefferson.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that prior to the DNA evidence there was compelling
evidence on both sides of the liaison issue. Jefferson's
contemporaries did not believe the accusation, first made in a
Richmond, Va., newspaper after the birth of Hemings' first son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would have been unduly reckless of Jefferson to
have continued the relationship when under scrutiny,'' Ellis said,
``but we recently have had reason to recognize that presidents of
the United States are perfectly capable of that degree of
recklessness.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis also noted that the character of Jefferson as it emerges
from his voluminous correspondence makes it extremely hard for
readers to believe he would have had an illicit relationship of any
kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you immerse yourself in the Jefferson papers,'' Ellis
said, ``the more difficult it becomes to imagine a liaison between
Jefferson and Sally Hemings. It's ironic, the more grounded you
are, the more likely you are to get this wrong.''

 &HT;    Lewinsky tops witness list
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON_ As House prosecutors floated the names of witnesses
they would like to call in Presidetn Clinton's impeachment trial,
they also worked to dampen fears that such testimony would fill the
august Senate chamber with sex talk.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the witness wish list is Monica Lewinsky, the
former White House intern. Lewinsky's illicit relationship with the
president and her tape-recorded descriptions of it are the
underpinnings for the case against Clinton. The release of her
graphic grand jury testimony, included in independent counsel
Kenneth Starr's report to Congress, drew numerous complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans are not eager to witness a repeat. But Rep.
Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.), one of 13 House prosecutors, said, ``We
don't have to go into all the (sexual) details.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson said any questioning of Lewinsky would be in a
limited fashion, focusing on the obstruction of justice charge
against Clinton. For example, she could be asked in greater detail
about Clinton's efforts to help her find a job.
</P>
<P>
   The same issue likely would await Clinton secretary Betty
Currie, another potential witness identified by Hutchinson.
Republicans in the House were persuaded that Clinton sought to
obstruct Starr's investigation, in part, by attemtping to coach
Currie about the details of his White House meetings with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Currie acted as a conduit for messages between Lewinsky and the
president. She was also the keeper of several gifts Clinton gave
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson also identified presidential friend Vernon Jordan as
a possible witness prosecutors would like to call. Jordan, who
appeared several times before the grand jury, would most likely be
asked to explain his role in helping Lewinsky find a job in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors will seek to establish that the job search was part
of Clinton's scheme to derail Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he would like to interview
aides that were close to the president in an effort to uncover the
president's ``state of mind'' when he allegedly tried to cover up
his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides such as Sidney Blumenthal and Bruce Lindsey
could be subpoenaed to talk about how Clinton falsely denied that
he was having an affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Former aides such as Dick Morris could also be called to set the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson, a former federal prosecutor, said the prosecutors
could present their case within two weeks. The big question mark is
whether they will be given that much time by the Senate leaders.

EDITORIAL: GUN HOMICIDES BY YOUNG PEOPLE  (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Jan. 7:
</P>
<P>
   The continuing decline in homicides in New York City and
elsewhere last year is cause for celebration, but it does not end
the need for strict gun-control laws. A new Justice Department
study shows that while the nation's overall homicide rate fell in
1997 to its lowest level in three decades, the number of firearm
homicides by young people remains alarmingly high. The report
offers no explanation for this discrepancy. But criminologists
point to the phenomenal spread of illegal handguns among young
people that began with the start of the crack epidemic around 1985
as a major reason for the continuing high level of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The number of firearm homicides committed by Americans 25 and
older declined remarkably between 1980 and 1997, by about 50
percent. But those committed by 18-to-24-year-olds actually
increased during that period by about the same percentage. The
6,076 killings by this age group in 1997, though fewer than the
all-time record of 8,171 gun homicides in 1993, is almost double
the number reported in 1976, the year the FBI began compiling such
statistics. Moreover, the Justice Department figures omit the even
greater number of firearm deaths through accidental shootings and
suicides each year by young people under 25.
</P>
<P>
   It can be expected that gun-control opponents will try to use
the overall decline in crime as an argument against reasonable
measures to keep guns out of the wrong hands, for example by
cracking down on illegal gun trafficking by limiting an
individual's gun purchases to one a month, and to require gun
manufacturers to sell products that can be fired only by authorized
users. Yet deadly gun violence by young people remains a pressing
problem. It calls for those firm steps, and more.

SPORTS COLUMN: DAVID'S DAY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A few minutes past three in the afternoon, with a
salvaged season and unprecedented union concessions in his pocket,
David Stern took the longest elevator ride of his 15-year life as
commissioner, from the low ground he had taken in dealing with his
desperate players, to the 25th floor of the Fifth Avenue high-rise
where about half of them were waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Stern had with him his loyal deputy, Russ Granik, and two
National Basketball Association security people, Horace Balmer and
Larry Richardson. He had a message that he wanted to share, one
last hand to play, but he did not know what awaited him inside the
law office of Weil Gotshal &AMP; Manges.
</P>
<P>
   Here, about 200 of the NBA's players glimpsed in David Stern's
face what they had never once seen from across the bargaining
table. They saw doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he first walked in, you could see this funny look on his
face, like he was thinking, `What kind of reception am I going to
get?' '' said Nick Anderson of the Orlando Magic. ``He had to be
thinking, `What do they think of me being here?'''
</P>
<P>
   A few players, Charles Oakley being one, didn't think much,
didn't want to hear what Stern had to say, and left. Most of them
remained, though, as Stern broke the ice by introducing Granik as
``the designated bad guy,'' before launching into a speech about
how this day had marked the end of a long blood feud.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, thank you to the players for saving the season and
thank you to Billy Hunter and Patrick Ewing for being courteous
during the negotiations,'' said Kevin Johnson, who is about to
become a free agent guard in what is going to be a freewheeling
January market. ``He said, `It's our time to get back together.'
And then he said, `We're all part of the same family.'''
</P>
<P>
   Back on the high road, back in control of his tarnished product,
Stern finished, believe it or not, to a round of applause. What a
difference the imminent return of a pay check, a few dozen adoring
fans in the lobby and a slightly less imperious Stern had made.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, knowing he had the players right where he wanted
them, Stern finally moved off the craggy mountain he had climbed
atop last month. He accepted an 11th-hour appeal by Hunter, the
union's cornered executive director. He threw the players the
necessary collective bargaining scraps that allowed them a measure
of dignity, and after voting overwhelmingly to play, they were back
in the mobbed lobby by late in the afternoon, feeding on their
fame.
</P>
<P>
   The players wore small blue buttons inscribed with the word
``solid,'' and tried their best to discount the fact that, on top
of half a season's pay lost, they had swallowed cost controls that
will reduce many top salaries by tens of millions. Gone was the
mood of defiance, the talk of principle. One by one, the players
descended from the 25th floor, and said, no, they did not have
anything personal against Stern. This was about business, and he
was doing his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just we had players working for us, David was on the strings
of the owners,'' said Michael Curry, a member of the players'
negotiating committee.
</P>
<P>
   This was an interesting, new portrayal of Stern, as the
basketball owners' marionette. For years, while commissioners in
other sports were pilloried as obsequious owner stooges, Stern
managed to cast himself as the spiritual leader of the global
basketball revolution, representing all, from the richest owner to
the lowliest ball boy. ``Easy Dave,'' he once called himself. The
players' partner. Then his league grew, more crowded, more
corporate. At the end of the century, Stern, more than a
commissioner, now goes about his work like any other cold-blooded
chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tyrant, a bully,'' one of the agents, Steve Kaufmann, said,
when asked how players might now view Stern. ``But then, they're so
relieved they probably won't even care.''
</P>
<P>
   Like any other calculating executive, Stern realized that, in
the end, people just have to work. He won big, mainly over the
agent, David Falk, and maybe he will use this coup as a springboard
into a higher corporate perch. Maybe, after training on basketball
players, he goes off one day to the kind of company that inflicts
real pain on its workers.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, when Stern was a rising young attorney at the
Manhattan firm Proskauer Rose Goetz &AMP; Mendelsohn, he did pro bono
work for a group in his integrated town of Teaneck, N.J. The group
was engaged in a landmark lawsuit against real estate brokers
accused of racial steering, the illegal practice of showing whites
and blacks homes in distinctly different areas. Stern helped win
the suit, but soon after left Teaneck behind for a less contentious
town, defining success in more upscale ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Easy Dave'' always tried to be one of the guys. Wednesday, the
finished corporate product left the GM Building and marched up
Fifth Avenue, bodyguards on both sides.

   There are plenty of unlikely places to see art in the physical
world, but for sheer range and pure oddity, terra firma has nothing
on cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The number of museums online has assumed proportions that only
Alice grown 10-feet tall could comprehend. According to the
listings provided by the authoritative online directory, the World
Wide Web Virtual Library, the strangely named Elsas Producties site
out of the Netherlands tallies links to more than 10,000 museums in
120 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Bowen, webmaster of the Virtual Library's museum pages,
claims that a new museum is added to its own lists on an average of
one a day, every day.
</P>
<P>
   The directories themselves are spawning like so many baby
galaxies: all of the search services, like Yahoo and Lycos, stock
ample museum links; and then the specialized directories like the
Virtual Library, ArtNet, Musee and World Wide Arts Resources
provide immensely broad (though spottily updated) offerings.
</P>
<P>
   What is a virtual museum? It can be anything from a homemade
collection of images with accompanying texts that focuses on a
category of objects _ paintings, restaurant ware, wooden nickels _
to a slickly produced, elaborate summary of a physical museum, with
floor plans, descriptions of collections and exhibitions, images,
audio, even virtual-reality tours.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as in the physical world, on-line museums dedicated
to art are just a fraction of the virtual storehouses displaying
everything from the artifacts of science and history to the more
florid examples of humanity's full-bore nuttiness.
</P>
<P>
   Witness the Air Sickness Bag Virtual Museum or, back in the
realm of artworks, the only slightly less twisted Museum of Bad
Art, whose slogan is ``Art too bad to be ignored'' (but we'll try).
</P>
<P>
   The dizzying propagation of visual culture on the Web has its
bright sides, from the established international institutions (the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Pompidou Center in
Paris, the Prado in Madrid) to the local (ever visited the National
Gallery of Slovenia or the Tokugawa Art Museum in Japan or the
Portland Art Museum in Oregon?) to the deeply strange (try the
Museum of Jurassic Technology's exhibit of fruit-stone carving).
</P>
<P>
   What is apparent is that museums now see the Internet as a
supplementary portal of value. The Museum of Modern Art in New York
has an extraordinarily rich site _ perhaps the best of its kind on
the Web _ and its numbers are intriguing. In 1997, 1.2 million art
aficionados surfed by, rapidly approaching the 1.65 million
visitors who passed through its actual doors. (To put the Modern's
yearly numbers in perspective, Yahoo, the most trafficked single
site on the Web, has more than one million visitors a day.)
</P>
<P>
   For artists attuned to the possibilities of such swelling
audiences, museums are offering new cyber venues. The Walker Art
Center's on-line Gallery 9 features Piotr Szyhalski's provocative
interactive pieces ``Ding an Sich'' and ``Harvest.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art recently purchased a
whole collection of Web works called ``RSUB'' from the
digital-design shop Razorfish Studios in New York.
</P>
<P>
   There is much, much more. Galleries? Hundreds. Auction houses
and live on-line auctions? Indeed. Art-locating services, advice
about collecting? A click away. All of them _ and who knows what
else? _ are now playing on a browser near you.

 WASHINGTON: impeachment proceedings.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hastert was turned to by shocked Republicans after Newt Gingrich
stepped down under fire and their next choice, Bob Livingston,
abruptly resigned over revelations that he had had extra-marital
affairs. Livingston had toppled Gingrich just one month earlier,
capitalizing on anger that Republicans had lost five House seats in
a midterm election seen as a mandate against impeachment. The
election left them opening the new session Wednesday with a 10-seat
majority, one of the smallest House majorities this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Solutions to problems cannot be found in a pool of
bitterness,'' Hastert said, delivering his first speech as speaker
from the well of the House chamber instead of the imposing
speaker's platform. ``In the turbulent days behind us, debate on
the merits often gave way to personal attacks,'' he said. ``Some
here have felt slighted, insulted or ignored. That is wrong, and
that will change.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader, called on the new
Congress to ``put to rest finally the poisonous politics that has
infected this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the impeachment of the president dominated a day which is
usually devoted to celebration and hopeful talk of legislative
goals and new party agendas. At times the confluence of events
almost seemed bizarre. At one point in the morning, Lott left a
Republican conference which was heatedly debating the trial of
Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice to receive
a quick greeting from Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Looking tanned, Gore heartily called out New Year's greetings to
reporters waiting word of how impeachment would proceed. As the
presiding officer in the Senate, Gore then swore in the 34 senators
elected or re-elected in 1998.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Shortly after noon, Lott and Sen. Tom Daschle also placed a
quick phone call to Clinton to tell him the new session had
convened, with Lott making pleasantries about college football.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of a new tone, the House plunged almost
immediately back into the impeachment issue, because of the
requirement that the new Congress reappoint the 13 Republicans that
the 105th Congress selected to prosecute the president in the
Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, the head of the House impeachment team, in a
futile effort to head off the debate, called the measure a ``simple
straightforward housekeeping resolution'' and said it was
``incidental to impeachment.'' He said his group planned to
prosecute the case ``as expeditiously and fairly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the Democrats who had fought against impeachment
from the House Judiciary Committee appealed to the new members of
the House not to cast one of their first votes to facilitate the
trial of the president. Rep. John Conyers Jr., the ranking Democrat
on the committee, said the House had carried out a partisan
impeachment ``totally lacking in credibility and overwhelmingly
rejected by the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``Today we have a final opportunity to put this
salacious activity behind us. If we reject the motion to reappoint
managers we will send a signal that we are prepared to move from
the politics of personal destruction.'' But the managers were
reappointed 223-198 on a near party line vote, with the same five
Democrats who had supported Clinton's impeachment voting with the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate side of the Capitol, senators searched for a way
to reach a bipartisan plan for a trial that would overcome the
differences between the conservatives' push for witnesses and the
Democrats' opposition to them.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, the leader of the House impeachment team, told Lott in a
meeting Wednesday morning that House prosecutors want to call five
to eight witnesses and take two weeks to make their case against
Clinton, Republican senators said. Ms. Lewinsky, as well as White
House aides Betty Currie and Vernon Jordan, were likely to be on
the witness list, according to congressional officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that any witness list that we put together
will include the name of Monica Lewinsky,'' Rep. George Gekas, one
of the House managers, said in an interview on CNN. ``But the
extent of what testimony we would elicit from her, that has not
been fully decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans said they wanted to back their colleagues in
the House. ``I would prefer not to have witnesses,'' said Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas. ``But if the House believes they have to have a few
witnesses to make their case, I'm not going to support some
political deal that denies them the ability to make their case.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Democrats took a firm stand against hearing from the
cast of characters who have become familiar to the nation in the
saga of the president's affair with Ms. Lewinsky. Assessing
Democratic sentiment, Daschle, the minority leader, said, ``I think
it is fair to say that there is universal, unanimous opposition to
witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has refused to speculate on how much time it
might demand to prepare should the Senate permit the House managers
to call witnesses. But Democratic senators who have consulted
closely with the White House have suggested that calling just one
witness could lead the president's lawyers to call others and to
demand to review more documents in order to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Clinton have repeatedly complained that the House
Judiciary Committee and Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater
prosecutor, had access to information the White House has not seen.
The White House is likely to demand to review that information in
order to cross-examine witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans spent hours locked away in an ornate floor off the
Senate chamber trying to find a middle ground. Wednesday night they
emerged optimistic. ``It's gelled,'' said Sen. Olympia Snowe,
R-Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said Republicans wanted an actual vote on articles of
impeachment and not simply the test votes that had been contained
in an earlier compromise proposal for a highly expedited trial. And
in contrast to that plan's one-week timetable, he said that both
the House and White House could end up getting several weeks each
to present their cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that takes you to January the 30th or February the 12th,
that's not as important as that you get these things achieved,'' he
said. ``I think everybody agrees to that. Everybody would like to
have it done in a speedy fashion, but only so speedy that it
doesn't cause people to feel like it's being shoved or that they
haven't had a chance to make their case.''
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan group of senators continued to try to hammer out a
plan in Lott's third-floor hideaway of the Capitol Wednesday night,
negotiating with Hyde and a three other House Republicans. Lott
described the session as a kind of pre-trial conference. The key
negotiators are Sens. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, Carl Levin
of Michigan, Joseph Biden of Delaware, all of them Democrats; and
Ted Stevens of Alaska, Pete Domenici of New Mexico and Fred
Thompson of Tennessee for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   A team of White House representatives, among them White House
counsel Charles Ruff and special counsel Gregory Craig, met by
invitation with some of the members of the bipartisan group who
have talked with the House managers who will prosecute the case.
</P>
<P>
   The senators hope to identify areas of evidence that both the
House and White House lawyers would stipulate to, to speed the
trial along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a lot has occurred between the House and the White HOse,
as we understand it, on that,'' Lott said, ``We're hoping that we
can facilitate that.'' He said, ``Obviously, it would be best if we
could get a broad stipulation out of the gate.''
</P>
<P>
   The group broke up at about 8:30 p.m., with Hyde saying
negotiations would continue. The lawmakers declined to say what if
any progress had been made.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how the negotiations progress, the first impeachment
trial of the president is to begin Thursday morning when Hyde and
the 12 other House managers are invited into the Senate chamber at
10 a.m. There they will read the articles of impeachment charging
Clinton with perjury and obstruction of justice. Then the Senate
will notify the chief justice that it is ready to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   At 1 p.m. Rehnquist will be sworn in by the presiding officer of
the Senate. Although Gore could play that role, he is not expected
to. Rehnquist will likely be sworn in by Sen. Strom Thurmond,
R-S.C., who at 96 is the oldest member of the Senate. Rehnquist in
turn will swear in senators as jurors in the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the ceremonies will mark the formal opening of the
trial, negotiations are expected to continue off the floor. Lott
said he planned to talk to Daschle Thursday as well as to his
fellow Republican senators to see if an agreement was in grasp.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS PUSH TO HEAR WITNESSES DURING SENATE IMPEACHMENT
TRIAL OF CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton
opens Thursday against a backdrop of partisan division as House
Republicans pushed for testimony from witnesses, including former
presidential paramour Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently willing to continue bucking public opinion, House
prosecutors late Wednesday sought the right to call Lewinsky,
Washington power broker Vernon Jordan, presidential secretary Betty
Currie and others, according to congressional officials.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said an agreement
was near on how a ``full trial'' would be conducted into charges
that Clinton lied to a grand jury and obstructed justice in an
effort to cover-up his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The trial will provide ``a substantial amount of time for the
House and the White House to put on their evidence,'' Lott said,
adding that the trial could go into mid-February. ``The date is not
as important as that we have a process that is understandable, an
opportunity for the trial ... and a vote on the articles of
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Late into the evening, eight Republican and eight Democratic
senators met privately with House prosecutors, all Republicans,
haggling over procedural details for only the second presidential
impeachment trial in U.S. history and the first since Andrew
Johnson was tried in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the 45 Senate Democrats oppose calling witnesses,
the 55 Republicans are divided over whether they want to hear any
testimony. ``We're not prepared to accept any witnesses,'' said
Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle, adding, ``As soon as the
first witness is called, all bets are off with regard to agreeing
on a procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat, complained that during the
House impeachment debate neither the Republicans nor Democrats
``chose not to use one witness, not to depose one witness, in (the)
entire investigative proceedings. It is, to me, puzzling at best
why they now insist on witnesses over here.''
</P>
<P>
   While the list of witnesses proposed by House prosecutors does
not include Linda Tripp, the woman who secretly tape recorded her
conversations with Lewinsky, some want to summon other women who
filed affidavits in connection with the Paula Jones lawsuit,
officials said. That sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton was
dismissed, but it led to accusations that he lied about Lewinsky
while being deposed for it.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans, led by chief prosecutor Rep. Henry Hyde of
Chicago, had proposed a witness list of up to 15. However, Lott was
trying to hold Hyde and his 12 House colleagues to five to seven
witnesses, Republicans said.
</P>
<P>
   If agreement is reached to call witnesses, Lott said he wants
the House prosecutors and the president's defense team to justify
their need for questioning each person. The majority leader said
the Senate would then vote on whether to hear that particular
witness.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen blocks away, White House lawyers were crafting a plan to
force senators _ who will sit as jurors _ to conduct a vote early
in the trial to show the Senate does not have the two-thirds
majority needed to convict Clinton and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we show the two-thirds is not there, the message is, it's
just a show trial with no chance of conviction. And every day we
can remind the public of that,'' a White House official told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a CBS News poll of 1,175 adults early this week found
63 percent opposed to a full Senate impeachment trial. Thirty-two
percent favor a full trial, complete with witnesses. The same
survey showed 69 percent of adult Americans approving of the job
Clinton is doing as president, a rating that has remained fairly
constant during last year's House impeachment hearings and debate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's impeachment trial formally begins shortly after the
Senate convenes at 9:45 a.m. EST. The 13 House managers who will
prosecute the case against Clinton will be escorted from the House
chamber on the south side of the Capitol to the marble and
gold-trimmed Senate chamber on the north side. There, Hyde and the
other managers will read the charges against the president.
</P>
<P>
   At noon, 96-year-old Senate Pro Tempore Strom Thurmond, a South
Carolina Republican and the oldest and longest serving senator in
the history of the Senate, will swear in Chief Justice William
Rehnquist to preside over the impeachment trial. Rehnquist then
will administer the jurors' oath to the 100 members of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   While no other major Senate business is expected on the Senate
floor until the trial is completed, Lott said committees will
continue to meet before and after senators sit as trial jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a responsibility to go forward, and we will do our
best to have a dual track,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   The trial had been expected to get under way next Monday, but
Republicans involved in closed-door negotiations over procedures
said that may now be pushed back to the middle of next week,
possibly later, so Clinton's legal team will have time to prepare a
formal response to the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Lott cautioned that although he hopes to have details worked out
within his own GOP caucus and with Democrats some time Thursday,
there is a chance no agreement will be reached on how to the trial
will proceed. ``You may not have the absolute answers (on witnesses
and procedures) until we get started'' next week, the Mississippi
Republican said.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans, including some who support not hindering
House prosecutors by barring witnesses, expressed concern about
getting into a trial without a bipartisan agreement on procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is clearly the sense of our caucus that it's
dangerous to start this kind of a process without some kind of
pretrial agreement on things like witnesses,'' said Sen. Chuck
Hagel, R-Neb. ``You get into procedural motions and questions and
then it just becomes a free-for-all as to people rising to debate
motions and changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate rules allow any senator to offer a motion at any time to
dismiss the case. If all 45 Democrats were to support a motion to
dismiss, they would still need the support of at least six
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., broke with his
Democratic colleagues by calling for a full-blown trial with
witnesses, particularly on the question of whether Clinton tampered
with witnesses or otherwise obstructed justice as alleged in one of
the articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, a critic of Clinton since he admitted the affair in
August and acknowledged misleading the nation for seven months,
said obstruction of justice is the only charge against the
president that might result in his removal from office. The perjury
allegation, if proven, is not a serious enough to warrant
terminating Clinton's presidency, Graham said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HILLSBORO, Ore. _ Bruce Campbell has heard all the jokes, thank
you very much. He knows he has bought himself a real fixer-upper.
He knows his project will never fly _ not anymore, that is. When
guests come to visit at his new home, they will inevitably ask
whether they have to keep their safety belts fastened, and whether
it is time to return their chairs to a locked upright position.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the kinds of comments a man will get when he buys a
used Boeing 727 to live in, which is exactly what Campbell has
done. The jetliner, which logged 43,000 flights in nearly 30 years
of service for the Greek carrier Olympic Airways, now sits at the
muddy fairgrounds of this suburb west of Portland, dismantled into
four sections: the 153-foot-long main body, the tail and the two
wings.
</P>
<P>
   Those sections will soon be moved by tractor-trailer to
Campbell's wooded property 12 miles away, where they will be
reassembled and turned into a man's castle _ 1,066.5 square feet of
living space, including two bathrooms that could, truth be told,
stand a bit of enlarging. It is, as Campbell, a 49-year-old
electrical engineer and self-proclaimed ``lifelong nerd,''
enthusiastically describes it, ``an aerospace-quality sealed
pressure canister with structural attributes that would put a
common home to shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as a real estate broker might put it, the roof will never
leak.
</P>
<P>
   If Campbell's plans for the plane, which he bought from a
salvage company for $100,000, are indeed unusual, they have
generated few complaints from neighbors of his rural property,
where he now lives in a trailer. Many there seem far more worried
about the creeping sprawl of subdivisions than the prospect of a
727 parked amid his 10 acres, where it will be largely obscured by
stands of Douglas firs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can pull off something like this and not have his place
turned into building lots, it'd be great,'' said Chris Denfeld,
whose family has a fifth-generation walnut farm next to Campbell's
property. ``I say more power to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The new home currently has no power at all: the salvage company
removed the jets and a lot of other equipment just after it made
delivery to Campbell with a final flight of the 727 into the
Hillsboro airport two months ago. But he already has all the
permits he needs to turn the plane into his home, and is working
with county officials to develop a route for moving the
94,000-pound aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Most commercial airliners come to an ignominious end. Once they
are out of service, the bulk is melted down for scrap, a process
that Campbell calls an ``incredible waste.''
</P>
<P>
   In rare instances, though, part of a fuselage will be used to
house students in a remote school district or perhaps serve as a
restaurant. And at least one other person has done what Campbell
plans to do. Jo Ann Ussery, a retired Mississippi hairdresser,
bought a Continental Airlines 727 a few years ago and turned it
into what she calls her ``dream home,'' with three bedrooms and one
and a half baths.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell was inspired when he heard a report on public radio
about that home. It sent him on a hunt that ultimately led to the
Olympic 727, which cost about $6 million when new. Olympic used it
mainly for hops within Greece and it still has ``fasten seat
belts'' and ``toilet occupied'' electrical signs in Greek and
English throughout the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell has removed the overhead storage bins from all but four
rows of the original seats, some of which still have the safety
instruction card and a ``motion discomfit'' bag in the pocket. He
has sold the seats for $50 a row to friends and to some of the
gawkers who have flocked to tour his plane.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that he will build a deck on top of one of the
wings once the whole plane is put back together. But maybe not.
</P>

   ``I want it to look like a fully operational aircraft,'' he
explained. ``They look so sexy when they're complete and clean.''

   He is thrilled with the mostly aluminum material used to
construct his new home _ much better than wood, which he dismisses
as ``termite chow.'' He is overjoyed, too, with the public
response, measured in visitors to both the plane itself and the Web
site he has established (www.airplanehome.com) to document his
project in meticulous detail.

   Campbell tentatively plans to use the cockpit as an office, with
computers installed where the control columns are. And he will
probably keep the main cabin undivided, leaving him with a
super-long 12-foot-wide studio apartment. A bachelor all his life,
he jokes that if he ever happens to meet a ``soul mate'' and settle
down, he may just have to buy a 747. He is surprised that no one
else has done so.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take all the seats out of a 747, and _ wow! _ it's a
palace in there,'' he said. ``That's 4,500 square feet of
exhilarating aerospace-quality living space. If I could get a
wide-body up to my property, I'd do it in a second.''

SPORTS COLUMN: ARMAGEDDON ... NOT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This was not the Armageddon I'd been waiting for.
</P>
<P>
   All summer and then into the fall, we saw prima-donna basketball
players turn to warriors. They battled 27 extremely wealthy team
owners and put a value on their muscle. July. August. September. By
November the owners realized they had a fight on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Only an edict from David Stern, the National Basketball
Association commissioner, prevented the owners from crying out in
pain and letting the players know that some of them were hurting,
too. So Wednesday morning I woke up with visions that the NBA, in
all its arrogance, would finally be put in its place. That more
than 400 professional basketball players, having fought and endured
for six months, would take a final vote and push the owners to the
brink, fling the ball in the owners' court. That they would make
the owners decide to end the season.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment of truth, the players capitulated. ``Because my
guys were beginning to soften,'' Billy Hunter, the executive
director of the players association, said in an interview Wednesday
night. ``We were getting so many pleas from players that if the
season was going to get canceled, they wanted to have a say in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   So, in the middle of a bitterly cold January day, the General
Motors Building in New York City was turned into Appomattox Court
House, or the battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay. This was the
players' surrender. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I suppose that I wanted the NBA players to do what has become
increasingly difficult for normal, work-a-day workers to do. These
players, despite their salaries and often glamorous life styles,
still bore the frustration of workers rendered defenseless against
corporations gobbling each other up, becoming larger, more arrogant
and callous, more insensitive to the well-being of workers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as players entered the General Motors Building
Wednesday, they passed by members of the National Association of
Broadcast Employees and Technicians who have been locked out since
early November, some of them skirmishing with workers who had
replaced them. Not far away, at a hotel on Seventh Avenue, members
of local 32B-32J, office building workers, were preparing for a
strike vote.
</P>
<P>
   But these basketball players work in an unusual industry and had
a rare opportunity to strike a blow against employers who, at the
end of the day, could never become so big, so fat that they could
do without the skills and charisma of the athletes who drive their
product. Had the players remained unified and strong for one more
day, the owners might well have made larger concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my belief, too,'' Hunter said. ``And I'd done it for
a while, managed to keep everyone together. But the guys at the
bottom _ not the top, the guys at the bottom, the little guys were
saying, `What about us?'''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter added: ``The owners are independently wealthy. They did
not earn their riches from basketball. They can function if the
season blows up. I did not want to be reckless. This is not like
the United Auto Workers and General Motors. They work together:
they make automobiles. If something happens, they will all suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the idea of Armageddon. I was not prepared to
play free and loose with my clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players were telling Hunter to take the gamble and stand
firm. Others said to give the players an opportunity to turn down
the NBA's offer.
</P>
<P>
   What should have enlightened the players about their value were
the hundreds of fans who stood out in the bitter cold Wednesday
just waiting to catch a glimpse of them. The players should have
gathered from that outpouring that they are the game.
</P>
<P>
   When Stern came in, no one called his name; only the news media
rushed to Stern, to get photos and quotes. There was even a
smattering of boos from those fans who recognized him. Otherwise,
no one knew; no one cared.
</P>
<P>
   During the next few months, players will get back into their
work-a-day world, ``digging deep down,'' ``going the extra mile,''
``gutting it out'' for coaches who have been getting paid through
all this and for franchises which have been subsidized through all
this. Toughing it out to bring home a victory _ something they
didn't do for themselves. At the moment of truth, the rank and file
panicked.
</P>
<P>
   The players learned not simply how much they loved the game;
they learned out how much they depended on the game. This is far
more distressing. For many the game had become the drug around
which they built their life style _car, house, clothes, jewelry.
When the drug was withdrawn, they were forced to pay a higher price
to get it back; some might spend the rest of their careers in
pursuit of the fix. They no longer love the game but need the game.
Their life styles dictate that it be so.
</P>
<P>
   A number of players said they had a newfound respect and love
for the game. They appreciate how easily it can be taken away. You
have not heard, and will not hear, similar sentiments expressed by
the owners, that they have new respect for the players, whom they
realize can be taken away at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the 191-day lockout proved what most owners have
always felt: players, literally, are a dime a dozen.

Bruce Campbell plans to live in this Boeing 727, which will be
reassembled on his rural 10 acres in Oregon. It is, as Campbell, a
49-year-old electrical engineer and self-proclaimed ``lifelong
nerd,'' enthusiastically describes it, ``an aerospace-quality
sealed pressure canister with structural attributes that would put
a common home to shame.'' (Shane Young/New York Times Photo)

BLACK-PANTHER-POLITICIAN, 1-6 -- David Hilliard, with his former
Black Panther colleague Bobby Seale, in the background, announcing
his candidacy for Oakland City Council. The campaign purports to
fulfill the unfinished agenda of the Black Panther Party. That,

slump in prices for hogs doesn't seem to affect what shoppers pay
for pork here - at Gepperth's Meat Market in Chicago - or
elsewhere. As a result, allegations of price-gouging are being
leveled against the meatpackers who turn hogs into pork products,
and to a lesser extent against the giant supermarket
chainsretailers that sell them. (Steve Kagan/New York Times Photo)

Ismar Schorsch, chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary in
New York, sees a confrontation brewing in Israel. ``As a result of
the increasing political power in the hands of the Orthodox and
ultra-Orthodox, you're seeing a confrontation pushing Israel in the
direction of getting the government somewhat out of the business of
religion,'' he says. (Ruby Washington/New York Times Photo)

For Yao Tonglin, 63, who has lived in Nanjie for 40 years, Maoism
means free housing, free furniture and a daily bottle of beer, also
free.. As one admirer recently wrote, Nanjie is a place of ``truly
shared prosperity,'' where people ``uphold what is public and spurn
what is private.'' (Erik Eckholm/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT32) NANJIE, China -- Jan. 6, 1999 -- CHINA-ANOMALY-1, 1-6 --
In May 1993, as seeds of reform sprouted in China, residents of the
Nanjie collective went the other way, erecting a towering statue of
Mao Zedong. Billed as a socialist model, this village in the
central province of Henan is often cited as a paragon by China's
``leftists'' - the dwindling, old-guard Communist critics of
China's rush from ideology and state planning. (Erik Eckholm/New

The Premium Standard Farms giant hog farming operation in Green
City. A glut in the number of hogs being raised has sent hog prices
plummeting to Depression-era lows, yet the price of pork at the
meat counter has barely budged. As a result, allegations of

hogs into pork products, and to a lesser extent against the giant
supermarket chainsretailers that sell them. (Keith Meyers/New York

NBA and its players' union Wednesday moved toward final approval of
a new labor contract that could end the owner-imposed lockout and

   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA coach Steve Lavin walked into a press room in
Pauley Pavilion on Monday night, grabbed a chair and marveled at
what had transpired. Arizona State, 0-for-UCLA this decade, had
just taken the Bruins to overtime.

   For UCLA, and for the league. If the first weekend of conference
play was any indication, get ready for two months of unprecedented
mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   Five of nine games were decided in the final seconds, and two
went overtime: USC held off Arizona State at the buzzer; Oregon
surprised Cal in OT; Washington State beat Washington on a
last-second shot; the Bruins escaped ASU; and Cal avoided a major
upset with a two-point win over Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   No team typified the wackiness better than the Bears. On Dec.
29, they defeated North Carolina in a thrilling finish to the
Newell Challenge. Four days later, they lost to Oregon; two days
after that, they narrowly defeated Oregon State, the worst team in
the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The offspring of parity and inconsistency is fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pac-10 has more going for it now than at any point in its
history,'' said former USC coach George Raveling, an analyst for
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   In five days (Dec. 24-29), the conference won three important
intersectional games: Washington over No.11 New Mexico, Stanford
over Temple, and Cal over No. 9 UNC.
</P>
<P>
   The old guard can protest all it wants, but this is a basketball
league. In the past four years, the Pac-10 is 7-12 in bowl games
and 36-16 in the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's better geographic balance,'' Raveling said. ``The team
in Seattle is good. The teams in the Bay Area are good. The teams
in L.A. are good, and the teams in Arizona are good. As you walk
through the geography and the population bases, everyone is playing
well. That helps the fan base, it helps recruiting, and it helps
television.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not so good for the blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy him while you can: Several NBA scouts attended the
Arizona-UCLA game Saturday. At least one concentrated on the
matchup between UCLA's Baron Davis and Arizona's Jason Terry.
</P>
<P>
   NBA talent evaluators believe Davis will enter the draft this
spring if he has a good season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks he's coming out,'' the scout said. ``Some
people think it's already been decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing fan club: USC's Brian Scalabrine is the league's best
newcomer and has impressed every coach he's faced, particularly
Arizona's Lute Olson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an all-leaguer,'' Olson said. ``He's the closest thing
I've seen to Detlef Schrempf since Detlef Schrempf. He can bring it
on the break. He can pass it, and he can shoot it. He's a pro, no
question.''
</P>
<P>
   A dim bulb!: Miles Simon didn't distinguish himself as a student
at Arizona, but he set a new standard for stupidity last month
after finding out his former girlfriend was dating Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of Dec. 14, Simon reportedly called Belle, who has
a home in the Tucson Mountains, and asked to speak to the woman.
When told she didn't want to speak to him, Simon told Belle he was
coming over. When Simon arrived, Belle refused to answer the door
and reportedly called the police, who cited Simon for misdemeanor
trespassing.
</P>
<P>
   Considering Belle's temper and track record, it could have been
a lot worse for Simon.
</P>
<P>
   A dim bulb II: Sophomore guard Cedric Clark's bio in the
Washington State media guide claims he was a scout team player for
Arizona in 1996-97 and traveled with the Wildcats to the Final
Four.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. The Wildcats denied Clark's request to walk-on, so he
spent the season as a practice player with the women's team.
</P>
<P>
   Loading up for Ducks and Huskies: Oregon and Washington have a
huge disadvantage because their travel partners, Oregon State and
Washington State, respectively, are the worst teams in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Although they won't say it, opponents will devote an entire week
to preparing for the Ducks and Huskies, figuring they can defeat
OSU and WSU with minimal preparation and effort.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the point? Point guard, once the domain of Jason Kidd,
Damon Stoudamire, Tyus Edney, Brevin Knight, Kenya Wilkins and Mike
Bibby, is now the Pac-10's weakest position.
</P>
<P>
   Raveling notes that only three players are capable of breaking
down defenses with dribble penetration: Davis, Terry and Stanford's
Art Lee.
</P>
<P>
   When will they break? How did Oregon coach Ernie Kent celebrate
the victory at Cal? After dinner, the Ducks had a two-hour
walk-through at the team hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Stumbling without Femerling: The departure of 7-footer Patrick
Femerling was considered addition by subtraction for the Huskies
because it would create space for Todd MacCulloch and improve
Washington's speed.
</P>
<P>
   Both premises are true. But without Femerling, the Huskies are
woefully small when the 7-foot MacCulloch gets in foul trouble.
Only one other player is taller than 6-7: freshman Marlon Shelton,
and he's not ready to play.

For Yao Tonglin, 63, who has lived in Nanjie for 40 years, Maoism
means free housing, free furniture and a daily bottle of beer, also
free.. As one admirer recently wrote, Nanjie is a place of ``truly

what is private.'' (Erik Eckholm/New York Times Photo)

In May 1993, as seeds of reform sprouted in China, residents of the
Nanjie collective went the other way, erecting a towering statue of
Mao Zedong. Billed as a socialist model, this village in the
central province of Henan is often cited as a paragon by China's
``leftists'' - the dwindling, old-guard Communist critics of
China's rush from ideology and state planning. (Erik Eckholm/New

The Premium Standard Farms giant hog farming operation in Green
City. A glut in the number of hogs being raised has sent hog prices
plummeting to Depression-era lows, yet the price of pork at the
meat counter has barely budged. As a result, allegations of

Luers in a gallery of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In more than
a dozen years as president and chief executive of the Met, Luers

OWNERS, PLAYERS AGREE TO DEAL, SALVAGE NBA SEASON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL MURPHY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the verge of losing the 1998-99 National
Basketball Association season, the league's team owners and its
players union finally reached an agreement Wednesday that will put
players back on the court in early February.
</P>
<P>
   The 191-day lockout will end once the six-year agreement, with a
league option for a seventh year, is drawn up by lawyers and
ratified by the owners and the union, a process that will take
about a week.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout won't be lifted until lawyers draft the agreement
and that version is ratified by the league and union, NBA
commissioner David Stern has said.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA Board of Governors will meet at 11 a.m. EST Thursday to
approve the deal, which is expected to be rubber-stamped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect the agreement to be ratified by the Board of
Governors at (today's) meeting,'' said Stern, who declined to
elaborate on details of the agreement. ``I will say that I am
elated that we will be playing basketball this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Training camp is expected to start Jan. 18, and the league will
begin play in the first week of February, with each team playing a
52-game schedule, abbreviated from the standard 82 games.
</P>
<P>
   After a bargaining session that began Tuesday evening, the
agreement in principle was finally struck between Stern and Billy
Hunter, executive director of the National Basketball Players
Association, at 6 a.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did we blink?'' Hunter said. ``I guess we both blinked.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means that neither was prepared to lose the entire season,
which is why Hunter said he bowed to pressure from certain
superstars _ reportedly Hakeem Olajuwon of the Rockets, Shaquille
O'Neal of the Los Angeles Lakers and David Robinson of the San
Antonio Spurs, among others _ and called Stern for one last-ditch
negotiating session.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had to be some horse trading to get the deal done,''
said Hunter when asked what broke the negotiating logjam. ``It's
not everything we wanted. That happens. The time was right for us
to talk. We both knew there was a lot to give up by both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   That horse trading was clearly evident in a summary of the final
deal.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement includes some of the owners' biggest wants _ a
limit on individual player salaries, a five-year pay scale for
rookies, and a decreased percentage of revenues going to the union
in the final three years of the six-year proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the union got more middle-class exceptions, a
graduated minimum salary based on experience, higher annual salary
increases and no limit on the percentage of revenue that will go to
salaries during the first three years of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great deal,'' Olajuwon said. ``I'm satisfied.
It shows a great strength from the players' point of view, the way
they stuck together. I think everybody is pretty much happy with
how it (the proposal) turned out.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement caught many of the players by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Players had been summoned to New York for a vote on whether they
supported the union negotiating committee's recommendation that
they reject the owners' previous proposal, which had been submitted
Dec. 27. But when Hunter and Stern reached their agreement, players
found out they would be voting on the framework for the new
collective-bargaining agreement, which they approved by a reported
181-5 vote.
</P>
<P>
   The players, however, were prepared to approve the owners'
previous proposal, which Hunter and the rest of the union's
negotiating committee had tried to discourage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody would have voted for the (owners') deal as it
existed,'' said Orlando's Nick Anderson. ``We want to play
basketball, and that's what we're supposed to be doing. We avoided
a massive earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern and NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik talked to the
players after the vote, saying, ``Let's get together. It has been a
tough battle. We have to come back to work as a team and make this
the best sport in the world as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither side wanted to name a winner and a loser in the
six-month labor war, but the owners wound up with a much better
agreement than the old one, especially with control of the high-end
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody won,'' Charles Barkley said. ``We gave some, and we
took some, but I'm just glad the deal is signed. We've done a great
disservice to the game, but business is business.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the compromises:
</P>
<P>
   _ The union agreed to a $14 million maximum salary for players
with 10 years' experience. Players with one to five years'
experience can get a maximum of $9 million, and players in years 6
to 9 can get $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ The union agreed to a three-year rookie scale, with teams
holding an option for the fourth year and the right of first
refusal in the fifth year. First-round draft picks will be grouped
into three categories by where they were selected _ picks 1-9,
10-19 and 20-29 _ with the highest picks eligible for higher
percentage increases in their salaries from year to year.
</P>
<P>
   _ To exceed the salary cap when signing free agents, the league
accepted the union's proposal for an ``average'' salary exception
and the $1 million exception, which increases by $100,000 every
year _ effectively becoming a ``median'' salary exception. As a
result, every team will have the right to sign two additional
players each season, even if it is over the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   _ The league agreed to higher minimum salaries than it had been
offering, starting at $287,500 and escalating to $850,000 for a
player with nine years of experience. A player with 10-plus years
in the league gets a minimum of $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a guy in my situation, I don't think it could get too much
better,'' said Eldridge Recasner of the Atlanta Hawks. ``I think
everybody's pretty pleased with the deal. It's fair across the
board. It's more what the union wanted, so what else can you say?''
</P>
<P>
   Ratification of the agreement will trigger a three-week
whirlwind of teams attempting to sign free agents, make trades and
hold abbreviated training camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be very busy,'' said agent Mark Bartelstein. ``We've
got a lot of free agents, so we've got to find them homes and
teams, get other guys into camps. I'm sure I'll probably talk to a
lot of teams (today).''

<P>
   The agreement in principle reached Wednesday to salvage the
National Basketball Association season is being welcomed by most
marketers and agencies, particularly those that covet the younger
male consumers who fervently follow the Bulls, Knicks, Lakers and
all that Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   But in an ominous sign for the long-term advertising appeal of
the league, many others _ apart from those executives directly
involved in marketing footwear and apparel _ described little if
any significant damage from the six-month lockout. And they
expressed concern that the late start to the season, as well as
lingering perceptions of players and officials more concerned about
salaries and selling than statistics and scoring, would alienate
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA got confused, thinking the fan base was the television
audience,'' said Jon Mandel, co-managing director of Mediacom, the
media services agency in New York owned by Grey Advertising, which
buys time and space for marketers like Reebok International Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's the fans who follow the game who are really in charge
of your brand image,'' he added. ``So if you tell them, `Let 'em
eat cake,' it's more than just a labor issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Donny Deutsch, chairman at Deutsch Inc. in New York, the agency
for the Foot Locker and Lady Foot Locker athletic retail chains
owned by Venator Group, echoed Mandel's cautionary comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this bad will has the NBA in trouble,'' Deutsch said.
``I'm a huge fan, but I will not go to a game this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball is driven by individual athletes, more so than
other sports,'' he added. ``But the players are looking unlikable,
like fools.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene DeWitt, the chairman at DeWitt Media in New York, a media
services agency, compared the dispute between the players and
league officials to ``two sets of bankers having a battle.''
</P>
<P>
   The public's attitude, he added, ``is like a pox on both their
houses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People have formed other habits without NBA games,'' he said.
``The damage to the sport, certainly for this year, could be
tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   There were two reasons given for the widespread opinions that
the difficulties inflicted upon advertisers were minimal. One was
the breadth of media alternatives to professional basketball,
particularly in an era of manufactured sports like the Winter X
Games and myriad cable and broadcast networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a variety of other male-targeted, very male-oriented
programming,'' said Monica Karo, the Los Angeles media director for
TBWA/Chiat/Day, a unit of Omnicom Group. ``For clients like Sony,
Apple, Kinko's, Nissan and Infiniti, we found other places to
advertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``To reach men 18 to 24, 18 to 34, 25 to 49 and 25 to 54,'' she
added, ``we've used other sports, primarily college basketball and
football, some cable like CNN and Discovery and syndication.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Donchin, vice president and director for national broadcast
at Carat North America in New York, a media services arm of Aegis
Group PLC, said that for advertisers like Alberto-Culver and Midas,
``we re-expressed the money into appropriate programming to give us
male viewership.'' He said that included the ``male-oriented
movies'' scheduled by the TNT cable network, part of Time Warner
Inc., in lieu of the NBA games that were to have appeared on the
network.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Igiel, executive vice president and broadcast director at
the Media Edge in New York, the media services unit of Young &AMP;
Rubicam Inc., said: ``Some clients just wanted pro basketball and
held money back until play resumed. For those who needed media
weight in January and February, we used prime time, football and
college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tightened up the first-quarter TV market,'' he added,
referring to the shrinking inventory of commercial time that has
produced more robust demand than is usual for the post-holiday
season. Indeed, the trade publication Mediaweek reported this week
that commercials during network prime-time programs in the
so-called scatter market _ the spots that were not bought before
the 1998-99 season began _ were nearly sold out.
</P>
<P>
   The other main reason given for the commonly held belief that
the effect of the lockout on advertisers was slight was the rhythm
of the pro basketball season: Earlier games attract less attention
than later games and later games attract less attention than
playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our attention is focused on the playoffs,'' said Brad
Shaw, a spokesman for the Pepsi-Cola Company unit of Pepsico Inc.
in Purchase, N.Y., ``so the impact on us was minimal.'' To help
introduce the Pepsi One soft-drink brand, aimed at younger men as
well as women, ``we've been largely on network prime time,'' he
added, ``which was the plan anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   A competitor that rarely agrees with Pepsi-Cola did so this
time. ``Ratings climb as the season progresses,'' said Scott
Jacobson, a spokesman for the Coca-Cola Co. in Atlanta, which bills
its long-term sponsorship agreement with the league as a ``100-year
partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In most seasons, we tend to have heavier media weight toward
the end,'' he added, ``so while we'll be figuring out a way to make
up for some lost time, it was kind of business as usual; this was
not disruptive at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware before the lockout began that ``there might be a labor
situation,'' Jacobson said, Coca-Cola executives planned so that
their annual professional basketball promotion, for the Sprite
soft-drink brand, would work with or without games being played. In
fact, the promotion, called the Sprite Salary Cap, capitalized on
the publicity for the dispute with satirical spots by Lowe &AMP;
Partners/SMS in New York _ part of the Lowe Group unit of the
Interpublic Group of Companies _ showing players like Grant Hill
and Tim Duncan pretending to need work.
</P>
<P>
   One commercial, which showed players performing chores for
callers to a make-believe job referral service, 1-800-TALL-MEN,
generated ``between 300,000 and 400,000 calls,'' Jacobson said,
adding that callers heard a recorded message from Hill in which he
said: ``I can't believe you really called. It's a joke, a joke,''
then described details of the Sprite promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Some advertisers, of course, need the NBA more than others.
Sales of sneakers and other athletic paraphernalia, especially for
marketers that sponsor the NBA or have a stable of
player-endorsers, have been weakened by the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly has hurt the industry overall,'' said Vizhier
Mooney, a spokeswoman for Nike Inc. in Beaverton, Ore., ``and Nike
is included in that.'' She said it was impossible to quantify the
sales decline ``because the industry was flat to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Ms. Mooney said, ``We're looking forward to being
able to showcase again our footwear and apparel and our
relationship with the athletes and the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike, too, parodied the lockout problems in advertising, running
a campaign by Wieden &AMP; Kennedy in Portland, Ore., in which
celebrity fans of pro teams, like director Spike Lee and actress
Dyan Cannon, delivered spoof tributes to neighborhood pickup games
and eighth-grade girls' basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing that will replace professional basketball,''
Ms. Mooney said.

AWAY FROM SPOTLIGHT, TAYLOR THRIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ He is a National Football League rookie who
has toppled records the way he has toppled defensive backs: with an
explosive combination of power and speed. He has given the
Jacksonville Jaguars dimensions that frighten teams. Yet some teams
were afraid of him when he came out of college because of several
off-the-field incidents.
</P>
<P>
   His name is not Randy Moss.
</P>
<P>
   It is Fred Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets will get a close look at Taylor, who has put up big
numbers in relative small-market obscurity, on Sunday when they
play the Jaguars in the American Football Conference divisional
playoffs at the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has really taken this league by storm,'' said Rich
Griffith, the tight end for the Jaguars. ``But I think he's been
overshadowed by Randy Moss. The kinds of numbers Fred has put up
are incredible. Normally, they'd be good enough to win him rookie
of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss won that award by getting 44 votes from a panel of 47
sports writers and broadcasters. Indianapolis quarterback Peyton
Manning got two votes and Taylor got one. During any other season,
1,223 yards rushing and 14 touchdowns would be enough to win the
award. But this is a leap year _ watch Moss leap over this guy,
watch him leap over that guy _ and Moss had 17 touchdown catches,
the most ever by a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Moss, Taylor wasn't haunted by his past in last April's
NFL college draft. Normally, teams don't shy away from college
players with checkered pasts, but Lawrence Phillips changed all
that. Teams watched how the St. Louis Rams took a chance on
Phillips, accused of several incidents of violence against women
while at the University of Nebraska, only to see Phillips released
last season after the Rams were unhappy with his behavior on and
off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Moss, who had been arrested because of marijuana
possession, an incident of domestic violence, and a racially
charged fight in high school. He was selected by Minnesota with the
21st pick in the draft, when a player of his talent normally would
have been a top-five selection.
</P>
<P>
   Moss was put under the microscope and burned, while Taylor
escaped the glare despite problems of his own. He was suspended at
the start of his junior season because of his role in a book-theft
incident, and was suspended the preceding year for fraudulent use
of a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   According to an NFL team security report, on Sept. 1, 1995,
Taylor was cited for violating the University of Florida student
code of conduct for throwing eggs at other students. Several
general managers who picked after the Jaguars were asked this week
if Taylor's problems would have prevented them from selecting him.
All answered no.
</P>
<P>
   Why were Moss and Taylor viewed so differently by various teams?
Some executives said they believed Moss' problems were worse than
Taylor's. Others said that Taylor was contrite in interviews prior
to the draft, and explained in detail what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't hide anything,'' said Jerald Ingram, the Jaguars
running backs coach, who interviewed Taylor at scouting combines
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, as Moss has proved in Minnesota, Taylor is showing
that the Jaguars made the right decision in drafting him.
</P>
<P>
   A 235-pound back with 4.3-second speed in the 40-yard dash,
Taylor is a combination bruiser and track star. Against the
Patriots last week, he rushed for 162 yards, the most yards gained
by a rookie in the playoffs behind Washington's Timmy Smith (204)
and Paul Lowe of the Los Angeles Chargers (165).
</P>
<P>
   As he has done all season, Taylor showed exceptional smarts in
picking holes last Sunday as the Jaguars defeated New England by
25-10. Most running backs need time to develop that very subtle,
but obviously important, skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always come into the game wanting the ball,'' said Taylor,
who set team records in attempts (264), rushing yards (1,223),
rushing touchdowns (14) and total touchdowns (17).
</P>
<P>
   ``Fred gives us an added dimension we've never had before,''
said Griffith. ``When he gets going, we're hard to stop.''

Bruce Campbell plans to live in this Boeing 727, which will be
reassembled on his rural 10 acres in Oregon. It is, as Campbell, a
49-year-old electrical engineer and self-proclaimed ``lifelong

sealed pressure canister with structural attributes that would put
a common home to shame.'' (Shane Young/New York Times Photo)

complete and clean.'' One option, though: a deck he might build on
top of one of the wings. (Shane Young/New York Times Photo)

In May 1993, as seeds of reform sprouted in China, residents of the
Nanjie collective went the other way, erecting a towering statue of
Mao Zedong. Billed as a socialist model, this village in the
central province of Henan is often cited as a paragon by China's
``leftists'' - the dwindling, old-guard Communist critics of
China's rush from ideology and state planning. (Erik Eckholm/New

RUMOR MILLS OF RIGHT, LEFT AIM AT IMPEACHMENT PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ As the Senate begins its first impeachment trial in
130 years, there are powerful forces on the right and left trying
to throw a monkey wrench into the process.
</P>
<P>
   The right, largely through the Internet and talk radio, is
pushing a 6-year-old rumor, resurrected by a supermarket tabloid,
that President Clinton has an illegitimate son by a prostitute in
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The editor of the ``Star'' tabloid, quoted by the Internet's
Drudge Report, said the story ``could be a 13-year-old hoax,'' but
that hasn't stopped talk radio from spreading it across the
airwaves in an apparent effort to pressure GOP members of the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, publication of ``Hustler'' magazine chief Larry
Flynt's one-time magazine, the ``Flynt Report,'' looms, and it,
too, appears to be shooting for scandals designed to incite popular
outrage at GOP politicians and affect the outcome of the Senate
trial in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt, a Democrat who proudly states that he is digging up dirt
on behalf of Clinton, promises a news conference early next week to
serve another helping of ``sex scandals by high government
officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is: Will the scandal-mongering swamp the Senate
and undermine the impeachment trial?
</P>
<P>
   Observers say the down-and-dirty tactics are bound to take a
toll on the process.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton ``love child thing,'' said Berkeley political
scientist Bruce Cain, ``just poisons the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``That matters because, when the atmosphere gets poisoned,
people don't necessarily do rational things. They do things out of
anger or revenge, and they dig in their heels,'' said Cain,
associate director of the Institute of Government Studies at the
University of California-Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton rumor has been largely ignored by the mainstream
press, although the ``New York Post'' published a story in its
Sunday editions.
</P>
<P>
   It's also become fodder for late-night comedian Jay Leno, who
joked, ``Imagine that, Clinton a father again. Is that what Clinton
needs, another reason to pass out cigars?''
</P>
<P>
   But when reporters asked for White House comment Monday, Clinton
press aide Joe Lockhart dismissed them.
</P>
<P>
   He said reporters who ``come with no independent reporting to
repeat the gossip from tabloid, supermarket tabloids, are wasting
their time with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, CBS News' Bill Plante continued the questioning. ``Well,
Joe,'' he said, ``isn't it legitimate to ask about reports such as
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said, ``Not like that. As all of you know, those
reports have been around for years, and it's just a waste of your
time to waste my time here with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The reports bubbled up last week at a gathering of conservatives
at the Arizona Biltmore in Phoenix, when cyber-gossip columnist
Matt Drudge promised a ``huge story'' with a ``worldwide impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Drudge later delivered with a report on the ``Star's'' DNA
testing to determine whether the story had any basis. He said a
news conference would be held on the DNA tests, which were to be
completed this week, if they showed a positive connection.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the buzz on the Internet and talk radio
continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feeds the fires of the right,'' Cain said. ``They just
continue to get more and more outraged about the fact Clinton is a
cad. They in turn will continue to put pressure on the Senate to
have a trial because they want to drag him through the mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its effect is more on the right than it is on general public
opinion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the House impeachment hearings, rumors of wild Clinton
sex tales sent some members, including Rep. J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz.,
to evidence hidden away in a government office building.
</P>
<P>
   The booming Hayworth took to the airwaves and said that the
secret information portrayed Clinton as a ``sexual predator.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., showed restraint,
pointing to legal arguments that the material should not be
considered because it was excluded from the House Judiciary
Committee report used as the basis to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Former Arizona Sen. Dennis DeConcini, now a Washington lobbyist,
said the latest reports have yet to make a mark with senators. But
he said that, if proved true, they could be devastating to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are a little bit callous toward that right
now,'' said DeConcini, who has conferred with several senators
about the process.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he said an impeachment trial is ``very dangerous for Clinton
. . . if another shoe drops.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will work unless it comes from other
sources,'' added DeConcini, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   That may be the key difference with the latest seamy Clinton
saga.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it has largely been confined to the Internet, where
journalistic standards are non-existent.
</P>
<P>
   Political scientist Mark Petracca, who has studied the effects
of the Internet on the democratic process, said the Drudge Report
and other Clinton scandal sites lend credibility to stories once
confined to the Capitol Hill gossip network.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's little difference between the CNN Web site and the
Matt Drudge Web site,'' said Petracca, head of the political
science department at UC-Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The form it takes, its presentation, adds legitimacy that
wouldn't ordinarily be there in the historic way in which political
gossip occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``When you hear gossip, you know it's gossip, so you
treat it as such. Now it becomes much more difficult to distinguish
between what's gossip and what's not gossip.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Petracca said, the Internet has given rumors a new
legitimacy that can, in turn, have a powerful impact on the
political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does have a potentially more vicious consequence if it gets
taken up by mainstream news outlets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt also is promising to bypass the mainstream media by
posting the results of his investigation on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Since offering a $1 million bounty on philandering politicians,
which led to the downfall of House Speaker-elect Bob Livingston,
Flynt has emerged as a powerful force in Washington's sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt says his investigators have dug up dirt on about a dozen
politicians, all but one of them Republican, in an attack on what
he sees as Clinton's hypocritical detractors.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt, a self-described ``pornographer, pundit and social
outcast,'' has hinted only that his next target is a ``big fish''
Republican in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to unmask what Flynt calls hypocrisy in the Clinton
investigation is shaking up more than politicians. Some observers
fear that in driving the public discourse to new lows, Flynt will
deepen cynicism about the impeachment process and government in
general.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is dangerous to democracy,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a
political scientist at Claremont (Calif.) Graduate University.
``It's dangerous to the First Amendment and it only adds to the
cynicism we see out there. This is sexual bounty hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynt had flushed out Livingston after putting an advertisement
in the ``Washington Post'' offering to pay up to $1 million for
verifiable information on adultery by members of Congress or other
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt described his next victim as a GOP House member who has
been a strong critic of Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is really a gem,'' Flynt said. ``We've got enough to
go on now, but we are waiting for an affidavit from his ex-wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynt said that he will probably name a third politician next
week, and that he is paying a total of about $4 million to women
who responded to his ad. At some point, he will publish details not
in ``Hustler,'' but in the ``Flynt'' ``Report.''
</P>
<P>
   His activities have Republicans across the nation cringing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you wonder who's running the country,'' said national
GOP strategist Ray McNally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are the politicians going to start becoming the most
responsive to? Larry Flynt? This is crazy. It's like Armageddon.
It's just mutually assured destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole sorry process ultimately hurts everyone,'' McNally
said. &QL;

 By ALAN TRUEX  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
He is demanding, sometimes abusive, often critical. Bill Parcells
is not the typical ``player's coach.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Jets' free-speaking author/receiver, Keyshawn
Johnson, writes in this week's ESPN The Magazine: ``He made us a
better team by being willing to put up with all of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``And credit us for being willing to put up with Bill
Parcells.''
</P>
<P>
   They put up with Parcells because they know his methods result
in triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Three times he has turned around moribund franchises _ the New
York Giants, NFL champions of the 1990 season; the New England
Patriots, AFC champs in '96; and now the Jets, who on Sunday will
play the Jacksonville Jaguars after earning a bye in the first
round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells was 9-7 last year, his first with the Jets, who are
12-4 this year.
</P>
<P>
   The year before Parcells took over, the team was 1-15, and the
precocious rookie Johnson wrote a book, Just Give Me the Damn Ball,
that included disparaging remarks about teammates, among them
fellow receiver Wayne Chrebet.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was accused of destroying team chemistry, to which he
says: ``What team chemistry?''
</P>
<P>
   Chrebet is not fond of Johnson: ``We are not friends; we do not
go out socially. All that high-fiving I do with him is for the good
of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is all Parcells asks _ not that players shut up, not
that they like each other, but that they do what's good for the
team when they're on the field.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with Johnson and Chrebet, who this season caught 83 and
75 passes, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   High-strung athletes who would have been problems for other
coaches _ Johnson, Lawrence Taylor, Bryan Cox _ Parcells accepts,
as long as they help him win.
</P>
<P>
   When Cox launched into a tirade about the NFL being racist after
he was fined $10,000 for late hitting, Parcells told him it was OK
to vent.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson complains about not getting the ball enough, that too
is permissible.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson points out that Parcells does not discourage
selfishness, that the coach likes to say: ``I'm selfish. I do what
is going to help me win.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Parcells makes selfishness and teamwork mesh. As Jets
quarterback Vinny Testaverde observed, Parcells ``has a way of
getting everybody to play as a unit; he brings out the best in
every player.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Parcells' guidance, Testaverde has risen from the bench to
become the leading passer in the AFC. A quarterback who was known
for indecisiveness and heaving the football into crowds of
defenders is now, at age 35, a model of efficiency and composure.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I did,'' Parcells said, ``was tell him that when he
decides to run, take the ball down and run. This year, he's making
all the right decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are 7{-point favorites over Jacksonville and are a
trendy pick to make the Super Bowl, based on their all-around
excellence _ solid defense, a tremendous passing game and a
reliable rushing attack.
</P>
<P>
   The team reflects Parcells' discipline by avoiding turnovers and
penalties. In their last two games, the Jets allowed a total of one
sack and committed only one turnover and four penalties. The Jets
are the hottest team in the AFC, having won their last six games
and 10 of their last 11.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, 57, has guided them masterfully down the stretch,
easing up in practices (no pads for the last month) to minimize the
risk of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   While the Jaguars have 13 players on injured reserve and
numerous others masking pain with cortisone, the Jets are,
relatively speaking, a picture of health. Their only concern is
star cornerback Aaron Glenn, who is recovering from a sprained
ankle but is expected to play Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The one flaw that often is cited with the Jets is their lack of
playoff experience. Only 19 of their players have ever appeared in
a postseason game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose this game,'' Parcells said, ``everyone will say,
`Well, they don't have playoff experience.' Well, that's a crock. I
think I have enough guys who have been in the tournament _ about 35
percent of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about our preparation for this because with our
bye week, we'll have time. And winning those last four games makes
a believer out of me that we're going to try hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets closed the regular season with a comeback win against
Seattle and victories against three playoff teams _ Miami, Buffalo
and New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't think we could win all four of those games,''
Parcells said. ``Those were like playoff games. That's why I say
they made a believer out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that didn't happen until he made believers out of
them. Bill Parcells has a history of doing that.

US ALERTS DEMOULAS CASE LAWYERS TO POSSIBLE INDICTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The US Justice Department sent target letters,
considered the formal warning of an imminent criminal indictment,
to two of Boston's most prominent lawyers Tuesday for their role in
an elaborate last-ditch scheme to win the nasty battle for the $2
billion Demoulas supermarket fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators for the Justice Department have also prepared a
memo of prosecution and a draft indictment for the two lawyers,
former Assistant US Attorney Gary Crossen and former Nike President
Richard K. Donahue Sr., and three others involved in the plan,
several sources close to the Justice Department and the principals
told the Globe Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The letters informed the targets that they have until Jan. 15 to
make statements to the Justice Department before senior department
officials formally sign off on the indictment, which is expected
later this month or next.
</P>
<P>
   The five lawyers and private investigators have been under
federal investigation for 18 months on charges that they created
aliases and lured a young law clerk to job interviews as far away
as Nova Scotia and New York to try to get him to give taped
statements that the judge in the Demoulas case had been biased
against their client, patriarch Telemachus ``Mike'' Demoulas.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious charge in the indictment, several sources close
to the Justice Department and the principals said, is expected to
be interstate travel in aid of racketeering. Other likely charges
include conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud, and extortion, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Two lawyers close to the investigation said they expect the
indictment to extend beyond the ``job interview'' plot to other
questionable behavior by the lawyers during the trial. For example,
Crossen and some investigators paid a stripper $500,000 to testify
on Mike Demoulas's behalf _ money Crossen argued was necessary to
keep a flighty witness from running away or using drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, private investigators working under the attorneys
approached an elderly couple and offered free legal advice to get
the couple to file a complaint alleging that Middlesex Superior
Court Judge Maria I. Lopez was biased in their suit against a
former partner in a North End pasta shop.
</P>
<P>
   But the caper with the law clerk won the most notoriety because
it raised questions about just how far a lawyer _ even a highly
respected one _ would go to defend a client offering big fees. One
firm working for Mike Demoulas had already reaped $13 million for
its role in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The US Attorney's Office in Boston, which would ordinarily have
prosecuted the case, recused itself because Crossen is one of its
most well-liked and well-known former stars, having headed the
General Crimes Unit under former US Attorney William F. Weld. He
also served as the head of Weld's Judicial Nominating Committee,
and was Weld's counsel in his campaign for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue is a former campaign aide to President John F. Kennedy,
and has remained a close adviser to the Kennedy family.
</P>
<P>
   Crossen and Donahue both expressed confidence Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did are things we were supposed to do, as lawyers, for
our clients,'' said Crossen, now a partner at Foley, Hoag &AMP; Eliot.
``I'm happy that the matter is approaching conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Donahue said in a statement, ``My conscience is clear that
throughout the course of my involvement with this case, my actions
have been appropriate and ethical. I look forward to a resolution
in this matter and am confident that I will be found to have
commited no wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   The target letters were sent to private investigators Ernest
Reid and Richard Labonte and attorney Kevin Curry, but not to
investigator Joseph McCain, who had been investigated initially,
one source said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Crossen and Donahue said they would go to Washington
to argue that the plan, though unusual, was proper and appropriate
because it was in the interest of their clients. One said the
lawyers would fight so hard for their reputations and careers that
there would be a ``bloodbath.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Justice Department sent target letters
suggests it will indict the lawyers anyway, unless they can present
so unusually strong evidence in their favor, several former federal
prosecutors said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to get a higher-up to overturn a
recommendation to indict,'' said one former federal prosecutor who
knows Crossen. ``It's not impossible. It does happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The case against the lawyers began with the case against Mike
Demoulas by his late brother George's heirs. Over eight years and
multiple trials and appeals, a judge and juries have found Mike
Demoulas guilty on charges that he calculatedly stole stock from
his nieces and nephews over the 20 years after George died, despite
having made a dramatic vow to his brother to protect the stock and
the children's interest in the company the two brothers bought from
their parents.
</P>
<P>
   The case spilled out into courtroom brawls between members of
both sides of the family, with so much bitterness that the family
refused to come together to mourn one nephew's tragic death.
</P>
<P>
   After Lopez ordered that control of the company be stripped from
Mike and given to George's heirs, Mike's lawyers trained their
energies on convincing a higher court that Lopez had been biased in
her statements and judgments against his side.
</P>
<P>
   They got several witnesses to testify that the judge had
improperly socialized with one of the key lawyers for George's side
at a popular Beacon Hill bistro. And they sent her clerk, Paul
Walsh, a letter soliciting his resume for a job at an international
insurance firm. They flew him to ``job interviews'' in Nova Scotia,
and then New York, where the law allowed them to tape him without
his consent, and got him to say on tape that Lopez had told him who
``the good guys'' and ``the bad guys'' in the case were before the
trial began.
</P>
<P>
   Posing as interviewers, the lawyers and investigators caught
Walsh in several embellishments regarding his role in the Demoulas
decision. Back in Boston, they confronted him with their real
identities and told him he should testify on their behalf, or they
could expose his lies.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh then went to the Justice Department, which provided him
with a wiretap that taped Crossen and Donahue repeating their
advice to tell the truth. Walsh characterized it as extortion;
Crossen and Donahue said it was typical prosecutorial tactics, to
get Walsh to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Crossen has said that Mike Demoulas's son Arthur dreamed up the
Walsh plot after getting a tip that the clerk had told other
lawyers about the judge's partiality. A state appeals court last
month rejected the claim that Lopez was biased.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we have been looking for is justice,'' Arthur T. Demoulas
said Wednesday. ``We have the evidence to show the misconduct and
the impropriety on the part of Judge Lopez. We believe that the
judicial system as well as ourselves will benefit from such a
hearing.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ National Basketball Association players and owners
brought an end to the most calamitous and costly labor dispute in
league history Wednesday, agreeing to an 11th-hour deal that saved
the season only a day before the owners were to vote on canceling
it.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiating for 12 hours and trading concessions until 6 a.m.
Wednesday at the league offices in Manhattan, Commissioner David
Stern and Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, worked out
a seven-year collective bargaining agreement that ended the 191-day
impasse.
</P>
<P>
   An abbreviated regular season of about 50 games _ there are 82
games in a full season _ was expected to begin in early February,
with a full complement of playoffs beginning in early May. The
regular season could be extended by one to two weeks, but the
playoffs were not expected to last into July and would certainly
end before July 4.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout by the owners will not officially end until after
the deal is made final by lawyers for both sides and then signed.
Training camps and the signing of 200 free agents would then begin,
probably around Jan. 18. The games lost this season translate into
total player salary losses of about $400 million; leaguewide
revenue losses also ran into the hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the disagreement for the past six months has been
how to divide the $2 billion in annual revenue that the league
generates. Although both sides made some concessions at the end,
the league achieved its main goal of containing the contracts of
high-salaried players, and received some unprecedented concessions
from the union.
</P>
<P>
   It insisted on and received a maximum salary provision, and no
other professional sport has a limit on individual salaries. It
also eliminated some of the crippling loopholes to its salary cap
that had sent salaries skyrocketing in the last five years, and it
refused to yield to the union's request for a greater percentage of
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the union was left to try to hold onto some of the
terms that had provided its players the highest average salary in
pro sports, $2.6 million. It also achieved its stated priority of
significantly bettering the economic position of its middle-class
players, those making around the median salary of $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The union will receive 55 percent of total revenue toward
salaries in the last three years of the deal. That was less than
the players had hoped for, and the feeling among many of them was
that they had given in to many of the league's demands at the last
moment. Still, it was better than the prospect of no season and
many more millions of dollars in lost paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the NBA came perilously close to becoming the first
major sports league to lose an entire season to labor strife, many
players considered Wednesday morning's surprise announcement
fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call at 6 a.m. in my hotel room this morning and I
couldn't believe it,'' said Joe Kleine, a free-agent center. ``We
will finally play again. Now we have a bigger job ahead of us:
getting our fans back.''
</P>
<P>
   Kleine was one of the 179 players who came to Manhattan
Wednesday for a vote called by the union's negotiating committee.
On Monday, Stern had rejected the union's final proposal, and
Hunter, succumbing to internal and external pressure to hold a
vote, summoned the players to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Though he said he still considered the owners' offer inadequate,
Hunter said he would put the issue before the general membership.
It was a risky move that may have led to uneasiness in the union,
prompting it to resume discussions. Amid talk of mounting
displeasure among the players, players flocked to New York unsure
of the parameters surrounding a vote.
</P>
<P>
   But what was supposed to result in a tense and potentially
divisive debate on the union's position instead turned into scenes
of relief in and around the General Motors Building on Fifth
Avenue, where the players had gathered at the offices of the
union's law firm. Hundreds of reporters and fans mingled inside and
outside the buildings, fighting to talk to the players as they
exited the building after voting, 179-5, to approve the new deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is crazy,'' said Steve Kerr, the Chicago Bulls guard. ``I
never expected this. Of course, at times I never expected a season,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   The league announced that its labor relations committee had
unanimously approved the deal. The agreement was also approved
Wednesday by the membership of the union, upon the unanimous
recommendation of its negotiating committee.
</P>
<P>
   Details will not be released until after the league ratifies the
agreement at its board of governors meeting Thursday at 11 a.m. at
a Manhattan hotel. But apparently both sides had their key concerns
met in the wee hours of Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did we blink?'' Hunter asked. ``I guess we both blinked.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I expect the agreement to be ratified by the board of
governors at tomorrow's meeting,'' David Stern said in a prepared
statement ``I have agreed with Billy Hunter that I will not discuss
the agreement in detail until after its approval by the board. I
will say that I am elated that we will be playing basketball this
season.''
</P>
<P>
   The decisive talks began Tuesday night after Hunter asked one of
the union's outside counsels to go over to the league's offices at
6 p.m. to meet with the deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, and
present several concessions to the league.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiating secretly in a conference room at the league's
Olympic Tower offices, the two sides gave each other a list of
their desires. When they came across a disagreement, Hunter said,
they moved on.
</P>
<P>
   In reaching an agreement with the league, Hunter avoided the
heated confrontations that could have taken place with 210 of the
league's 430 players in one room and under so much strain. With
financial futures and playing careers dependent on the outcome of a
vote, players entered the day concerned that teammates would be
pitted against each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we got everything settled before there was a
free-for-all,'' the free-agent forward Charles Barkley said. ``It
could have been bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The carnage was avoided. But the damage of this labor dispute on
the union could linger.
</P>
<P>
   After agreeing to a deal that many believed was only minimally
better than the one the league had been offering all along _ and at
a cost of almost $600 million in player salaries _ Hunter's
leadership has been put into question and his future is uncertain.

 MindSpring Snares Netcom for $245 Million   By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Netcom, the San Jose Internet service provider, has been sold to
MindSpring Enterprises for $245 million in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   ICG Communications Inc., which bought Netcom 14 months ago, said
it will sell Netcom's dial-up, dedicated and Web hosting accounts
to the Atlanta ISP for $215 million and $30 million in MindSpring
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Netcom has 420,000 customers, but MindSpring officials said
consumers won't have to change their e-mail addresses or the phone
number they dial for Internet service. Prices are expected to
remain the same, though there could be new pricing plans down the
road, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers won't have to change a thing,'' said MindSpring CEO
Charles Brewer. ``Their software, their e-mail address, the price
plans, the number they call, all that stuff will stay the same,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer, whose company has 455,000 customers, said he's been
eyeing Netcom for some time and bought it in order to increase his
company's market share. MindSpring, which has been beefing up its
customer base through acquisitions, bought both SpryNet and PSI
Net.
</P>
<P>
   The Netcom purchase will give MindSpring more than 1 million
customers, catapulting it to the No. 4 spot _ the same place as its
rival ISP EarthLink Network.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second sale of Netcom in less than two years. ICG, a
Denver telecommunications company, bought Netcom in October 1997 to
help it compete against regional phone companies, which offer both
voice and data products.
</P>
<P>
   But in November 1998, ICG said it wanted to sell off Netcom's
dial-up service, which was not part of its ``core
telecommunications business.'' ICG will keep the network backbone
of Netcom.

 City Treasurer Rethinks San Francisco's Business With BofA  &HT;       
 By Edward Epstein 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Bank of America chief executive Hugh McColl comes to San Francisco
next week on a fence-mending trip, and City Treasurer Susan Leal
had some troubling news for him yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sitting down with McColl, she is going to meet
with executives from Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. next week to see if they are
interested in bidding on all or part of the city government's huge
banking business. Almost all that business, which involves millions
of dollars a year in fees, is done with BofA.
</P>
<P>
   Several city officials, including Leal, Mayor Willie Brown and
Supervisors Mark Leno and Michael Yaki, have expressed
dissatisfaction with BofA since it was acquired last year by
NationsBank of Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   They have been troubled by a series of events at the bank, which
now is named BankAmerica but is based in Charlotte. David Coulter,
chief executive of the old BofA, was forced out shortly after the
merger became final, 10 senior female executives at the bank either
left or were demoted, and worries arose over the combined bank's
commitment to community lending in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``My primary goal is to get the best deal for the city and its
money,'' Leal said. She will meet with McColl on Monday, when he
also will sit down with Brown. On Tuesday, McColl meets with Yaki
and Leno.
</P>
<P>
   The city's payroll of about $60 million monthly goes through
BofA, along with the ``concentration account,'' into which tax
receipts and other payments are consolidated, Leal said. In all, a
few billion dollars in city funds pass through the bank annually.
</P>
<P>
   She said the aim of her Wells Fargo meeting is to start finding
out if the bank is interested in bidding on all or some of the city
business. Leal has been talking about putting the city's business
out to bid since she became treasurer last January.
</P>
<P>
   Her goal is to see if the city can save money on banking fees
through competitive bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Wells itself is merging with Norwest Corp. of Minneapolis, but
the combined bank will be based in San Francisco. That is a plus in
City Hall's view.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the first priority is getting the best deal
possible,'' said Leal, ``and then look if someone is a good
corporate citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   If Wells is interested, the city could put its banking business
out to bid. But Leal stressed that only big banks can handle the
city's volume of business and the special demands it makes.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, she said, BofA counts the cash from Municipal
Railway fare boxes and also cashes monthly general-assistance
checks for the 11,000 or so recipients.
</P>
<P>
   BofA spokesman John Keane said, ``We have no fear of being
involved in a competitive opportunity to retain the city's
business. We're very proud of the way we've handled it over many
years and believe we offer an excellent combination of service and
price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city's needs are very complex, and it takes a strong
working relationship to tailor products that meet these needs,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said BofA also has won the right through competitive bidding
to underwrite most of the city's bond issues for several years.
</P>
<P>
   That business led to a lawsuit filed by City Attorney Louise
Renne, which was settled last year. The city said the bank cheated
issuers of municipal bonds. But Keane pointed out that Brown has
praised the bank for saving the city millions of dollars on its
bond issues.
</P>
<P>
   If the business goes out to bid, Leal may ask the banks to do
even more. They may have to sell Muni Fast Passes at all branches
in the city, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he expects the meeting that he and Leal will hold
with McColl on Monday to be tense, at least at the outset, as city
officials outline their grievances against the bank.
</P>
<P>
   He said the only topic of the McColl meeting, for which he has
scheduled an hour, will be ``the maintenance of the Bank of
America's historic activities in San Francisco.''

 E-Shopping Hits Some Rough Spots  &HT;       
 By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Record numbers of shoppers went online this holiday season to avoid
the lines, the crowds and the traffic. But in its biggest test yet,
e-shopping didn't always deliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet Santa didn't get it right his first big year either,''
said Jeff Atlas of San Francisco, who ordered books online twice &UR;  &LR; _
once from Barnesandnoble.com and once from Amazon.com. Each time,
the gifts he purchased were sent to him instead of the intended
recipient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess a blizzard of orders resulted in an avalanche of
problems,'' Atlas said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, most online shoppers enjoyed the convenience of
ordering gifts from home or work. When problems arose, it was
usually because merchants underestimated demand and didn't have
sufficient computing power or fulfillment capabilities. In other
cases, a simple lack of human communication caused
misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline O'Donnell of Pacifica ran into big problems when she
tried to order a hibiscus tree from 1800flowers.com for her
brother's family in Oregon. She placed the order on December 12. In
an e-mail, the company told her the tree could not be delivered on
the date she'd chosen, but would be delivered on the next available
day by Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   When she spoke to her sister-in-law on December 23, no tree had
arrived. So O'Donnell picked up the phone and called 1-800-Flowers.
The company told her it had been waiting for her to confirm the new
Federal Express delivery date _ instructions she said she'd never
received. Her brother finally got the tree in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing business over the Internet is convenient, but it is much
better to actually talk to a person and confirm the orders and
information,'' O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers spent an estimated $3 billion in Web purchases this
holiday season, according to various analysts. That's less than 1
percent of overall retail holiday sales, but it's more than double
last year's spending.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the spending came from first-time Web shoppers. Some
1.25 million customers America Online subscribers made purchases on
the Web for the first time between Thanksgiving and Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Among Internet users polled by Zona Research, more than half had
spent nothing online in 1997. This year, those users and others
spent more than a quarter of their total family holiday budget on
the Web _ an average of $629 each, nearly triple last year's
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows Web shopping at the holidays is broad-based and not
just for kids and geeks any more,'' said Jack Staff, Zona's
director and chief economist.
</P>
<P>
   Not every online merchant was ready for the onslaught.
Heavier-than-expected traffic put several prominent Web stores
temporarily out of business, including those for toy giant Toys R
Us, book retailer Barnes and Noble and consumer electronics
e-tailer 800.com.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Everyone expected significant dollar volume. But some
retailers didn't anticipate their needs surrounding the demand,
whether it was (computing) capacity and technology infrastructure
for their site or the fulfillment capabilities it takes to get the
product there on time,'' said Nicole Vanderbilt, senior analyst in
Jupiter Communications Digital Commerce Group.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites were simply too slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Web, speed is a big part of customer service. The
longer it takes to download pages, the worse your customer
service,'' said Gene Shklar, vice president for marketing at
Keynote Systems, a San Mateo firm that measures site performance
and availability. Even a few seconds delay can be frustrating if a
shopper is trying to get through a site quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Online video retailer Reel.com prepared for the holidays by
buying more than a dozen new servers, the computers that process
much of the data on the site. As a result, the site kept working
and Reel.com was able to ship 99 percent of its orders within 48
hours, said Chris Deyo, president of the Emeryville company.
</P>
<P>
   ``People that are shopping online have different and higher
expectations in terms of turnaround time (than traditional
shoppers). There's a great sense of immediacy,'' Deyo said.
</P>
<P>
   That may explain why online shoppers are easily discouraged when
things go wrong. According to Zona's research, a third of those who
ran into some obstacle, whether it was trouble negotiating the site
or trouble finding the product, simply gave up and didn't buy the
item. A quarter of those who ran into difficulty turned to
bricks-and-mortar stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do much Internet shopping, and some of what I have
done has been frustrating and inefficient,'' said Mary Barlow of
Tiburon. In one case, items she wanted were out of stock. When she
ordered a book from online mall shopping.com, she was sent the book
on tape instead of the print version.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you end up with is something you didn't want and now you
have to go to the post office and pay to return it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Barlow did have good luck with reel.com, finding and ordering a
video _ the 1943 version of ``The Secret Garden'' _ that she
couldn't find anywhere else. ``If all Internet shopping was this
efficient and this reasonable, I'd probably never have to go to a
mall again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Once orders were placed, most Web merchants performed fairly
well, Zona said. One-third of the shoppers polled said merchandise
was delivered within 72 hours, and 80 percent said merchandise was
delivered within a week.
</P>
<P>
   Mail-order goods ship in an average of two days, according to
the Direct Marketing Association. The association did not have
figures for delivery.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``I bought several Christmas gifts online this year: eight
toys, two books, one knickknack, one software program and several
household items,'' said Ron MacKenzie of San Francisco.
``Everything I ordered arrived quite quickly and in good shape. The
items from eToys arrived within three days,'' and this was two
weeks before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite problems, most Web shoppers said they'll keep coming
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how I lived without (Web shopping). To me, the
convenience just about outweighs any shipping costs,'' said
Madeline Moore of Oakland. Moore said she'll keep shopping online
even though an order of books her daughter sent her from Amazon.com
was mixed up. ``They straightened it out beautifully, and I got the
right books in time for Christmas.''

 Macworld Showgoers Hailing New Products  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Apple's new candy-colored iMacs and speedy high-end systems,
unveiled Tuesday at Macworld Expo in San Francisco, could fuel a
resurgence at the Cupertino company, according to consumers and
software developers interviewed at the trade show yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fantastic, to put it mildly,'' said Darren Williams, CEO
of Active Concepts Pty Ltd., a networking software company in
Melbourne, Australia. ``We were seriously considering dropping Mac
development before iMac sales kicked in late last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Showgoers called the new products, including the iMac in five
colors and the redesigned Power Mac G3, among the strongest
offerings from the computer-maker in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They finally learned their lesson and came out with some
products of substance after years of empty announcements,'' said
Jeff Baudin, president of MicroMat, a utility-software company in
Windsor (Sonoma County). ``We were all getting a bit sick of
vaporware announcements,'' said Baudin, who was operating a
life-size replica of Robby the Robot from the TV series ``Lost in
Space'' in his company's booth.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Sutter, a self-described ``installer guy'' for software
distributor MindVision Software of Lincoln, Neb., added ``any
increase in Mac sales makes our lives easier. Until iMac, that
wasn't the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple was emerging from a dreary three-year stretch when it
announced the iMac last spring. The curvy, translucent Internet
computer quickly became a top-selling model, with unit shipments of
800,000 last year, according to PC Data in Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Although the iMac was the single best-selling model in
December, all of Apple's computers currently account for only 5
percent of total PC sales, according to ZD Market Intelligence of
La Jolla (San Diego County).
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, people attending Macworld, which continues at the
Moscone Convention Center through tomorrow, said the addition of
colorful new iMacs as well as a $100 price-cut, to $1,199, should
continue Apple's recent sales momentum in the consumer market. They
also expect the high-margin G3 machines to be popular among graphic
artists.
</P>
<P>
   Many are so confident, in fact, they are willing to bet big on
Apple stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family ran out and bought $9,000 worth of Apple stock''
Tuesday morning, said Roxanne Brown, 24, an Oceanside (San Diego
County) graphic artist wearing a software box on her head. ``It's
about time they put out competitive products for general home
use.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple's shares rose $2.06 on Tuesday to $43.31, but yesterday
they declined $1.56 to $41.75.
</P>
<P>
   Even Apple competitors admit the iMac could provide ``a great
wake-up call'' for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple appeals to simplicity,'' said Paul Otellini, &UR;  &LR; Intel
executive vice president. ``We all need to get away from beige.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every Macworld showgoer was overwhelmed by the colorful
iMacs, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should help the company make money,'' said Tim Van Wagner,
13, of Nevada City (Nevada County). ``The red one is OK. The green
is kinda ugly, though.''

 Las Vegas' Disneyland For Gizmos  &HT;       
 By Carolyn Said 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Most people still haven't taken down their Christmas lights, but
buyers for electronics stores already are starting holiday shopping
for this year.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  About 90,000 buyers will swarm Las Vegas for the Consumer
Electronics Show, a four-day event where about 1,800 exhibitors
will showcase products as diverse as flat-panel TVs that hang on a
wall, car-navigation systems that give verbal directions, and
remotes &UR;  &LR; that let couch potatoes control all their home
electronics.
</P>
<P>
   The event, which opens today, ``is the toy department of the
information age,'' said Jim Barry, a spokesman for the Consumer
Electronics Manufacturers Association, the trade association that
sponsors CES. ``But it's not just toys for big boys and girls _ a
lot of this stuff has a real impact on the way we live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We come to CES to look at all the products and evaluate who
has the newest features and best price points,'' said Jayne
Spiegelman, senior vice president of merchandising and marketing at
Good Guys, a Brisbane chain of 80 electronics stores.
</P>
<P>
   Sprawling over the Las Vegas Convention Center and several
nearby hotels, the show occupies the space of a couple of dozen
football fields and draws mainly buyers from electronics stores
like Circuit City and Good Guys and discounters like Wal-Mart and
Costco.
</P>
<P>
   CES also attracts high-powered Hollywood moguls. At past shows,
``I have literally bumped into people like (former MCA/Universal
Studios chief) Lew Wasserman and (director) Steven Spielberg
walking the floor,'' said CEMA's Barry. ``They're there because
they want to see the products that people are going to buy to watch
the movies they make.''
</P>
<P>
   Attendees endure hype as overblown as the splashiest casino.
``Just like Comdex (the world's largest computer show, also held in
Las Vegas), everybody's competing for your attention, but instead
of booth babes trying to make network-connector products sexy, they
actually have cool products,'' said Kevin Hause, an analyst with
International Data Corp. in Mountain View. ``This is a Disneyland
for people who are into electronics.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, the products are going digital, &UR;  &LR; especially as
computer vendors venture into consumer electronics. ``Some of the
hottest new products were born out of the wizardry and digital
savvy of Silicon Valley,'' said Rick Doherty, director of research
at Envisioneering, a market research organization in Seaford, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   One hot new product category, courtesy of Silicon Valley, is a
digital TV recorder that lets you watch the first part of a show
while you record the rest of it.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you're watching a program and the phone rings,
you can just hit a button to start digitally recording the show,
then return to it where you left off while the device continues
recording the rest of the program _ so you don't have to miss a
moment.
</P>
<P>
   You can even subtly speed up a recorded program so that you can
watch, say, a one-hour show in 55 minutes, with no noticeable
change.
</P>
<P>
   WebTV of Palo Alto, which Microsoft bought for $425 million in
1997, will jump into this market today, sources said, joining
neighbors Replay Network of Palo Alto and TiVo of Sunnyvale. Like
the others, WebTV's recorder is expected to start at $500 when it
ships this spring. (WebTV's main product is a set-top box that lets
you surf the Internet on your television.)
</P>
<P>
   TV is changing in lots of other ways, too.
</P>
<P>
   High-definition TVs, which provide crystal-clear images on wide
screens and CD-quality sound, will be all over the show floor from
manufacturers like Philips, Samsung, Sharp and Sony. At $5,000 or
so, the HDTVs won't be under too many trees this year, but the cost
is expected to decline.
</P>
<P>
   Super-duper HDTV models, costing $20,000 or more, will be
pitched for use in bars and public places _ just where most people
got their first glimpses of TV when it debuted 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   CBS will broadcast the football playoffs this weekend in HDTV,
giving CES showgoers a chance to cluster around display models and
see the picture and sound quality for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a regular TV, you see something white underfoot in a
hockey game _ it could be linoleum,'' Doherty said. ``With an HDTV,
you see that it's ice _ and you see every little particle of ice
being kicked up. The level of realism is stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   Digital video disc players have finally gone mainstream, now
that rows of titles are available at Blockbuster and other video
rental stores. Some of the first DVD players that can also record
movies from a TV broadcast should debut at CES.
</P>
<P>
   Initially wary of technology that let people tape movies off TV,
Hollywood now considers home entertainment ``the best thing that
ever happened to them,'' Barry said. ``Movies at home are three
times as big as movies in theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as technology gets more sophisticated, the way users
control it is getting simpler _ a boon for the millions of people
who still can't program a VCR.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stuff is getting easier to use all the time. New VCRs
program the time automatically, using signals coming in from atomic
clocks,'' Barry said.
</P>
<P>
   To help tie together all those new electronic gadgets, tech
firms will be pushing the concept of home networking. Senior
Microsoft Vice President Craig Mundie will explain how the software
giant hopes to expand from your office to your living room _ with
home networking, new handheld Windows CE devices and ``intelligent
appliances.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco chief executive John Chambers will talk about his San Jose
company's plans to give consumers high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Although show organizers are loathe to acknowledge it, some of
the most bleeding-edge technology may crop up in adult
entertainment. Pornography helped inventions from VCRs to the
Internet take off, and it continues to push the tech envelope with
innovations like live, interactive two-way streaming video over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Adult Video Exhibition, sequestered in the Sands Hotel, will
feature such luminaries as Hustler publisher Larry Flynt, who will
take a break from investigating Republicans' sex lives to promote
Web sex site Vivid Video.

 MP3 Is Well Worth the Hype  &HT;       
 By David Einstein  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; QUESTION: &LR;  I'm hearing a lot about MP3, the technology for
downloading music over the Internet. Is the sound quality really as
good as people say it is? And do I need any special equipment to
play MP3 music?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; ANSWER: &LR;  The sound quality is fabulous. I know this firsthand
because even as I write this column, Pink Floyd is coming through
the wall loud and clear from my son's bedroom, which adjoins my
home office.
</P>
<P>
   MP3, for those who don't know, is a compression technology that
reduces huge digital music files so that they can be downloaded in
minutes rather than hours and stored on a PC without gobbling up an
entire hard drive. (Music takes up lots of space. Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony, for instance, fills up an entire compact disc, which can
hold 650 megabytes!) MP3 opens the door for recording companies to
sell music online. It also has created an instant black market for
pirated music.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need any special equipment other than a computer with
speakers to listen to MP3 music. But you do need a software player.
The most popular one is WinAmp, a $10 shareware program that you
can download at  &LR; www.winamp.com.  &LR; With WinAmp, you can play MP3s on
your PC, either using its own speakers or through your stereo if
it's hooked up to the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Want to listen to downloaded music away from your PC? There are
a couple of ways to do it. The most convenient is with an MP3
player such as the $199 Rio from Diamond Multimedia. Resembling in
size a Walkman cassette player, it stores up to an hour's worth of
music.
</P>
<P>
   Another way is to put MP3 tracks onto an audio CD. To do that,
you'll need a CD-Recorder ($200 and up). You'll also need a program
that can convert MP3 to .WAV files, which then can be burned onto a
CD. A number of such programs are available online, including a
good free program called FlipTech Visual Encoder &AMP; Decoder.
</P>
<P>
   What's in a Name?
</P>
<P>
   Q: I put together a database for my wife consisting of names and
addresses for a volunteer group called the Friends of the Library.
For some reason, the first name of one person, June, won't line up
with the rest of the names in the column. I tried deleting the name
and re-entering it, but it still won't line up. I constructed this
in Microsoft Works on a spreadsheet. Can you help me?
</P>
<P>
   A: The spreadsheet thinks June is a month, not a person.
Reformat the cell containing the name (or the entire column) as
general format. That should solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A Slipped Disc
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have Windows 3.11 installed. I purchased Windows 95 via
mail. It turns out that the CD is labeled ``For distribution only
with a new PC,'' yet the user's manual has a procedure for
upgrading from an earlier version of Windows. When I try to install
the CD, I'm informed that the upgrade can't be done and that I
should obtain the Win 95 upgrade disc. I tried contacting the
vendor with no luck. Any help would be appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   A: The vendor probably is halfway to Argentina by this time.
However, you may be able to salvage the situation by removing
Windows 3.11 from your computer and then using the new disc to
install Windows 95. (I never tried this. You might have to reformat
your hard disk, in which case you'd lose all your data.) Before you
embark on such a drastic course, make sure there's a Certificate of
Authenticity on the cover of the Windows 95 user's manual. Above
the bar code on the certificate, there should be a product ID. If
that corresponds to the ID number of the program itself, you should
be able to install the program. But you won't know until you try,
and by that time, you'll already have deleted Windows 3.11. Am I
giving you a good feeling?
</P>
<P>
   Disappearing Toolbar
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recently, I had to reformat my hard disk, and when I reloaded
Microsoft Office 97, the Office toolbar did not restart. I have
tried reloading Office again, but this did not solve the problem.
How can I get the toolbar back?
</P>
<P>
   A: Try this: Click the Windows Start button, point to Programs,
then to Office Tools and choose Microsoft Office Shortcut Bar. This
should open the toolbar and also give you the option of having it
start each time you start Windows.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Once in a while, a Windows program will freeze. You can't
continue working, and you can't close the program using normal
procedures. But you may be able to close it using what's called a
local reboot. Press the Ctrl, Alt and Delete keys simultaneously to
display the Close Program dialog box. (You may have to hit the
Ctrl-Alt-Del combination several times for this to happen.) Then
click End Task to close the program. You'll probably lose any
unsaved work, but them's the breaks.

U.S. SPIED ON IRAQ, USING U.N. COVER, AMERICAN OFFICIALS SAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. officials said on Wednesday that American spies had worked
undercover on teams of U.N. arms inspectors ferreting out secret
Iraqi weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has long condemned the inspectors as tools of American
intelligence. In October it issued a statement saying it would
never cooperate with U.N. teams riddled with ``American spies and
agents.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said American intelligence agencies provided
information and technology to the commission, which is known as
Unscom. In turn, they said, the United States and other nations
received information on Iraqi weapons programs from the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   By being part of the team, the Americans gained a first-hand
knowledge of the investigation and a protected presence inside
Baghdad,
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence-gathering devices supplied to the inspectors by
Washington gave the United States a better understanding of the
sites for weapons of mass destruction, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has been a unique attempt by the United Nations
to establish an international intelligence-gathering and analysis
operation. Its mission was to uncover Iraqi weapons programs that
continued after the 1991 Persian Gulf war, in which Iraq's
occupation of Kuwait was ended.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists, military officers, diplomats and other professionals
serve on the commission. The United States included some
intelligence officers, using diplomatic cover or other professional
identities, to gather intelligence independently, according to the
officials. Intelligence officers typically perform their cover jobs
and spy in their spare time.
</P>
<P>
   American officials did not say how many American intelligence
officers served on the commission or describe their precise roles.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure that American spies had worked as inspectors came
after The Boston Globe reported on Wednesday that American
intelligence agents had used the team as a cover to spy on
President Saddam Hussein. The Washington Post also reported on
Wednesday that the commission had worked with American spy agencies
to collect intelligence that was used to undermine Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   American officials also said on Wednesday that a former American
U.N. inspector was misinformed when he said the United States had
taken over a U.N. intelligence-gathering operation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said they had no evidence to support such an
accusation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We not only have no convincing evidence of these
allegations,'' said Fred Eckhard, the spokesman for Secretary
General Kofi Annan, ``we have no evidence of any kind.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said: ``Unscom does not have an
indigenous intelligence capability; that was provided by member
states. The information it gathered was used to help break Saddam's
concealment effort, and the information was passed on to United
Nations Security Council members.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Scott Ritter, a former U.S. Marine intelligence
officer, raised the question of whether the inspectors improperly
aided U.S. intelligence in ways that threatened the inspectors'
independence, or opened them up to charges of spying for
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said on Wednesday that Ritter was describing
a secret U.S.-assisted U.N. intelligence program that he did not
fully understand.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter said the inspectors had developed ``methodologies,''
which he refused to describe, that helped them understand how Iraqi
security services concealed arms programs. These security services
and concealment methods were also used to protect Saddam, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter said his inspection team ``had a tremendous success using
these methodologies'' in March. A few weeks later, he said,
American officials approached Richard Butler, an Australian who is
chairman of the U.N. commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``In April, the U.S. went to Butler and wanted to take over a
certain portion of the system of how we track these weapons,'' he
said. ``I wanted to make sure it was only for tracking weapons, but
the U.S. wanted to cut me out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could no longer guarantee that the methodology would be
used'' for weapons inspections alone, and not to benefit U.S.
military and intelligence agencies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Butler will have to convince people that what the U.S. did was
for Unscom,'' said Ritter. ``I think we were given assurances the
information would not be misused,'' he said. But, he added, he
believed that the United States ``used Butler.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they set him up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter resigned in August, saying the United States and the
United Nations had undermined the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   A government official familiar with the dispute said Ritter was
ill-informed because there had been a shift in the commission's
intelligence-gathering methods last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unscom's efforts to collect information have gotten better,''
the official said. ``There was a period when Mr. Ritter was
familiar with these methods. The methods have since gotten better,
but Mr. Ritter wasn't totally witting of what was done.''
</P>
<P>
   And a White House official lashed out at Ritter on Wednesday,
saying his allegations had delivered a pointless propaganda victory
to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said the commission had asked for more advanced
technology after discovering in 1995 the sophisticated lies and
methods of concealment that Iraq had used to hide its weapons
programs and missile projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say this with all the force that I can: We have
never accepted or used any of that assistance for any other
purpose'' than disarming Iraq, Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have we facilitated spying?'' he said. ``Are we spies?
Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler's predecessor, Rolf Ekeus, now Sweden's ambassador to the
United States, said the teams had ``exclusively devoted their
activities in Iraq to identifying Iraq's holdings of weapons of
mass destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ekeus also said no eavesdropping equipment had
been installed by the United States to spy on Saddam or on the
troops who protect him. Butler also denied that any such
eavesdropping took place.
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring the efforts of Iraq's Special Republican Guard and
Special Security Services to conceal clandestine weapons programs
might have led to Iraqi protests that these troops were being spied
on.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors were withdrawn in December, hours before American
and British attacks on Iraq. Saddam has said they will not be
allowed to return unless the special commission is restructured and
Butler is replaced.

PACIFIC-10 AT A GLANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
ARIZONA 
Overview: The Wildcats are replacing three All-Conference players
(Mike Bibby, Michael Dickerson and Miles Simon) and will be
hard-pressed to win their second consecutive league title. Coach
Lute Olson will combine one of the nation's top freshman classes
with the Pacific-10's best center (A.J. Bramlett) and its best
point guard (Jason Terry). 
The pressure's on: Terry, a senior from Seattle. As Arizona's only
experienced perimeter player, he'll be the focus of every defense. 
Player to watch: Freshman forward Michael Wright is the best
rebounder to enter the league in decades. 
Outlook: Because Arizona's fate depends on the freshmen, Wright,
Richard Jefferson and Ruben Douglas, anything can happen. Likely
NCAA bid. 
ARIZONA STATE 
Overview: The Sun Devils have a new coach, Rob Evans, but the same
trio of scorers: junior guard Eddie House and the league's best
forward tandem, seniors Bobby Lazor and Mike Batiste. 
The pressure's on: House has recovered from a jaw broken in
November to become one of the Pac-10's top perimeter threats.
Unlike predecessors Stevin Smith and Jeremy Veal, House plays with
discipline. 
Player to watch: Point guard Alton Mason, a transfer from Barton
County (Neb.) Junior College. His job is simple: get the ball to
House, Lazor and Batiste. 
Outlook: Evans, hired from Mississippi, is the anti-Bill Frieder in
that he preaches half-court defense and a patient attack. The Sun
Devils will improve steadily as Evans' system takes hold and seven
newcomers adjust to Pac-10 play. Probable NIT bid. 
CALIFORNIA 
Overview: The Bears start four seniors and have five of their
top-six scorers back. Their best player is guard Geno Carlisle, a
probable All-Pac-10 pick who has moved from wing guard to the
point. 
The pressure's on: Center Francisco Elson, a 7-footer from the
Netherlands who must rebound, defend and avoid foul trouble. If he
scores, it's a bonus. 
Player to watch: Sophomore forward Sean Lampley. He's athletic,
skilled and a rising star. 
Outlook: In one week, the Bears upset North Carolina, lost at home
to Oregon and narrowly escaped Oregon State. That inconsistency
infuriates coach Ben Braun, one of the league's best tacticians.
Chances are, Braun will get the problems corrected _ and soon.
Likely NCAA bid. 
OREGON 
Overview: The Ducks have a slew of role players, from forwards A.D.
Smith and Flo Hartenstein to transfer guards Alex Scales and Darius
Wright. Ernie Kent is the most underappreciated coach in the
league. There's enough talent for the Ducks to beat a few of the
elite. 
The pressure's on: Wright, a point guard from West Valley (Cal.)
Junior College. He must make the parts play together. 
Player to watch: Freshman guard Freddie Jones, a national-caliber
recruit from Portland. He scored 12 points in his Maples Pavilion
debut. 
Outlook: Looking for a sleeper pick? Try the Ducks. They're well
coached _ Kent is a former Stanford assistant _ and will be tough
to beat at McArthur Court. Their season hinges on winning a few
road games. Probable NIT bid. 
OREGON STATE 
Overview: Coach Eddie Payne could form a pretty good team with
players who have left his program in recent years: Carson
Cunningham, Corey Benjamin, John-Blair Bickerstaff and Ron Grady.
There's not much talent remaining. 
The pressure's on: Sophomore guard Deaundra Tanner, who must score,
pass, rebound and defend for the Beavers to have a respectable
season. 
Player to watch: Sophomore center Jason Heide, the lone frontcourt
scoring threat. He had 15 points Monday night at Cal. 
Outlook: It's grim, as usual. For better or worse, the Beavers
return just one of the top seven scorers from a team that went 3-15
in conference last year. Payne is a good coach in a bad situation.
In November, he signed the best recruit in the state, center Brian
Jackson, but will he be around to coach him? No postseason bid. 
STANFORD 
Overview: The Cardinal has size, experience, coaching and five
starters back from a Final Four team. But the vaunted depth that
separated Stanford from the pack has deteriorated because of
injuries. 
The pressure's on: Senior center Tim Young. Passiveness and a
nagging back injury have slowed his progress. 
Player to watch: Junior wing man David Moseley, who has become the
top backcourt reserve because of injuries to guards Ryan Mendez and
Mike McDonald. 
Outlook: With coach Mike Montgomery, forward Mark Madsen, point
guard Arthur Lee and shooter Kris Weems, Stanford is in a class by
itself. It's the only team capable of winning seven or eight road
games. Guaranteed NCAA bid. 
UCLA 
Overview: These Bruins play harder than any UCLA team since the
championship gang of '95. However, they have suspect defensive
fundamentals and a spotty half-court offense, which means they must
play with maximum effort to defeat the league's elite. 
The pressure's on: Sophomore guard Baron Davis. How's the knee?
How's the jumper? His teammates _ and NBA scouts _ will be watching
closely. 
Player to watch: Sophomore Ryan Bailey. Sure, he's a reserve who
rarely scores. But he was Penn State's starting point guard in
1997. His experience and savvy will be essential to UCLA's success
on the Pac-10 road. 
Outlook: When your top 10 players are freshmen and sophomores,
anything's possible. Bruins could go 12-6 in league play, or they
could finish 8-10. The most realistic goal: win seven at home, four
on the road, finish with 19 or 20 victories, and win a game in the
NCAAs. Make the Sweet 16, and it's been a great year. Likely NCAA
bid. 
USC 
Overview: Will the Trojans pick up where they left off at the end
of last season, when they swept the Arizona schools? There's enough
talent and coaching to compete for a postseason bid, although a
weak nonconference schedule won't help their power rating. 
The pressure's on: Junior forward Jarvis Turner. Brian Scalabrine
can't do it alone on the frontcourt, and Trojans don't want to
depend on freshman Sam Clancy. 
Player to watch: Sophomore guard Jeff Trepagnier, one of the
league's best athletes, who's steadily improving his skills and
adds size to the Trojans' otherwise tiny backcourt. 
Outlook: Coach Henry Bibby has raised the bar, and the Trojans must
respond to his challenge if they hope to join the Pac-10's first
division. They should win six or seven home games, but their
postseason fate depends on road performance. Is this the year they
finally beat UCLA? Probable NIT bid. 
WASHINGTON 
Overview: The Huskies have been the biggest disappointment in the
league so far, with losses to Boise State, Gonzaga and Washington
State. A rough early schedule and Donald Watts' sprained ankle _ he
missed a month _ contributed to the defeats. 
The pressure's on: Watts, a senior guard from Seattle. He has NBA
blood (son of Slick) and NBA ability, but he hasn't become the
dominant perimeter scorer Washington needs to challenge for second
place. 
Player to watch: Junior guard Deon Luton, a superb athlete and
dangerous shooter who has been inconsistent so far. 
Outlook: Not as bright as it was two months ago. If someone emerges
at point guard, and if Watts and Luton score consistently, the
Huskies will turn it around. If not, it may be the longest season
of coach Bob Bender's career. Possible NCAA bid. 
WASHINGTON STATE 
Overview: When the Cougars opened with a loss at Alaska-Fairbanks,
they appeared to be headed for a horrific season. But Sunday's
victory against Washington showed they may be competitive after
all. Four of their top five scorers return (All-Leaguer Carlos
Daniel has departed) but not even Cougars fans can name them. 
The pressure's on: Senior forward Kojo Mensah-Bonsu, who has a
great name and decent game. He's the Cougars' best chance to break
down defenses. 
Player to watch: Junior Jan-Michael Thomas, a sharpshooting guard
from San Joaquin (Calif.) Delta College whose jumper beat
Washington at the buzzer. 
Outlook: Coach Kevin Eastman is a solid teacher who hasn't
recruited well. The Cougars will win a few at home, if only because
no one is motivated to play there. But on the road, they're in big
trouble. No postseason bid.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ Play ball!
<TEXT>
<P>
   That was the prevailing mood after the National Basketball
Players Association and the NBA finally worked out a new
collective-bargaining agreement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which is expected to be approved today by the
league at its Board of Governors meeting, will have players in camp
Jan. 18. The first games of what will be a 52-game schedule will be
played in the first week of February.
</P>
<P>
   The players had flown to New York for a vote on whether to back
the union negotiating committee's recommendation that the owners'
previous proposal be turned down.
</P>
<P>
   But after union executive director Billy Hunter and NBA
commissioner David Stern hammered out the framework for an
agreement during a 12-hour negotiating session that ended at 6 a.m.
New York time, the players found themselves voting on the final
agreement instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the owners' offer) is much better than it was before,''
said the Rockets' Hakeem Olajuwon. ``We know that this is the
maximum we can get from the owners. The deal speaks for itself. It
is a good deal. It is a fair deal. Everybody is happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means that this could be the first time anybody is happy
since the lockout began July 1. The negotiations had been hard,
even acrimonious at times, which may lead to lingering bad feelings
over the next couple of months from players who lost nearly half a
season's salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, there's going to be (hard feelings),'' said Houston
free agent Charles Barkley. ``But we have to realize that we're in
this thing together. There has always been an adversarial
relationship between owners and players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes (there is going to be lingering animosity), but that's
business. But once you sign a deal, it's a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Rocket Kevin Willis, now with Toronto, was one of a
handful of players who criticized the union. But Willis feels the
partnership between the league and the players will quickly be
re-established.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it will, no question,'' Willis said. ``It's over with now.
It's time to play ball. We have to stick together and make good
things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The players ``sacrificed'' the high-end players, limiting how
much they can get paid. But what they received in return, a higher
percentage of revenues for salary and more salary-cap exceptions
for middle-class free agents, more than made up for such an
important concession.
</P>
<P>
   ``The percentages are a lot better, and there are more
exceptions there for the middle class,'' said Atlanta's Tyrone
Corbin, a member of the union's executive committee. ``The minus
that we have to accept is that we had to give up the guys at the
top. They have limits on the amounts that they can make, but we
have some things in there that will guarantee that the money will
come back down to the middle-class guys. So I think that's the
biggest thing. That and the fact that we worked it out together.''
</P>
<P>
   Jayson Williams, a free agent who was expecting to cash in after
making the All-Star team last season, said he doesn't mind that he
will be directly impacted by the high-end limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I lost a lot of money on my contract,'' Williams said.
``But, hey, how much money does one person need? That's what it all
comes down to.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players were openly wondering why it took so long for
Hunter and Stern to sit down and work together to reach an
agreement, but Olajuwon waved off such questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this could have been achieved (earlier),'' he
said. ``It took all this (negotiation) from both sides, the give
and take, to get to this point. I think both parties are satisfied
and happy because they know it's a good deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's give and take. You have to give in some areas, and you
have to take in others. They work together, and that's the only way
you can have a good deal, when both parties are satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   And both parties are definitely satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy it's over,'' Barkley said. ``I'm just happy it's
over. I just care about the game. It's been frustrating not being
able to play. It's all about give and take, but we reached a deal
and that's all that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gugliotta, another prominent free agent, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has a sense of relief,'' Gugliotta said. ``We've
salvaged the season, and now we can get back to work, start
rebuilding the fans' trust and go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is the best thing about a very busy Wednesday for the
players and the owners _ that everyone will be able to play ball.
Well, maybe the second-best thing, Barkley noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the best thing about all this?'' he said. ``That it's
signed, that's what.''

PRESSURE ON HUNTER BROUGHT AGREEMENT CLOSER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Repeating for all needing.) 
(JT) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For six months, the members of the National
Basketball Players Association were as unified as a chorus as they
followed the lead of union executive director Billy Hunter and
president Patrick Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   But the pressure began to mount, and the moment of truth was
upon them as David Stern, commissioner of the National Basketball
Association, issued the owners' final proposal this week and urged
the players to vote or else face the cancellation of the season
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the pressure, the voices of unity began to crack and a
groundswell of opposition toward the union's 19-man negotiating
team started to take shape. Suddenly, Hunters' invitation to the
league's 430 players to join in solidarity and vote the owners'
proposal down Wednesday looked like an invitation for an uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Star players like Shaquille O'Neal of the Los Angeles Lakers and
Hakeem Olajuwon of the Houston Rockets were on their way here to
voice their opposition to the union leadership. Over 30 players had
called Isaiah Thomas, a former union leader, and asked him to part
the stalemate and take control of negotiations. All-Stars including
Jayson Williams of the New Jersey Nets were adamant about getting a
deal done and not calling Stern's bluff. And many other players,
like Miami's Keith Askins and Toronto's Kevin Willis, were adamant
about voicing their approval of the owners' final deal.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's union was splintering before his eyes. Preventing what
could have been the downfall of the union's leadership and chaos
among players, Hunter met with Stern through the night and reached
an agreement to save the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end, the players took control of their own destiny,''
said Thomas, who did not fly to New York Wednesday upon learning an
agreement was being put in place. ``Enough blood had been shed.
There wasn't a revolt but there was the potential for one.''
</P>
<P>
   Players and agents grew anxious as the league's deadline to
cancel the season approached. On Dec. 29, the union's negotiating
committee _ which had been given the authority to approve or
disapprove the owners' proposal _ rejected what Stern said was the
owners' final proposal and refused to put it before their
membership for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   As a tense week passed, several players spoke out and pleaded
for a chance to vote. When Hunter relented on Tuesday, and invited
every NBA player to town in order to vote to reaffirm the
negotiating committee's stance, the union was confident they had
the support of their membership. In a 24-hour period, that
confidence eroded.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys were fed up, and that's why a lot of guys came
and were going to give their opinions,'' Charles Oakley said.
``They were going to do that rather than scrapping the whole
season. Billy and them heard a lot of feedback from a lot of the
guys coming to town. And a lot of guys weren't coming to vote no to
the owners.''

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ When last we left the Lakers, they were
wounded and red-faced, swept out of the Western Conference finals,
so distraught they shipped out their All-Star point guard in
exchange for a rookie and a question mark.
</P>
<P>
   That was six months and 196 shopping days ago, a week before the
NBA lockout slammed shut the door on all action on and off the
court.
</P>
<P>
   When that door reopens, the Lakers will resume the search for a
power forward, perhaps another point guard, then make a run for the
championship in what should be the start of the NBA's post-Jordan
era.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the nagging little details.
</P>
<P>
   Like where to hold training camp, and when. There are media
guides and pocket schedules to publish. Heck, there isn't even a
schedule to put on paper yet.

Monday, training camps !ital!might!off! open Jan. 18, and the
season !ital!might!off! start Feb. 1 or 2.
</P>
<P>
   But dates aren't firm, NBA teams are still under gag order, the
ink isn't dry yet on the new labor agreement and there is much,
much work to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously in scramble mode today,'' said Lakers
spokesman John Black, and he could have been speaking for every
team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers hope to hold training camp later this month in Palm
Desert, but may have to settle for Santa Barbara or San Diego or
even Inglewood.
</P>
<P>
   By this time next week, executives Jerry West and Mitch Kupchak
and coach Del Harris will be ungagged by the league and start
addressing the questions. Here's where the team stands today:
</P>
<P>
   _Nine players are under contract, and there are three rookies to
be signed, so there is little room for free-agent pickups. But the
Lakers have the advantage of continuity when play resumes.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite end are teams like the Phoenix Suns, who have
only three players under contract.
</P>
<P>
   _The Lakers' core remains in Shaquille O'Neal, Eddie Jones,
Robert Horry and Kobe Bryant. Point guard Derek Fisher replaces
All-Star Nick Van Exel, who on draft day was traded to Denver for
rookie point guard Tyronn Lue and second-year forward Tony Battie.
</P>
<P>
   _The reshuffling that began with the Van Exel trade will
continue. Almost certain is a trade of center/forward Elden
Campbell in exchange for a power forward and/or a veteran point
guard.
</P>
<P>
   _Three Lakers from last season are free agents _ Jon Barry,
Mario Bennett and Rick Fox. Only Fox is a possibility to return,
but it's a longshot.
</P>
<P>
   Fox wants a long-term deal in the $5 million-a-year range, and
the Lakers remain well over the new, $30 million salary cap. Their
best hope is to clear cap space via trades, but more than likely
Fox will leave, probably signing with Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   _Three rookies will be brought to training camp, but only Lue is
a lock to make the team. The others are shooting guard Sam Jacobson
and small forward Ruben Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, who played a partial season in Greece before injuring
his left elbow, is back in the States and reportedly healthy. He's
a possible replacement for Fox.

MICROSOFT PRESSES ITS VIEW ABOUT RIVALS' 3-WAY DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In its antitrust trial Wednesday, Microsoft Corp.
made its most concerted effort yet to convince a federal judge that
the recently announced deal that brings together three of its
rivals _ America Online Inc., Netscape Communications Corp. and Sun
Microsystems Inc. _ seriously weakens the government's case.
</P>
<P>
   In a three-way deal announced in late November, America Online
agreed to buy Netscape for $4.2 billion and made a side agreement
to buy and jointly develop technology with Sun.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who will decide the
outcome of this nonjury trial, expressed the view that the deal
``might be a very significant change in the playing field as far as
this industry is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   During Wednesday's cross-examination of the government's last
witness, Franklin Fisher, an economist, Microsoft's legal team
presented as evidence comments made by executives of the three
companies who characterized the deal as sure to strengthen their
competitive muscle in software used to browse the World Wide Web,
in electronic commerce and in Internet technology _ all areas of
head-to-head competition with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft lawyer, Michael Lacovara, repeatedly tried to get
Fisher to concede that the triumvirate of rivals with ambitious
plans for the future did indeed pose a genuine threat to
Microsoft's dominance in the personal computer software business.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Fisher would give an inch or two, saying, for example,
that moves planned by the three companies were a ``hopeful sign''
that they might some day be a counterweight to Microsoft. But each
time he was challenged, Fisher returned to his view that Microsoft
has a monopoly in the personal computer operating system market
with its Windows family of products and that it has illegally used
its market power to defend that monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of this,'' Fisher replied at one point, ``affects my
conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacovara prodded Fisher repeatedly to admit that the emerging
technology championed by the group _ the combination of Sun's Java
software, an Internet programming language, and Netscape's Web
browser _ could pose a serious challenge to Microsoft in the long
run. Fisher allowed that it was difficult to predict what might
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Yet any such challenge will not come soon, he said, adding, ``I
don't think it will happen at all if Microsoft is permitted to go
on as it has.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft insists that the America Online-Netscape-Sun deal
fundamentally changes the competitive landscape and undermines a
linchpin claim in the government's case: that Microsoft has a
resilient monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal was the shot heard around the world, in the
industry, by the public and in this courthouse,'' said William H.
Neukom, the Microsoft senior vice president for law and corporate
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Jackson gave another signal that he is weighing the
impact of the three-company deal on the case. He interrupted the
cross-examination of Fisher to directly ask his opinion about a
column Wednesday morning on the Op-Ed page of The Washington Post
by David Ignatius, based largely on an interview with American
Online chairman Stephen Case.
</P>
<P>
   In it, Ignatius quoted Case as saying that the deal is not
intended to mount a challenge to Microsoft's mainstay, the Windows
operating system, which controls the basic operations of more than
90 percent of personal computers sold today. ``AOL's merger with
Netscape has no bearing on the Microsoft case, as nothing we're
doing is competitive with Windows,'' Case was quoted as saying.
``We have no flight of fancy that we can dent in any way, shape or
form what is a monopoly in the operating system business.''
</P>
<P>
   After reading the quotations, Jackson asked Fisher if he agreed
with that view of the deal. ``I certainly do,'' Fisher replied.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson then asked lawyers for both Microsoft and the Justice
Department whether they planned to call Case as a witness. Another
America Online executive, David Colburn, has already appeared as a
witness for the government. Case is not on the 12-person witness
lists for either side, but he could be called as one of the two
additional witnesses allowed to each side after Microsoft presents
its defense, which is expected to begin early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Both Microsoft and the government told the judge that they would
wait until Microsoft had presented its defense, expected to last
six to eight weeks, before naming their two so-called redirect
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Later, on the courthouse steps, David Boies, the lead trial
lawyer for the Justice Department, made no commitment, but he said
Case would be a ``useful witness'' for the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very knowledgeable,'' Boies said, ``and Microsoft is
pinning a lot of hopes on the effect of that merger.''

CLINTON TO PLEDGE $7 BILLION FOR MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Pa.)  (rl) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sixteen years after President Ronald Reagan
envisioned a ``Star Wars'' program to protect the United States
from ballistic missile attacks, President Clinton plans to pledge
about $7 billion over six years to build a limited missile defense
system, even though he will leave a final decision on whether to
build it until later, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is not expected to decide whether _ and how _ to build a
system until the summer of 2000. And at this point, no one has
proved that such a system will work.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials said the decision to set aside money in the
Pentagon's budget now was meant to underscore the administration's
political commitment to the idea and to head off growing criticism
from Republicans in Congress that Clinton was not doing enough to
defend the nation from a missile strike.
</P>
<P>
   Since Reagan unveiled his dream of creating an impenetrable
shield against nuclear missiles in 1983, the nation has spent $55
billion trying to develop a workable weapon _ so far to no avail.
But never before has any money been put in the budget actually to
build one.
</P>
<P>
   The money, which officials put at roughly $7 billion, is part of
the more than $100 billion in new spending Clinton is expected to
propose giving the Pentagon between now and 2005 when he submits
his budget to Congress next month.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and Pentagon declined to discuss the spending
proposal Wednesday, but the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
Gen. Henry Shelton, signaled the administration's intent at an
appearance before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton said the Pentagon had the resources to continue to
develop the program. The administration is ``also putting money
into the program so that at the time that we have the technology,
if in fact the threat justifies it, then we could go ahead with the
fielding,'' he said when questioned about Clinton's commitment to a
missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   The system now being developed and tested is a mere shadow of
the space-based network of satellites and lasers that Reagan
envisioned to knock out even the largest Soviet nuclear strike. The
Pentagon officially abandoned that concept in 1993 and has since
concentrated on using ground- or sea-based missiles to intercept
perhaps a few missiles launched either accidentally from a
superpower like Russia or deliberately by a hostile nation like
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a pledge of money, the effort remains burdened with
economic, technological, political and diplomatic problems.
</P>
<P>
   The system faces a pivotal test in June. The program's
developers, led by the Boeing Co., plan to launch a dummy missile
from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and try to destroy it
in space over the Pacific Ocean with an interceptor missile fired
from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Three more tests are scheduled before Clinton makes a decision
next year. Previous tests of interceptor missiles have failed, as
have tests of shorter-range missiles, like those in the troubled
Theater High-Altitude Area Defense program, or Thaad, run by the
Army. But officials at the Pentagon express confidence that a
limited system may at last be technologically at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who work in the program are very confident we're
going to have a working system, and we're going to have it soon,''
Lt. Col. Richard Lehner, spokesman for the National Missile Defense
Program, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress have long wanted to revive at least part
of Reagan's original vision. Faced with legislation mandating the
creation of a national system, Clinton promised to proceed with
research for three years and decide in 2000 on whether the threat
justified building a system by 2003, a policy referred to a ``three
plus three.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said the White House and Pentagon had concluded that the
threat from intercontinental missiles from hostile nations was
growing, noting North Korea's test of a three-staged missile on
Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., one of the strongest proponents of a
national missile defense, said he would welcome a decision to put
money in the budget. But Weldon said he remained skeptical about
the president's motives and vowed to press again for legislation to
build a system as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Many arms control advocates argue that a system _ if someday
workable _ would violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty signed
by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1972, which sharply
limited the number, type and placement of missiles that could be
used to counter enemy missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics argue that the effort squanders resources that
could better be spent trying to keep terrorists or hostile nations
from ever acquiring the technology to develop weapons in the first
place. And even within the Pentagon, there are those who argue that
the real threat of nuclear attack against the United States is a
terrorist armed with a warhead in a car or truck, not a
nuclear-tipped missile fired from thousands of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does not seem to be a wise and balanced approach to U.S.
defense needs,'' said Spurgeon Keeny Jr., president of the Arms
Control Association in Washington.

(ATTN: Conn., Texas, Mass., Germany, Brazil)  A ROBUST START OF '99
DAZZLES STOCK INVESTORS (Eds: SUBS 9th graf, Evidence of ..., to
ADD that Japanese markets down this week.) 
By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 
 
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nothing but up. So said stock markets around the
world Wednesday, wowing investors with one-day gains of better than
2 percent and in some markets, more than 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only three days old, 1999 already looks like a banner year for
equities. The Dow Jones industrial average has risen 3.96 percent.
The Nasdaq composite index, which gained just under 40 percent last
year is up 5.84 percent. Germany's benchmark DAX index has risen
8.28 percent, and the Bovespa index of Brazil, which was beaten
down in 1998, has leapt 7.97 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All the major U.S. stock gauges _ the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, the
Nasdaq composite index and the Dow industrials _ are trading at
their highs. The Dow closed Wednesday at 9,544.97, up 1.8 percent
from its former peak of 9,374.27 on Nov. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Driving this euphoria is a conviction among investors that
gloomy economic predictions have been overstated. ``It's a show-me
market,'' said John L. Manley Jr., senior equity strategist at
Salomon Smith Barney. ``Investors are saying, `We've been waiting
for this recession for so long now and it hasn't materialized.' Now
they're saying `Prove to me we're going into a recession or I'm
going to buy stocks.'''
</P>
<P>
   Early January jumps in stocks are not unusual. In 1988,
according to Birinyi Associates, a money management firm in
Greenwich, Conn., stocks rose 3.9 percent in the first day of
trading. In the first two days of 1987, stocks began the year up
3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that stock prices often rise in January is the
tendency among investors to change where they put their retirement
accounts when they open a new calendar. Although most can make
changes in their accounts any time, investors often decide to
switch investments with the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   The most common change is to shift more money into whatever
performed best during the previous year. It is likely then that
investors moving money around now are doing two things.
</P>
<P>
   First, they are probably increasing their holdings in technology
stocks, which dominate the Nasdaq Composite, and have given the
biggest boost to that index. Second, they are likely shifting money
from funds that have lagged behind the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 _ more
than 90 percent of actively managed funds underperformed their
benchmarks last year _ into those like the Vanguard 500 that mirror
this index.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of these changes can be found in the disparity early
this year in the performance of big company stocks, the small
company stocks in the Russell 2000 index. While the Dow Jones and
the S&AMP;P 500 have both blown through their former all-time highs,
the Russell 2000 is still 7.7 percent below its peak of last July.
The small-stock index is up only 1.4 percent in 1999. Although
Wednesday's advance in big company stocks was fairly broad, it did
not lift all boats. For every two stocks that gained, one declined.
IBM, for example, fell slightly. Japanese markets are down so far
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors contributed to the broad market rally. The
Commerce Department reported that sales of new homes rose in
November to a record high, indicating that the economy is strong
and demand for appliance, furniture and other consumer goods to
fill these houses will continue to be robust.
</P>
<P>
   Another lift came from oil prices, which rose more than 3
percent following the news that oil inventories in the United
States had taken their biggest decline idd n 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Higher oil prices, while a pain in the neck for consumers, are
a positive for developing countries,'' said Jack Shaughnessy, chief
investment strategist at Advest Inc., in Boston. ``Anything that
tends to ease their financial stress is good for world markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The freefall in commodity prices, a sign of slow or negative
growth around the world, seems to have been stopped, leading some
investors to conclude that the worst of global economic turmoil is
behind us. The Commodity Research Bureau's index, which stood at
187 on Dec. 15, closed Wednesday at 197.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CRB was the last thing hanging out there that indicated a
problem in world economic growth,'' said James Paulsen, chief
investment office at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. But
firming commodity prices will also help U.S. corporations, Paulsen
argues, by allowing them to increase their prices and bolster their
profit margins. Companies have found it difficult to raise prices
in recent years, which has slowed earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   Because corporate earnings felt the pinch of Asia's economic
woes in the first quarter of 1998, investors also suspect the first
quarter of this year will look good in comparison. For investors
who still care about old-fashioned things like earnings growth,
improvements from a year earlier usually translate into higher
stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   As stocks ran away Wednesday, some market strategists speculated
that the overall market had been infected by the fever that has
Internet stocks sizzling.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning? When investors are willing to pay 80 times
revenues for Amazon.com or 366 times sales for Ebay Inc., why not
push Microsoft shares to 64 times estimated earnings? That lofty
level seems cheap in comparison, even though it is three times the
historical market average.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks and bonds also benefitted Wednesday by a sharp rise in
the dollar against the Euro. That currency, in its first days of
trading, fell from 1.1720 against the dollar at the close of
trading in Europe to 1.1568. Traders said that when Euro traders in
Europe went home, a lot of the support for the currency
disappeared. When trading shifted to New York, the market started
to dip and found little support. With the dollar rising, the
Treasury market bounced as well, and bonds closed at their highs
for the day. The move in the dollar also gave a kick to stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest propellant for stocks so far this year is the
explosive growth in the supply of money in the United States, a
factor that has contributed to higher stock prices for months.
Money supply is growing at an annualized rate of 11 percent, far
above what's needed to finance the growth in the nation's gross
domestic product. An enormous amount of the excess money is finding
its way into the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   This makes for an interesting dilemma for the Federal Reserve
Board, points out Ned Riley, chief investment officer of
BankBoston. ``The Fed has resurrected the irrational exuberance it
was trying to temper earlier,'' he said. ``The creation of all this
money and lower interest rates have tended to fuel more
speculation.'' The next meeting of the Fed's policy-making
committee, in February, ``is going to draw a lot of attention to
this speculative frothy market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost nobody thinks the federal bank will change its stance on
interest rates, which is toward lower rates, not higher. As long as
the bank isn't going to step in and spoil the party by raising
rates, stocks will likely remain on a power trip.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many professional investors were puzzled by Wednesday's
move in stocks. Frederick E. Rowe Jr., head of Greenbrier Partners,
a money management firm in Dallas, echoed the views of many big
investors when he said: ``I don't pretend to understand it, but I
don't want to get in the way of it.''

 By   KEITH BRADSHER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Last month was the best for auto sales since December
1986, lifting the industry's sales for 1998 to the highest level in
a dozen years despite a nearly eight-week strike last summer from
which the General Motors Corp. has not fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
   With the last auto makers reporting their results Wednesday, the
industry's sales in the United States rose 7.1 percent last month
from December 1997. For the year, a total of 15.55 million cars,
sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans were sold, a 2.8
percent increase from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, sales soared when the impending expiration of certain
tax provisions for auto loans produced a race to dealerships late
in the year. By contrast, auto executives at the North American
International Auto Show here offered several reasons for the sales
surge last month, which followed brisk sales throughout the autumn.
</P>
<P>
   The explanations included the popularity of sport utility
vehicles and other light trucks, for which sales rose 10.5 percent
last month, as well as high consumer confidence, rising disposable
incomes and car prices flat or edging down.
</P>
<P>
   But even while citing these factors, executives seemed a little
surprised by how vigorous their business has been. ``The market is
stronger out there than anyone anticipated,'' said Robert J. Eaton,
co-chairman of DaimlerChrysler A.G., adding that the company might
raise its forecast of industry sales this year, from 15.2 million
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   While DaimlerChrysler, the Ford Motor Company, Toyota, Honda and
even struggling Nissan all posted big gains last month, GM reported
a gain of only 3.1 percent as its market share fell to 30.2 percent
from 31.3 percent a year earlier. GM sales for the entire year
tumbled 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Top GM executives at the auto show acknowledged that the
company, the world's largest auto maker, had not recovered from the
strike, which cost it close to $12 billion in lost production.
During the strike the company took a hard line that was based
partly on an assessment that sales could not maintain the brisk
pace of last spring. The continued strength of sales has left the
company's factories unable to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still short of product, there's no doubt about that, but
that gap is beginning to close,'' said John F. Smith Jr., GM's
chairman and chief executive. Roy Roberts, the group vice president
for North American sales and marketing, said that GM dealerships
now have 84 percent of their optimal inventories, barely up from 81
percent at the start of December.
</P>
<P>
   A few pockets of strength showed in GM's figures Wednesday. The
company's GMC division, which sells premium light trucks such as
the GMC Yukon full-size sport utility vehicle, posted a sixth
consecutive year of record sales last year as the industry's
overall sales of light trucks rose 8.1 percent and car sales fell
1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   GM's Saturn division, which plans to introduce a midsize car
next summer but remains stuck in the shrinking market for small
cars, managed to eke out a surprising 6.4 percent increase. Mark
Hogan, the company's vice president for small cars, said the
division's showrooms had been busier since Thanksgiving, when it
introduced a car that looks like a traditional two-door vehicle but
has a small third door that folds open on the driver's side to make
it easier to load groceries or briefcases into the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan warned that the severe weather of last week, particularly
in the Middle West, might reduce the number of people visiting
dealerships. But Eaton predicted that the robust sales in November
and December would spill over into January. Industry sales in
December were calculated at a torrid seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 17.3 million vehicles, according to Ward's Auto Info Bank,
a data service.
</P>
<P>
   Ford reported on Tuesday that its sales climbed last month by
1.2 percent, as a 6.4 percent gain in light-truck sales more than
offset a 4.3 percent drop in car sales.

<P>
   Jacques Neuville, a forger for the French Resistance in World
War II who became a San Francisco department store executive, died
on Dec. 29 at his home in Sausalito, Calif. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Neuville was awarded the Croix de Guerre for his wartime service
in the anti-Nazi underground in Lyons and Paris. He had been born
and reared in Berlin as Gunther Neustadt, the child of a well-to-do
Jewish family in the clothing trade. As the Nazis took control of
Germany, he was sent by his family to Paris, where he studied
painting.
</P>
<P>
   There, as war drew closer, he found himself in an increasingly
precarious position as both a German national in France and a Jew.
He adopted a French version of his surname, changed Gunther to
Jacques and volunteered to serve in the French army. In 1940, he
was with an artillery unit north of Lyons that was overwhelmed by
German forces.
</P>
<P>
   Neuville made his way to a Resistance unit in Lyons and was put
to work forging the ration cards, passports, marriage and birth
certificates that were used to construct false identities. As he
later told his family, he was betrayed to the Gestapo by a woman
who had occasion to go through his trouser pockets one night and
found many ration cards.
</P>
<P>
   He was in prison for six weeks until a sympathetic French guard
left doors open, allowing Neuville and other prisoners to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking sanctuary, he knocked at random on the window of an
apartment belonging to a woman named Jeanne Lilaze, who took him
in. Late in 1940 he made his way to Paris where he worked with an
underground unit until the city's liberation.
</P>
<P>
   There his contribution to the Resistance involved working as a
street and cafe artist, drawing and painting portraits. He would
find his customers among German officers, engage them in
conversation and pass on what he learned to the Resistance.
</P>
<P>
   He received the Croix de Guerre in 1946 and later received a
citation from the United States for the information he had
forwarded on the location of allied pilots captured by the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the war, he learned that his mother had been sent
to Auschwitz and that all of his family, except for a sister, who
was a doctor in San Francisco, had been killed. Neuville returned
to Lyons and married Christianne Lilaze, the daughter of the woman
who had given him refuge. He worked as a translator and assistant
in the Paris bureau of The New York Times and helped in the
coverage of the Nuremburg trials.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1952, he went to San Francisco with his wife and began a
marketing career. He eventually became the merchandising manager at
Macy's in San Francisco, where he helped to develop a marketing
concept called Macy's Fifth Floor, in which disparate items like
china, luggage and stationery were displayed together. He retired
in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the war ended, Neuville began a campaign to obtain
payment on a life insurance policy his mother had taken out before
the war with the Swiss company La Baloise. For four decades he
pushed his claim as a matter not of compensation but of honor, with
the company insisting that it could not honor the claim without a
death certificate. But last year, as Neuville's health was failing
and as Swiss financial institutions were facing class-action suits
over their handling of the property of Holocaust victims, the
company settled the claim for $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters,
Charlotte Neuville of New York and Madeline Bohrer of Salzburg,
Austria, and four grandchildren.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, said
Wednesday night that the Senate was getting ``closer and closer''
to a plan for an impeachment trial of President Clinton that could
last as long as six weeks, and end with an actual vote on the two
articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   His guardedly optimistic remarks about a possible agreement on a
plan, announced Wednesday on the Senate floor, just hours after the
106th Congress convened, appeared to put an end to any hopes by
Democrats and the White House for a bipartisan compromise plan that
might have avoided a full trial.
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, Lott had conceded to senators that the emerging
plan for the first impeachment trial of a president in 130 years
would be one ``that neither the House nor the White House will just
necessarily think is wonderful but will give all parties a fair
chance to make the case and get to a conclusion that's an equitable
one.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist set to swear in
senators for the trial on Thursday, the two parties remained split
over whether to allow witnesses to testify in the trial of Clinton
on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. House Republicans
want to call such key witnesses as Monica Lewinsky and perhaps
Vernon Jordan, a Clinton confidante and Washington lawyer, but
Democrats have adamantly opposed calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Lott did not say how the volatile issue of witnesses would be
handled, calling that question ``one of the critical points.''
Other lawmakers said the Senate might control the calling of
witnesses by taking a vote on whether to allow each one.
</P>
<P>
   ``All sides of this Rubik's cube have been talked about,' Lott
said Wednesday evening. ``We hope to have this all resolved
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was not clear Wednesday that Democrats would agree
with whatever plan emerged. Ranit Schmelzer, the spokeswoman for
Sen. Tom Daschle, the minority leader, said Wednesday night that
there was ``no deal and no agreement on witnesses. Our position
continues to be, no witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott was also careful not to suggest he had yet found the magic
formula. ``I don't think it's safe to assume anything right now,''
he told reporters, ``so don't be trying to read my body English or
anything else. Nothing is written in stone.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides declined to respond to Lott's brief
announcement of a possibly lengthier trial, saying that they still
did not know what procedures the Senate would adopt. ``I'm not
going to try to decipher the meaning of that,'' said Joseph
Lockhart, the White House spokesman. ``We will await an
announcement of what their process is before commenting further.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the Capitol in the House, lawmakers elected a new,
little-known speaker, Rep. Dennis Hastert, 57, who appealed for the
House to put aside the deep divisions that had engulfed it late
last year in the final days of its impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert was turned to by shocked Republicans after Newt Gingrich
stepped down under fire and their next choice, Bob Livingston,
abruptly resigned over revelations that he had had extra-marital
affairs. Livingston had toppled Gingrich just one month earlier,
capitalizing on anger that Republicans had lost five House seats in
a midterm election seen as a mandate against impeachment. The
election left them opening the new session Wednesday with a 10-seat
majority, one of the smallest House majorities this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Solutions to problems cannot be found in a pool of
bitterness,'' Hastert said, delivering his first speech as speaker
from the well of the House chamber instead of the imposing
speaker's platform. ``In the turbulent days behind us, debate on
the merits often gave way to personal attacks,'' he said. ``Some
here have felt slighted, insulted or ignored. That is wrong, and
that will change.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader, called on the new
Congress to ``put to rest finally the poisonous politics that has
infected this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the impeachment of the president dominated a day that is
usually devoted to celebration and hopeful talk of legislative
goals and new party agendas. At times the confluence of events
almost seemed bizarre. At one point in the morning, Lott left a
Republican conference that was heatedly debating the trial of
Clinton to receive a quick greeting from Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Looking tanned, Gore heartily called out New Year's greetings to
reporters waiting word of how impeachment would proceed. As the
presiding officer in the Senate, Gore then swore in the 34 senators
elected or re-elected in 1998.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after noon, Lott and Daschle also placed a quick phone
call to Clinton to tell him the new session had convened, with Lott
making pleasantries about college football.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of a new tone, the House plunged almost
immediately back into the impeachment issue, because of the
requirement that the new Congress reappoint the 13 Republicans that
the 105th Congress selected to prosecute the president in the
Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, the head of the House impeachment team, in a
futile effort to head off the debate, called the measure a ``simple
straightforward housekeeping resolution'' and said it was
``incidental to impeachment.'' He said his group planned to
prosecute the case ``as expeditiously and fairly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the Democrats who had fought against impeachment
from the House Judiciary Committee appealed to the new members of
the House not to cast one of their first votes to facilitate the
trial of the president. Rep. John Conyers Jr., the ranking Democrat
on the committee, said the House had carried out a partisan
impeachment ``totally lacking in credibility and overwhelmingly
rejected by the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``Today we have a final opportunity to put this
salacious activity behind us. If we reject the motion to reappoint
managers we will send a signal that we are prepared to move from
the politics of personal destruction.'' But the managers were
reappointed 223-198 on a near party-line vote, with the same five
Democrats who had supported Clinton's impeachment voting with the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate side of the Capitol, senators searched for a way
to reach a bipartisan plan for a trial that would overcome the
differences between the conservatives' push for witnesses and the
Democrats' opposition to them.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde told Lott in a meeting Wednesday morning that House
prosecutors want to call five to eight witnesses and take two weeks
to make their case against Clinton, Republican senators said. Ms.
Lewinsky, as well as Clinton's secretary Betty Currie, and Jordan
were likely to be on the witness list, congressional officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that any witness list that we put together
will include the name of Monica Lewinsky,'' Rep. George Gekas,
R-Penn., one of the House managers, said on CNN. ``But the extent
of what testimony we would elicit from her, that has not been fully
decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans said they wanted to back their colleagues in
the House. ``I would prefer not to have witnesses,'' said Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas. ``But if the House believes they have to have a few
witnesses to make their case, I'm not going to support some
political deal that denies them the ability to make their case.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Democrats took a firm stand against hearing from the
cast of characters who have become familiar to the nation.
Assessing Democratic sentiment, Daschle, the minority leader, said,
``I think it is fair to say that there is universal, unanimous
opposition to witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has refused to speculate on how much time it
might demand to prepare should the Senate permit the House managers
to call witnesses. But Democratic senators who have consulted
closely with the White House have suggested that calling just one
witness could lead the president's lawyers to call others and to
demand to review more documents in order to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Clinton have repeatedly complained that the House
Judiciary Committee and Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel,
had access to information the White House has not seen. The White
House is likely to demand to review that information in order to
cross-examine witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans spent hours locked away in an ornate floor off the
Senate chamber trying to find a middle ground. Wednesday night they
emerged optimistic. ``It's gelled,'' said Sen. Olympia Snowe,
R-Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said Republicans wanted an actual vote on articles of
impeachment and not simply the test votes that had been contained
in an earlier compromise proposal for a highly expedited trial. And
in contrast to that plan's one-week timetable, he said that both
the House and White House could end up getting several weeks each
to present their cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that takes you to January the 30th or February the 12th,
that's not as important as that you get these things achieved,'' he
said. ``I think everybody agrees to that. Everybody would like to
have it done in a speedy fashion, but only so speedy that it
doesn't cause people to feel like it's being shoved or that they
haven't had a chance to make their case.''
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan group of senators continued to try to hammer out a
plan in Lott's third-floor hideaway of the Capitol Wednesday night,
negotiating with Hyde and a three other House Republicans. Lott
described the session as a kind of pre-trial conference. The key
negotiators are Sens. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, Carl Levin
of Michigan, Joseph Biden of Delaware, all of them Democrats; and
Ted Stevens of Alaska, Pete Domenici of New Mexico and Fred
Thompson of Tennessee for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   A team of White House representatives, among them White House
counsel Charles Ruff and special counsel Gregory Craig, met by
invitation with some of the members of the bipartisan group who
have talked with the House managers who will prosecute the case.
</P>
<P>
   The senators hope to identify areas of evidence that both the
House and White House lawyers would stipulate to, to speed the
trial along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a lot has occurred between the House and the White House,
as we understand it, on that,'' Lott said, ``We're hoping that we
can facilitate that.Obviously, it would be best if we could get a
broad stipulation out of the gate.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how the negotiations progress, the first impeachment
trial of the president is to begin Thursday morning when Hyde and
the 12 other House managers are invited into the Senate chamber at
10 a.m. There they will read the articles of impeachment charging
Clinton with perjury and obstruction of justice. Then the Senate
will notify the chief justice that it is ready to proceed.

BELL ATLANTIC SEEKS TO SHOW ITS SYSTEM IS OPEN TO RIVALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Texas) 
(af)  
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trying to show that its network is open to competitors, the Bell
Atlantic Corp. intends to announce Thursday that it has developed a
system that would allow its New York customers to change local
phone companies almost as easily as they switch long-distance
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Backing up that claim will be Allegiance Telecom Inc., a new
local phone company based in Dallas, executives close to the
announcement said Wednesday. Allegiance will certify that the new
system, which it developed with Bell Atlantic, cuts the time
necessary for a consumer to switch local phone providers from as
many as six weeks to one, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic is sure to hold up the new system as evidence that
its local network is open to potential competitors, the main test
that any Bell must pass before winning entry to the lucrative
long-distance market. No Bell has passed yet.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, switching local phone companies has been arduous
if not impossible. Even in areas where the Bells face competition,
the new phone company must sometimes fax an order to switch a
customer to the Bell's offices, where it is then entered manually
into an antiquated computer system.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic and Allegiance intend to announce that they have
automated that process, allowing Bell Atlantic's computers to
communicate directly with Allegiance's.
</P>
<P>
   Having Allegiance alongside will increase Bell Atlantic's
credibility in touting the new system. Royce J. Holland,
Allegiance's chairman, was formerly president of the MFS
Communications Co., one of the first companies to broadly take on
the Bells in the local market.

CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR VOWS TO REIN IN STATE SPENDING
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ John Grosvenor Rowland showed two political
faces as he was inaugurated Wednesday for a second term as governor
of Connecticut, calling for civility and moderation in government
even as he vowed to rein in state spending despite the economic
boom.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, a Republican who at 41 is the nation's youngest
governor, used his inaugural address to project the moderate,
inclusive air that he has urged his national party to adopt. Then,
he strolled across the Capitol to a joint session of the General
Assembly and delivered a State of the State address stressing the
conservative touchstones that characterized most of his first term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we've had some great economic times,'' he told the
legislators, several of whom wore corsages and boutonnieres for the
big day. ``But that is no reason for us to return to the days of
big spending and tax increases. Our greatest challenge, over the
next four years, will be to continue to control the cost and the
growth of state government.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that his budget would not grow much over last year's
and that the rise was likely to be less than the inflation rate,
now about 2 percent. That would leave little room for new programs
proposed by legislators as they contemplated a budget surplus of as
much as $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lean government, free of excess programs, excessive rules
and regulations, helps us keep our budget in balance,'' the
governor said. ``It helps us provide tax relief. It helps us create
economic opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   He called on Connecticut to ``resist the politics of personal
destruction that has paralyzed our federal government,'' and
offered instead a ``politics of results.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When legitimate differences over policy descend into bitter
partisanship, the result is inaction, gridlock and the failure of
leadership,'' he said. ``The winner in such a power struggle wins
control of a government that is powerless to do any public good.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's message Wednesday was softer than his first
inaugural address, in which he warned against ``the notion that the
state government is the fountain of endless favors.'' Wednesday, he
emphasized the more moderate themes that helped him easily win
re-election in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we look forward to the next century, our responsibility is
to redefine the role of state government,'' he said. ``Policies of
inclusion must be practiced at every level of government.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
With time running out, the NBA owners and players combined for a
buzzer-beater Wednesday, ending the 191-day lockout. Here's a look
at how it happened and what comes next:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What finally brought the sides together?
</P>
<P>
   A. When players began to gather in New York on Tuesday, a group
led by the Rockets' Hakeem Olajuwon and the Lakers' Shaquille
O'Neal pressured union leader Billy Hunter to try to hammer out a
deal with NBA commissioner David Stern. By about 6 p.m., Hunter and
Stern had agreed to meet.
</P>
<P>
   Stern did a series of televised interviews in which he said if
the players moved enough toward the owners' final proposal, he
would try to persuade the owners to move toward the players. After
several hours of meetings between just Stern and Hunter, attorneys
and other league and union leaders were brought in. An agreement
was reached by about 6 a.m. New York time.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Who blinked?
</P>
<P>
   A. Hunter made the call, but both sides came off their
insistence they had gone as far as they could.
</P>
<P>
   The owners gave the players additional concessions on salary-cap
exceptions, allowing an extra annual exception to the cap for
players signed as free agents. They also increased the salaries
allowed for new contracts and the amount of raises available to
free agents who jump teams from 7.5 percent to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The union backed off its fight for the highest-paid players and
against some of the rules it had argued would limit player
movement. And the union agreed to five-year rookie contracts, with
the team holding the option on the fourth year and right of first
refusal on the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The union agreed to make payments back to owners from an escrow
account if player salaries reach 55 percent of revenues in the
fourth, fifth and sixth years of the agreement. The owners accepted
the union proposal that the escrow payments would not be triggered
in the seventh year until salaries reach 57 percent _ if the owners
exercise the option on the agreement that season.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why did the settlement take so long?
</P>
<P>
   A. Egos. Stubbornness. Politics. Posturing. And given how far
apart philosophically the sides were when the lockout began in
July, each was bound to test the mettle of the other. But most of
all, until both sides stared into the abyss of a lost season and
the long-term damage it would cause, they were not ready to
compromise enough.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Who won?
</P>
<P>
   A. Nobody. And everybody. Neither side could say it defeated the
other. The owners failed to get a deal with a hard cap and no
``Bird exceptions'' as they originally sought. The players accepted
a limit on salaries and additional limits on player movement. And
both sides will likely feel the wrath of fans left in lockout limbo
for six months.
</P>
<P>
   But if the deal creates a stronger league by giving more teams a
chance to compete for players, the owners will own franchises in a
financially sound industry, and the players will have more teams
able to vie for their services. And because the high-end contracts
can go only so high, more of the money can be spread to the
league's ``middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides will live with a system with more player freedom than
football but without the small-market/large-market problems of
baseball and hockey. And if the owners exercise their option for
the deal's final season, neither side will have to go through this
again for seven more years.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What kind of season will there be?
</P>
<P>
   A. Plans will be finalized to put in a 52-game schedule, likely
with teams playing only conference opponents. The revised schedule
would begin between Feb. 2 and Feb. 7, likely the latter date. The
playoffs would begin about two weeks later than usual, in May, and
could extend into July.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will the fans come back?
</P>
<P>
   A. Polls show obvious bitterness. But the track record of other
sports' work stoppages seems to indicate that eventually fans do
return. Baseball fans seem to have held a grudge longest, and the
NBA had better not count on the basketball equivalent of a
season-long Sammy Sosa-Mark McGwire home-run duel. But baseball
lost a World Series. The NBA lost 30 early-season games and an
All-Star Game. A 52-game season might be just enough for the season
to be considered credible and for the postseason to produce a
legitimate champion.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, the anger of many fans will likely be seen at
the gate.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What happens to season tickets?
</P>
<P>
   A. Teams will continue to refund the cost of tickets for games
not played, plus 6 percent. Other tickets will be used for the
revised schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How will the deal affect the Rockets?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are more than 200 free agents out there, and no one has
fewer signed players than the Rockets. The compromise included
changes that would allow the Rockets to pay a free agent, if not
quite as much as his previous team, enough for a contract to be
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Who will play for the Rockets?
</P>
<P>
   A. No team in contention to land Suns forward Antonio McDyess,
including Phoenix, thinks as highly of him as do the Rockets. No
team is more determined to build around him to chase a championship
now and in the future. The Rockets will not be allowed to pay him
as much as the Suns, but they can come close enough to lure him to
Houston. They want Charles Barkley back but must move quickly on
him because he will count $6.6 million against the cap until he
signs or is renounced.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets also want Othella Harrington back, but he might need
to play the field to determine a price tag. It seems unlikely that
both Brent Price and Matt Maloney would be back. Price is under
contract, but coach Rudy Tomjanovich has given minutes the past two
seasons to Maloney. Matt Bullard could return. Mario Elie is
unlikely to be back. In addition to the four signed players _
Olajuwon, Rodrick Rhodes, Roy Rogers and Price _ this year's four
draftees _ Michael Dickerson, Bryce Drew, Mirsad Turkcan and
Cuttino Mobley _ will all likely make the roster. An additional
player willing to sign under the free-agent exception is a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will Michael Jordan retire?
</P>
<P>
   A. He always said he would if Phil Jackson was not back as the
Chicago Bulls' coach. He also said after last season he wouldn't
``go through this again.'' And Barkley has repeatedly said his
friend was ready to give it up.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan has also made references to having to study the deal
and the future of the Bulls. The agreement provides a grandfather
exception to the salary cap and the other parameters for signing
free agents, permitting the Bulls to pay him 105 percent of last
season's $33.14 million salary. Still, he has the chance to go out
on top and is likely to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will the networks add more TV games to make up for lost time?
</P>
<P>
   A: First, let's assess the damage so far. By the time the season
begins, NBC will have lost five game dates and nine broadcasts plus
the All-Star Game from its 18-date, 32-game schedule. Turner Sports
will have lost 50 of its 80 game dates on TNT and TBS.
</P>
<P>
   NBC probably will stick with its current schedule of game
windows _ two Saturday games in April, two tripleheaders, six
doubleheaders and two single games on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Saturdays in March are booked for the PGA Tour, and Saturday
regular-season games usually aren't great shakes in the Nielsen
ratings anyway. So NBC's only extra games are likely to be in the
two or so weeks that will be added to the end of the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   As for Turner Sports, its regular schedule includes Monday-night
games on TBS and a Tuesday doubleheader and Friday single game on
TNT. It's not out of the question that a fifth game each week could
be added to make up for some of Turner's lost game dates.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about Rockets broadcasts?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Rockets are among the few teams in the league that
televise every game, and fans have become accustomed to that. So
you can be assured that Fox Sports Southwest and KHTV (Channel 39)
will work with the team in every way possible to get each of the
remaining games on the tube.
</P>
<P>
   As for radio, the Rockets finally will make their debut on KPRC
(950 AM).

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THERE was the mighty reach to the sky in the last seconds and the
fingertip block of John Starks' jumper that saved Game 6 against
the Knicks and the Rockets' first championship.
</P>
<P>
   There was the dramatic tip-in basket at the final tick of the
clock in overtime that concluded the Game 1 comeback and started
the back-to-back sweep of the 1995 NBA Finals in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   So many years and so many incredible efforts. Curling through
the lane for a jump hook. Spinning like a 7-foot top along the
baseline for another unstoppable fadeaway. Doing everything,
anything, whatever it takes.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, he is out front, the lead horse pulling the wagon. But
for what might have been the biggest, strongest, boldest, most
far-reaching play of his entire career, Hakeem Olajuwon worked
behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Saving the NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the jubilation and the back-slapping by both sides of
self-centered, headline-grabbing leadership in recognition of the
end of the labor war, know this: Without Hakeem, basketball this
year might have been only a dream.
</P>
<P>
   Call it Clutch City goes to the bargaining table. Or at least to
the New York offices of union negotiator Billy Hunter for a
polite-but-firm pronouncement that it was time to stop posturing,
put away hidden agendas and reach an agreement with the owners
before both sides burned down the mansion.
</P>
<P>
   It was a handful of players, tired of the politics and the
finger-pointing, who let Hunter know that a failure to strike a
deal with NBA commissioner David Stern could produce severe
consequences, possibly even legal action.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a vote by the union Wednesday and a possible shutdown
decision by the owners today, a group consisting of Shaquille
O'Neal and his agent, Leonard Armato; Sam Mitchell and his agent,
Mike Curry; Jayson Williams; and Olajuwon cajoled, prodded and
eventually got Hunter to telephone Stern to arrange the 11th-hour
meeting that lasted all of Tuesday night and eventually resulted in
the new contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a wonderful feeling to have everything settled and be
able to get back to basketball,'' Olajuwon said from a hotel suite
in Manhattan. ``This new agreement is for the betterment of the
league, in the interest of both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the season had been canceled, it would have done tremendous
damage to the game, and it may have taken a long time to recover,
if ever. I believe that it was important to have some kind of
season, and it was getting late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not want to be here. I had to be pushed to get involved.
This is not about me.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is about him and all that he has become over the course
of a glorious 15-year career _ All-Star, Most Valuable Player, a
two-time champion and, most important at this critical juncture, a
respected figure, a keeper of the flame.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon had to be pushed by some of the union members who felt
their best interests were not being represented by Hunter and the
David Falk-Patrick Ewing-Michael Jordan cabal that was spending so
much time flexing its muscles like oiled-up bodybuilders. There
were members of the union who wanted to have their voices heard and
who needed someone with the on- and off-court stature of Olajuwon
to deliver the message.
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem and Shaq, giants both literally and in image, represented
the present and future of the NBA. But while O'Neal carries
financial clout as a multimedia personality and unprecedented
physical strength, even he needed the thoughtful, statesmanlike
aura of Olajuwon to carry the banner of reason and compromise.
Olajuwon is nothing like the majority of NBA players in terms of
cultural and religious background, and yet their respect for him is
nearly universal.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's raw, uncanny abilities are held in awe by his peers.
Olajuwon's all-around character is regarded with admiration.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it was time for his tact, his sense of ethics, to cut
through the bombast. He had sat back long enough, trusting others
to be reasonable men who could find common ground. But now the
clock was ticking down, and it was his time. Time to make a play.
So he came onto the scene like a steel hammer inside a velvet
sheath and pounded away at the concept of compromise. He had been
offended at the personal attacks in some of the previous talks, at
the profane language, the rancor and the bitterness. He was all
business, no showy emotion. There was a plan for him to address the
full union membership _ with O'Neal and Williams at his side _ if
that had been necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon is a man of few words. But when he speaks, people
usually listen. Hunter understood. Today, we have a season.
</P>
<P>
   Another slam dunk, Hakeem.

ANALYSIS: PATAKI SETS COURSE DOWN FAMILIAR PATH
</HEADLINE>
  (See also EDIT-PATAKI) 
 (DW) 
 By   CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Rather than seeing his convincing re-election
victory as a mandate for daring new initiatives, Gov. George Pataki
seemed determined Wednesday to give New Yorkers more of what so
many of them liked the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   He could have used his annual address to the Legislature to try
and set his second term apart from his first. He could have made
bold promises and electric commitments. But the governor instead
hewed to his longstanding priorities: curbing state spending,
cutting taxes and toughening the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've laid a solid foundation on which to build,'' he said in
a speech so narrowly focused that it at times sounded repetitious.
</P>
<P>
   His stance had some of the Capitol cognoscenti griping about an
uninspiring performance and neglected opportunities. But Pataki
believes that with a disciplined agenda, he will preserve the
successes of his first term, allowing him to cement his legacy in
New York and giving him a platform to broaden his reputation
nationally, his advisers say.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the speech showed how much he has staked his
political future on a handful of landmark changes that he has
wrought in New York as the first Republican governor in a
generation. It suggested that Pataki feels that if these policies
are imperiled, then so is he.
</P>
<P>
   ``In four years, we have cut taxes and created a stronger
economy by suppressing government's built-in tendency to grow and
spend,'' he said, calling for a ``continued commitment to fiscal
prudence.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who fancies himself a student of Albany,
recognizes that successes here can be short-lived. Democratic
lawmakers tried to block most of his first-term accomplishments,
particularly his effort to impose more fiscal restraint. They
largely failed, but would no doubt like to scale back some of
governor's big-ticket items, like a big income tax cut and stiffer
criminal sentences. Even Republicans in the Legislature have not
always been the governor's most reliable backers.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's two centerpiece fiscal proposals Wednesday _ to
squirrel away the state's surplus of about $2 billion, and to
require a two-thirds majority of the Legislature to approve tax
increases _ seem intended to thwart any legislative attempt to
undermine his fiscal record.
</P>
<P>
   If the state spent the surplus, and then the economy slumped,
the governor might have to choose between steep, unpopular spending
cuts or repealing his beloved tax cuts _ a damaging fate that
befell his predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining his fiscal record, and therefore succeeding with his
new proposals, could have an important impact on the governor's
future; if he decides to run for national office in 2000, his
handling of the state budget would be important evidence of his
Republican bona fides.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a succession of initiatives that he can
dutifully herald,'' said Sen. Stephen M. Saland, a Republican from
Poughkeepsie, who, like many of the governor's allies, was eager to
talk about Pataki's future outside of the state. ``Certainly, I
believe that he was talking to a national audience.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor is expected to use these achievements to try to
fend off attacks from more conservative national Republicans over
his support for abortion rights and other moderate positions on
social issues. Pataki's advisers contend that the way to succeed
nationally is to get across the message that the party will
flourish by concentrating on such fundamental issues as tax cuts or
welfare _ and avoiding contentious social matters.
</P>
<P>
   Who better to lead that charge than Pataki, who tamed the
liberal Empire State?
</P>
<P>
   Some of the advisers also think that it would be foolish to
interpret the governor's landslide in November as a signal that the
public wants him to venture into new areas. People voted for
Pataki, these advisers contend, because they are pleased with his
record on crime, welfare and taxes, and to divert from this path
will only disappoint them.
</P>
<P>
   The risk is that New Yorkers will chafe at the governor's
reluctance to take on other issues, and some Democrats on Wednesday
repeatedly brought up matters that they thought he had ignored in
his speech. Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried of Manhattan, chairman
of the Assembly Health Committee, reeled off a list of major
health-care matters that Pataki did not mention, from the problem
of people without health insurance to regulation of HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you listened to his speech, you would think that the issues
didn't exist, let alone any plan to solve them,'' Gottfried said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Pataki will tackle many matters in the coming months
that he did not discuss Wednesday. Governors typically use their
addresses to the Legislature to establish themes for their dealings
with lawmakers, not to present lists of proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Democrats criticized the governor's vision. ``He missed
a golden opportunity to reach out and talk about areas that need
job development in the city of New York and which really did not
support him last time,'' said Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, from the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   But by doing it his way, Pataki sought to insure that the battle
between lawmakers and the governor _ an annual event _ would be
fought on his terms, not theirs.

NBA TO START 52-GAME SEASON FEB. 2
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After an 11th-hour negotiation session, NBA players
union Executive Director Billy Hunter and Commissioner David Stern
reached an early morning deal on a collective bargaining agreement
yesterday to end the 191-day lockout and save the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of an unprecedented loss of the season, players will
report Jan. 18 for an abbreviated training camp. After a frenzied
free-agent period when 200 players will sign contracts, the
National Basketball Association will begin a 52-game regular season
Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a joke all along,'' Mavericks forward Chris Anstey
said. ``A lot of us never understood what we were fighting for in
the first place. Now we can quit talking and sitting and start
playing. I'm glad we came to our senses. It's a great day.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the National Basketball Players Association voted
179-5 to ratify the six-year agreement reached by Hunter and Stern
about 5 a.m. CST. Owners, who were within 29 hours of a vote on
canceling the season, are expected to give a slam-dunk ratification
to the deal at the NBA Board of Governors meeting this morning.
Mavericks owner Ross Perot Jr. and club President Terdema Ussery
will represent Dallas at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't love it, but we'll deal with it,'' said Minnesota
Timberwolves All-Star Tom Gugliotta, who is a free agent. ``I'm
sure both sides are saying that. But after the dust clears, we'll
all make plenty of money doing what we love. And that's the bottom
line, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   After six months of contentious negotiations on how to fairly
divide the league's annual $2 billion revenue, NBA teams lost about
30 games each of revenue and players lost more than $500 million in
salaries. Hunter, desperate after calling all players to New York
for a vote on the owners' ``final'' offer on Monday, called Stern
after the commissioner's appearance on ``Larry King Live'' on
Tuesday night. The two began talking at 8:30 p.m. CST, were joined
by Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik about midnight and reached a
deal just before sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, it just seemed like it was time to talk, just
the two of us,'' Hunter said. ``The clock was ticking and the
timing was right. We both had a sense of urgency, and I think we
both blinked for the good of the league.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Stern and the owners won the longest and most
damaging lockout in league history.
</P>
<P>
   Although players will again start receiving paychecks and
remain, on average, the highest-paid athletes in the world, their
last-minute cave-in cost them. The biggest chip for owners is an
individual player salary cap, allowing players with six years'
experience or less to earn a salary of $9 million; from 7-9 years,
$11 million; and 10-plus years, $14 million. It is the first such
cap in American professional sports history and provides a stark
contrast to the old system, which allowed Chicago Bulls star
Michael Jordan to make $33 million last season.
</P>
<P>
   Players also compromised their once-hardened positions on rookie
wage scales (up from three to five years) and on percentage of
revenue committed to salaries in the last three years of the deal
(down from 57 percent to 55 percent). In exchange, the players won
battles via minimum salary increases and salary-cap exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't clear who the five dissenters were in the vote, but
20-year-old phenom Kobe Bryant of the Lakers _ one of the players
talented and popular enough to demand $30 million a year _ stormed
out of the meeting 30 minutes before the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no winners,'' Seattle SuperSonics center Jim
McIlvaine said. ``Only degrees of losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Players, most wearing blue ``Solid'' buttons, took a secret
ballot on paper, then greeted Stern and Hunter about 3:15 p.m. on
the 25th floor of the GM building across from Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very calm and focused,'' former Mavericks player Dennis
Scott said. ``Then it was like `Whew!' _ big relief when Billy read
the totals and we were sure we were going to start playing again.
What almost happened was pretty damn scary if you want to know the
truth. We almost killed 52 years of progress just like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem facing players now is fan support. Apathetic toward
the lockout since midsummer, 50,000 fans responded to an ESPN
Internet poll yesterday by indicating 55 percent were ``not
interested'' in the resumption of the season, while only 11 percent
were ``excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim O'Connor, 24, of Fort Worth expressed a degree of enthusiasm
for the NBA as he talked about the lockout in between pickup
basketball games at the Fort Worth YMCA yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy ... I'll still watch them ... The \Rlockout\S really
didn't change my opinion,'' said O'Connor, a former Houston Rockets
season-ticket holder who recently moved from Houston to Fort Worth.
``I don't know if you can say they are greedy, but it's awfully
difficult to understand how people can't get together to decide how
to divide up $4 billion or whatever the amount is.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Gette said he considered himself a fan until the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season's over with,'' said Gette, 52, of Arlington. ``As
far as I'm concerned, they've ruined it.''
</P>
<P>
   It took Major League Baseball four years and a historic home-run
chase to earn fans back after canceling the 1994 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get out and apologize to the parking lot
attendant and the guy who sells nachos,'' New Jersey Nets forward
Jayson Williams said. ``We've got to say `We're sorry' and mean it
sincerely. The fans did nothing to deserve this. Maybe we need a
fan appreciation day where we all sign autographs all day or maybe
I'll call the owners and have them lower ticket prices. Something
to get things back to the way they used to be.''

MICHEL PETRUCCIANI, JAZZ PIANIST, IS DEAD AT 36 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: France, Italy)   By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michel Petrucciani, a French jazz pianist and
composer with an international following whose keyboard virtuosity
earned him comparisons to Art Tatum and Bill Evans, died Wednesday
at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. He was 36 and lived in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a pulmonary infection, said a representative of
his French record company, Francis Dreyfus Music.
</P>
<P>
   Petrucciani was a national hero in France, and his records were
best sellers in Europe. French President Jacques Chirac was among
the many who paid tribute to him Wednesday, praising his ability to
``renew jazz, giving himself up to his art with passion, courage
and musical genius.'' He called him an ``example for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The career of Petrucciani, who was considered one of the great
romantics of the jazz piano, flourished in spite of a severe
physical disability. The pianist was born with osteogenesis
imperfecta, also known as ``glass bones,'' a disease that stunted
his growth (he was only three feet tall and weighed barely 50
pounds) and weakened his bones. Petrucciani had to be carried onto
the stage, and he used a special attachment to work the sustaining
pedal of the piano.
</P>
<P>
   The ailment didn't affect his hands, however, and he played with
a seemingly inexhaustible vigor and enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Petrucciani was born to Italian parents in Montpellier, France.
His family was musical, and as a child he played the drums in a
band with his father, Tony, a guitarist, and his brother Louis, a
bassist. After studying classical music for eight years, he turned
to jazz full time because he loved to improvise and wanted to write
his own music.
</P>
<P>
   He began his professional career when he was 15, playing for the
drummer and vibraphonist Kenny Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to Paris, he recorded his first album at 17, and he was
appearing regularly at European jazz festivals while still a
teen-ager. After a visit to New York he toured France in a duo with
the saxophonist Lee Konitz, with whom he recorded an album of
duets.
</P>
<P>
   While in California in 1981, Petrucciani was discovered by the
saxophonist Charles Lloyd, who made him a member of his quartet.
They toured Europe and recorded an album, ``Montreux '82.'' One of
his most acclaimed early recordings, ``100 Hearts'' (Concord), was
an album of solos.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1986 and 1994, he made seven albums for Blue Note
Records, including ``Power of Three'' (with Wayne Shorter and Jim
Hall), and an acclaimed album of original songs, ``Michel Plays
Petrucciani'' (Blue Note).
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 he was made a knight of the Legion of Honor in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   For all the comparisons to Bill Evans, Petrucciani had found his
own style, which was more aggressive, fuller and sunnier than that
of his idol and incorporated secondary influences as disparate as
McCoy Tyner and Debussy.
</P>
<P>
   A marriage to Gilda Butta, a pianist, ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his companion, Isabelle, his publicist said,
and by a son, Alexandre, and a stepson, Rachid Roperch, both of
Paris, from a previous relationship.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, he was hoping to set up an
international jazz school in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my life's work,'' he said. ``Jazz is dying out.''

NBA TO START 52-GAME SEASON FEB. 2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After an 11th-hour negotiation session, NBA players
union Executive Director Billy Hunter and Commissioner David Stern
reached an early morning deal on a collective bargaining agreement
yesterday to end the 191-day lockout and save the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of an unprecedented loss of the season, players will
report Jan. 18 for an abbreviated training camp. After a frenzied
free-agent period when 200 players will sign contracts, the
National Basketball Association will begin a 52-game regular season
Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a joke all along,'' Mavericks forward Chris Anstey
said. ``A lot of us never understood what we were fighting for in
the first place. Now we can quit talking and sitting and start
playing. I'm glad we came to our senses. It's a great day.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the National Basketball Players Association voted
179-5 to ratify the six-year agreement reached by Hunter and Stern
about 5 a.m. CST. Owners, who were within 29 hours of a vote on
canceling the season, are expected to give a slam-dunk ratification
to the deal at the NBA Board of Governors meeting this morning.
Mavericks owner Ross Perot Jr. and club President Terdema Ussery
will represent Dallas at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't love it, but we'll deal with it,'' said Minnesota
Timberwolves All-Star Tom Gugliotta, who is a free agent. ``I'm
sure both sides are saying that. But after the dust clears, we'll
all make plenty of money doing what we love. And that's the bottom
line, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   After six months of contentious negotiations on how to fairly
divide the league's annual $2 billion revenue, NBA teams lost about
30 games each of revenue and players lost more than $500 million in
salaries. Hunter, desperate after calling all players to New York
for a vote on the owners' ``final'' offer on Monday, called Stern
after the commissioner's appearance on ``Larry King Live'' on
Tuesday night. The two began talking at 8:30 p.m. CST, were joined
by Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik about midnight and reached a
deal just before sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, it just seemed like it was time to talk, just
the two of us,'' Hunter said. ``The clock was ticking and the
timing was right. We both had a sense of urgency, and I think we
both blinked for the good of the league.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Stern and the owners won the longest and most
damaging lockout in league history.
</P>
<P>
   Although players will again start receiving paychecks and
remain, on average, the highest-paid athletes in the world, their
last-minute cave-in cost them. The biggest chip for owners is an
individual player salary cap, allowing players with six years'
experience or less to earn a salary of $9 million; from 7-9 years,
$11 million; and 10-plus years, $14 million. It is the first such
cap in American professional sports history and provides a stark
contrast to the old system, which allowed Chicago Bulls star
Michael Jordan to make $33 million last season.
</P>
<P>
   Players also compromised their once-hardened positions on rookie
wage scales (up from three to five years) and on percentage of
revenue committed to salaries in the last three years of the deal
(down from 57 percent to 55 percent). In exchange, the players won
battles via minimum salary increases and salary-cap exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't clear who the five dissenters were in the vote, but
20-year-old phenom Kobe Bryant of the Lakers _ one of the players
talented and popular enough to demand $30 million a year _ stormed
out of the meeting 30 minutes before the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no winners,'' Seattle SuperSonics center Jim
McIlvaine said. ``Only degrees of losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Players, most wearing blue ``Solid'' buttons, took a secret
ballot on paper, then greeted Stern and Hunter about 3:15 p.m. on
the 25th floor of the GM building across from Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very calm and focused,'' former Mavericks player Dennis
Scott said. ``Then it was like `Whew!' _ big relief when Billy read
the totals and we were sure we were going to start playing again.
What almost happened was pretty damn scary if you want to know the
truth. We almost killed 52 years of progress just like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem facing players now is fan support. Apathetic toward
the lockout since midsummer, 50,000 fans responded to an ESPN
Internet poll yesterday by indicating 55 percent were ``not
interested'' in the resumption of the season, while only 11 percent
were ``excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim O'Connor, 24, of Fort Worth expressed a degree of enthusiasm
for the NBA as he talked about the lockout in between pickup
basketball games at the Fort Worth YMCA yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy ... I'll still watch them ... The \Rlockout\S really
didn't change my opinion,'' said O'Connor, a former Houston Rockets
season-ticket holder who recently moved from Houston to Fort Worth.
``I don't know if you can say they are greedy, but it's awfully
difficult to understand how people can't get together to decide how
to divide up $4 billion or whatever the amount is.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Gette said he considered himself a fan until the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season's over with,'' said Gette, 52, of Arlington. ``As
far as I'm concerned, they've ruined it.''
</P>
<P>
   It took Major League Baseball four years and a historic home-run
chase to earn fans back after canceling the 1994 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get out and apologize to the parking lot
attendant and the guy who sells nachos,'' New Jersey Nets forward
Jayson Williams said. ``We've got to say `We're sorry' and mean it
sincerely. The fans did nothing to deserve this. Maybe we need a
fan appreciation day where we all sign autographs all day or maybe
I'll call the owners and have them lower ticket prices. Something
to get things back to the way they used to be.''

MAVERICKS SAY THEY'RE AT DISADVANTAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Some of the talk after the settlement of the 191-day
NBA lockout yesterday assessed the winners and losers in the labor
impasse. But for the Mavericks, the lockout may be the difference
between winning and losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this long, long layover, it's going to hurt everyone,
especially teams like the Mavericks,'' said Mavericks guard Robert
Pack, who traveled to New York yesterday where approximately 200
members of the players union voted to ratify a new collective
bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to get in and work out our wrinkles and get to know
each other,'' Pack continued. ``We needed training camp and the
time to make mistakes, so we can try to be ready and be hitting our
strides by this time of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Training camp cannot begin before Jan. 17, when NBA teams can
also begin signing more than 200 free agents. A 52-game regular
season is slated to begin Feb. 2. That could have the Mavericks and
the other 28 teams playing four games a week, and possibly pushing
the players to the brink of injuries by playing games on three
consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
   But the feeling coming out of New York seemed to indicate that
this abbreviated season is better than no season. With the deadline
the NBA owners set two weeks ago to cancel the season 29 hours
away, Billy Hunter, executive director of the players association,
and NBA commissioner David Stern went into an all-night bargaining
session that produced the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The players seemed to make more concessions than the owners for
the deal, which included an unprecedented individual player salary
cap. The NBA is the first professional sports league to put a
maximum on what players can earn, which ranged from $9 million for
younger players to $14 million for 10-year-plus veterans under the
terms of the new agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't put a damper on the settlement for Pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely glad the lockout's all over,'' he said from his
hotel room in New York. ``I think guys really want to play, and
they're going to make the best of it. Hopefully, this deal is
something everybody can be pleased with.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in this thing, nobody wins. Hopefully it's something we
can live with and get the season started.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks forward Samaki Walker also is glad a settlement was
reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have never thought in a million years that we would
have been locked out for 190 days,'' Walker said. ``But I don't
want to be naive, because anything like that is possible when
you're in a business with big money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the Mavericks trade away Jason Kidd, and I never
thought that would happen. So anything's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything's possible might be a good mantra for a team coming off
a 20-62 record last season and fifth-place finish in the NBA's
Midwest Division.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting free-agent forward Kurt Thomas, Dallas already has
a 12-player training-camp roster intact. That includes guards
Michael Finley, Steve Nash, Hubert Davis, Erick Strickland, Khalid
Reeves and Pack, forwards A.C. Green and Walker, centers Shawn
Bradley and Chris Anstey, and rookies Dirk Nowitzki and Ansu Sesay.
Dallas would like to sign Thomas to a one-year deal, and Thomas has
already said he doesn't have a problem signing a one-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks also have to address the situation with forward
Cedric Ceballos, a veteran free agent who is well-liked among his
teammates and a proven scorer. Mavericks coach/general manager Don
Nelson said he's willing to offer Ceballos only a short-term deal,
while Ceballos wants a five-to-seven-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   But since Nowitzki obviously is the Mavericks' small forward of
the future, it's highly unlikely they'll re-sign Ceballos, who was
acquired Feb. 18 from Phoenix for Dennis Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Slaughter, the agent who represents Ceballos, said
yesterday: ``The problem with having Cedric is he's interested in a
multiyear contract, and when I last talked with Don Nelson he's
only interested in a one-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason they traded for him, and now they want to only
give him one year. That's something that can't be done. It's my
hope that Nellie is really just posturing, but if they're not
interested in Cedric, we'll just have to talk to some other people
who have interest.''
</P>
<P>
   While the season now appears to be a rush job for all teams,
Pack believes the Mavericks would have been better prepared going
into this season had they gone through the summer-league program
and a regular training camp.
</P>
<P>
   And if it is a rush job, well, Pack is just happy to be playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we can get back to doing ultimately what we all want to
do, which is play ball.''

PATAKI OFFERS LIGHT AGENDA; CLASH ON SURPLUS LIKELY
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
(See also NY-PATAKI-ASSESS) 
By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Treading cautiously as he begins his second term,
Gov. George Pataki on Wednesday delivered a State of the State
message notably light on new initiatives, while proposing that the
state's budget surplus be set aside to pay for the ballooning tax
cuts already enacted.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's plan to salt away most of a budget surplus that
is expected to reach $2 billion is certain to be a flash point in
his relations with the state Senate and Assembly, because it would
deny the Legislature one of its favorite roles, that of dividing up
the spoils of a healthy economy. While legislators might balk at
creating a reserve fund, they also realize Pataki can achieve the
same end by vetoing spending they approve, as he did last year.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's annual speech to the Legislature, his first major
policy address since his re-election, was heavy on criminal justice
proposals: abolishing parole, logging the DNA of all felons into a
state computer database and increasing penalties for underage
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   But he paid little attention to an issue that he had pledged in
October to make one of his priorities, reforming the state's
campaign finance laws. He devoted only half a sentence in his
hourlong speech to the topic.
</P>
<P>
   After two years in which conservative groups have accused him of
runaway spending, the Republican governor pledged a return to the
budget stringency he brought to Albany four years ago, proposing an
amendment to the state constitution to require a two-thirds vote of
both houses of the Legislature to increase taxes. ``The act of
raising taxes is a destructive act, and should therefore be a
difficult act,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He promised that the budget he proposes later this month will
increase spending at less than the rate of inflation. And he
proposed requiring that two-thirds of the voters, rather than the
current simple majority, approve local school districts' property
tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must take bold steps to insure that this government
continues to live within its means,'' Pataki said in the newly
renovated Assembly chamber here. ``To protect taxpayers now and in
the future, we must make lower taxes and fiscal integrity the law
of the land in New York state.''
</P>
<P>
   But the speech was most striking for what it omitted, as the
governor avoided the most divisive issues facing the state.
</P>
<P>
   Health care was a major issue in last year's campaigns, and it
promises to be one of this year's legislative battlegrounds, with
New York facing a rapid rise in the number of uninsured people, the
expiration of its law governing hospital charges and growing calls
to regulate health maintenance organizations. Yet Pataki said
little about health care.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he repeat his call for a law guaranteeing women's access
to family planning clinics, first made in December, after a Buffalo
doctor who performed abortions was murdered. And he did not raise
what has been his frequent call to restrict late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators on both sides of the aisle were in agreement that
the speech had almost as much to do with Pataki's ambitions for
national office in 2000 as with New York's concerns. Democrats
accused the governor of showing his most conservative face to
appeal to Republican voters in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, D-Manhattan, said New Yorkers
``don't want to know if in Arizona they're impressed with a
two-thirds vote'' to raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   More surprising was the response of Republican legislators, who
had unanimously refused to discuss openly the governor's national
prospects when he was running for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the script had obviously changed, as they sought out
reporters to crow that Pataki had demonstrated his presidential
bona fides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an eminently presidential speech,'' said Sen. Roy
Goodman, R- Manhattan. ``It touched on a number of areas which make
New York a national model.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the governor's new proposals seemed aimed for
rocky shoals in the Legislature. The Democrats who control the
Assembly raised objections to nearly all of his criminal justice
plans and said his budgeting notions would hinder their plans to
spend money on schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders of the Senate complained that Pataki's
plan to save the surplus would stand in the way of lowering taxes.
``We see it as a pot for tax cuts,'' said Senate Majority Leader
Joseph Bruno.
</P>
<P>
   The icy relations Pataki has with the Democrats were amply on
display Wednesday. His speech drew lusty applause and cheers from
the south side of the Assembly chamber, where the Republicans were
seated, while the Democrats made barely enough noise to scare off a
flock of birds.
</P>
<P>
   The governor spent far more time dwelling on the accomplishments
of his first term, particularly the deep tax cuts, than laying out
a vision for the second. And he continued to slay the dragons of
1994, when he was first elected. ``In New York,'' he said,
``government had become that uninvited dinner guest, who arrived
too early, ate too much and stayed too long,'' he said, and the
state was leading the nation in violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki revived a number of proposals he has made in the past,
including tougher penalties for juvenile criminals, eliminating
tenure for school principals, giving teachers the right to expel
chronic trouble-makers from their classrooms, a law against hate
crimes and summer school for immigrant children to immerse them in
English.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new ideas in the speech was one long advocated by
environmentalists: expansion of the state's Superfund program for
cleaning up toxic waste sites to include hundreds of less severely
polluted tracts.
</P>
<P>
   He also called for the creation of a biotechnology research
center in Buffalo, to be run jointly by the State University of New
York campus there and the Roswell Park Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's only proposals on health care were to have
schools take a greater role in caring for children with diabetes,
and a pilot project for more aggressive treatment of childhood
asthma.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to save this year's surplus for future use was a nod to
the independent fiscal monitors who warn that the state will have
trouble paying for the tax cuts it has already enacted, but which
have not yet come due _ more than $4 billion a year. The tax cuts,
including reductions in property and business taxes, and the
elimination of the sales tax on clothing, are being phased in over
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Enacting a requirement for a two-thirds vote to raise taxes is
an even taller order, requiring a change in the state constitution
and a statewide referendum. Many Democrats in the Assembly were
declaring the idea dead on arrival. ``What he's trying to do is
limit the ability to legislate,'' said Assemblyman Herman Farrell,
D-Manhattan, who chairs the Ways and Means Committee. ``I'm opposed
to that.''

AS STOCKS RISE ON THE CONTINENT, EURO FALLS AGAINST THE DOLLAR
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The euro fell sharply against the dollar Wednesday, marring what
was expected to be a pleasant honeymoon after the currency's
introduction on Monday. A drop of 1.5 percent to a value of
$1.15920 left the new currency below the initial reference rate of
$1.16675 set on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Its decline came despite a continued rally in European stock
markets, some of which are up 8 percent in just the first three
trading days of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and traders said the euro selling was caused by several
factors. One was rumors _ which were not confirmed _ that there
were problems in settling trades in the new euro. A spokesman for
the European Central Bank denied there were any problems.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the dollar rallied against the Japanese yen after a
seven-day decline, a move that seemed to spill over into euro
trading. And trading in the new euro is still cautious and
relatively light, which means that its moves during one day can be
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar also got a boost from a sharp rise in U.S. stocks,
which sent the Dow Jones industrial average and other indexes to
new highs, and from automobile sales and housing data that showed
that the American economy is still healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it means it has emptied the tank of the euro,''
said David Gilmore, a partner in Foreign Exchange Analytics in
Essex, Conn. ``There is still an argument for a stronger euro. But
it is a setback.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had expected the euro to climb steadily and quickly
to a value of $1.20. So the decline was a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Another analyst said that traders were ``jumpy'' but that it was
too early to say the decline would set a trend for the euro's
value.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the euro has not been able to hold its own in its
first three days of trading _ its only up day was Monday _ Friday
could be very important for the new currency. That is when the
Labor Department releases the December employment report and
Germany announces its employment data.
</P>
<P>
   Given current expectations _ for a weak German report and
moderately robust American data _ the euro could face some more
selling pressure. ``I would argue at this point that the U.S.
economy has more momentum going into 1999 than Euroland does,''
Gilmore said.

   1998 AUTO SALES POST BEST GAIN IN 12 YEARS
</P>
<P>
   Last month was the best for auto sales since December 1986,
lifting the industry's sales for 1998 to the highest level in a
dozen years despite a nearly eight-week strike last summer from
which General Motors has not fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
   With the last auto makers reporting their results, the
industry's sales in the United States rose 7.1 percent last month
from December 1997. For the year, 15.55 million cars, sport utility
vehicles, pickup trucks and vans were sold, a 2.8 percent increase
from 1997.

<P>
   In court papers disclosed this week, Coca-Cola Enterprises, the

distributor out of business.

<P>
   EISNER BONUS TO BE CUT IN HALF
</P>
<P>
   Michael D. Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, is about to have his
bonus cut in half, to $5 million from $9.9 million, because of the
company's weak performance in the 1998 fiscal year. The company
also said it would revamp the formula that determines the bonus but
did not elaborate on a new formula, saying only that it planned to
submit a revised plan for shareholder approval.
</P>

   MICROSOFT SAYS DEAL WEAKENS CASE
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft made its most concerted effort yet to convince a judge
that the recent deal that brings together three of its rivals _
America Online, Netscape Communications and Sun Microsystems _
seriously weakens the government's antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   AIRBUS MAKES GAINS AGAINST BOEING
</P>
<P>
   Airbus Industrie made further inroads against rival Boeing when
Boullioun Aviation Services, a fast-growing aircraft leasing
company founded by a former Boeing executive, announced its first

<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ There were times, David Hilliard concedes,
when the Black Panther Party carried a stigma, conjuring images of
violence rather than community empowerment, of black separatism
rather than multiculturalism.
</P>
<P>
   But Hilliard, 56, is still proud to say he was a member of the
radical Panther group of the late 1960s _ its chief of staff, in
fact. And so Wednesday, when he announced his bid for an Oakland
City Council seat, Hilliard introduced Bobby Seale, who co-founded
the Black Panther Party here, as his campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was inspired by the new mayor, Edmund G. Brown Jr.,
and his progressive politics, Hilliard said, and represents
fulfilling the unfinished agenda of the Black Panther Party. That,
Seale told reporters, was not about murder and drugs, but ``was
always all about power to all the people, whether they're black,
white, yellow or polka-dot.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing with supporters in front of a high school that is
languishing academically, across the street from a row of houses
with burglar bars on the windows, the aging revolutionaries said it
was obvious that the poverty and lack of education and jobs in the
inner cities that the Panthers had hoped to address still existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time is right to do this,'' Hilliard said of his bid for
the council seat opening next year. ``We now have a progressive
mayor who sounds more like a Black Panther with every speech he
makes. We can help him realize his goals for better schools, health
care and jobs. We realize he can't do it alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Seale, who has been living in Philadelphia for many
years, announced he was planning to move his family back to Oakland
permanently, as soon as his son finished medical school this
summer, to help ``bring about what we all advocated in the 60s.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought of this, Brown, the former governor who
became mayor on Monday, sounded pleased, saying, ``You're going to
find a lot of very interesting people moving to Oakland.''
</P>
<P>
   He described Hilliard's campaign as ``about the magic of
democracy that allows anyone who avails him or herself of the
process to participate,'' and added, ``I say, Right on.''
</P>
<P>
   Seale ran for mayor of Oakland as a Black Panther in 1973,
losing to a white incumbent in a runoff that brought out more black
voters than any other election in the city's history. Four years
later, the group was credited with helping to elect the city's
first black mayor, Lionel Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Several former Black Panthers have also run for office _ and
won. Bobby L. Rush is serving his fourth term as a member of the
House of Representatives from Chicago and is planning a run for
mayor. A few others have held local offices, Hilliard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a history of being involved in this political
process,'' he said. ``We're no upstarts. Building a community _
that was always the Black Panthers' concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of the Black Panther Party includes starting a free
breakfast program, health clinics and bus service for the elderly.
It also includes frequent run-ins with the law. About 2,000
Panthers were arrested around the country during a five-year period
beginning in 1967. Some 20 Panthers were killed in shootouts with
one another, other revolutionaries, the police or the FBI. Huey
Newton, the group's other co-founder, died on the streets of
Oakland in 1989 in what is usually described as a drug deal gone
sour. Hilliard himself spent several years in prison in the 1970s
on charges stemming from a shootout between Panthers and the
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a very violent era,'' Hilliard said. ``This was the
era of George Wallace standing in the schoolhouse door declaring
segregation forever and whites lynching blacks. The Black Panthers
had a self-defense posture. When America grew up, we laid down our
arms and we started working within the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard has spent a great deal of energy preserving the more
noble aspects of the Panthers' legacy. In 1993, he published an
autobiography, ``This Side of Glory'' (Little, Brown &AMP; Company)
that tried to explain both the youthful idealism and anger that
inspired the party's formation. Last year, he began a Black Panther
Legacy Tour, where for $20, he gave a 60- to 90-minute lesson on
the party on a bus ambling through the humble streets of the city's
west side. With Newton's widow, he also started the Huey P. Newton
Foundation, a kind of information bank. He regularly gives talks
about the Panthers in the local schools. In the spring, he said, he
will begin teaching a course on the history of the Panthers at a
local college.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Black Panthers' ideals have just as much relevance today
as ever,'' Hilliard said.

EDITORIAL: A SPY ENIGMA IN IRAQ  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Thursday, Jan. 7:
</P>
<P>
   Divisions within the United Nations over Iraq have created a
poisonous atmosphere in which it can be difficult to determine fact
from fiction. That makes caution essential in assessing accusations
of misconduct, including reports this week that the Clinton
administration may have improperly used weapons inspection efforts
in Iraq to augment its own intelligence operations against Saddam
Hussein. It is not yet clear that such a violation of U.N.
independence occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Using U.N. activities in Iraq as a cover for American spy
operations would be a sure way to undermine the international
organization, embarrass the United States and strengthen Saddam.
Initial news accounts suggest that Washington may have taken
advantage of its technical support for inspections to conduct
electronic eavesdropping operations aimed at dislodging Saddam.
This was supposedly done with the approval of senior inspectors but
without the knowledge of the Security Council or Secretary-General
Kofi Annan. While Washington has ample reason to oppose Saddam,
using the U.N. to help unseat him through covert means would
crudely undermine the organization's autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   But more information will be needed to know whether Washington
acted so irresponsibly. For one thing, it is very difficult to
differentiate intelligence collection efforts in Iraq. With the
blessing of the Security Council, Washington has long provided U.N.
inspectors with critically important data about Iraq's chemical and
biological weapons programs, much of it collected by satellites and
other sophisticated listening devices. Because Iraqi security
services protect both Saddam's and Baghdad's unconventional
weapons, it is likely some information about Hussein and his inner
circle was routinely acquired by American spy agencies as they
assisted the U.N. in its search for arms.
</P>
<P>
   Another question is whether the spy work is being distorted by
Iraq's allies to humble Washington and to discredit the U.N.
inspection team and its leader, Richard Butler. Baghdad would be
delighted to see Butler fired and his colleagues replaced by a more
pliant group. That would effectively end any hope of rebuilding a
viable inspection system.
</P>
<P>
   Washington did cross a line it should not have if it placed
American agents on the U.N. team with the intention of gathering
information that could be used for military strikes against targets
in Baghdad. The Senate Intelligence Committee or its House
counterpart should look into the American intelligence role in Iraq
to determine whether Washington abused its relationship with the
U.N.

EDITORIAL: MORE THAN A GOOD MORNING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Thursday, Jan. 7:
</P>
<P>
   After several sleepy years, ABC News &UR;  &LR; finally has decided to do
something about ``Good Morning America,'' a daily decaffeination
that now ranks a distant second in the networks' wake-up time slot.
Like CBS, whose morning show has struggled for years, ABC seemed
inclined to cede this rich territory to NBC's ``Today,'' where the
warm chatter is paired with a daily bracing of hard, cold news.
</P>
<P>
   To combat the lucrative ``Today'' program, ABC News has called
in two morning stars from earlier eras _ Diane Sawyer and Charles
Gibson. While their return has the whiff of a desperate publicity
stunt and undoubtedly reflects pressure from the network's
television affiliates around the country, the change at ``Good
Morning America'' also &UR;  &LR; has raised hopes that the network now owned
by Walt Disney Co. still values a morning dollop of news as viewers
start the day. Although both stars can do the cooking segments,
they pride themselves on expert interviews, and even hard news.
</P>
<P>
   Such hopes for news at ABC definitely need raising. The network
has faced a technicians' strike in recent months that has hobbled
ABC News during one of the biggest news seasons in television
history. But ABC News is not alone.
 &UR;  &LR;  As the old broadcast networks steadily lose viewers to cable, the
Internet or places unknown, the big reporting teams that made
network news crucial for many Americans are being steadily eroded.
 &UR;  &LR;  Outside Washington, network television bureaus have been closing,
especially those outside the country. News operations are being
pared down as the big corporations that now run these networks
recognize that even if news shows are cheaper than entertainment to
produce, the actual reporting of news is still very expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The cutbacks could get worse. Lawrence Grossman, a former
president of both NBC News and PBS, has been warning the television
news industry to look over its shoulder at radio news. Radio is now
the most profitable medium of all, and one of the reasons is that
the owners of radio stations are rapidly shedding their news
operations, choosing instead to use many of the same radio wire
services. Grossman estimates that out of 10,000 commercial radio
stations in this country, only 15 are genuine all-news outlets that
employ news staffs large enough to report on their communities. One
big money-maker using such tactics in the radio boom, Grossman
notes, was Mel Karmazin, who is now the president of CBS.
</P>
<P>
   It may be too much to hope that even Diane Sawyer and Charles
Gibson can fight for more and better reporting for a mere morning
show. But it is also worth noting that NBC has earned its steady
first-place audience, in part because Matt Lauer, Katie Couric and
Tim Russert bring a healthy serving of news each morning to the
nation's breakfast table.

BASEBALL WRITERS QUIRKY, BUT `JUST SIX' MISSED BOAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last thing anyone wants to read in a newspaper is provincial
whining. This business should not be about turf protection. Leave
that to a lawn service.
</P>
<P>
   But in falling off this high-road journalistic note, I do have
one question.
</P>
<P>
   What in the bleepity-bleep-bleepity-bleep were the ``Just Six''
thinking about? Did the brain temporarily malfunction? Is medical
help needed?
</P>
<P>
   How could Nolan Ryan's name appear on a Baseball Hall of Fame
ballot, and the little box next to his name not be marked? I don't
understand.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, the ``Just Six'' all had good reasons. But when Ryan
received 491 votes out of a record 497 ballots cast by select
members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, it became
a lonely ledge for those six.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone can come up with a good reason for not voting for
Nolan Ryan, I'd like to hear it,'' said BBWA secretary Jack
O'Connell of Hartford, Conn. ``Since Nolan wasn't a unanimous
choice, that means we will never have one.''
</P>
<P>
   The first BBWA voting for the Hall of Fame began more than 60
years ago. Remarkably, no player has ever been unanimous, and just
think of some of those names now in Cooperstown. The ultimate
tribute to Ryan is 491 of 497 voters approved him, the
second-highest percentage ever.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell, who is in charge of the vote-counting, telephoned
Ryan in Alvin to give him the good news on Tuesday. ``He was
extremely humbled he had received that many votes,'' said
O'Connell.
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to the time several years ago when O'Connell made the
same kind of call to Mike Schmidt. Told he had been elected 16
votes short of unanimous, Schmidt paused, then asked O'Connell,
``Can you give me the names of those 16?''
</P>
<P>
   In other BBWA elections (Cy Young, MVP, etc), voting can be made
public upon request. But not for the Hall of Fame, which is
restricted to BBWA members with a minimum 10 years of membership.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ``Just Six,'' however, is columnist Bill Conlin of
the ``Philadelphia Daily News''. Conlin, a highly respected former
baseball writer, wrote a column a month ago explaining why he
wouldn't vote for Ryan. He also was a guest on Chuck Cooperstein's
WBAP talk show Tuesday night, giving his reasons. There is no hide
in Conlin.
</P>
<P>
   And the other five probably followed close to the same Conlin
logic _ that Ryan lost 292 games in his career, while winning 324.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Nolan Ryan a Hall of Famer? Absolutely,'' Conlin wrote in
his column, while also admitting Ryan would be voted in
immediately. But Conlin said he didn't think Ryan deserved to be a
first-time-on-the-ballot selection, mainly due to the 292 Ls.
Conlin did vote for two first-timers, George Brett and Carlton
Fisk, along with Gary Carter. Only Brett of his three was elected.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame voting is all about opinion and theory on
qualifications. But having now voted in 17 of these things, I'd say
this is the 17th consecutive year of strong disagreement with some
of the opinion and theory, and none more so than with Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   I'm still, however, severely hacked the baseball writers never
elected Nellie Fox. It's just ... well, stupid. Nellie's game was
not about gaudy offensive numbers, but he may have been the best
defensive second baseman/top-of-the-order hitter who ever played.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, however, was all about gaudy numbers and baseball records.
But there was and still is a segment of baseball aficionados who
give a turned-up nose to Ryan's winning percentage over 27 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching is all about winning,'' they tell us, and tell us,
and tell us.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching is all about pitching.
</P>
<P>
   When a hitter goes to the plate, he is in complete control of
his destiny. It's strictly about putting wood on ball.
</P>
<P>
   But there are three elements that go into being a successful
pitcher, and the pitcher controls only one _ what kind of pitch he
makes.
</P>
<P>
   But then it comes down to the defense behind him _ unless
there's a strikeout _ and how many runs did his team give him in
support.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's 1987 season in Houston is a classic example. Pitching for
a team that would finish 10 games under .500, he went 8-16. But
Nolan led the league in ERA (2.76) _ no one else was under 3.00 _
and strikeouts (270). This despite a pitch limit of 100 for half
the season due to an injured elbow from the year before. The
opponent's batting average against Ryan that season was .199 over
211 innings. Tell me again. Pitching is about what?
</P>
<P>
   True confession. While Ryan was a shoo-in to be elected this
week, I'm shocked his vote percentage was that high, based on
notorious quirks of BBWA voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed we'd have one player, much less two (Ryan and
Brett), go over 98 percent,'' said O'Connell. ``In our
organization, that's unheard of.''
</P>
<P>
   But we still can say the ``Just Six'' upheld a longstanding and
strange tradition.

EDITORIAL: PATAKI'S STATE OF MIND  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Thursday, Jan. 7:
</P>
<P>
   Freshly re-elected, Gov. George Pataki gave a State of the State
address Wednesday that was a disappointing effort to make the
incremental sound grand. Politically unadventurous, the speech
allowed New York's governor to stick to his old, comfortable
issues. He was tough on crime and taxes and offered a jot for
education, a tittle on the environment. In a long hour, however,
Pataki spoke only a few seconds on health care, not a word on how
to allocate the tobacco settlement and one sentence, an
afterthought perhaps, promising to clean up the state's abysmal
campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he focused on proposals like a New York state
constitutional amendment that would require a two-thirds vote by
both legislative houses to raise taxes. A two-thirds-for-taxes
requirement has a nice ring to it politically, but might not mean
much in Albany, where any tax has traditionally become law as part
of a last-minute budget deal that passes with hefty majorities.
</P>
<P>
   For felons, Pataki proposes an end to parole and the beginning
of universal DNA testing, a costly change with an uncertain
outcome. Moreover, he made no mention of the important but
politically difficult need to reform the Draconian Rockefeller drug
laws, which have helped to overload the state's prisons.
</P>
<P>
   A more promising proposal is the governor's plan to place in
reserve about $1 billion of the budget surplus this year as a way
to protect tax decreases already in effect. Although we would
prefer that at least some of the surplus from these fatter years be
used to help chip away at the state's huge debt, the governor's
plan is better than using the surplus to pay for another tax cut or
higher spending that would eventually make the state's balance
sheet even worse.
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, as disappointment wafted over Democrats trying
to assess the political prospects for subjects barely mentioned or
avoided altogether, Pataki's Republican friends began collaring
reporters to make sure they got a larger political point _ that
this governor has talent to go national.
</P>
<P>
   ``An eminently presidential speech,'' one colleague purred to
the press. If this speech is an application for the big time, it
clearly needed a little work and a good deal of polish. Still, if
Pataki did not rouse the GOP to the nearest barricades, his speech
was safe enough not to raise any hackles, which made it sound at
least eminently vice-presidential.

UNION LEADERS PAY PRICE AFTER MISJUDGING SUPPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It pretty much took a public castration to get it done, but the
NBA lockout ended yesterday with the collapse of the players union
and an overwhelming victory for the owners.
</P>
<P>
   Whoopee.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, Billy Hunter and Patrick Ewing, for, unwillingly or
not, paying the ``ultimate'' price. Symbolically, of course, though
I'd bet that Hunter, the union's chief negotiator, and Ewing, its
president, have both checked several times to be sure that all
vital parts are still intact.
</P>
<P>
   NBA players, teetering on the verge of casting a vote of ``no
support'' for Hunter, Ewing and the other union leaders in an
emergency meeting in New York called for yesterday morning, were
instead stunned to learn when they arrived that an abashed Hunter
and commissioner David Stern had hammered out an agreement during
an all-night bargaining session.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take a genius to figure out that Hunter must have
finally got a read on the temperament of his constituents and
realized it was time to cut the best deal he could and save face.
</P>
<P>
   Or whatever he could save, which wasn't much.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, when Hunter brought Stern's offer to the players, was
an all-but-unanimous 179-5 to accept. Those against must have
included five of the six who didn't vote for Nolan Ryan for the
Baseball Hall of Fame either.
</P>
<P>
   One unconfirmed rumor circulating yesterday was that LA's
Shaquille O'Neal and the New Jersey Nets' Jayson Williams went to
Hunter's New York hotel room Tuesday night and strongly
``suggested'' that the rank-and-file members weren't going to be
intimidated by veteran players like Ewing and others in union
leadership and that it was time for Hunter to sit down with Stern
and work something out.
</P>
<P>
   True or not, it's rather pleasant to envision that, or something
similar, happening.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, the owners got many of the concessions they were
looking for, most important a hard cap on veteran salaries. No
sports union had ever agreed to a maximum salary for players until
the NBA's did yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Eat your hearts out, baseball owners.
</P>
<P>
   The next Michael Jordan to come along, whoever he is, can't make
more than $14 million a year. You listening, Michael Finley?
</P>
<P>
   Still, nobody really won, of course. Nobody ever does when
things get this bloody.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the owners and the players have done irreparable
damage to their sport and its once exciting and highly marketable
image.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't put a bandage on what both sides have done,'' Knicks
forward Terry Cummings told the ``New York Post'' even before the
agreement had been reached. ``We must sew it up in the 40 or so
games remaining and let the fans fall back in love with the game.
Let us fall back in love with it ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, this is the easiest money we'll ever make That
anyone can ever make.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the message that finally got through to Hunter, who leads
a union of players who average $2.6 million a year, by far the
highest in sports.
</P>
<P>
   Why, for pity's sake, did it take this long? Why, with
baseball's 1994 strike sitting there as the perfect example of how
not to do things, did the NBA _ both sides _ pick up that script
and read from it almost line by line? In the end, the offer the
players accepted was virtually the same one, with a few tweaks here
and there, that had been on the table for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if the rank-and-file players hadn't made a stand, who knows
when NBA basketball as we've known it would have been played again?
</P>
<P>
   Hunter and Ewing thought they had the support vote locked in in
their favor. They'd all but rigged it that way, announcing through
Larry King's TV show that all NBA players had to come to New York
yesterday to vote, whether or not they supported their union
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Messages left by players to the union offices went unanswered.
Players couldn't find out where to report or when. The union's
hotline number had a recording last updated Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   What Hunter and Ewing wanted was a low voter turnout, allowing
the union reps to intimidate those who managed to show up. That's
also why it was announced that the vote would not be by secret
ballot but by a verbal ``yea or nay'' count.
</P>
<P>
   ``The peer pressure in that room would have been tremendous,''
an NBA executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the vote showed reluctant support for Hunter and Ewing _
and you know it would have been announced as ``unanimous'' _ then
they could have thumbed their noses at Stern, who had claimed that
most players wouldn't support the union's position.
</P>
<P>
   Stern was right, but before we applaud him too much, let's
remember that he's equally responsible for this appalling mess. All
Hunter did was beat him to the phone anyway.
</P>
<P>
   There are no heroes here. That's the message that was driven
home to the fans once again as they watched multimillionaires
squabble over how to split $2 billion in annual revenues.
</P>
<P>
   An abbreviated 52-game season, they say, will begin on Feb. 2,
with full playoffs to follow. Thank God, we can now get Ewing out
of his suit and tie, off the podium and away from the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   I never thought I'd be so happy seeing a grown man in his
underwear again.
</P>
<P>
   Ready or not, like it or not, the NBA is back.
</P>
<P>
   Whoopee.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's been a rough three months for Spike Lee, the
filmmaker and famous Knicks fan, who has weathered the lockout as
well as can be expected for a man who once jetted back from the
Cannes Film Festival rather than miss a regular game. ``Actually I
flew back twice in one week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not an understatement to say Lee has been made whole
again now that the owners and the players have tentatively settled
their differences. ``I'm ready to get back to the game,'' he said
Wednesday, upon learning the happy news. ``The nightmare is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Filling the void has not been easy. He has had to make do with
college football while grumbling about greedy team owners and
enduring remarks from strangers who imagine him a personal adviser
to Patrick Ewing, the players' union president. ``As if I had any
influence,'' Lee said, shaking his head with a bemused grin.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most people could be forgiven for thinking that he has
some pull with basketball's rank and file. Besides his friendship
with players like Ewing, Michael Jordan and Ray Allen, Lee is known
as the Knicks' unofficial coach and one of its most zealous
cheerleaders.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, his $1,500-a-game seats on Celebrity Row have
given the public frequent glimpses of his boisterous boosterism _
and his habit of taunting the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The most notorious episode occurred during a nationally
televised playoff game in 1994, when Reggie Miller, the voluble
Indiana Pacers guard, obscenely heckled Lee while sinking 25
long-range points that stole the game. The next day, Lee found
himself a front-page demon in the city's tabloids, the scapegoat
for the home team's ugly defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really wanted my neck,'' recalled Lee, who says he
sweated through the final playoff game that summer, worried that a
Knicks loss might bring out an angry mob. ``I felt like I had more
at stake than the players,'' he said. The Knicks won that night,
and Lee got to keep his neck.
</P>
<P>
   While the union's executive director and the league's
commissioner were negotiating in secret on Tuesday night, Lee was
working out at an Equinox gym in midtown, dressed in his trademark
orange and blue (the Knicks' colors, for those born yesterday).
Besides the Stairmaster and softball, Lee, 41, says he isn't much
of an athlete. ``I was never any good at basketball,'' he said,
sitting down with a cup of carrot juice at the gym's health bar.
``I really miss the game,'' he said, glancing up at a television
screen that showed David Stern, the National Basketball
Association's commissioner. Lee rolled his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, he is editing his latest film, ``Summer of Sam,''
set in the summer of 1977, when the serial killer known as Son of
Sam terrorized New York. ``It's my first all-Italian-American
film,'' he said, referring to the cast. ``There aren't any black
stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Race often plays a starring role in Lee's films, and the subject
is often on his mind. Basketball is no different, and Lee believes
that the racially polarized league _ the owners all white and the
players mostly black _ has worsened the strife. ``I think a lot of
white America has a problem with these young black men making so
much money,'' he said, referring to the disputed cap on salaries.
``No other industry places a limit on what a person can earn. Can
you imagine if Hollywood tried to cap Tom Cruise or Leonardo
DiCaprio's salary? No way.''
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that some players had misjudged public sentiment
with statements like those of Ewing, who said the owners were
trying to force his colleagues into poverty. ``It's unfortunate,''
Lee said, ``but these guys aren't used to talking to the media,
unless it's about how they won or lost the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee says his love of basketball came from his father, Bill, a
bass player who dragged his young son to the old Madison Square
Garden on Eighth Avenue at 49th Street. As a teen-ager he rode the
subway alone from Brooklyn to cheer the Knicks from the blues, as
the top tier of the Garden is called. More often he would sneak
past the ushers so his hoots might reach the players' ears.
</P>
<P>
   As a 14-year-old, he watched as a limping Willis Reed scored the
first two baskets that led to the Knicks' unexpected
championship-game victory in 1970 over the Lakers. Lee was so moved
by the scene, he reconstructed it in his film ``Crooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the year Ewing was drafted by the Knicks, Lee finally
splurged and bought season tickets for about $400. They were in the
lofty green section, but with each new film he directed, Lee says,
he edged closer to the court.
</P>
<P>
   Other celebrities have come and gone from the courtside seats
opposite the Knicks bench, but Lee is always there, usually with
his wife, Tonya, or with one of their two children, Jackson and
Satchel. He shows up two hours early for games so he can schmooze
with the players and hold court with movie fans. When the warm-ups
begin, it is Lee who tosses out the ball.
</P>
<P>
   If a last-minute impasse ends up killing the season, Lee says he
will start following college basketball. (``Write down that I'm
looking for a ticket to the St. John's game,'' he said, referring
to the Big East team from Queens.) Even if he has to wait until
2000 to see the Knicks play again, his ardor will not be
diminished, ``just as long as I get my season ticket money back,''
he said, adding, ``with 6 percent interest.''

FARRIS TO APPLY FOR NFL DRAFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When he arrived at UCLA in 1995, offensive tackle
Kris Farris set three goals: make the All-Pacific-10 team, make the
All-American team, and win the Outland Trophy as the nation's best
interior lineman.
</P>
<P>
   In a three-week span that began in late November, Farris
accomplished all three. So in a 20-minute press conference
Wednesday, he announced he will forgo his senior season and apply
for the NFL Draft.
</P>
<P>
   His decision seemingly was not based on money or draft position.
He's considered a late first- or early second-round pick, and a
senior season probably would have increased his value
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Farris said goodbye to UCLA because he was saying
goodbye to his linemates, seniors Shawn Stuart and Andy Meyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like I belong here anymore,'' said Farris, a
fourth-year junior. ``When the seniors graduated last year, it was
hard for me because I grew up with them. Now that (Meyers and
Stuart) are leaving, it makes it harder to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Farris wavered after the loss to Miami. But the postseason
honors, a solid Rose Bowl performance and an offensive line meeting
made him realize his time had come _ and gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a meeting one day (before Christmas), and Andy and
(Stuart) were at Andy's grandfather's funeral,'' Farris said. ``I
looked around, and it was just me....
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been viewed as a senior. Every time there's a
senior meeting, I'm there.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Bob Toledo believed all along that Farris would
choose the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a pretty good idea,'' Toledo said. ``It was his
personality. He acted like a senior.''
</P>
<P>
   Farris' departure leaves a gaping hole at left tackle. Toledo
said the Bruins have several candidates: reserve David Wilford,
converted defensive lineman Josh Webb and two promising freshmen,
Blake Worley and Mike Saffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody will emerge,'' Toledo said, ``but we'll be young.''

LOCKOUTS LINGERING EFFECTS ON REVENUE UNCLEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Damaged, but not destroyed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's how sports marketing experts view the business of the NBA
in the wake of the six-month owners' lockout. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the near term, the shutdown cost players millions in salaries
and owners millions in lost ticket sales. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the lingering ill will could cost professional basketball
much more in future revenue, both at the gate _ where disgruntled
fans might stay away in protest or disinterest _ and in boardrooms
_ where corporations might decide to sponsor other sports. The
lockout's effects also could be felt in stores where licensed
merchandise sales already have declined, and in living rooms where
television viewership of NBA games might wane. That would drive
down advertising rates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How much revenue will be lost because of the lockout won't be
known until after the shortened 1999 season when attendance and
sales figures are calculated and when sponsorship contracts are
renewed and ad rates set. But marketers said the figures likely
won't be pretty. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The players and owners have been exposed. They came off like
two spoiled kids,'' said David Smith, president of Steiner Sports
Marketing, a New York sports marketing firm. ``There's no question
that has an impact. The NBA was at its height last year, with
\RMichael\S Jordan winning another championship and with
\Rcommissioner\S David Stern having built a phenomenal marketing
vehicle. Now, you have all this dirty laundry out there. There is
this perception of greediness.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been significant short-term damage to the sport,''
said Bob Williams, president of Burns Sports Services, which
matches advertisers with sports figures. ``Will fan excitement
eventually get back to the level of last year? I don't think so.
The players have revealed that greed and arrogance is what's
driving them and that they're out of touch with their fans. Couple
that greed with the eventual retirement of Jordan and it'll be hard
to recover.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The situation, however, is not entirely hopeless, analysts said.
Much depends on Jordan, whose return for one more season was deemed
essential to rebuilding fan interest. Jordan has not announced if
he will play this season. Also critical: another exciting
postseason. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To counter the negative publicity of the lockout, marketers
said, the NBA and its teams will probably not soon increase the
price of tickets, sponsorships or licensing agreements, all of
which have been skyrocketing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The immediate effect on some teams, including the Mavericks,
apparently has been minimal. Mavericks officials said there has not
been a significant erosion of ticket sales or corporate support
during the lockout. In fact, a Mavericks official said the team
actually sold several ticket packages yesterday after word of the
settlement came. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The NBA does have one other asset in its favor as it tries to
recover from lockout-related damage _ its lucrative multiyear
national TV contract. The deal kept revenue flowing throughout the
lockout and won't expire until 2002. By the time negotiations on a
new contract begin, sports media analysts said, the league's image
could be fully restored and the value of its next TV contract
enhanced. NBA clubs are to receive more than $600 million this
season from NBC and Turner Sports. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether basketball fans will continue to tune in NBA games at
levels established in recent seasons is uncertain. Media analysts
note that TV ratings for baseball have yet to recover from that
sport's strike in 1994-95. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Basketball-related merchandise sales have declined this season,
in part because retailers, anticipating a lockout, didn't order as
much inventory as in past seasons. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Retaining corporate sponsors also could be a difficult task.
Sports marketers said that companies might now perceive the NBA as
a risky marketing proposition and decide to allocate advertising
and marketing dollars to other sports. Companies, they said, might
not want to be associated with a league whose owners and players
are perceived as greedy. &QL;

PLAYERS TAKE ROYAL BEATING IN LONG BATTLE WITH OWNERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pertinent questions and answers surrounding yesterday's end of
the NBA lockout:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was commissioner David Stern serious about canceling the
season, and how close did we come to that disaster?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, and very. Players who arrived in New York said yesterday
they weren't sure how the vote to approve the owners' supposed
final offer would have went. Of those polled, it seemed about
50-50. If rejected, owners had already decided to cancel the
season. Stern made the deal because owners asked him to; Hunter
because players demanded him to.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After six months of contentious posturing, did either side
win?
</P>
<P>
   A: Huge win for the owners in several areas, including a
lengthened rookie wage scale to five years and percentage of
revenue designated for salaries (i.e. salary cap) down to 55
percent from the players' original stance of 63. The biggest win,
however, is the fact that players' salaries are now limited.
Whereas Michael Jordan made $33 million last season, a future
superstar like the Lakers' Kobe Bryant will have to play 10 years
just to get to $14 million a season. The players didn't want a hard
cap and they didn't get one, they got worse.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who were the other losers in this ordeal?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rookies, who now must play five years with the same team
under a slotted salary. And agents, who will get many less
negotiating opportunities with rookies and free agents and smaller
percentages of smaller salaries. The days of contracts like Kevin
Garnett's seven-year, $126 million deal are history.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happens next?
</P>
<P>
   A: Owners will ratify the agreement today at their board of
governors meeting, then lawyers will put the deal in writing over
the next week. Teams will begin calling players, pondering trades
and evaluating free-agent moves for the frenzied period that will
begin Jan. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When do we get to see NBA games again?
</P>
<P>
   A: After a two-week training camp starting Jan. 18, a 52-game
regular season begins Feb. 2. Though the All-Star Weekend was
canceled long ago, a regular format of playoffs is scheduled to
begin May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How will the shortened schedule work?
</P>
<P>
   A: The original format is scrapped, meaning your pocket schedule
is useless. Teams will likely play every team at least once, with
most of the focus on intra-conference games. Games on three
consecutive days had been talked about, but the basic thinking now
is to play four games a week for the 13-week season.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who will be the teams coming to Reunion Arena from the
Eastern Conference?
</P>
<P>
   A: That hasn't been finalized yet, but there's a possibility
Michael Jordan and the Bulls could play in Dallas after all.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the likelihood of Jordan returning to play one more
season?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not good. Close friends like teammate Ron Harper indicate
Jordan's absence from yesterday's meeting (he was in the Bahamas
playing golf) is a strong signal he is distancing himself from the
league. However, Jordan, a free agent, could be intrigued by the
shorter regular season and chance to win a title for a new coach
and a new team like the Knicks. After his stance all last season,
if he returns to play for coach Tim Floyd and the Bulls, he will
lose as much face as the players have during the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With the Bulls all but broken apart with a new coach and
Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman in the free-agent market,
who are the favorites to win the NBA's shortened title?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Pacers and Jazz have the most players under contract (11)
of teams that went far in last year's playoffs. The Bulls and
Rockets have only four players under contract while the Mavericks
have 10, not including rookie Dirk Nowitzki. And, of course, there
are the Clippers, who have managed to still not hire a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the lockout do to the Mavericks?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ends their undefeated run, for one. Actually, coach Don
Nelson's team is in good shape in that it has its roster pretty
much set. The Mavericks need to quickly sign Nowitzki and re-sign
Kurt Thomas. Other than that, they have a long-shot chance at
landing Cedric Ceballos or trading one of their many point guards
like Khalid Reeves or Robert Pack to make way for Steve Nash's
takeover of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With only 52 games and little time to prepare, what quality
of play can we expect?
</P>
<P>
   A: Poor, at first. But with the fewer games carrying increased
significance, games should be incredibly intense after the first
month. Injuries, of course, will be a major factor as players won't
be in game shape right away.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Besides 30 games, what did the NBA lose in the lockout?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tons of respect from fans, and any momentum created by last
summer's stirring Bulls-Jazz Finals. If Jordan retires as most
believe he will, that void coupled with the abbreviated season will
take a major bite out of the league's popularity.
