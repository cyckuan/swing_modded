<HEADLINE> Nepali Cabinet Members Promoted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government, while
facing an opposition challenge in the near future, today announced
some changes in the cabinet with seven members promoted to higher
rankings.
</P>
<P>
According to a press communique of the Royal Palace, King
Birendra, on the recommendation of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur
Deuba, promoted Minister of State Ramkrishna Acharya and Minister
of State Sarat Singh Bhandari respectively to minister for science
and technology and minister without portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, five other assistant ministers were promoted to
ministers of state with different portfolios, the press communique
said.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the promotion of these cabinet members by
the prime minister was aimed at strengthening the three-party
ruling coalition as a new parliament session is approaching.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition the Communist Party of Nepal (UML) is
likely to topple the present coalition government during the
forthcoming session of the Lower House within a month. The
session is to discuss the government's policy program and budget
for the 1996-97 fiscal year beginning from mid-July.
</P>
<P>
UML leaders have said openly that they would try to overthrow
the government by persuading one faction of the second ruling
partner the National Democratic Party (RPP) to withdraw from the
coalition and vote against the government in the parliament
session.
</P>
<P>
The three-party coalition government led by the Nepali Congress
(NC) was formed last September when the previous UML minority
government stepped down after losing a no-confidence vote tabled
by the NC and supported by the RPP and the third ruling partner
Nepal Goodwill Party.
</P>
<P>
The present cabinet headed by Deuba has been reshuffled three
times from an original compact one with five members to a
48-strong one, the biggest in Nepal's history.

<HEADLINE> Mo Wins All-Around Title in China Olympic Gymnastics Trials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, Central China, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Mo Huilan had
suffered a scare before she snatched the women's all-around title
at the Chinese Olympic gymnastics trials here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mo, who won the beam event at the world championships in Sabae
of Japan last year, gradually moved further ahead of her rivals
after a slow start on beam to claim the gold in a total of 78.600
points.
</P>
<P>
Mo scored only 9.775 points on the beam because she made two
little mistakes in her routine and then snatched 9.800 points in
her second apparatus on the floor.
</P>
<P>
"I made two errors on the beam because it was my first
apparatus and I hadn't got enough warm-up," Mo said.
</P>
<P>
Mo received her highest score of 9.900 points on the uneven
bars with an excellent performance of the Mo's Salto, a unique
move named after her which involves a multi-salto forward tucked
over the bar.
</P>
<P>
Ji Liya, world runner-up on the floor in 1995, scored the day's
highest score of 9.950 points for a floor routine packed with
exciting somersaults. She finished second overall in 78.175
points, also qualifying for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The third place went to Bi Wenjing, a newcomer to the national
team from Shandong province, who chalked up 77.700 points.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Olympic trials, which has drawn some 420 gymnasts
from all over China, will conclude on Tuesday after the finals of
the men's and women's individual events.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Australians' Opportunity Lies in HK, China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- For Australian businessmen,
their opportunity is in Asia, particularly in Hong Kong and China,
said Alfred Chown, chairman of the Australian Chamber of Commerce
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Chown said that the rapid economic
growth in Hong Kong and China has ensured that now more than ever
the opportunity exists for Australian companies to enter the Hong
Kong and China markets.
</P>
<P>
He said, "If there is one message that I wish to get across to
people, it is that the opportunity is knocking for Australian
companies."
</P>
<P>
He said that in the first quarter of this year, some Australian
companies have got a big batch of contracts for undertaking
infrastructural projects or supplying equipment in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The contracts secured or now being undertaken by Goninan and
Co., Leighton Asia and Universal Motor Kontrol were valued at
about 600 million Australian dollars (480 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Chown said that Hong Kong has become a major commercial base
for Australian business and investment.
</P>
<P>
According to the chamber, the value of Australia's exports to
Hong Kong in 1995 reached 2.79 billion Australian dollars (2.23
billion US dollars), increasing 7.92 percent over 1994, while the
value of Australia's imports from Hong Kong amounted to 1.013
billion Australian dollars (810.4 million US dollars), an increase
of 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is also Australia's fifth largest destination for
foreign investment. Last year the investment value from Australian
businessmen in Hong Kong was more than 3.51 billion Australian
dollars (2.81 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hong Kong remains the fourth largest source of
foreign investment in Australia and the investment value amounted
to over 14.44 billion Australian dollars (11.55 billion US
dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Chown said that the Australian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong
had witnessed the growing trade ties between Australia and Hong
Kong and China.

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1987 when the chamber was established, there were only 206
members. Over the past nine years, the chamber has grown to be
the second largest of foreign chambers of commerce in Hong Kong
with over 1,100 members, representing over 500 Australian
companies and an expatriate community of over 32,000 in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Michelle Gray, marketing manager of the chamber, said
Australian businessmen in Hong Kong cover a wide spectrum of
business serving as bankers, insurers, stockbrokers, accountants,
consultants, engineers, architects, freight forwarders and
couriers, publishers, traders, manufacturers, advertisers and
contractors.
</P>
<P>
Chown said that he is confident of HK's future development and
that most of Australian businessmen in Hong Kong have shared
positive attitude toward Hong Kong's transition.
</P>
<P>
Many of Australian businessmen can manage their business well
in Shanghai under the Chinese government, and it is stupid to
think that after 1997 the businessmen can not do well in Hong Kong
whose infrastructural condition is better than Shanghai's, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Chown noted that Hong Kong also represents a vital role in
Australia's growing trade and commercial links with the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
These links are expected to intensify as Hong Kong moves
towards 1997 when Hong Kong will become China's Special
Administrative Region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 84 Hong Kong-based Australian companies are running
joint ventures in China and another 85 companies have set up their
representative offices there.
</P>
<P>
The value of Australian exports via Hong Kong to China amounted
to 628 million Australian dollars (502.4 million US dollars) in
1995, growing 59.3 percent over 1994, and the value of Australia's
imports through Hong Kong from China was 2.2 billion Australian
dollars (1.76 billion US dollars), rising about 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to Chown, his chamber has a China committee which has
been one of the driving forces in the chamber to organize
functions like seminars, workshops and conferences on
China-related business.
</P>
<P>
The committee meets monthly to provide valuable information to
all those trying to do business in China. In the past few years
the committee has organized conferences focusing on specific
growth areas in China and hosted numerous study missions to China.
</P>
<P>
Chown said that it is the intention of the China committee to
begin work now for the day when Hong Kong formally becomes part of
China, in order to "provide not only greater service to existing
members but also to future members of Australian Chamber of
Commerce in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
"Australia business is now well and truly entrenched in Hong
Kong and China, and in military terms the beachhead has been
secured" he said.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Block Muslims Visits in Past 10 Days, UNHCR Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Only one of the 10 attempted
visits in the past 10 days by Muslims to the Serb-controlled
territory of Bosnia was successful, a UN spokesman said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The visits were organized by the UN Higher Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), but they were either physically blocked or ran
into trouble with the Serb welcoming committees, said UNHCR
spokesman Kris Janowski.
</P>
<P>
Janowski said that the latest failed visit occurred on Saturday,
with an "angry mob" of 100 Serbs in Koraj, north of Tuzla, forcing
four Muslims and accompanying UNHCR officials to flee.
</P>
<P>
In another incident, the police chief in Doboj abruptly
canceled a visit by a group of Muslims, claiming that there were
mines in the village they intended to visit.
</P>
<P>
The continued blockade by Serbs "is certainly manifestation of
harsh fact on the ground", Janowski said, "it tells us what a long
way we have to go before we can piece the two communities together
again".

NICOSIA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus announced here today to
hold an "European Week Against Cancer" from June 10-16 under the
banner written with "I love the sun but I protect my skin".

At a press conference, Health Minister Manolis Christophides

Referring to cancer cases in Cyprus, Christophides said
estimates indicate that each year more than 400 new cancer cases
are detected.
</P>
<P>
Anna Achilleoudes, Chairman of the Cyprus Association of
Cancer Patients and Friends, said this year's anti-cancer campaign
 will be conducted in three phases and aimed at different groups

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh All Set for Parliamentary Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's election officers and
frantic candidates are gearing up their preparations for the
upcoming seventh parliamentary elections scheduled for June 12.
</P>
<P>
Before the electioneering deadline at Monday midnight, the
campaign tempo by political parties already reached its peak with
numerous public meetings and processions all over the country.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the nation has been in the grip of an election fever
over the past few weeks. Polls posters, pamphlets and bulletins
were distributed and appeared at every corner in cities and even
in rural areas, and campaign booths decked with the party symbols
dotted roads.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission (EC) announced that a total of 2,574
candidates, representing 81 parties, are contesting for the 300
parliamentary seats.
</P>
<P>
In most of the constituencies, the fight will be a straight one
between candidates of the ex-ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP) and the Awami League (AL). The Jatiya Party (JP) and
Jamaat-e-Islami are the other competitive contestants.
</P>
<P>
Great enthusiasm is noticeable among the people to cast their
votes, which is in contrast to the low turnout of voters in the
controversial polls held on February 15.
</P>
<P>
After all the opposition parties spearheaded by the AL
boycotted the BNP-dominated polls, the BNP government of Khaleda
Zia stepped down on March 30 paving the way for a caretaker
government to conduct a fresh election.
</P>
<P>
The EC also got a new chief election commissioner, Mohammad Abu
Hena, whose main task is to restore law and order for holding free
and fair elections in two months.
</P>
<P>
Since then, more than 4,000 illegal firearms and 10,000 crude
bombs and other explosives have been recovered. Police have also
arrested some 42,000 people in a drive to crack down on violence.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a free and safe election on June 12, the EC is
expected to deploy about 400,000 members of police and
para-military forces at nearly 26,000 polling stations across the
country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 40,000 army personnel will be deployed in aid
of the civil administration during the election period. The
national borders will also be sealed so that no outside
infiltration can take place.
</P>
<P>
Hena told reporters Sunday that the EC has completed all
preparations for holding a free and fair election in a peaceful
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts however said that the recent reshuffle of
the army, which made President Biswas control the army, might cast
a big shadow over the fairness of the election.
</P>
<P>
AL chief Sheikh Hasina has kept on accusing Biswas of intending
to rig the polls in favor of the BNP with the help of the army.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the allegation, the EC chief said that the
Home Ministry would coordinate the activities of the law enforcing
agencies, including the armed forces, during the elections.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the ballots would be counted in the presence of the
polling agents of different parties and the results would be
directly declared from the EC.
</P>
<P>
"How could the results be hijacked by someone else?" he
queried.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Raps Japanese Ex-Minister's Claim Over Comfort Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Claims by a former Japanese
minister that so-called "comfort women" who worked as sex slaves
for the Japanese army were recruited as a "commercial activity and
were not forced" were condemned today by a leading newspaper of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the ruling Workers'
Party of Korea, said Seisuke Okuno's remarks, made at a press
conference last week, don't merely represent his personal stand,
since other Japanese right-wing forces have also tried to justify
the aggression and crimes of Japanese imperialists in Asian
countries, including the "comfort women" issue, and have refused
to provide compensation to the women.
</P>
<P>
By refusing to acknowledge this historical fact, the Japanese
authorities seek to flee responsibility for past crimes and make
no state and legal compensation, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
As many as 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, served as sex slaves
for Japanese soldiers before and during the World War II. Japan
ruled the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government has been urged by the United Nations
and Asian countries to accept legal responsibility for "comfort
women." But Tokyo has insisted that it is not legally bound to
compensate individual victims, saying it has settled all claims
under the 1965 Japan-South Korea Basic Treaty which normalized
relations between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> 5 Israeli Soldiers Killed, 8 Wounded in Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Five Israeli soldiers were
killed and eight others wounded in south Lebanon today in an
ambush by the Hezbollah guerrilla forces.
</P>
<P>
The ambush took place this morning in the eastern sector of the
Israeli self-declared Security Zone, when a group of Israeli
soldiers on way back to their base came under sudden machine
gunfires and rocket-propelled grenades.
</P>
<P>
None of the group escaped unhurt -- five were killed and
eight others wounded in the exchange of fires. The wounded,
four of whom seriously, were late rushed to a hospital in
Haifa, an Israeli resort town, by Israeli helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Israel radio reported that two Hezbollah gunmen were killed in
the clash, but Hezbollah did not mention its casualties in a
statement which confirmed the ambush against the Israeli
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army retaliated with artillery shells against Hezbollah
positions this morning and afternoon. One Hezbollah gunman was
reported to be killed and one civilian wounded, the Israel
Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli outgoing Prime Minister and Defense Minister Shimon
Peres toured south Lebanon today and chaired a security
meeting in the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
He met with Prime-Minister-elect Binyamin Netanyahu late this
afternoon to discuss the situation.
</P>
<P>
Peres warned Hezbollah against continuing the escalation of
attacks and vowed that Israel will respond in a proper manner
when time is fit.
</P>
<P>
This is the deadliest fighting between Israeli troops and
Hezbollah forces in the past two months since the two sides
reached a understanding of ceasefire late April.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah forces launched regular attacks on Israeli
targets in past weeks, a sign of renewed violence in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Four Israeli soldiers were killed in Hezbollah attacks less
than two weeks ago, and one South Lebanon Army soldier was
killed and two others wounded in two roadside bombings last
week.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Agencies Call for More Food Aid For the DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- United Nations aid agencies
today appealed to the international community for more food to
help ease the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK)
severe food shortage caused by last year's devastating floods.
</P>
<P>
Representatives in the DPRK of the United Nations Development
Program, the World Food Program (WFP), United Nations Children's
Fund made their appeal to foreign diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The food shortage will continue to cause major problems for the
country well before this year's harvest, they added. The food
situation there is so serious that the aid agencies called on all
countries, organizations and groups who can, to continue or begin
to supply food to the starving population.
</P>
<P>
The WFP's resident representative in DPRK, R. Hauser will go to
Beijing soon to persuade foreign diplomats there to put pressure
on their own governments to provide more food aid.
</P>
<P>
The floods last July and October in the DPRK's South Hwanghae
Province and other grain-producing areas left more than 500,000
people homeless and exacerbated the country's acute food
shortage. International aid in various forms has since poured
into the country, but aid workers say it is not enough.

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes HK Civil Servants to Stay: Lu Ping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 10 (Xinhua) -- China welcomes all civil
servants of Hong Kong to stay and there will be no major reshuffle
in Hong Kong's civil service, said Lu Ping, director of the Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the Chinese State Council, here
today.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese official accompanying Lu on the visit told Xinhua
that Lu made remarks during his meeting with Singaporean Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Lu said that the civil servants are
doing their jobs serving Hong Kong, no matter whether it is before
or after 1997. Therefore, China does not want to see any major
reshuffle of the civil service.
</P>
<P>
As for the senior officials, the fewer change the better, Lu
said, adding that China and Britain should cooperate to make the
civil servants stay and do their jobs at ease.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that Hong Kong has its uniqueness, namely, its
adaptability, which should be kept in the future. He also
expressed his belief that Hong Kong will be well administrated
after 1997.
</P>
<P>
Lu came here last Saturday on a four-day visit at the
invitation of Singaporean Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting shortly after Lu's arrival Saturday night,
Jayakumar said that Singapore would keep its good relations with
Hong Kong well beyond 1997. It would be in the interest of
Singapore that Hong Kong continues to be dynamic, he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Hong Kong and Singapore are complementary to each
other in their economic roles, Jayakumar also said he believed
that China is sincere to keep Hong Kong as a prosperous center of
commerce and finance, for this is in the interest of China.

ATHENS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A 60-year-old woman from Greek
Island for Rhodes has given birth to two twin boys, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to Athens daily Eleftheros Typos (freedom news),
Christoula Karioti, 60, had given birth by Caesarean section in
her eighth month of pregnancy at Athens' Alexandra Hospital,
breaking Greek record for the oldest mother (previously 58).
doctors said the two boys, weighing 1.5 and 1.8 kilogrammes
respectively, had been found to be in good health.
</P>
<P>
Senior Greek doctors have condemned the decision to let Karioti
have children. The criticism was fuelled by reports that she had
not initially revealed her real age to doctors.
</P>
<P>
"There is a code of ethics observed in this country and abroad
which states that a woman should not be made pregnant by
artificial insemination if she is over the age of 45, that is if
she has completed menopause and cannot conceive on her own," said
Athens gynaecology professor Dimitris Loutradis. "This is because
the complications shown during pregnant tend to increase with the
age of the woman. There is the danger that children born to
mothers beyond the age of conception may quickly become orphans."

<HEADLINE> BIS on How to Maintain Financial Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BASLE, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Bank for International
Settlements (BIS) said Monday that preventing financial crises,
reducing the risks induced by price swings in financial markets
and better supervision of financial markets are three major issues
needed to be tackled to maintain stability of the international
financial system.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the annual General Meeting of the BIS held in Basle
on Monday, the Bank's President W.F. Duisenberg stressed that
although the international financial system continued to function
well last year in the face of a number of shocks, including the
Mexican crisis, it "should provide no grounds for complacency".
</P>
<P>
"Change in the financial system is by no means over yet, while
the level of understanding of new financial instruments is still
not always what it should be. The possibility for market
participants to make outright mistakes is still very much there,"
he warned in a speech delivered to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bank's latest annual report unveiled by the
President at the meeting, how to prevent Mexican-like financial
crises has become a key policy issue for all countries.
</P>
<P>
For developing countries in particular, the BIS report said,
conclusion drawn from the experience of many industrial countries
in recent year is that deregulation of the financial system should
be both gradual and carefully phased.
</P>
<P>
Another lessen as far as crisis prevention is concerned is that
rapid credit growth should probably be treated as a more dangerous
sign than it often is, particularly when bank credit is highly
concentrated in certain sectors, which is unfortunately the case
in many developing countries, the BIS said.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, it said, permitting domestic banks that are
sufficiently capitalised to diversify abroad might prove helpful.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the restructuring of banking systems in developing
countries might be assisted in some cases if foreign banks were
allowed to play a greater role, the BIS recommended.
</P>
<P>
Apart from financial crises, a second source of concern for the
international financial system is that developments in financial
markets might threaten stability if rapid price changes were to
take important participants by surprise, leading to their
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
The BIS noted that while short-term volatility in financial
markets was not particularly high in 1995, there were some
significant swings in bond prices.
</P>
<P>
Another worrying element was the renewed appetite for risk on
the part of investors, which seemed to be prompted by the general
reduction in bond yields.
</P>
<P>
"The potential for an abrupt change in this appetite for risk
should not be underestimated," the Bank said.
</P>
<P>
In order to help investors to better assess the risks, the BIS
said more timely information on developments in derivative
financial markets would be useful.
</P>
<P>
It also said consideration is now being given to having the
central banks, coordinated through the BIS, collect and publish
aggregated data based on leading global derivative dealers.
</P>
<P>
The third area of concern pointed out by the BIS is that the
distinctions between different market instruments and between
different categories of market participants continue to become
more blurred, making it harder to determine who is doing what and
why.
</P>
<P>
"This poses a challenge to the disciplinary powers of both
regulators and markets," the BIS annual report said.
</P>
<P>
In developed world, regulators have responded to these rapid
changes by putting more emphasis on disclosure of market
informations with a view to relying on market discipline as a
complement to traditional regulatory oversight, the BIS said.
</P>
<P>
For many developing countries where supervision has been
inadequate, the BIS said much needs to be done over the medium
term to increase the effectiveness of rating agencies and market
discipline, in particular by addressing the unsatisfactory state of
accounting standards, and other impediments to transparent
disclosure.
</P>
<P>
In the short term, however, the authorities cannot rely
principally on market discipline. Supervisory practices must be
significantly strengthened as well, the BIS said.
</P>
<P>
The BIS is the oldest international financial institution
established in 1930 whose objects are to promote the cooperation
of central banks, to provide additional facilities for
international financial operations and to act as trustee or agent
for international financial settlements.
</P>
<P>
At present, thirty-two central banks in the world, the bulk of
them from western industrialized countries, are shareholding
members of the Bank.

<HEADLINE> CEICO Summit Divergent on European Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, June 8 (Xinhua) -- State heads from nine European
countries failed to reach consensus on European integration at a
two-day regional summit ending today in Rzeszow, Poland.
</P>
<P>
Some of them expressed great enthusiasm toward building a
common Europe at the Central European Initiative Countries
Organization (CEICO) while others voiced serious doubts on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Slovak President Michal Kovac said it is harmful to keep the
central European countries waiting a long time before they are
accepted into NATO and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with Kovac, both Polish President Aleksander
Kwaoniewski and Czech President Vaclav Havel maintained that
Europe make use of "the historical chance" to realize European
integration.
</P>
<P>
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Italian president, said the western
European countries should try to integrate with the central
European countries despite risks.
</P>
<P>
However, German president Roman Herzog questioned the idea of
making use of the historic chance in building a common Europe
while Austrian President Thomas Klestil noted that no pledges
should be made on the continental integration.
</P>
<P>
Slovenian President Milan Kucan, Hungarian President Goncz
Arpad and Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma also attended the
summit.

<HEADLINE> N. Ireland Talks Start without Sinn Fein's Participation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Historic multi-party talks on the
political future of Northern Ireland open in Belfast today,
without Sinn Fein's participation, according to reports from
Belfast this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams was rejected at the talks
because of the failure of it's allies, the Irish Republican Army
(IRA), to restore a truce ended in February with a wave of bombing
in London
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of the multi-party talks,
British Prime Minister John Major said that "too much blood had
been spilt in Northern Ireland's 25-year conflict. Major said he
believed the talks could be a "turning point for the better".
</P>
<P>
Major's Irish counterpart, John Bruton was also present at the
opening session.
</P>
<P>
A British government statement handed to reporters before the
formal opening of the talks made clear Sinn Fein would not be
allowed to take part.
</P>
<P>
"Sinn Fein is not at these talks because there has been no
restoration of the autumn 1994 ceasefire. It has been a consistent
position of the British government since February," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Unionist Party's leader Ian Paisley was also at
the negotiations table following a meeting with the talks Chairman
former US Senator George Mitchell. The Unionists, who want the
province to stay British had threatened to stage a walkout in
protest against the appointment of Mitchell as chairman of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, an adviser to US President Bill Clinton on Northern
Ireland's economy, led a panel that earlier this year drew up
proposals meat to lead to the disarmament of all illegal armed
groups in the province.

<HEADLINE> EU Seminar to Restore Confidence in Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- European milk and dairy products
are free from mad cow disease and third countries have no
justification for restricting imports, a top European Commission
official said today.
</P>
<P>
Rigorous measures for ensuring the safety of EU beef and beef
products have also been applied, eliminating any potential risk of
humans contracting mad cow disease, Franz Fischler, the EU's
Agricultural Commissioner told representatives of more than 50
non-EU countries attending a conference on bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, or BSE.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was set up to explain to third countries the
measures the EU is taking to protect human and animal health from
the disease.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed a worldwide ban on exports of British beef and
beef products in March after the British government admitted the
possibility of a link between BSE, or mad cow disease, and a
similar fatal brain disease in humans which could have been
transmitted through eating beef.
</P>
<P>
Britain, which has the worst record on BSE within the 15-member
EU, is now being forced to slaughter some 80,000 cows believed to
have been infected with the disease, as part of a scheme to
restore consumer confidence in beef and lift the ban.
</P>
<P>
Fischler said protective measures have been applied with
"equal rigor" with regard to EU beef exports to eliminate any
potential risk from BSE and there is no basis for third countries
to restrict imports of beef from Europe.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the EU and the World Health Organisation have
concluded that milk and milk products, even from countries with a
high incidence of BSE, are safe and there is no justification for
any trade restriction for dairy products form any EU member
state.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Fire Fighters Gain Upper Hand in Battling Wild Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ulan Bator, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian fire fighters have
gained an upper hand in battling the more than three-month-old
wild fires that killed or injured 85 persons, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The National Standing Special Committee, a government
organization set up to coordinate the efforts in fighting the
nation's worst fires in decades, said most of the wild fires have
either been put out or brought under control, except a fire
burning about 100 kilometers north of Ulan Bator.
</P>
<P>
The wild fires, started on February 23, spread to 14 of the
nation's 21 provinces, destroying 178 tents, charring 3.7 million
hectares of forest and about 7 million hectares of pasture, said
Deputy Prime Minister Choijilsurengiyn Purevdorj.
</P>
<P>
Purevdorj said the government has mobilized some 80,000 fire
fighters, including 3,000 army soldiers, 700 parachuters and 1,500
police officers, to contain the fires.
</P>
<P>
Besides undisclosed huge economic losses due to the fire, the
fire fighting efforts alone have cost the government 800 million
tugriks, or about 1.7 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> UN Experts Destroy Iraqi Biological Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. official said here today
that U.N. experts are now supervising the destruction of
machinery and equipment at the Iraqi biggest biological arms
production site in al-Hakam.
</P>
<P>
Goran Wallen, director of Baghdad's ongoing monitoring and
verification center of the U.N. Special Commission on Disarming
Iraq (UNSCOM), told reporters that the U.N. experts are currently
destroying the al-Hakam production site, some 80 kilometers west
of Baghdad, in the same manner as in Muthanna, a chemical weapons
production site which was destroyed by Iraqis under strict the
U.N. supervision in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM official said that the destruction of al-Hakam
biological warfare arms production site started in mid-May and is
expected to conclude by mid-June.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. destruction mission in al-Hakam includes the
destruction of what is termed as dual-purpose machinery which can
also be used in the civilian fields.
</P>
<P>
The al-Hakam site covers an area of 18 square kilometers which
is under U.N. supervision by 16 sophisticated video cameras
installed there. A dozens-meter-high tower there is connected with
the supervision center in the capital, sending back the
information obtained through the cameras.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Ministry of Culture and Information organized in
April last year a trip there by foreign reporters to visit the
site which the Iraqi side said is producing pesticides,
fertilizers and animal feeds.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a 20-member team of U.N. experts arrived here this
afternoon on a mission related to Iraq's missiles program. An
additional 30 experts headed by Russian ballistic expert Nikita
Smidovitich will be here to join them on Monday, a UNSCOM
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council set up the weapons monitoring program
in April 1991, shortly after the end of the Gulf war which
liberated Kuwait from the Iraqi occupation.

<HEADLINE> 12th Trial Session of 2 Former S. Korean Presidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The 12th trial session on mutiny and
treason charges involving former South Korean Presidents Chun
Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo was held at the Seoul District Court here
today.
</P>
<P>
Standing trial at the court were Chun and Roh as well as Chun's
nine close aides.
</P>
<P>
During today's trial, Chun admitted that he and his close aides
formulated the crisis management plan in May 1980, but again
rejected the prosecution's charges that the aim of their move was
to usurp the power.
</P>
<P>
Chun said that the plan was prepared on the basis of an idea
proposed by Kwon Jong-dal, then chief intelligence officer of the
Defense Security Command.
</P>
<P>
Kwon recommended that the National Assembly be dissolved and
the then martial law rule be extended throughout the country to
quell the political crisis stemming from student demonstrations,
Chun said, adding that acting President Choi Kyu-hah approved the
plan so that Kwon's recommendation could be put into practice.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Special Committee for National Committee
Measures was a crisis-management team intended to perform
administrative functions of the government under a martial law.
"During the days of President Park Chung-hee, I personally got his
approval to form just such a group for emergencies," Chun added.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16 former South Korean army officers including Chun
and Roh have been indicted for mutiny or treason, or both. The
mutiny and treason charges respectively stem from their roles in
the military revolt on December 12, 1979 and in the military
crackdown of the civil uprising on May 18, 1980 in Kwangju,
capital of South Korea's South Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
Chun Doo-hwan seized power on August 27, 1980 and ruled the
country until February 1988. He was followed by Roh Tae-woo who
stepped down in February 1993.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese FM Expects New Positions Emerging from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz said here today that "new positions" on the consequences
of the Israeli elections would emerge from a wider Arab summit to
be held in Cairo from June 21-23.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the scheduled Arab summit, Boueiz said that a
"new Arab policy should be defined and the policy in the past five
years since the Gulf war should be reviewed."
</P>
<P>
That is because "we are facing the new Israeli situation which
is concentrated on a traditional policy of (Israel's) Likud Party
and its stands regarding Golan Heights, Jerusalem and the
Palestinian problem," the foreign minister told reporters this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
After their meetings in Damascus at the weekend, Egyptian,
Syrian and Saudi Arabian leaders called for a wider Arab summit
and warned that any shift in Israeli peace policy would plunge the
Middle East into violence.
</P>
<P>
The call has been welcomed by Lebanon and some other Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri announced Sunday that
his country would attend the summit, describing it as "very
important" and stressing that it would "lead to the formation of
an Arab position and especially a Lebanese position."
</P>
<P>
The election of Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the rightwing
Likud Party, as the next Israeli prime minister, and the recent
reports on the staunch guidelines of the soon-to-be formed Israeli
government, have evoked concern of the Arab countries on the
prospect of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The job of the summit is to discuss all these issues and to
work out new positions conformable to the current situation," the
Lebanese foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that an escalated tension in south Lebanon is
"shaking" the cease-fire understanding reached between Lebanon and
Israel on April 26. The U.S.-brokered understanding ended the
16-day Israeli blitz in south Lebanon in which some 200 Lebanese
civilians were killed and 400 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
"The south Lebanon situation unfortunately shows the convulsive
climate prevailing in the region," Boueiz noted.
</P>
<P>
Five Israeli soldiers were killed and six others wounded in an
ambush carried out by guerrillas of the Lebanese pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, at an Israeli patrol in the Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone" in south lebanon this morning.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, Israeli artillery gunners heavily shelled the
two southern Lebanese mountain areas of Iglim Al-Toffah and
Nabatiyeh facing the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Only two hours after Israel warned to revenge the ambush,
Hezbollah guerrillas attacked another Israeli patrol in the
border strip this afternoon without causing casualties.
</P>
<P>
The morning ambush brought to 16 the number of Israeli
soldiers killed in south Lebanon since this year, including nine
killed after the Israeli large-scale military strikes in April.

<P>
BONN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Employment Institute in
Nuremberg said today the number of Germans registered as out of
work fell in May by 140,600 to 3,818,400.
</P>
<P>
Compared to April, the percentage of unemployed among the
country's work force sank from 10,4 percent to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
In western Germany, 2,683,200 people were listed as out of work
in May, a reduction of 85,900. In eastern Germany, 1,135,200
people were registered as jobless, a decrease of 62,600.
</P>
<P>
However, Bernhart Jagoda, president of the institute, said that
despite the declines, "the generally unfavorable trend in the
labor market has not changed."
</P>
<P>
Reduced orders in the construction industry were in particular
having a dampening effect on employment figures. In view of
continuing weak economic growth, an improvement was unlikely, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Joint Action Could End Kwazulu/Natal Violence: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Joint action by the leaders
of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and African National Congress
(ANC) could bring an end to the increasing violence in
Kwazulu/Natal Province, IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Pietermaritzburg, Buthelezi said: ''I
do believe that joint action by President Nelson Mandela and
myself will back the Kwazulu/Natal cabinet's endeavours to end
violence.''
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said the time had come for him and the president of
the ANC to go out there to stop people from killing each other.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Buthelezi and Mandela were supposed to
address a joint rally of supporters in Kwazulu/Natal midlands in
1991, but mandela was advised by the local ANC leader not to
attend because of potential violence.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said if that rally had gone ahead it might have
prevented violence which escalated in subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
The IFP leader stressed that he was prepared to address a
joint rally with Mandela if it would help end violence in the
province.
</P>
<P>
It is also estimated that the violence between the ANC and the
IFP supporters in Kwazulu/Natal had claimed the lives of about
20,000 people since the mid-1980s. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Six Liberian groups today appealed

<HEADLINE> 30 More UN Inspectors Arrive in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A 30-member U.N. inspection team
headed by Russian weaponry expert Nikita Smidovitich arrived here
today starting an inspection of Iraq's missile program.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at Canal Hotel in the suburb of Baghdad where
the office of the U.N. Special Commission on Disarming Iraq is
located, Smidovitich, refused to say anything to reporters.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, an additional 20 U.N. inspectors arrived in Baghdad
prior to the team's head Smidovitich, who is in charge of
dismantling Iraq's prohibited long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that another group of U.N. inspectors are
currently scrapping machinery and equipment in al-Hakanm, an
Iraqi biological weapons production factory, about one-hour's
drive from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The destruction started in mid May and is expected to finish
in recent days.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Iraqi authorities have declined to acknowledge that
the factory is a site for production of materials used in
biological weapons, claiming it is making farm materials including
pesticide, fertilizer and animal feeds.
</P>
<P>
The latest development in Iraq indicates that the U.N, mission
in Iraq will not come to a conclusion in the foreseeable future
despite Iraq's insistence that it has met all U.N. disarmament
demands, which is one of the requirements of the U.N. for a total
lifting of sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait
in August 1990.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Pushes Back Refugee Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian tugboats today pushed back
again a Russian-registered ship with Liberian refugees to sea
after it apparently returned to the western seaport of Takoradi.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today said that the Ghanaian
authorities have stuck to a decision not to take in any more
refugees from the war in nearby Liberia.
</P>
<P>
''It is being towed out... We won't allow it to dock,'' said
Ghana's Foreign Minister Obed Asamoah, quoted by the report.
</P>
<P>
The vessel, the Zolotitsa, has been bobbing along the west
African coast looking for sanctuary for the over 450 Liberian and
other west African refugees on board since it set out from
Monrovia, capital of Liberia, on May 26. But no country is
willing to accept it.
</P>
<P>
The Togolese authorities refused to allow it to discharge its
passengers last Wednesday after they had given it food and water.
</P>
<P>
It arrived at Takoradi, some 230 kilometers west of Accra,
capital of Ghana, last Friday but was pushed back to sea the
second day.
</P>
<P>
In Accra, Deputy Foreign Minister Mohamed Ibn Chambas said
that Ghana had not been approached to take in the refugees and
warned that should the captain sail into a Ghanaian port, he
would be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
Ghana bowed to intense diplomatic pressure in May and took in
about 2,000 refugees from Liberia on board an old Nigerian
freighter, the Bulk Challenge.
</P>
<P>
The United States has appealed to west African countries to
allow the ship to dock for humanitarian reasons and promised to
help cater for the refugees in collaboration with UN agencies and
international relief organizations. enditem

<HEADLINE> U.S. Forecasters on Economic Growth of This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Top U.S. economic forecasters
agree that the U.S. economy is growing vigorously now but differ
over how quickly it will expand at the end of the year, according
to a survey released today.
</P>
<P>
The consensus of 51 economists polled in early June by the
newsletter Blue Chip Economic Indicators showed the economy was
growing at a 3.3 percent annual rate from April through June, up a
full percentage point over forecasts in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
The report said that it would be well above the 2.3 percent
annual rate in the first quarter of 1996 and the anemic 0.5
percent pace in the final three months of 1995.
</P>
<P>
But there is sharply difference among forecasters about the
growth in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
"Pessimists (bottom 10 average) believe high levels of consumer
debt, slow income growth and this year's rise in interest rates
will curtail consumption in the second half, dropping annualized
economic growth to around 1.2 percent," the report said.
</P>
<P>
While many economists surveyed said that the growth for the
third and fourth quarters would be 2.3 percent and 2.0 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
"Increasingly, the differences between the forecasts of these
two camps has actually risen in recent months as more economic
data became available," the report said.
</P>
<P>
For the year, the forecasters predicted the economy will grow
by 2.2 percent this year and by 2.1 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Continued growth will cause little inflationary pressure, the
economists believe. The consensus calls for a 2.9 percent increase
in the Consumer Price Index this year and a 3 percent rise in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The survey was taken before the Labor Department reported last
Friday that a surprising 340,000 jobs were created in May. The
survey participants represent major corporations, banks,
universities, economic forecasting services and Wall Street firms.

<HEADLINE> Fire Damages Another Black Church </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Fires damaged two black church
buildings in Greenville, Texas, and two white men and a Hispanic
man were being questioned Monday.
</P>
<P>
In North Carolina, a 13-year-old white girl was arrested Sunday
night and charged as a juvenile with Thursday's burning of the old
sanctuary of a black Charlotte church, The Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said fires have struck at least 30 predominantly
black, Southern churches over the past 18 months. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin met with a group of black ministers to
discuss the church burnings.
</P>
<P>
Rubin and other officials promised an aggressive federal
investigation of all the fires. Agents from the FBI and Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms arrived in Greenville, about 40
miles northeast of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
Investigators have not determined the origin of the fire Sunday
night at Greenville's New Light House of Prayer, which has about
150 members.
</P>
<P>
The three men, who were charged with unrelated crimes, were
also being questioned about a fire at another church about a mile
away, although it was reported three hours after they were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
Authorities would not discuss whether there might be a racial
motivation in Thursday's arson at Charlotte's Matthews Murkland
Presbyterian church.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Speaker Meets with Russian Deputy FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Speaker of the National
Assembly (parliament) Saadoun Hammadi told visiting Russian Deputy
Foreign Minister Victor Bosuvalyuk here today that the U.N. must
put into practice para 22 of resolution 687 despite the Iraq-U.N.
oil deal signed last month.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with the Russian official, Hammadi said that
the oil-for-food memorandum of understanding signed on may 20
between Iraq and the U.N. should not be an alternative to putting
para 22 of resolution 687 into effect, which provides for a total
lifting of U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Bosuvalyuk, who arrived here Sunday, stressed the importance of
enhancing friendly ties and cooperation between Iraq and Russia,
adding that his country will continue its efforts to put para 22
of U.N. resolution 687 into practice and urge the U.N. Special
Commission on Disarming Iraq to accomplish its task as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The Russian official said that he came here to discuss with
Iraqi officials the best means to hasten the lifting of the
U.N. embargo imposed on Iraq and enhance the role of Russian
companies in meeting Iraqi people's needs of food and medicine in
accordance with the Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food accord.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance of strengthening ties between
parliaments of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iraqi Minister of Culture and Information and
acting Foreign Minister Abdul Ghani Abdul Ghafour also met with
the visiting Russian deputy foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Ghafour stressed the importance of
development in bilateral relations with Russia as well as Iraq's
keenness to boosting the ties in the common interests of both
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iraq-U.N. deal which enables Iraq to export 2
billion U.S. dollars of oil every six months to buy food and other
supplies, reflects Iraq's cooperation with the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> HABITAT Chief Stresses Equal Emphasis on Urban and </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Wally N'Dow, Secretary-General
of the Second U.N. on Human Settlement (HABITAT II), said today
that urban and rural areas in developing countries should be
given equal emphasis in addressing issues of human settlements.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during an interview with a group of
journalists from Asia and Africa, who have been covering the
two-week event, also known as "City Summit."
</P>
<P>
"Most of Asian and African countries must fight on two
fronts," said N'Dow, adding that "they must fight on the rural
front as preparing an urban future. There is no escape from that."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that most of the economic decline today in
developing countries has happened because the slow development in
rural areas, which has forced the rural population to move to
cities.
</P>
<P>
"I think this conference is trying to underscore that and we
are constantly reminded people from developing countries of that,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the relations between the north and the south,
the HABITAT chief stressed that international cooperation in the
field of human settlement was not only an issue of funding.
</P>
<P>
He said direct international assistance was just one way of
cooperation. It can also be realized by means of sharing
scientific and technical achievements, and more importantly,
training people in developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Strong Earthquakes Shake Aleutian Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Two strong earthquakes struck
the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, within 12 hours since 00:03 EDT
today, sending hundreds of residents rushing to high ground to
avoid high tidal waves, but no damage or injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
A tremor measured 7.7 on the Richter scale shook the Aleutians
at 00:03 EDT with an epicenter about 60 miles west-southwest of
the Aleutian island of Adak, causing waves about three meters above
normal tides, said Guy Urban, a spokesman for the Alaska Tsunami
Warning Center.
</P>
<P>
About 11 hours later, an aftershock measured 7.2 on the Richter
scale struck the same region with an epicenter about 30 miles
southwest of Adak, an island on which about 600 people live,
geologists said.
</P>
<P>
The quakes were the latest series of tremors hitting the
region. A major quake measured 6.3 on the Richter scale shook the
Aleutians Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Aleutian Islands are known for frequent earthquake activity
because of their location along the plate boundary between the
North American and Pacific plates. In May 1986, the region
experienced an earthquake of 8.1 on the Richter scale.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Confirms 5,500 Aids Cases in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) said here today that it had confirmed 5,500 cases of
aids in Nigeria up to the end of May.
</P>
<P>
According to a UNICEF fact sheet for June, a sero-prevalence
study of Hiv since 1994 has shown a 3.8 percent rate in the
general public of the country.
</P>
<P>
For each reported case of Aids, the UNICEF report said, there
are four to five unreported cases and up to 10 hiv infected
persons.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary report of the 1995 sero-prevalence study shows a
disquieting sero-prevalence of 5 percent to 6 percent among
ante-natal clinic attendance in some states, the report said.
</P>
<P>
''These apparently higher figures may be attributable to
better reporting by health officials and more established Aids
control and prevention programs in those states'', the report
said, adding that recognition and under-reporting constitute big
problems in defining clearly the magnitude of the Aids problem in
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
While Aids cases have been reported among all age-groups,
those of between 20 and 39 years face the highest risk, said the
report, pointing out that there are more cases among females in
the 15-19 age bracket than there are males in the same age group.
</P>
<P>
However, there are more cases in males in the 30-39 age group,
the report added.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Aids and STD Control Program, 81
percent of reported aids cases in the country are from the 15-39
age group with the 20-29 group being the most affected.
</P>
<P>
The 1994 report also indicated that 70 percent of Nigerian
youths have had sexual experience before the age of 16, most of
them with multiple partners. enditem

<HEADLINE> China's Project Hope Students Deliver Letter to UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Representing 1.25 million
Chinese donated students of Project Hope, one boy and two girls
today delivered a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali on the seven-year-old nation-wide project.
</P>
<P>
"We are from the remote poverty-stricken areas of China.
Because of poverty, our parents could not support us to school, so
we had to leave school," said the three children in the letter.
They came to the United Nations en route to Buffalo City to
participate in the 1996 Olympic Torch Relay.
</P>
<P>
"Comparing with the other children, we were unfortunate, but on
the other hand were are the most fortunate children under the sun,
because Project Hope has changed our life, it made us back to
school and again have the chance to education as the other students
do," it said.
</P>
<P>
Project Hope, which was launched by the China Youth Development
Foundation in 1989, aims to promote elementary education in
China's poor rural areas by mobilizing social resources and to
support school dropouts whose families are too poor to afford them
to school.
</P>
<P>
For seven years, with nearly 1 million U.S. dollars donated by
the public, Project Hope has helped more 1.25 million school
dropouts to return to school and built more than 2,000 Hope
primary schools in those poor areas.
</P>
<P>
"The China Youth Development Foundation follows very closely
the courses of the United Nations on eradicating poverty,
illiteracy, and strengthening families," said Rosario Green,
special adviser to Boutros-Ghali, who is now in Turkey attending
the U.N. conference on settlement. Ms. Green accepted the letter
on the behalf of the secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general is a strong believer in the power of the
civil society to change things in the world," she said. "Although
the United Nations is an inter-governmental organization, we work
very closely with non-governmental organizations, we are always
trying to find ways and means to strengthen the relationship."
</P>
<P>
She praised the visit by the three donated students for
providing a good opportunity to exchange views and enhance mutual
understanding.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Government Adopts Platform for Talks With IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government today
adopted a platform for expert talks with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) in Geneva on June 13-14.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav delegation, to be headed by Professor of the
Belgrade School of Economics Oska Kovac, will act in line with the
government's stands, which clearly affirm Yugoslavia's principled
policy, the Yugoslav Ministry of Information said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The expert talks will also deal with legal and economic issues
in regulating Yugoslavia's IMF membership, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav delegation failed to reach an agreement with the
IMF in their last talks in early April in Paris because Yugoslavia
insisted on being the sole successor of the former Yugoslavia. The
failure to join the IMF has prevented Yugoslavia from gaining
access to hard currency credits it needs to revive its economy,
which is virtually at standstill despite the suspension of U.N.
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government has stated its readiness to find
optimal ways to normalize relations with the IMF and pointed out
that it would strive to "resolve the issue in a pragmatic and
realistic way."
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that the platform for the Geneva talks
was based on previous government documents and the basis for
Yugoslavia's stabilization and development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Yugoslav government today adopted a platform for
its participation in the ministerial conference on the
implementation of the Dayton peace accords in Florence, Italy, on
June 13-14.
</P>
<P>
The basic goal of the conference is a review of the six-month
implementation of the Dayton agreement, an accord on a further
comprehensive implementation of the Dayton provisions and respect
for the set deadlines, a Yugoslav government statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav delegation, to be headed by Foreign Minister Milan
Milutinovi, will insist on a comprehensive implementation of the
Dayton accords and an equal treatment of all sides in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The conference's participants will focus attention, among other
things, on elections in Bosnia, the return of refugees, freedom of
movement, and regional arms control.

<P>
CANBERRA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The New South Wales state
government has decided to launch an eight million dollars training
fund to solve the shortages of labor skills for major 2000 Olympic
Games construction projects, a government official said in Sydney
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts estimated that about 10,000 skilled laborers will be
needed to build the 2.3 billion dollars projects at Olympic Park,
in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"The building industry had raised concerns with me about
shortages of skilled labor," said Industrial Relations Minister
Jeff Shaw. "We were faced with the choice of increasing the pool
of skilled workers or importing labor from interstate or overseas.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Agriculture Grows 6.7 Percent in Pakistan in 1995-96 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's agriculture sector
grew 6.7 percent in 1995-96 with record production figures for
rice and wheat, said the Economic Survey 1995-96 released here
today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Economic Survey, annually prepared by the
Finance Division of the government and released before the
announcement of the budget for the next fiscal year, a number of
factors have contributed to higher growth in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The weather remained favorable for many major crops while a
combination of better agronomic practices enabled farmers to
respond to more favorable market-induced price incentives.
</P>
<P>
Under the Awami Tractor Scheme, or the People's Tractor Scheme,
a large number of tractors were sold at financially attractive
prices in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
There has also been an increase in the irrigation water intake.
 An agricultural credit of 14.2 billion rupees (406 million US
dollars) was disbursed to farmers.
</P>
<P>
Suitable plant protection measures as well as the availability
of virus-resistant seed varieties helped overcome the
virus-induced difficulties of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The total rice production in the country in 1995-96 was 3.966
million tons, showing an increase of 15.1 percent over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Wheat production in the year under review was 17.6 million tons
against the target of 17.4 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Cotton production is estimated at 10.6 million bales in 1995-96
against 8.7 million bales in 1994-95, depicting an increase of
21.7 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Cotton plays a vital role in Pakistan's economy. It is the
major foreign exchange earner and provides raw materials to the
domestic textile industry.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture sector contributes around 25 percent to
Pakistan's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and engages about half of
the total employed labor forces.
</P>
<P>
It is the largest source of foreign exchange earnings and meets
raw material needs of the country's major industries like textiles
and sugar.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Businesses of Beijing University Benefit School, Nation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Beijing University, one of China's
most prestigious universities, has earned a total income of six
billion yuan (about 723 million U.S. dollars) from sales of
high-tech products during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
This has earned the University a reputation as the biggest
money-maker among 1,057 Chinese colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
Li Pingfang, director of school-run businesses of Beijing
University (known as Beida in Chinese), said that Beida became a
pioneer in combining theoretical study and scientific research
with the national economic construction.
</P>
<P>
He said that Beida's high-tech enterprises have not only
created significant economic benefits, but also played an
essential role in promoting technological renovation in Chinese
enterprises and establishing China's own high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
The electronic composing system developed by the Fangzheng
Group, which is affiliated to Beida and specializes in computer
technology, has been adopted by 90 percent of all newspapers
across the country and about 40 newspapers overseas.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Group established a one-million-yuan foundation
to sponsor a plan for Beida intended to train 200 young and
middle-aged leading scholars within five years.
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with east China's Anhui province, the
University's College of Life Science has recently developed a new
medicine that has proved to prevent the growth of tumors, and cure
liver-related and cardiovascular diseases by transforming selenium
into a form that can be absorbed by the human body.
</P>
<P>
Three out of every four Chinese, who die of illness, die from
cerebral and cardiovascular diseases and those related to tumors,
according to study results provided last week by Academician Ba
Denian from the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
</P>
<P>
Medical reports said that the shortage of selenium in human
bodies will lead to the denaturalization of bones, necrosis of the
kidney and liver, and even death. Over 40 diseases are linked with
the shortage of selenium.
</P>
<P>
Statistics provided by the College of Life Science showed that
China's location on the Earth is a natural cause of the lack of
selenium, as 72 percent of its area faces a shortage.

<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo met here
today with William Mitchell, chairman of the American Electronics
Association (AEA), and his delegation.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting at the Great Hall of the People, Wu outlined
China's reform and opening up, its economic construction and the
development of its electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
"Opening to the outside world is an important characteristic of
China's economic development, which provides a spectrum of
opportunities for foreign enterprises and investors," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the principle of "one China" and the three
Sino-U.S. joint communiques should be honored in the development
of relations between China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"It is normal that there may appear to be some problems between
the two countries, which should be solved through consultations on
an equal footing," Wu said. "We are against sanctions, which
render no solutions to problems but complicate them," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the protection of intellectual property rights, Wu said the
Chinese government has cracked down on piracy and other IPR
violations, which is the need of building China's socialist market
economy and of developing science and promoting technology.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that China attaches importance to its economic and
trade relations with the U.S., adding that he hopes the two sides
will increase multi-channel contacts, including contacts between
non-governmental organizations and enterprises, in order to
strengthen cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Good Sino-U.S. relations are beneficial not only to the two
sides, but also to the world peace and stability," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said the U.S. electronics industry is eager to forge
closer cooperation with China and to play a part in China's
economic development.
</P>
<P>
AEA is the biggest high-tech industrial group in the U.S., with
a membership of more than 3,000 enterprises, or two-thirds of
those engaged in the electronics industry.

<HEADLINE> 70 Percent Farmers Still in Countryside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Nearly three-fourths of China's
900 million rural people are still in the countryside practicing
traditional agriculture.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics released today by the State
Statistics Bureau, 72 percent of these farmers were still engaged
in farming, forestry, husbandry and fishery by the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China had 450 million rural laborers last
year, an increase of 2.95 million over the previous year, while
those engaged in the industrial or service sectors accounted for
less than 30 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 6.8 percent of the rural laborers shifted to the
industrial and service sectors, a decrease of 0.5 percentage
points over 1994.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the extra laborers in the countryside mainly shift
to the industries, construction and services, indicating that the
rate of the rural laborers who shift from traditional agriculture
to other sectors has slowed down.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed this mainly to the higher profits in some
areas that have attracted the farmers and the slow development in
the industrial and service sectors in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
The increase of travel fares due to rail price hikes was also
an important reason for this, experts added.

Italy, the current EU presidency state, warned Britain that it
had to be more flexible to keep alive hopes of a deal, allowing a
step-by-step lifting of the embargo upon British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EU Commission and Italy are playing key roles in
striving to mediate a deal to resolve the beef crisis before the
EU summit scheduled for later this month in Florence, Italy.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini explained that there
could be progress toward an agreement if Britain abandoned its
non-cooperation policy in a "pragmatic and not definite way."
</P>
<P>
But other EU countries, led by the Netherlands, took a harder
line with Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo, saying that
Britain should call off its blocking campaign before negotiations
began on a framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette is also reported as
criticizing Britain, saying that Britain was "shooting itself in
the foot" by blocking policies which it favored.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Rifkind made it clear to his EU
counterparts that "the British policy of non-cooperation
continues, but we can be flexible within that (policy)."
</P>
<P>
The British government has blocked quite a number of measures
since British Prime Minister John Major announced the
non-cooperation campaign in a desperate effort to get rid of the
worldwide ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
But it has recently showed some flexibility by giving green
light to some limited EU measures.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the global ban on March 27 when the British
government admitted that there were possible links between BSE or
"mad cow" disease and its human equivalent Creutzfeld-Jacob disease.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the EU Commission decided to lift the ban
on the exports of three British beef by-products -- gelatine,
tallow and bull semen.
</P>
<P>
However, the British government still refused to end its
non-cooperation policy, saying it will give up the policy only if
the EU announces a clear timetable to lift the beef ban.

<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China has suspended the
reproduction licences of two CD factories, accusing them of piracy
and fining them each 200,000 yuan (about 24,096 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Press and Publication Administration and the
State Copyright Bureau said this move serves to show the Chinese
government's sincere effort to fight piracy and protect
intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, the Chaoyang Jinfa CD Company and
Zhongshan Yisheng CD Company, both in Guangdong Province, were
engaged in reproducing pirated and pornographic CDs.
</P>
<P>
These reproductions were in serious violation of China's
efforts to preserve intellectual property rights and caused severe
negative impact, the official said.
</P>
<P>
And the Jindie Technology Company in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, which imported two production lines to reproduce pirated
and pornographic CDs without permission from the Press and
Publication Administration, also was ordered to suspend the
duplication business.
</P>
<P>
Since late last year, China has suspended licences of seven
other CD manufacturers for piracy.

FREETOWN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A five-day Sierra Leone-Nigeria
Joint Commission meeting will start here next Monday, Nigerian
High Commissioner Alhaji Mohamed Abubakarr said here today during
a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
According to the diplomat, military cooperation between the
two states will feature prominently at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The joint commission will also review achievements since it
was set up in 1989 and its first session was held in Lagos a year
later.
</P>
<P>
About 30 Nigerian participants mainly from the private sector
are expected at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Under the commission's agreement, both states have cooperated
in trade, mining, petroleum, education and health, technical aid,
fisheries and aviation.
</P>
<P>
A follow-up meeting was scheduled in 1992 and according to the
high commissioner, "political factors in both countries"
prevented it taking place in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here say that in spite of the various agreements
signed between the two countries, the "only growing link remains
military cooperation" under which Nigerian troops, including a
crack mechanized Mortar contingent, are stationed in Sierra Leone
to assist in the five-year long rebel war. They are also guarding
key installations in the capital.
</P>
<P>
In addition, three Nigerian registered airlines are flying to
Freetown.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Economy Grows 6.1 Percent in 1995-96 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's economy recorded a
growth of 6.1 percent in 1995-96 against 4.4 percent in the
previous year, according to the Economic Survey 1995-96 released
here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the annual economic survey prepared by the Finance
Division of the government before the announcement of the budget
for the next fiscal year, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth
rate in 1995-96 of 6.1 percent is slightly above the average
growth rate in the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
This high growth rate was contributed by 6.4 percent increase
in commodity sector and 5.8 percent increase in services sector,
says the survey.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit is now estimated at around 5.0 percent of
the GDP, compared with 5.5 percent in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
Tight monetary policy kept monetary expansion down to 8.4
percent during July 1995-March 1996 against 9.8 percent in the
corresponding period last year, which was within the annual
expansion target of 12.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Higher GDP growth in domestic output combined with significant
progress in achieving macroeconomic stability brought about a
decline in inflation.
</P>
<P>
The annual inflation rate is estimated at around 10.5 percent
for the fiscal year of July 1995-June 1996 as against 13 percent
recorded in 1994-95, the survey says.
</P>
<P>
The survey also gives a detailed account of the performance of
specific areas of the national economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The high-tech industry has become
a driving force behind Shenzhen's economic growth, with production
value accounting for 21 percent of the city's industrial output
value.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Shenzhen City government said that the
city's high-tech industry now contributes about 40 percent to
production value of the high-industry in Guangdong Province, one
of the most developed areas in China.
</P>
<P>
Flexible policies are being pursued in the Shenzhen Special
Economic Zone to encourage investors from Hong Kong, Macao and
overseas.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Shenzhen currently has 77 high-tech
companies specializing in such industries as computers and
software, telecommunications, micro-electronics and devices, new
materials, biology enginering, integration of machinery and
electronics, and laser.
</P>
<P>
He said that the high-tech industry manufactured 22.5 billion
yuan worth-of goods in 1995, up 54 percent from the previous year,
nearly doubling the increase in production value of the
manufacturing industry as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The computer industry and telecommunications industry have
become the "pillars" of the city's high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
Production value of the computer industry came to 17.38 billion

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese trademark authorities
refused more than 50 unsuitable Chinese and overseas trademark
applications between May, 1995 and April 1996, in an effort to
control the trademark market.
</P>
<P>
The move was done in accordance with China's Trademark Law,
which stipulates that trademarks are banned from using words or
pictures that are detrimental to the socialist ethics or are
likely to cause an unhealthy impact, according to an official of
the Trademark Office of the State Administration for Industry and
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The refused applications defy social ethics and are in
violation of religious beliefs, support racial discrimination, and
feature colonial culture and serious unhealthy political
tendencies, said Teng Jiacai, a deputy division chief of the
Trademark Office.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, these unacceptable trademarks contain words or
pictures that promote or degrade professional killers, American
Indians, Bodhisattva, the queen, and the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
"The owners of these trademarks want to attract more consumers
by unique pictures or wording, but the trademarks cannot be
protected since they are harmful to society", Teng said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, there had been 528,541 valid registered
trademarks in China. Of these, 451,945 belonged to the Chinese,
while the others were owned by overseas applicants.

COLOMBO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- At least 14 villagers were killed
and four others injured when Tamil rebels raided a village in the
North-Western province of Sri Lanka at the early hours of today,
according to informed sources here.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the incident took place at Wanathawillu
village, over 140 kilometers from Colombo. The liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) massacred at least 14 people and later set
fire to the dwellings of the villagers before withdrawing into the
jungles.

Eight of the 14 killed were from a same family. Many
villagers, on hearing the cries of the victims, took cover behind
bushes and in the nearby jungles to escape the rebels of the LTTE,
the sources said.

When police and government troops rushed to the scene of the
massacre this morning, the LTTE rebels had already withdrawn from
the village.

HONG KONG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A medicine shop operator was
fined today a total of 150,000 HK dollars (19,355 US dollars) by a
court in Hong Kong for possessing a large quantity of musk grain
and pod.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old defendant pleaded guilty for possessing some
115 kilograms of musk grain and pod without license late last
year. The goods were estimated to be valued over 12 million HK

The spokesman said that last November AFD officers raided a
shop in Des Voeux Road West after being tipped off. Upon search,
about 115 kilograms of musk grain and pod were found.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was the largest seizure in Hong Kong about the
endangered species.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the musk concerned could not be confirmed
to be originated from a highly endangered musk deer species, it
would still make the offender liable to a maximum penalty of
500,000 HK dollars (64,516 US dollars) fine and one year's
imprisonment upon conviction.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the case of a highly endangered species used

<HEADLINE> China's First Soda Ash Producer Finds Way to Treat Slag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China's first soda ash producer
has discovered a way to turn slag into engineering filling.
</P>
<P>
The experiment passed an experts' examination and appraisal
today in Tianjin, the largest port city in north China.
</P>
<P>
Slag, which is discharged in the production of soda ash, is a
worldwide environmental problem, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The slag-turned-filling resists high pressure, is highly
permeable and can be used in road repair and foundation cementing,
according to test results. It can also improve soil structure.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin Soda Plant, China's first soda ash producer, went into
operation more than 70 years ago. It has turned out more than 15
million tons of slag, that occupy an area of 3.5 sq km and pose a
threat to the coastal environment.
</P>
<P>
At present, the slag discharged by the plant encroaches on
180,000 square miles of land resources annually.
</P>
<P>
The technique has been submitted for national patent
rights.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The People's Insurance Corporation
of China (PICC), China's No.1 underwriter, has decided to provide
full coverage for export of a float glass production line.
</P>
<P>
Valued at 27 million US dollars, the production line, which can
produce 350 tons of high-quality float glass daily, is to be
exported to Iran by the provincial Machinery Import and Export
Corporation in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
"It's Zhejiang's first large-scale export project supported
with export credit, and will promote export of local machinery and
electronic products in the province," said an official with PICC.
</P>
<P>
"It has a higher technology-intensity among China's export of
set equipment so far this year, reflecting that China has turned
to export products with high technology-intensity and earning more
foreign exchange," he added.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, China exported machinery products
and set equipment that featured low technology and earned less
foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
A leader in export credit insurance in China, PICC has helped
to spur the export of machinery and electronic products and set
equipment.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, it offered export credit coverage valued at
5.4 billion US dollars to nearly 800 Chinese enterprises, paying
34 million US dollars in indemnities.

MACAO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese official in Macao told
a visiting Portuguese official here today that the Sino-Portuguese
cooperation in Macao should abide by the three principles based on
the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
told Jorge Almeida Coelho, under-minister of the premier of
Portugal, that there are large potentials for cooperation between
the two sides on Macao affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said these principles are the basic spirit set in the joint
declaration, the principle compatible with the Basic Law of the
Macao Special Administrative Region, and the principle that the
Portuguese governance over Macao during the transitional period up
to 1999 should be conducive to Macao's economic development and
social stability.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, both sides agreed that cooperation should
be strengthened for the handling of Macao affairs and for a better
future of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Coelho said that he hoped the transitional period of Macao will
pass in a stable way and that problems in the period could be
solved through friendly consultation and active cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In response, Wang said that he believes the two sides can
cooperate well in settling various issues during Macao's
transitional period.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the policy of "one country, two systems,"
which will be implemented in Macao after China resumes its
exercise of sovereignty on December 20, 1999, is a long-term one.

<HEADLINE> Debates Heat Up on Banning Coeducation Bill in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A country-wide debate on an
earlier parliament decision to implement segregation in
educational institutions in Kuwait is heating up, forcing the
Cabinet to postpone a decision on the bill, previously expected to
come last Sunday, till next week.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's Islamists-dominated National Assembly passed a
controversial bill on May 28 to end co-education at the Kuwait
University and foreign schools within five years. The bill, which
had to be approved by the Cabinet and signed by the Amir before
it becomes law, was referred to the Cabinet for a vote scheduled
to take place Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, a fierce debate was triggered on the bill with the
opposition side represented by professors and academics strongly
criticizing the supporters of the bill for trying to turn the
clock back.
</P>
<P>
Since the passage of the bill, Islamists and liberals are
mobilizing their forces and launching hectic campaigns to rally
public support as the two camps have held several seminars and
more are scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The people who expressed consent with the decision claimed
that the coeducation system has many negative aspects that
reflect clearly in public life, and the problem of the current
generation is that 50 percent of them come to university not for
the purpose of study but for other interests stemmed from
coeducation.
</P>
<P>
A parliamentary member, Khaled Al-Adwa, said Monday that "The
proposal represents popular decisions that have been supported
by the Kuwaiti people because co-education contradicts with the
values and traditions of this Islamic country."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 40 orgnizations and foreign schools
issued a statement on Monday calling on the government to
reject what they called a "very serious law".
</P>
<P>
One Kuwait University professor said co-education would
yield better results since girls will be accustomed to ways
of dealing with boys and "this is of immense use in their
adult lives, especially at work and in marriage."
</P>
<P>
Attacking the fundamentalist view that the bill would help
students concentrate on their studies and prevent them from
entering into illicit affairs, he said "we learned our lessons
at private schools in mingled classes 50 years back and no
any problem occurred" even at that time.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a professor who focused on the financial aspect of
the bill said a huge sum of money would be needed to
build separate buildings and other facilities for the students
and prepare special teaching staff.
</P>
<P>
The anti-segregationists are all of the opinion that the
bill will undermine everything that has been achieved thus
far.
</P>
<P>
They also pointed out that segregating the schools is not
the answer to any problems that exist between the sexes.
</P>
<P>
The destiny of the law now rests on the government. If it
refuses to endorse the law, the Amir of the country, Sheikh Jaber
Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, will return it to the parliament which would
then have to muster 41 votes to override the government veto and
make the law compulsory.

KAMPALA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- About 23 percent of Ugandan girls
are married under 15 and the figure goes up to a remarkable 59
percent for the girls under 17.
</P>
<P>
"The New Vision" of the east African country today quoted the
Ministry of Gender and Community Development as saying that such
cases have been found to be more pronounced in fishing villages
and landing sites.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the ministry reveals that poor parents quickly
marry off their kid daughters in exchange for wealth. In times of
famine, it is even feared that a girl can only go for a bag of
maize in some areas, according to "The New Vision".
</P>
<P>
Girls are forced to marry at an early age so as to get cows
for the marriages of their brothers, the newspaper added.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry attributes such marriages to illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda, the legal marriage age is 18 and under the penal
code act it is unlawful to have sex with a person below the age
of 18.

<HEADLINE> Siemens to Help China Improve Automation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-German joint venture to
produce numerical controls for machine tools is expected to begin
operations in Nanjing in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Siemens Numerical Control Company, with a total estimated
investment of 13 million deutsche marks, will be jointly formed by
the Automation Group of Siemens AG and the China Dongfang
Numerical Control Company under the China North Industries Group.
Germany will fund 70 percent of the venture.
</P>
<P>
The new enterprise, located in the capital of east China's
Jiangsu Province, mainly will produce numerical controls for
compact machine tools in China's market.
</P>
<P>
The detailed investment plan of the Siemens' Automation Group
in China was revealed by Manfred v. Raven, the group's president,
at a news conference here today.
</P>
<P>
China's annual demand for numerically-controlled (NC) machine
tools is estimated to be twice the current total of 12,000 within
the next five years. And most of the demand will be for homemade
compact NC machine tools.
</P>
<P>
Siemens' Automation Group intends to occupy 30 percent of
China's market for numerical controls of machine tools by the end
of the century.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the new joint venture, the Siemens' Automation
Group has formed another in Beijing and one in Shanghai. The group
has poured a total of 13 million deutsche marks into the three joint
ventures.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to become one of the world's industrial
giants in the future, Raven said, and so must turn to advanced
automation, rather than the extensive, cheap labor force it
currently uses, to improve product and service quality and to
promote flexible production and sensible use of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
The group expressed its intent to help China improve automation
in the fields of production, industrial processes and measurement,
as well as cargo and package flow in airports and other
transportation terminals.
</P>
<P>
The world's largest supplier in the automation field, the
Automation Group of Siemens AG is expected to gain 75 million
deutsche marks in sales in China in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In addition to automation technology, Siemens AG also has
cooperated with China in the fields of industry,
telecommunications, energy, information technology,
transportation, health care, engineering components and lighting.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Trade Gap Widens in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A marked slowdown in export growth
widened the Philippines' trade deficit to 3.9 billion US dollars
in the first four months of this year, up 44 percent compared with
the corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The National Statistics Office said in a report today that the
country's export revenues totaled 6.2 billion dollars against an
import bill amounting to 10.1 billion dollars during the
January-April period.
</P>
<P>
It said that external trade turnover expanded 26 percent to
16.3 billion dollars, from 12.9 billion dollars in the pervious
year.
</P>
<P>
Total trade rose from 3.6 billion dollars to 4.29 billion in
April alone, with exports amounting to 1.49 billion dollars, the
office said.
</P>
<P>
It said that growth in export earnings slowed down to 8.1
percent in April, from a monthly average of 28.51 percent in the
last 15 months.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the steep drop to the peso's steady
appreciation since January this year and the fragile economic
recovery experienced by the country's major trading partners.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan, Singapore and South Korea are major
trade partners of the Philippines.

XIAMEN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 67 percent of the waste
water is treated before being discharged in Xiamen, capital city
of east China's Fujian province. The treatment level is a 32
percent increase compared with the figure of 1994.
</P>

the city's comprehensive treatment rate of solid industrial waste

</P>
<P>
The report says that Xiamen, one of China's special economic
zones, made the achievements while its total industrial output
value quadrupled during the Eighth Five-Year (1991-1995) Plan
period.
</P>
<P>
However, the report also highlights the fact that there is
still a long distance between the city's environment and that of
an international scenic city.
</P>
<P>
The report also notes that Xiamen has vowed to elbow its way
into the country's top ten in terms of municipal environments,

<P>
The hardline Likud leader told reporters that Israel had
witnessed a very harsh terrorist attack on its soldiers while
referring to the incident that took place in the eastern sector
of the Israel self-proclaimed "security zone" Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
In the incident, an Israeli squad fell into a Hezbollah ambush
with five soldiers killed and eight wounded.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu emphasized that when his government is formed,
possibly by June 17, it will deal with the situation in its own
way.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and all other rightwing opposition parties supported
the Peres government when it launched the offensive code-named
Operation  Grapes of Wrath against Hezbollah on April 11 and
called for carrying out the operation through to the end.
</P>
<P>
But when Israel accepted a ceasefire agreement brokered by
the U.S., France and other countries on April 26, Netanyahu
accused the Labor-led government of caving in.
</P>
<P>
He maintained the operation failed to achieve the key
objectives of disbanding the Hezbollah and winning Syrian
guarantee against renewed Hezbollah activities.
</P>
<P>
According to Likud's strategy then, Israel should have expanded
the "security zone" beyond the Nahr el Litany so that northern
Israel will be no longer within the range of Katyusha rockets
fired by Hezbollah.

<HEADLINE> Cancer, Respiratory Diseases Listed as Top Killers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Malignant tumors and respiratory
diseases were among the leading killers in China in 1995,
according to a governmental report.
</P>
<P>
In a report on the country's environmental situation, the State
Bureau of Environmental Protection says respiratory diseases have
become the number one killer in rural areas, followed by malignant
tumors.
</P>
<P>
The report says the death rate for last year was 65.7 per
10,000 of the 1.2 billion population.
</P>
<P>
The rate of deaths caused by cancer for urban residents was
12.8 per 10,000, about 21.8 percent of all the deaths in urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
The figure is close to that of cerebrovascular diseases, the
top killer disease in urban China.
</P>
<P>
The rate of deaths caused by cerebrovascular diseases was 13
per 10,000 last year, accounting for 22.1 percent of the total
deaths, it says.
</P>
<P>
The report provides for the first time public information on the
effects on health of environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
It says the death rate of respiratory diseases in rural China
increased to about 17 per 10,000, or about 26 percent of the total
deaths.
</P>
<P>
A growing number of people in rural areas have died from cancer
since 1991, with the death rate of cancers increasing to 11.1 per
10,000 last year from 10.1 per 10,000 in 1991, the report says.
</P>
<P>
Respiratory diseases and cancers closely relate to
environmental factors, the report says.
</P>
<P>
Among deaths caused by cancers in urban areas, lung cancer has
become the top killer by claiming the lives of 3.6 people in every
10,000 residents in 1995, slightly higher than that of the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The report also says cancer is top killer of males, adding that
there are 15.6 cancer-related deaths per 10,000.
</P>
<P>
The 18-page, 15,000 Chinese character report was jointly
compiled by the bureau, the Ministry of Public Health and a dozen
other ministries.
</P>
<P>
China invested 3.46 billion yuan (416 million US dollars)in
pollution-control projects last year, almost 2,500 pollution
producing factories were closed down, merged with others or
switched to manufacture other lines of cleaner products.
</P>
<P>
A total of 739 polluting factories were relocated, the annual
report says.

NEW DELHI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister of India's United
Front (UF) government H.D. Deve Gowda today moved a confidence
motion to the on-going session of the Lok Sabha (lower house),
which began Monday.
</P>
<P>
The confidence motion came a day earlier than the deadline set
by President S.D. Sharma, who asked Gowda to show his majority in
the house by June 12.
</P>
<P>
The political atmosphere in the country was complex and fluid
as no political party had secured a clear majority in the just
concluded general elections, Gowda said.
</P>
<P>
"The mandate of the people is for a coalition government," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I would utilize every minute of my stay in office to serve the
deprived segments of the society. I am here for the poorest of the
poor," he further said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition in the house on the debate over the confidence
motion today launched a severe attack on the ruling UF coalition
government, describing it as an "opportunistic alliance" devoid of
any political morality.
</P>
<P>
The debate is expected to continue on Wednesday and the UF
government is set to win the confidence vote as it has a clear
majority in the house with the support of the Congress Party.

<HEADLINE> China to Boost Garment Accessories Making </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China's clothing trade has unzipped a
plan to boost its garment accessory industry.
</P>
<P>
Up to 80 percent of all items of clothing made in China for the
export markets use foreign made accessories.
</P>
<P>
Now the China Garment Association (CGA) plans to accelerate the
growth of the home garment accessory and auxiliary materials
businesses in next five years. It will mean China producing more
zip fasteners, padded shoulders, lace trimmings and lining
materials.
</P>
<P>
 The plan is aimed at achieving a rapid growth in the clothing
industry.
</P>
<P>
Dong Binggen, chairman of the China Garment Association said
the home accessory industry was suffering by the high use of
foreign trimmings.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the founding ceremony of the Special Committee for
Garment Auxiliary Materials of CGA today in Beijing, Dong said
that the shrinking market share is caused not only by the
imbalance between the development of garment businesses and
auxiliary material supplies, but also the immaturity of the
"market organism" which hinders coordination between the two
sectors.
</P>
<P>
During the next five years, he said, both the production
capacity and corporate images of China's garment accessories and
auxiliary materials enterprises should be upgraded. This should be
done by issuing preferential policies and unfolding more
co-operation projects among domestic enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Formed by of representatives from nearly 100 Chinese
enterprises, the non-governmental committee will serve as a "link
to connect all the country's garment accessory factories and 1,000
large garment enterprises". Market research and new product
development will be the committee's focus, according to Dong.
</P>
<P>
The business coverage of the committee ranges from lining
cloth, zip fasteners, lace trimmings to shoulder paddings and
package materials.
</P>
<P>
To reinforce the research and development arm of the country's
clothing industry, CGA will launch a state-level garment
accessories and auxiliary materials development center no later
than 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to launch an
intensive investigation of the implementation of the education
law, the State Education Commission announced today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The investigation, to be mounted by six ministries or
commissions under the State Council, is parallel to a similar move
by the National People's Congress Standing Committee, China's
legislature.
</P>
<P>
The education law, China's first in history, was promulgated on
March 18 last year and went into force September 1 last year. A
number of people have doubted if the law can be implemented
smoothly as some local officials ignore its importance.
</P>
<P>
The State Education Commission said that local governments will
organize a self-check between June and September. Afterwards the
six ministries under the State Council will send several groups to
provinces.
</P>
<P>
They will find out the good points as well as misdeeds in the
implementation of the new law by officials.
</P>
<P>
The investigative groups sent by the NPC Standing Committee
have already visited several provinces and heard reports by local
officials.
</P>
<P>
According to the education law, officials should undertake the
responsibility of developing education first, investing more money
to improve classrooms and housing for faculties.

MACAO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The number of passengers from Asia
regions increased rapidly this year following the inauguration of
the Macao International Airport late last year, a report said.
</P>
<P>
The "Macao Daily News" quoted a Macao government official in
charge of mass media, tourism and culture as saying that the number
of visitors to Macao from Taiwan and the Republic of Korea rose by
about 100 percent during the first five months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The increase was mainly the result of the opening of air routes
to the two places. Macao now has daily flights to Taiwan and weekly
flights to Seoul.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of tourists from Hong Kong decreased by four
percent, compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is one of the leading industries in Macao. Last year,
some eight million people visited Macao.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the government will strengthen promotion
campaign and hold more trans-regional events like international
meetings so that more people will know and come to Macao.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River Delta Draws More Foreign Agro Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- More and more foreign investors
are eyeing the agricultural sector of the Yangtze River Delta, the
traditional Chinese "rice bowl," thanks to the preferential
treatment granted by the Chinese government to foreign investment
there.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River Delta consists of the northern part of
Zhejiang Province, the southern part of Jiangsu province, and
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
With fertile land, densely covered rivers, and good natural
conditions, the region is a commodity grain base with the highest
output in China. The agricultural output of the region hit more
than 160 billion yuan (19 billion US dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more than 20 countries and regions have
invested in the Yangtze's agricultural sector, and the number of
Sino-foreign joint ventures engaged in farming in the northern
part of Zhejiang Province has reached more than 40, with total
investments hitting nearly 100 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of such joint ventures in the southern
part of Jiangsu Province climbed to more than 700, with total
foreign investment reaching more than 200 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the Nantong Agricultural Comprehensive Development Zone in
the southern part of Jiangsu Province, which was set up last
October, there are a dozen Sino-foreign joint ventures with a
total investment of 17 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
With acreage covering more than 278,000 ha, the zone will set
up a breeding base for grain, cotton, cereal oil, a special
breeding base, a beach breading base, and an agricultural product
and by-product processing center.
</P>
<P>
Government officials at various levels in the Yangtze River
Delta Show great interest in drawing more foreign investment into
the region to set up joint ventures, process agricultural
products, renovate township enterprises, establish agricultural
product markets, and promote the comprehensive development of the
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Some agriculture experts think that as it is the most densely
populated region (120 million) and the most developed region in
China, there is a great potential agricultural market.
</P>
<P>
China has planned to offer preferential treatment to foreign
investment in the agricultural sector for taxation and tax rates,
and the country also will offer assistance in areas such as land
and labor expenditure and product choice, said Liu Chongjun,
director of the international co-operation department of the
Ministry of Agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Hainan's Development Cashes in on Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, June 11 (xinhua) -- The southernmost province and
special economic region of China, Hainan province, is to enjoy a
high development speed through a well-developed infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Investment put into fixed assets has reached 60 billion yuan
(7.2 billion US dollars) since the island province was separated
from Guangdong province and become an individual province in 1988,
a local official said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
In just five years, the Eighth Five Year Plan Period,
investment pouring into infrastructure reached 13 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Listed as one of the country's five special economic regions,
but with a poor economic basis, the province is said to have
suffered several false "economic hots" caused by trade, tourism,
real estate and finance, which though giving the province a
provisional left also brought many negative after effects.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities launched a campaign to develop the province's
infrastructural facilities in 1993, encouraging and guiding
investment into infrastructure, resulting in birth of several
stock companies concentrating on infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Now with 13,000 km of roads extending all over the province,
Hainan has become an area with among the most convenient transport
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Electricity supply capability has also reached 1.6 million
kilowatts, airlines are operating ten times as many routes, the
number of telephone-owning household has surpassed the national
average, with 315,000 lines installed.
</P>
<P>
Hainan has plans to pour 45 billion yuan into development of
key projects in the coming five years, which is going to involve
agriculture, water supplies, electricity and transport.
</P>
<P>
The changes in infrastructure have changed the face of its
investment environment, the province lured nearly 200 million US
dollars in the first quarter this year.

<HEADLINE> Shandong to Optimize Wine-Making Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China's largest wine-making base
Shandong Province plans to cut down its existing 110 wineries to
about 30 within the next 15 years. The plan aims to save grain and
protect the environment, a local government official said.
</P>
<P>
The east China's province turned out 1.18 million tons of
spirits last year, ranking first in the country.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the booming wine-making industry has
become a driving force for allied industries just as glass making,
packaging and printing, breeding and advertising, creating more
employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
It has also promoted the development of animal husbandry with
the wide application of distiller's grain, he added.
</P>
<P>
However experts said that restrictions must be imposed on
spirit production since it consumes too much grain and pollutes
the environment due to the waste discarded from the industry.
</P>
<P>
The production of a ton of low-alcohol needs 2.2 tons of
grain. Since low-alcohol spirits consume less grain the province
plans to focus on the development of low-alcohol spirits, fruit
wines, beer and health beverages in the future.

NANNING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Rural enterprises in southwest
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region reached 147 billion yuan
in 1995, a 13-fold increase compared with the figure in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The per capita annual income of peasants in the autonomous

</P>
<P>
A senior official with the autonomous region's government

region which have organized various kinds of training courses in
the rural areas during the 1990-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the autonomous region has allocated a special fund
for the "Quality Project", a scheme which offers systematic

LAGOS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Eight external evaluators from
the World Health Organization, United Nations Children's
Fund and Global 2000 are to begin a case search of guinea
worm prevalence in endemic villages in Nigeria next week.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the case search, according to today's

The evaluators are expected to assess residents' knowledge
about guinea worm transmission, correct use of cloth filters,
use of water treatment chemicals, availability of medical
kits and training of village-based health workers.
</P>
<P>
The evaluators, to be joined by four other assessors
in the country, will also verify the quality for guinea worm
surveillance and the effectiveness of cross-border
transmission.
</P>
<P>
The action is also preparatory to the verification exercise
to be conducted by WHO declaring Nigeria a guinea-worm-free
zone.
</P>
<P>
According to street, Nigeria carried out its first case
search in 1988 when 653,620 guinea worm cases were revealed.
The number of cases dropped to 16,374 up to December last
year, he said.

countries of the Association of the Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) have made clear their position of sticking to the "one
China" principle, saying that the question of Taiwan is China's
internal affair.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Courts in east China's Fujian
Province have stepped up efforts to handle economic lawsuits to
ensure the sound growth of province's economy.
</P>
<P>
Increasing booming economic activities have resulted in growing
economic disputes, judicial officials said.
</P>
<P>
Various courts in Fujian accepted more than 28,000 economic
disputes in 1995, an increase of 21.73 percent over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Economic lawsuits tend to involve more money, judicial
officials said. The economic disputes last year involved more than
3.7 billion yuan, up by 39 percent over that in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the courts concluded some 20,000 economic cases
related to business contracting, leasing, joint management,
share-holding, bankruptcy, product quality, futures trading,
bills, taxation, credits, prices and real estate.
</P>
<P>
The same year, the courts accepted 56 cases related to
intellectual property rights, and 45 of which were concluded.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Shrimp Exports Face Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's booming shrimp exports
might see a slowdown as various challenges are making it difficult
for the country to repeat the annual growth rates between 10 and
20 percent achieved over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The country's shrimp exports are now running into four major
obstacles -- a US ban, a European Union plan to remove
preferential tariffs on frozen shrimps, rising production costs,
and white-spot disease plaguing shrimp farms in the south.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the US imposed a ban on shrimp imports from
56 countries, including Thailand, saying that trawlers in these
countries do not have proper devices to protect sea turtles.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, one of the top shrimp exporters in the world,
suffered greatly from the US ban.
</P>
<P>
The US, a major market for Thai black tiger shrimps, imported
an estimated amount of 77,955 tons of shrimps from Thailand last
year, accounting for 39 percent of the total Thai shrimp export in
the year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand strongly protested against the US ban, saying 95
percent of its shrimps for export come from farms, not from the
sea.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government said it would join other countries to
resort to the World Trade Organization (WTO) for arbitration on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thailand is planning to take active measures to
overcome the US ban, including offering of certificates of origin
for shipment of shrimps.
</P>
<P>
Rising shrimp feed costs are also undermining shrimp exports
of the country, which mainly relies on imports of grains to
produce feed because of insufficient domestic output.
</P>
<P>
Costs of maize, wheat flour and soybean meal soared in the past
year. The price of maize rose by 97 percent to 4.87 US dollars a
bushel in April, compared with the same month last year, while
that of soybean meal went up 67 percent to 244 US dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
Local shrimp exporters attributed the higher costs to quota
policy and high tariffs for imports of these products. They urged
the government to lower tariffs on grains to help them cut costs.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that lower production costs will make Thai
shrimp products more competitive in the world market, even after
the EU removes preferential tariffs on shrimp products.
</P>
<P>
The white-spot disease, though under control now, also severely
damaged shrimp hatcheries and cold storage early this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Thai Agriculture Ministry, production of black
tiger shrimp will grow slower this year at less than five percent
because of the outbreak of the white-spot disease.
</P>
<P>
Farmers are working to prevent the disease by changing feed
formulas and running special tests in raising ponds and storage
houses.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has set a target of 2.2 billion US dollars for its
shrimp exports this year, an increase of 8.7 percent over last
year.
</P>
<P>
But analysts indicated that the target is difficult to meet if
the country fails to find a proper solution to the existing
problems.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Enforce Plan to Thwart Culture Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran is to put into force a
special plan to Islamize colleges and universities as part of
nationwide efforts to thwart cultural invasion by the United
States, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Akbar quoted Iranian Interior Minister Ali
Mohammad Besharati as saying that the cultural and educational
sector is regarded most vulnerable to Western cultural invasion
and poses potential threat to the Islamic system.
</P>
<P>
He called on commanders of Basij (volunteer) forces at various
organizations to observe strictly the Islamic values at Iranian
colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Reza Hashemi Golpaygani, Minister of Culture and
Higher Education, admitted that there are some un-Islamic and
incredulous elements at the Iranian universities and research
centers, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States are trying to separate people
from religion and spiritual values by propagating secular and
materialistic tendencies so as to set up a state like the
U.S. administration which has no regard for human virtues.
</P>
<P>
But the education minister did not specify the plan which is
going to take effect in the universities soon, adding that he
needs assistance of the clergy, the Qom Theological Seminary, and
all religious and cultural institutions.
</P>
<P>
Strict Islamization of Iranian higher education centers would
mean separation of the sexes, less freedom of speech and
education mixed with a large doze of theocratic political
surrounding.
</P>
<P>
Mustafa Mirsalem, Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance,
said that Iranian authorities take the question of cultural
invasion seriously, and that is why plans and programs have been
devised in a way as to face head-on the problem's negative
consequences.
</P>
<P>
To confront the cultural invasion, he said, Iran will make
further efforts to strengthen the publishing industry, encourage
writing and translation in line with the Islamic principles.

<HEADLINE> Photo Studio Apologizes for Taking Japanese Soldier Photos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A photo studio in central China
has been heavily criticized for snapping pictures of young
children in World War Two Japanese army uniforms.
</P>
<P>
Memories of the Japanese army of aggression that brought horror
and misery to China in the 1930s still evoke strong feelings.
</P>
<P>
And when the studio provided a service using child-sized
unfirms it was too much for the locals.
</P>
<P>
Now the owner of the Lanmeng Artistic Photo Studio has had to
issue a public apology and promised "not to let same thing happen
again".
</P>
<P>
A photo of a boy wearing a Japanese soldier uniform, which used
to be displayed in the studio's show window, has been removed.
</P>
<P>
The studio in downtown Zhengzhou, capital of Henan Province,
provided the service, charging an extra 3.5-yuan "uniform fee" for
every child taking such photos.
</P>
<P>
Local residents, especially senior citizens, showed strong
resentment to the studio owner's profit-before-everything deeds,
according a report in the Shanghai-based "Xinmin Evening News".
</P>
<P>
An old man told the newspaper that he thought such deed was an
insult to the nation's feelings and dignity.
</P>
<P>
The city industrial and commercial administrative department,
the market watchdog, urged the owner to pull out the photo and
stop such business soon after the department was informed.
</P>
<P>
Southwest China's Chongqing City urged stores in April to stop
selling plastic models of Japanese and German WWII era warships,
and confiscated some 250 such models.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Domestic Tours Down, Overseas Trips Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Domestic travels in Japan were
affected by disasters and terrorism in 1995, while high yen prices
encouraged Japanese tourists to go abroad, Kyodo News Service
quoted a government white paper on tourism as reporting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An accumulated total of 187 million people, compared with
Japan's total population of 124 million, went on domestic
sightseeing and leisure tours in 1995, down 8 percent from a year
earlier, according to the document compiled by the Prime
Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
The destructive Great Hanshin Earthquake in January 1995, which
killed more than 6,300 people, and the sarin gas attack on Tokyo
subways in March the same year, allegedly by the religious cult
AUM Shinrikyo as well as Japan's slow economy were cited as
negative factors hampering domestic tours.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, the number of Japanese who traveled abroad in
1995, marked a record 15.3 million, up 12.7 percent from the year
before for the fourth consecutive year. The previous record was
13.5 million in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Shanxi Was Major Production Base of Colored Glaze, Experts Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists say that
Shanxi Province in north China used to be the major production
base of colored glaze, the most important decorative material used
on ancient Chinese buildings and pottery.
</P>
<P>
Invented in the Fourth Century B.C., colored glaze was widely
used on pottery in the Qin (221-206 B.C.) and Han (206 BC-220
A.D.) dynasties, and on large buildings in the Northern Wei
Dynasty (386-534).
</P>
<P>
Since the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), Shanxi has become the most
important production base of colored glaze, as partly demonstrated
by its glazed screen walls and pagodas.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi now has more than a dozen glazed screen walls with the
design of the dragon, which were made in the Ming Dynasty. The
designs are optical illusions, with the number of dragons changing
from one, two, three or five to nine.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the glazed pagodas in Shanxi, such as the
pagoda in the Dayun Temple in Linfen, which has 66 colorfully
glazed Buddhist statues, represent outstanding craftsmanship in
color glaze decoration.
</P>
<P>
The techniques to make colored glaze were handed down through
generations of families. This tradition continues today, experts
say.

<HEADLINE> US government, Hollywood Urged to Cherish Film Market in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The curtain could come down on
Hollywood blockbuster films in China if a trade war develops with
the US, Chinese film officials have warned.
</P>
<P>
It took the big studios many years to gain a foothold in
China. Now audiences across the country can watch smash hits such
as Forrest Gump, True Lies and the Lion King.
</P>
<P>
But the years of progress could be swept away, with Hollywood
being the loser if the States imposes its trade sanctions against
China in the Intellectual Property Rights row.
</P>
<P>
Ironically it was to protect IPR that partly persuaded the
Chinese government to allow Hollywood to show its big-budget films
in China at the same time that the films were be screened around
the world.
</P>
<P>
But if the trade war develops China has announced that the
import of US films will be banned.
</P>
<P>
Film officials in Shanghai have urged the US government and
Hollywood to appreciate the impact on its film industry if the
door is slammed on one of the world's biggest movie markets.
</P>
<P>
Xie Baoxin, manager of the Shanghai Film Issue and Show
Company, said that if a Sino-US trade war occurs, it would be
harmful to both sides, but Hollywood would suffer the most.
</P>
<P>
Xie, whose company is in charge of issuing Hollywood films in
Shanghai, made the grim forecast during an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Xie said that if China stops the import of films from
Hollywood, it can turn to other developed countries. Xie believes
it has been a long-cherished goal of many foreign film makers to
export their products into China, where cinema audiences reach an
annual six billion.
</P>
<P>
In the event of a trade war Hollywood will lose the film market
in China which it has just achieved.
</P>
<P>
Historical material shows that since the 1920s, Shanghai has
been a major Chinese city in which Hollywood films have been
popular. These films occupied an important position in Shanghai's
film market in the early years after the founding of new China in
1949.
</P>
<P>
Hollywood films were first banned from China when the Korean
war broke out in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Hollywood films were refused by China for more than 30 years
until Sino-US relations were normalized in the 1980s. And then
only a few out-of-date films such as "Love Story" were shown in
China.
</P>
<P>
To boost the development of the domestic film market and enrich
people's lives, China began to import foreign films under the
international norms of profit-sharing. China also imported some
Hollywood films which were shown simultaneously in overseas
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that in 1995, Shanghai imported seven Hollywood
films including "True Lies", "Speed", "Forest Gump", "The Lion
King", and "Die Hard", with total box-office earnings reaching 50
million yuan, accounting for one-seventh of the total box-office
earnings of new Hollywood films shown in the country.
</P>
<P>
Of these films the box-office earnings of "True Lies" reached
13 million yuan, and that of the "Lion King" accounted for 50
percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Manager Xie said that box-office earnings are a touchstone to
test the protection of intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
Xie said that good box-office earnings of Hollywood films have
proved the achievement China has made in protecting intellectual
property rights.
</P>
<P>
Xie believes that film art is the common wealth of the
world. Importing films which are appreciated by Chinese people is
a way of promoting cultural exchanges between China and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
People who treat these exchanges with a lopsided and rude
attitude would suffer the most, Xie noted.

<HEADLINE> China's Central Bank Leans Towards Spot Supervision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank plans to
establish a spot-check supervision system to guard against
systematic and regional financial risks, according to a bank
official.
</P>
<P>
Cai E'sheng, director of the Banking Department of the People's
Bank of China, said that efforts should be made to enhance
day-to-day, spot-check supervision and surveillance over banks and
credit cooperatives, thereby shifting the focus of financial
supervision to the prevention of financial risks.
</P>
<P>
The director explained that the dominant goal of financial
supervision is to maintain normal financial order and guard
against systematic and regional financial risks, so as to
guarantee a safe, stable and highly-effective performance of the
financial system.
</P>
<P>
"Prevention of financial risks is both the chief goal and focus
of our financial supervisory work," Cai said, noting that
practical and potential risks do exist in China's current banking
system and must not be neglected.
</P>
<P>
While calling for effective measures to counter the risks, Cai
revealed that the central bank will set up a spot check
supervision system to prevent systematic and regional financial
risks.
</P>
<P>
"Prevention of risks in the banking sector is of great
significance to the safe and healthy operation of the overall
financial system," Cai said.

<HEADLINE> Southern Chinese City Residents More Aware of Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of well-off families
in China's boom area of Guangdong Province have learned a new
motto - 'Speculate to accumulate'.
</P>
<P>
Safe-as-houses banks are no longer the exclusive custodians of
hard earned cash for China's new rich.
</P>
<P>
A new survey has revealed that at least one in four Guangzhou
families are playing the stocks, shares and securities markets.
</P>
<P>
And the number is growing every day as ordinary Chinese learn
the new art of investing.
</P>
<P>
To invest or not to invest is no longer a question for the new
rich of Guangzhou, capital of south China's prosperous Guangdong
Province. The puzzling question nowadays is how to invest.
</P>
<P>
Residents of Guangzhou, who are among the front-runners and
first beneficiaries of China's market economy drive, no longer
regard banks as the only place to deposit their money. Nor do they
go to the other extreme by purchasing expensive clothing and
brand-name household appliances.
</P>
<P>
Instead increasingly more people with spare money are busy
visiting the securities markets to maximize their investment
earnings.
</P>
<P>
An analysis by the city's financial authorities shows that
Guangzhou urbanities, who still show up at bank counters to
deposit or withdraw money and pay water and electricity fees, are
leaning more towards stocks, bonds, foreign exchange, and other
financial instruments in a hope of "letting the money in hand
breed money".
</P>
<P>
A release by the Statistical Bureau of Guangzhou said that
per-capita yearly living expense income in urban Guangzhou reached
8,553 yuan (about 1,018 US dollars) last year, which was more than
twice the national average of 3,893 yuan. The comparatively high
income level has made it possible for Guangzhou city dwellers to
invest on a small scale.
</P>
<P>
Luckily for them, Guangzhou residents also benefit from a
relatively developed financial industry. Official data indicates
that the southern Chinese city has more than 2,500 financial
outlets, which translates into one for every 2,500 persons -- a
density comparable to that of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Li Guang, deputy general manger of the Guangzhou Nanfang
Securities Registration Company, confirmed that the number of
registered stock investors in Guangzhou had ballooned to more than
500,000 by the middle of May.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that Guangzhou residents also lead their cousins
in other parts of China in terms of investment awareness.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that stock investors used to be institutions or
self-employed bosses. But starting this year ordinary citizens and
workers have increased their speculative activities in great
numbers.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predict that more financially-aware Guangzhou people
will choose to invest their money rather than deposit it in banks
after an inflation-indexed interest rate subsidy was canceled in
April and interest rates on savings deposits were lowered in May.

<HEADLINE> Demand For Telecom ICs On Fast Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China will see a rocketing demand
for integrated chips (IC) this year, because of a continuing
growth in production of program-controlled switches, telephones,
mobile telecom equipment and personal computers.
</P>
<P>
The telecommunications business and computer and electronic
instrument firms will place a massive order for 900 million ICs
worth 20 billion yuan-worth this year, according to People's Posts
and Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that country's demand for program-controlled
switches will stand at 14 million lines, and its production
capacity will exceed 20 million lines.
</P>
<P>
In addition to a small number of imported switching systems of
AT&AMP;T and Fujitsu, the domestic market will be dominated by the
joint venture launched by such big foreign names as Bell, NEC,
AT&AMP;T, Northern Telecom and Siemens.
</P>
<P>
However, the local brands, including the famous HJD-04 and
EIM-601, will gradually expand their market share, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
All the switch makers are expected to register a consumption
volume of 84 million ICs this year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
And about 200 million chips will be used by telephone
manufacturers who will turn out 70 million telephones annually.
</P>
<P>
China will produce 600,000 mobile phones and 2.5 million pagers
this year, consuming as many as 20 million ICs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China's growing trend of ISDN (integrated service
digital network) construction will give rise to IC sales, though
the most SDH (synchronous digital hierarchy) cable projects, which
used to be a major buyer of IC products, has been completed in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Some 22 ISDN networks will be established in 17 provinces by the
end of 1997, according to the paper.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Poll-Related Violence Rocks Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- As Bangladesh is tottering towards
Wednesday's parliamentary elections amid clashes and tension,
fears are mounting that poll-related violence might pose a threat
to the country's political scenario even after the election.
</P>
<P>
In the 11 days up to last Friday, 14 people were killed and 295
injured in 39 reported clashes between supporters of the ex-ruling
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the former largest
opposition the Awami (People's) League (AL).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 120 people were injured in 10 other
clashes between supporters of the BNP and the Jatiya (National)
Party (JP), another former major opposition party in the country.
</P>
<P>
In the days that followed, at least five more people were
killed and several hundred others injured in fights between rival
political parties contesting for the 300 parliamentary seats.
</P>
<P>
The demarcation between the BNP and the opposition camp has
somewhat blurred as nearly every party is interlocked in a snarled
battle for winning the election, with no less confrontation inside
the former anti-BNP alliance -- the AL, the JP and the
Jamamat-E-Islami.
</P>
<P>
"The information clearly shows that the use of violence is
central to the major parties and their students wings," said a
report by five non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
"We do not see any sign of a decrease in violence as the
election nears," the report noted, making observers here worry
that the deteriorating situation might damage the hard-won poll
process in this disaster-prone country.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the caretaker government said it is determined to
hold the elections in a free, fair and peaceful atmosphere. "No
violence is tolerated," Chief Adviser Habibur Rahman has time and
again assured the nation.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken numerous measures in a bid to ward off
untoward incidents and has recovered 4,000 illegal arms since
early April.
</P>
<P>
Over 400,000 members of police and other para-military forces
will be engaged in maintaining law and order throughout the
country on the polling day and more than 40,000 members of the
defense forces are also being deployed to assist the civil
administration.
</P>
<P>
But the power struggle between the main political parties have
apparently fostered a situation of lawlessness and civil strife in
which willful acts of violence have become a routine feature of
the political process in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
With skepticism about a peaceful poll widespread, political
parties, especially the BNP and the AL, are urged to hold their
supporters and cadres within the law for the interest of the
entire nation.

<HEADLINE> More Asians Visit Macao After Airport Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The number of Asia visitors to Macao
increased rapidly this year following the inauguration of the
Macao International Airport late last year, the Macao Daily News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The number of visitors to Macao from Taiwan and the Republic of
Korea doubled during the first five months of the year, a
government official in charge of mass media, tourism and culture
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the increase mainly to the opening of
air routes to the two places. Macao now has daily flights to
Taiwan and weekly flights to Seoul.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of tourists from Hong Kong dropped by four
percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is one of the leading industries in Macao, which was
visited by some eight million people last year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Fujian Vows to Make Water Cleaner, Sky More Blue  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Despite difficulties, east China's
Fujian province has set a target to put environmental pollution
under control within the next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the Fujian provincial bureau for environmental
protection has shown that pollution in the area irrigated by the
Minjiang River, a major river in the province, dust pollution
produced by local construction ceramics industry and waste gas
produced by shoe-making are the three major pollutant sources.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that each year, the Minjiang River receives
more than 800 million tons of industrial and domestic waste water,
and quality of drinking water for cities along the lower reaches
of the river continues to drop; waste gas released by shoe-making
industry in cities of Fuzhou, Putian and Quanzhou has excessively
exceeded set standards, and construction ceramic firms in Jinjiang
and Nan'an counties produce 15,000 tons of dust each year.
</P>
<P>
Fujian province started to tackle the three pollutant producers
a year ago. So far Quanzhou city has closed all glass mosaic
factories and urged enterprises to use dust-reducing technology in
production processes.
</P>
<P>
Waste gas produced by shoe-making factories in Putian city has
been reduced noticeably thanks to the use of purifiers.
</P>
<P>
Fujian provincial planning committee and provincial
construction committee plan to launch a large scale program to
harness the Minjiang River.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 township slurrying factories and small
paper-making mills which produce serious pollution will be shut
down.

<HEADLINE> "Mother" of 129 Tube Babies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Lizhu is the proud "mother"
of 129 children - the youngest three weeks old, the oldest eight
years of age.
</P>
<P>
Hardly surprising Zhang has become a medical hero for many
would-be Chinese mums.
</P>
<P>
When China's first test-tube baby, Meng zhu, was created by
Zhang in 1988, nobody had an idea about the way her family would
just grow and grow.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Zhang is 75-year-old, but she is still leading a group
of scientists working to improve the country's test-tube baby
technology at the Beijing Medical University.
</P>
<P>
All the babies born with Zhang's help live with their own
parents. Zhang can only place the photos of her "sons" and
"daughters" in her office -- along with stacks of
thank-you-letters mailed by her grateful patients nationwide.
</P>
<P>
"I just wish every person can become mother or father," Zhang
was quoted by the "China Women News" as saying.
</P>
<P>
However whenever she was asked for help by mothers who could
not get pregnant she asked them to be cautious.
</P>
<P>
To have a test-tube baby in China costs 6,000 yuan (750 US
Dollars). And the actual tube birth rate is only 19 percent due to
many factors, such as natural aborting.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also insists on refusing people who intended to have a
boy or have more than one child by taking advantage of tube-baby
technology.
</P>
<P>
China's tradition attached greater importance to boys than
girls. And the country is adopting a "One Child" policy to curb
its population explosion.
</P>
<P>
However, for Zhang, who studied medical sciences in the United
States and Britain, modern patriotism might have overweighed
ancient traditions.
</P>
<P>
Ironically few people know that the "mother" of so many tube
babies first was a student of aerospace-engineering. She changed
her speciality just by chance.

SEOUL, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul District Court today
sentenced Chang Hak-ro, a former secretary of South Korean
President Kim Young-sam, to a five-year prison term and a
785,000-U.S.-dollar fine for graft charges.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chang's girlfriend Kim Mi-ja, indicted on charges of
illegally acquiring real estate worth 625,000 dollars, was
sentenced to a one-year prison term with a two-year reprieve.
</P>
<P>
Kim Mi-ja's elder brother Kim Ui-ryung, indicted on similar
charges, was given one and a half year with a three-year reprieve.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the prosecution demanded a seven-year prison term for
Chang, who was charged with taking 900,000 U.S. dollars in
kickbacks from 17 companies while in office from January 1990 to
last March.
</P>
<P>
Chang, 45, became an aide to President Kim in 1977 and was his
"steward" for nearly 20 years. When Kim became president in
February 1993, Chang was named a presidential secretary in charge
of Kim's personal matters.
</P>
<P>
Following Chang's arrest last March, President Kim apologized
to the nation for the graft case involving his personal
secretary.

<HEADLINE> Xining: New Tourist Attraction on Plateau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Xining, capital city of northwest
China's Qinghai province, has become a booming tourist city on the
Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, the world's highest plateau.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of this year, more than 2,100 overseas
travelers stayed at the Qinghai hotel, the province's sole
star-rated hotel, 129 percent more than that in the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated over 10,000 overseas travelers visit the city
each year.
</P>
<P>
With an average temperature of about 17 degrees centigrade in
July and August and abundant rainfall, Xining is an ideal summer
resort, and summer has always been the peak season for its tourism
industry.
</P>
<P>
The Island of Birds in the Qinghai Lake, China's biggest inland
salt water lake, is the most popular destination for travelers in
the province.
</P>
<P>
Next comes the Gumbum Monastery, one of the six major temples
for Tibetan Buddism and the birth place of Tson-kha-pa, the
founder of the Yellow Sect.
</P>
<P>
With mountains and prairies covering most of its territory,
Qinghai is also a ideal place for mountaineering, hunting and
expeditions.
</P>
<P>
Travelers can go westward along the Qinghai-Tibet highway on
the Roof of the World, another name for the Qinghai-Tibetan
Plateau, and reach Lhasa, capital city of Tibet Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
They can also go to an international hunting ground in the west
of the province, or go to the south to seek the sources of the
Yangtze and Yellow rivers on the ice mountains and glaciers.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 mountaineering teams came to Qinghai in the past
three years.
</P>
<P>
An important trading town for people of central China and
ethnic minorities in the north for the past two millennia, Xining
has opened new passages to other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, the city had only one air route with Beijing,
the Chinese capital. It has now opened new routes with six more
Chinese cities such as Guangzhou, Urumqi and Xi'an. Trains can
take travelers from Qinghai to Beijing, Shanghai, Qingdao and many
other cities. And it takes two days from Xining to Lhasa traveling
on luxury buses.

YINCHUAN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region is promoting archeological excavation with the
cooperation of overseas academic institutions.
</P>
<P>
Currently the region is engaged in three archeological
excavation projects with academic institutions from Japan and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia has rich historical relics reserves, especially those
of Northern Wei (386-534), Northern Zhou (557-581) and Western Xia
(1038-1227) dynasties.
</P>
<P>
To utilize advanced overseas methods for determining cultural
relics and overseas funds for excavation work, Ningxia took a lead
in the country by cooperating with overseas institutions.
</P>
<P>
During August and September of 1995, in cooperation with
experts from a university in Tokyo, Ningxia Administration of
Museums and Archeological Materials, Cultural Bureau excavated a
number of ancient tombs dating back to Northern Dynasties to Tang
Dynasty in suburbs of Guyuan (386-907).
</P>
<P>
The unearthed painted pottery warrior figures and animal
figures are rarely seen among the unearthed China's historical
relics.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia also signed three archeological excavation agreements
with Japan, Italy and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ningxia arranged several cultural relic
exhibitions in Japan and Hong Kong and an additional show will be
held in Croatia Museum from September to December of this year, in
an effort to popularize its cultural relices.

<HEADLINE> Democracy in HK Will Surely Continue after 1997, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 11 (Xinhua) -- There is no question of the end
of democracy in Hong Kong after 1997, Lu Ping, the top-ranking
Chinese official in charge of the Hong Kong and Macao affairs,
declared here today.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a public lecture on China's policy and Approaches on
the Future of Hong Kong, Mr. Lu, Director of the Hong Kong and
Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said that in the final
400 days before Hong Kong returns to China on July 1, 1997, he had
read "some very negative comments on Hong Kong's future".
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he said that questions, such as the end of
democracy in Hong Kong after 1997, were raised by foreign
visitors, and therefore, he was concerned about the
misunderstandings on China's policy on Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to clear the misunderstandings, Mr. Lu said in his
lecture that in Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, it
is clearly stipulated that the pace of democratization of
elections in Hong Kong shall be conducted in a gradual and orderly
way, with universal suffrage as its ultimate aim.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the Legislative Council, Mr. Lu said that the
terms of office of the incumbent legislative council members will
end automatically when Britain departs from Hong Kong and that new
elections will be conducted after June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Lu said that the planned new elections became necessary
only after Britain reneged on the earlier agreement it reached
with China and after the current British Governor pressed forward
legislation to unilaterally change the system for the 1995
election.
</P>
<P>
Lu explained that "When unilateral changes were made in the
election process, in violation of an agreement reached and in
violation of the Basic Law," China has no other choice but to
arrange new elections "according to the Basic Law and the decision
of the National People's Congress, since the present legislative
council will have no legal basis whatever after June 30, 1997,"
Mr. Lu explained
</P>
<P>
The elections will be conducted in conformity with the
stipulations of the Basic Law, and they will be open and fair, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also said that in the interim period, before the full
elections for the first legislative council can take place, there
needs to be a body performing the duties of the legislative
council, including enacting election laws for the first
legislature.
</P>
<P>
China has decided, after much deliberation, to form a
provisional legislative council, which will be elected by a 400
Member electoral college that will represent broad sections of the
Hong Kong people and have restricted powers and a term of no more
than a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The intention is that the first full legislative council
election will be held within one year from July 1, 1997. This
interim measure is necessary to ensure a smooth transition," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Hariri Hopes to Promote Lebanese-Chinese Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri said Lebanon and China enjoy good relations and he hoped
the economic and political relations between the two countries
would be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks here in an exclusive interview with Xinhua
on the eve of his visit to China. Hariri is scheduled to pay an
official visit to China from June 13 to 16, the first by a
Lebanese leader to China since the establishment of diplomatic
relations between the two countries in 1972.
</P>
<P>
"The visit is aimed at consolidating the relations between
Lebanon and China, explaining the Lebanese position and the Middle
East problems to the Chinese leaders and finding ways to increase
cooperation between the two countries," said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's visit comes at a time when the Lebanese government is
making efforts to rally international support for Lebanon's
position in the Middle East peace process and financial aid for
Lebanon's ambitious reconstruction plan masterminded by the
billionaire prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Talking to Xinhua correspondents in the library of his
residence in western Beirut, Hariri stressed that Lebanon and
China enjoy good relations and they always support and help each
other on the international stages.
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanese-Chinese relations are always good," he
said. "Lebanon is always within China's concern, and China always
supports Lebanon's legitimate cause."
</P>
<P>
"At all international occasions, no matter whether in the
United Nations, in the Security Council and in every
international meeting if a topic relating to Lebanon is raised,
China always takes positive positions," the Lebanese leader
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, father of four sons and a daughter, said that "the
economic relations between Lebanon and China have been widened and
developed, especially since China adopted policies of reform and
opening up."
</P>
<P>
He noted that China can use Lebanon's advantages of "good
relations with other Arab countries and in the Middle East" to
expand its trade.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon is capable to play a basical role in marketing the
Chinese goods in the region," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Hariri reiterated Lebanon's "unshakable stand" of supporting
the Chinese territorial integrity and sovereignty and its
understanding on the term of "one China."
</P>
<P>
"We highly appreciate and respect the great Chinese people,
respect their history and respect their firm positions on the Arab
causes," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to establish wider relations with China in various
aspects, political and economic," he added.
</P>
<P>
The 52-year-old Sunni prime minister, who took office in
October, 1992, is a prime minister of the longest term in office
in Lebanon since the end of the 1975-90 civil war.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is an important trade partner of China in the Middle
East, and the trade between the two countries had witnessed a
sharp increase in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics of the Chinese Customs, the volume of
trade between China and Lebanon, which had never exceeded 49.90
million U.S. dollars in the 1970s and 1980s, increased noticeably to
141,60 million dollars in 1995 from 49.99 million dollars in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean-South African Trade Pact Under </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and South Africa on
Monday set up three technical committees which were tasked to
examine implications of a new preferential trade pact that is
mutually beneficial to both countries.
</P>
<P>
A one-day tough and crucial meeting was held in Zimbabwe's
northern resort Town of Victoria Falls to thrash out a new trade
pact that will replace the 1964 agreement which South Africa
terminated in 1992, plunging the Zaimbabwean economy into a
crisis and triggering a trade imbalance of four to one in favour
of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a session attended by two delegations from the two
countries, Zimbabwe's Industry and Commerce Minister Nathan
Shamuyarira and his South African counterpart Alec Erwin said
that the committees have been given three weeks to conclude the
task before the two countries meet again in South Africa at the
end of June.
</P>
<P>
The three committes are committee on textile and clothing,
committee on agricultural production and committee on footwear
and leather. Problems arising from textle and clothing,
agricultural production, and footwear and leather are reportedly
dominated the discussions since South Africa introduced punitive
tariffs on Zimbabwean products.
</P>
<P>
''We have set up these committees because we need to go into
greater detail to improve trade between the two countries,'' said
Shamuyarira, who described the talks as constructive and full of
consensus.
</P>
<P>
''We are conscious of the trade imbalance and the need for a
mutually beneficial solution because we realize there is a great
deal of scope to improve flows of trade between our two
countries,'' said Erwin. He described the talks as " tough and
realistic".
</P>
<P>
However, Erwin said that whatever final agreement is to be
reached, it will be a modification of the one which South Africa
terminated in 1992.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that his country would continue to press for a
Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) multilateral trade
agreement.

<HEADLINE> Live TV Program Puts Officials On The Spot Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A Shanghai TV program that puts
senior government officials on the spot to solve problems has
become a hot favorite on the small screen.
</P>
<P>
Since Shanghai Cable Television Station launched the live
program of dialogue between local officials and residents the
problems of many citizens have been quickly solved.
</P>
<P>
June 8 was a day for showing official-citizen dialogues. Two
officials of Zhabei District, the tenth group of local officials
at district level, arrived at the TV studios to exchange views
with local residents on the development of urban areas and helping
solve problems for citizens.
</P>
<P>
During the one-hour program many citizens made phone calls to
the studio, discussing with officials problems on reconstruction
of old city areas, building of commercial networks, environment
and public health, security and welfare of communities.
</P>
<P>
Some of the citizens made complains while others offered
advice.
</P>
<P>
When leaving the studio, an official of the Zhabei District
said this was the first time he had faced such a large audience
and answered the questions raised immediately.
</P>
<P>
He said through the program local officials can learn what the
citizens are most concerned about, and tell them the plans of the
local government.
</P>

Statistics show that the televised program has been widely
welcomed by nearly all of the 1.58 million subscribers of Shanghai

According to follow-up investigations made by Shanghai Cable

month.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, citizens made their complaints by
writing letters to officials or through dialogues aired by radio
stations. Putting officials on the spot, in the face of TV
cameras, is a new way of showing local government in action.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea to Provide Food Aid to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korea decided today to give
three million U.S. dollars in food aid to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK), Deputy Prime Minister and National
Unification Board Minister Kwon O-kie said.
</P>
<P>
Seoul will provide the aid to the DPRK through international
relief organizations "on humanitarian and brotherly-love grounds",
Kwon told reporters here after a meeting of unification-related
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Of the aid, two million dollars will be in cash for the DPRK to
buy powdered food for children, such as powdered milk, and the
remaining one million will be in powdered milk for babies.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's decision was made following the United Nations
appeal for 43.6 million dollars in emergency aid to help ease the
food shortages caused by devastating floods in the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The Seoul government will thus resume food aid to the DPRK nine
months after it shipped 150,000 tons of rice to Pyongyang late
last year.
</P>
<P>
However, South Korean officials said Seoul is not going to give
the DPRK a large amount of aid unless it meets the conditions for
such aid.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Japan will also provide the DPRK with several
million dollars in food aid respectively.

BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The number of lawyers in China's
capital Beijing has increased rapidly through 10 years of reform
and development.
</P>
<P>
The number of law offices has increased from more than 20 to
the current over 240; number of local lawyers now stands at over
3,700, ten times the figure for the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Naxin, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Judicial
Bureau, said that Beijing first introduced a cooperative system in
developing law offices in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Under the reform state-owned law offices were moved outside the
role of government bodies, and become self-funded and self-paid
law offices.
</P>
<P>
In 1990 Beijing introduced a partnership system into local law
office developments.
</P>
<P>
Beijing began to award qualified titles to lawyers through
examinations in 1986. Statistics show that at present more than 20
percent of local lawyers are doctors, postgraduates and students
returning from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Legal services have expanded from former criminal cases and
civil cases to cases involving finance, stocks and securities,
foreign-funded industries, intellectual property rights and
science and technology patents.
</P>
<P>
Beijing also has its own lawyers' association which is
responsible for training, awarding and disciplining lawyers;
guiding and popularizing professional work, and safeguarding
lawyers' legitimate rights and interests.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Folk Artist Makes Jade Instruments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A folk artist in northwest China
has used jade to make a violin and an erhu, China's traditional
two-stringed instrument.
</P>
<P>
Gu Yangfeng and his assistant Wu Kun, who live in Mujiaba
Township, Nanzheng County of Shaanxi Province, spent more than
four months carving 30 pieces of jade to make the instruments, the
Guangzhou-based "Yangcheng Evening News" said.
</P>
<P>
The jade violin weights about 1.5 kilograms, 0.7 kg heavier
than a wooden violin. The 3.3-kg jade erhu also is heavier than
a traditional one, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Both instruments sounded "harmonious and beautiful," according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
The unique musical instruments will be shown in the Chinese
capital and played for the first time at a party marking the
opening of the 30th International Geology Conference in Beijing
August.

<HEADLINE> Likud Issues Draft Guidelines for New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel's new government will
negotiate with Palestinians but rules out the establishment of a
Palestinian state and any compromise on Jerusalem and the Golan
Heights, the Likud said in its draft guidelines published today.
</P>
<P>
The Likud party began circulating the guidelines on Monday
among its potential coalition partners in efforts to form the new
government by June 17, when the new Knesset (parliament) convenes
for the first time, the English-language daily, The Jerusalem
Post, reported today.
</P>
<P>
The document announced that the new government will negotiate
with the Palestinian Authority (PA), while failing to specify at
what level these contacts will be maintained. The Oslo accords
were not mentioned.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines said the government "will offer the
Palestinians a self-rule arrangement in which they can freely run
their affairs, but will oppose the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state."
</P>
<P>
The document claimed the government will "deploy its troops and
other security forces to counter the terrorist threat, as
necessary and anywhere, to safeguard the security of Israelis and
Jews".
</P>
<P>
A special section is devoted to Jerusalem, saying the
government will keep "united" and "indivisible" Jerusalem as its
capital, and "prevent any action incongruent with Israel's
exclusive sovereignty in the city".
</P>
<P>
This is interpreted as a warning to the PA institutions in
eastern Jerusalem, especially the Orient House.
</P>
<P>
In very generalized terms, the guidelines briefly mentioned of
"strengthening, expanding and developing settlements throughout
the land."
</P>
<P>
On the Golan Heights, the document vowed it "must be left under
Israeli's sovereignty," because it is "vital for the defense of
the state and the protection of its water resources."
</P>
<P>
The guidelines affirmed that the new government will "strive
to expand peace with all our neighbors, while vigilantly
safeguarding national and personal security and protecting
Israel's vital interests."
</P>
<P>
The government will deepen the peaceful relations with Egypt
and Jordan, and will negotiate with Syria without any
preconditions.
</P>
<P>
On economic issues, the document said the government will make
efforts to cut the deficits through cutting government
expenditures and strict budgeting.
</P>
<P>
These hardline policies, if implemented, are expected to
derail the Israeli-palestinian peace process championed by the
outgoing Labor government, and strain the Israeli-Arab relations.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demand the establishment of an independent
state with east Jerusalem as its capital after the final-status
talks with Israel, and strongly oppose the expansion of Jewish
settlements in its territories.
</P>
<P>
Syria has already ruled out the possibility of Syrian-Israeli
peace before Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights seized by
Israel in 1967.
</P>
<P>
In the first reaction to the guidelines which were leaked
before the publishment, the Palestinian side denounced them as
"declaration of war" last week.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala), chief Palestinian negotiator
at Oslo and speaker of the Palestinian Council, said:" I don't
want to pour oil on the fire, but I don't think this is a
solution."

<HEADLINE> East China Province Vows to Protect Fish Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Fishery authorities in east
China's Zhejiang Province have vowed to take stricter measures to
control excessive fishing of small fish in East China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Local fishery authorities have decided to strengthen
inspections of fishing boats in the late fishing off-season this
year.
</P>
<P>
Under regulations to protect fish resources, the proportion of
small fish weighing less than 125 grams is not allowed to exceed
25 percent per 50 kilograms of cutlass fish. Violators are
threatened with severe punishments.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang provincial fishery authorities have plans to tell and
guide fishermen to abide by concerned regulations and adjust their
fishing seasons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local fishery authorities will also cooperate with
public security departments and industrial and commercial
administrative bureaus to enhance supervision and inspection on
fishing in the East China Sea area.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang Province started to implement regulations to stop
fishing during July and August in 1995, which has improved
protection of small fish resources in the fishing grounds of the
East China Sea.

<HEADLINE> Maize Production Expanded in Southern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China has increased maize growing in
its southern provinces, in an effort to meet their need for animal
feed.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months this year, only Hubei, Hunan and
Jiangxi provinces extended their maize production acreage by some
86,670 hectares, according to a meeting held on maize production
in southern China.
</P>
<P>
Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi
and Fujian in southern China are the country's major rice
production areas. About 6.6 million hectares of land in the area
are favorable for growing maize as well.
</P>
<P>
However, the southern provinces have to transport over 10
billion kilograms of corn as fodder for domestic animals from
northern provinces every year, which limited the development of
animal husbandry in the southern areas and added pressure to
China's railway transportation.
</P>
<P>
To meet the demand of southern China's fodder market, the
Ministry of Agriculture decided in 1994 to launch maize growing
projects in southern provinces.
</P>
<P>
The ministry plans to increase the maize production acreage in
southern China by 166,000 hectares by 1997 and rise the annual
corn output by 1.57 billion kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Since the implementation of the maize production promotion
plan, local authorities of the eight provinces and one autonomous
region have provided special funds for maize production and some
of them established maize production bases.
</P>
<P>
The development of maize production in southern China will not
be at the expense of rice production, an official of the National
Agricultural Technology Promotion Center said.
</P>
<P>
He said the southern provinces interplant maize with rice or
cotton, turn low-yielding rice land into maize land and promote
high-yielding maize growing technologies.
</P>
<P>
Maize production ranks third in China's grain production after
rice and wheat.
</P>
<P>
During China's Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), China
has determined to increase its grain production by 50 billion
kilograms. Of that amount, 16.5 billion kilograms will be corn.

</P>
<P>
She is only one of an increasing number of career women in

</P>
<P>
Nowadays more and more Shanghai women are seeking to improve
their image in public after taking advice from image designers on
make-up, hair-styles, dress and deportment.
</P>
<P>
Most of the women who visit image designers are actresses,
nurses, teachers and employees in joint ventures. Other people
also consult image designers before important appointments,
prior to job interviews or before wedding ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
A number of image designing companies have been established in
the city to cater for the trend.
</P>
<P>
At the same time many photographic studios and beauty parlors
have started to offer image design services.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai women can also get image design information from
popular newspapers and magazines, such as "Xinmin Evening News"
and "Modern Family".
</P>
<P>

Textile University, and China's first professional image designer,
started writing special columns for several magazines and has
written four books on the subject.
</P>
<P>
Yang also teaches thousands of students by correspondence
courses.
</P>
<P>
The young lady said that with the development of the economy,
promotion of urban culture and civilization, Shanghai citizens

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Southeast China's Fujian Province
plans to use overseas investment for the development of Fujian
Agricultural Science and Technology Zone.
</P>
<P>
Located 18 kilometers from Fuzhou, the provincial capital, the
46-square-kilometer agricultural zone was listed among one of
China's 10 state-level agricultural development demonstration
zones by the State Science and Technology Commission in September
1995.
</P>
<P>
The province has worked out favorable policies on land leasing
and taxes for the comprehensive development of the agricultural
zone with advanced science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural zone has five parts. Its comprehensive test
part expects overseas investment on development of flowers, fruit
tree saplings, the breeding of tropical fish, rare birds and
aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural and animal husbandry part is to introduce
overseas investment for growing quality rice, vegetables without
pollution, edible fungus, and the breeding of dairy cows and egg
laying ducks.
</P>
<P>
The zone's forest and fruit trees part is designed to build
forest parks, villas and farms for breeding special varieties of
animals.
</P>
<P>
The processing industry part plans to promote refined
processing of farm and side-line produce, light industry,
electronic industry and service trades.
</P>
<P>
And the zone's fifth part is to build a holiday village
surrounded with litchi trees.

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping Confident of Hong Kong's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Lu Ping, Director of the Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council of China, said
here today that the "one country, two systems" policy will work
in Hong Kong after 1997, though it is "an entirely new concept and
a new endeavor without precedence".
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a public lecture, entitled "China's Policy and
Approaches On the Future of Hong Kong", Mr. Lu said, "to have two
different social, economic, political and legal systems co-exist
in one country is an entirely new concept and a new endeavor
without any precedence. But I am confident that it will work".
</P>
<P>
Adding quickly that he was not claiming China's knowledge of
governing a capitalist society, Mr. Lu, reiterated that it would
be the Hong Kong people who will be ruling Hong Kong after 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Except for foreign affairs and defense, which will be handled
by the Central Government, everything else will remain the same:
the legal system, the existing life style, the currency, the
economic and financial policies and so on," he said.
</P>
<P>
The lecture was organized by the Institute of East Asia
Political Economy of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"In 1997, we envisage a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong,
much more than now. It will have its own administrative and
legislative powers. No departments or provinces in the Mainland
will be allowed to interfere in the daily affairs of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR)", Mr. Lu said.
</P>
<P>
"It will have its own police force and customs authority, not
subordinate to those of the Mainland. It will have its independent
judiciary, its own Court of Final Appeal. Financially, it will
also be independent, without having to contribute a single cent to
the Central Government, and the Central Government will not levy
taxes in Hong Kong," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Lu arrived here last Saturday on a four-day visit here at
the invitation of the Singapore Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar.

<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Three Chinese companies involved
in producing and selling pirated compact discs (CDs) have been
punished, the Press and Publication Administration announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
The business licences of the Chaoyang Jinfa CD Technology
Company and the Zhongshan Yisheng CD Production Company, two
Guangdong-based companies, have been revoked by the Press and
Publication Administration and the State Copyright Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Pirated products made by them have been confiscated and

"The move again shows the Chinese government's firm stand of
protecting intellectual property rights and fighting copyright
piracy," a spokesman for the Press and Publication Administration
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a number of laws and regulations have been issued
to bring the CD market into order and since later last year the

<HEADLINE> Peres Weighs Issue of Labor Leadership Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Shimon Peres and
Labor Party Secretary-General Nissim Zvilli Monday night
reportedly discussed the issue of advancing the party's
leadership primary, which had been raised by some senior party
officials.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ehud Barak, supported by some ministers, has
been pushing for a primary by the end of the year in the wake of
Labor's defeat in the general elections.
</P>
<P>
"Peres is the only one who will set the party's timetable
for the leadership elections," Zvilli said.
</P>
<P>
Labor's political bureau is due to convene to debate the issue
after the new Knesset is sworn in next week.
</P>
<P>
Barak discussed the issue with Peres in what was described as a
positive, friendly conversation, and it was reported that he will
leave the decision up to Peres. Barak also canceled a scheduled
meeting of ministers and Knesset Members who support him Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
Barak's rival, Interior Minister Haim Ramon came out against
early elections, and blasted Barak indirectly for trying to
undermine Peres' authority.
</P>
<P>
"It is too early to act to change the leadership and to start a
fight over who will head the party," he said. "The new government
hasn't even been set up yet, and already some people are pushing
the prime minister to go home. It's neither respectable nor the
way to behave when you lose. Peres has contributed to the state
and to the party for many years and he deserved to complete his
term as party leader in a dignified manner."
</P>
<P>
He said he has not yet decided whether to run for the party
leadership. "I want to know what kind of party I'm running in and
what the election system will be," he said, reiterating his call
for an open primary, in which the entire public can vote.
</P>
<P>
Member Of Knesset (MK) Dalia Itzik, who is contending for the
position of secretary-general, also came out against moving up
the elections. She said Peres intends to spend the next year
rehabilitating the party, as he has done in the past.
</P>
<P>
"His leadership is essential, at least for the first year
after electoral defeat. He is the cement which can mend the
rifts in the party, and most MKs feel the same way," she
said.

<HEADLINE> Crested Ibis Are A Growing Family in Shaanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The crested ibis natural reserve zone
in Yangxian County in northwest China's Shaanxi Province has added
another 21 chicks to the group this year, setting a new record of
breeding, and increasing the number of the crested ibis to 80.
</P>
<P>
"Its breeding situation has improved a lot this year, " said Lu
Baozhong, the director of the protection and observation station
for the crested ibis in Yangxian County.
</P>
<P>
Of the 21 newly-bred birds, 14 were born in wild areas and 7
were incubated artificially. The rate of egg-laying and survival
has hit the highest record.
</P>
<P>
The number of wild nests has risen from last year's 5 to this
year's 8, and they tend to be located in areas with lower
elevations. A nest was found recently in an area 480 meters above
sea level, while they were seen only in mountain areas from
800--1,200 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
Fruitful research results have been achieved in artificially
breeding the bird, especially in how to control the temperature
and moisture. So the incubation survival rate has increased
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Fixed observation stations have been set up around every nest,
watching over the birds day in and day out, and measures have been
taken to protect the birds from their natural enemies.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the local government has worked out a series of
regulations to protect the bird's natural habitat from
encroachment by the people. The government also provides feed for
the birds, amounting to 2,000 kg of food each year, to ensure its
survival and flourishment.

<HEADLINE> One Country's Law Cannot Be Imposed on Others: Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Joining the chorus of opposition
to a U.S. law tightening sanctions against Cuba, Venezuelan
Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas said today that no law
enacted in one country can be imposed on other countries.
</P>
<P>
This is a principle of international law that cannot be
questioned, he told a press conference in reference to the
Helms-Burton Act which was passed by the U.S. Congress in March
following the shooting down of two American light aircraft by
Cuban jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
The law, which came into effect on May 29, penalizes foreign
companies that do business with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"Laws have a limit, which is the geographical boundary of the
country which dictates it, period. We do not believe it reaches
us," said Burelli Rivas.
</P>
<P>
He said Venezuela has economic relations with Cuba and
Venezuelan businessmen may be interested in increasing trade with
the Caribbean island state.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that there is no need to present, over this matter,
any protest against the law that is trying to interrupt those
relations," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that the United States would abide by a
resolution approved by the general assembly of the Organization of
the American States (OAS), which refers the matter to the
inter-American legal committee for an opinion.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton law was extensively criticized by Latin
American countries during the five-day OAS general assembly, which
closed on June 7.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official to Push Bosnian Military Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. defense official arrived
here today for talks with Bosnian Muslim and Croat leaders in a
bid to clear the way for an American "equip and train" program to
strengthen their joint army.
</P>
<P>
The program, put forward by Washington last year, has been
delayed because the Muslims and Croats failed to meet two U.S.-set
preconditions -- a merger of their forces and Muslims' suspension
of military cooperation with Iran.
</P>
<P>
"We must move on. The security of the people of Bosnia is at
stake here and time is running out," James Pardew, head of the
program, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Pardew was to meet with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and
Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation President Kresimir Zubak.
</P>
<P>
The United States hopes that through its multi-million-dollar
training program, the Muslim-Croat army can counterbalance strong
Bosnian Serb force after the withdrawal of the NATO-led Peace
Implementation Force (IFOR).
</P>
<P>
The Muslims and Croats have agreed to establish a joint army
within three years but failed to smooth over their wide
differences over some concrete issues.
</P>
<P>
They still distrust each other since being forced into the
federation by the United States in early 1994 after fighting a
bitter 10-month war. Moreover, the federation parliament refused
to pass a defence law last week on the integration of the two
armies.
</P>
<P>
On the second condition from the U.S., the Bosnian Muslim-led
government says it has expelled all foreign troops and ended an
intelligence relationship with Iran. But Washington, which insists
that the Islamic fighters a menace to its troops in Bosnia, says a
small number of Iranian agents still remain in the
Muslim-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
Pardew will also meet Croatian President Franjo Tudjman in
Zagreb on Tuesday to discuss how to strengthen the Muslim-Croat
Federation.

VIENNA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union today called for
laws and other measures to combat trafficking in women which
experts at a conference here said is a growing problem.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the two-day conference, EU commissioner Anita Gradin

work in the sex trade and other illegal activities infringe on
women's rights.

against the problem by imposing stiffer penalties on traffickers
and protecting their victims.

Austrian Interior Minister Caspar Einem said that his
government had set up a ministerial committee specifically to deal
with the problem.

<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A Mongolian weekly today
carried an article to denounce a Russian newspaper for
unilaterally publishing the figure of debt Mongolia owes Russia.
</P>
<P>
The World News article said that the debt issue has been an
obstacle blocking the bilateral relations between Mongolia and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
It described the story on the Russian newspaper of Arguments
and Facts as regrettable in that the newspaper cannot provide
proof for its report which claims Mongolia to be the second
largest debtor nation and to owe Russia 18 billion U.S. dollars in
all.
</P>
<P>
The Russian newspaper attributed its source to a research
center of social studies under the Federation of the Russian
Commercial Round-Table.
</P>
<P>
The World News weekly article hinted that the research center
was not an official institution entrusted to publish state
statistics.
</P>
<P>
The article quoted Russian Duma (lower house of parliament)
Chairman Gennady Seleznev as saying that Russia should not
consider past aid given gratis to Mongolia as debt and that Russia
should reduce the total amount of debt owed by Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
The lower house speaker made the remark at a Moscow press
conference not long ago upon returning from a Mongolia visit.

<HEADLINE> Garbage Brought down from World's Highest Mountain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Nearly two tons of garbage was
brought to the Nepali capital of Kathmandu Monday by a helicopter
from Qomolangma Feng (Mt. Everest) on Nepal's northern border in a
mission to clean up the world's hottest mountaineering area.
</P>
<P>
The 1,800-kilogram solid waste, including empty oxygen
cylinders, food cans, tents, broken ladders and plastic bags, had
been dumped in the mountain area by climbing teams from around the
world during the past four decades in their bid to conquer the
world's highest peak.
</P>
<P>
Most of the garbage was collected at mountain camps and the
South Col, a path leading to the 8,848-meter summit.
</P>
<P>
The clean-up campaign was initiated last April jointly by the
Nepali Tourism Ministry and the Nepal Mountaineering Association
(NMA) to remove the increasing garbage accumulation in the area.
</P>
<P>
A 19-member NMA expedition began to gather waste six weeks ago
while having to carry out rescue work in the mean time to help
climbers due to bad weather in the area in early May, a press
statement of the NMA said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Pieces of the wreckage of an Italian helicopter that crashed in
the area in 1973 were among the garbage.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali clean-up team earlier brought a dead body of an
unknown Western climber from a high camp to the base camp at a
height of 6,000 meters and cremated it.
</P>
<P>
According to NMA President Dawa Norbu Sherpa, 15 tons of
garbage and at least eight dead bodies remain at different places
above the 6,500-meter-high Camp Two.
</P>
<P>
The clean-up team plans to resume its mission next year and
remove all the dead bodies left in the area, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chile, China to Step up Cooperation in Forestry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Chile and China should enhance
bilateral relations and cooperation, particularly in the sector of
forestry, Chilean Senate Leader Sergio Diez said while meeting
Chinese Forestry Minister Xu Youfang here today.
</P>
<P>
Chile and China are two countries joined by great friendship,
Diez said. "Our people are very much concerned about what is
happening in China".
</P>
<P>
Xu and his delegation arrived in Santiago on Sunday to know
more about Chile's forestry development and experiences in
planting the "Radiata" pine tree for expanded cooperation in the
forestry sector.
</P>
<P>
Rich in forest resources, Chile has 34 million hectares, or 45
percent of its land, suitable for growing forests. Of which, 14
million are protected forests.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chilean Agriculture Minister Emiliano Ortega told
the Xu that China would be the primary customer of Chilean
forestry products in the future.
</P>
<P>
Chile exported 65.9 million dollars of forestry products to
China in 1995, which was 25 percent of its total sales to the
Asian country.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Chile's forest exports reached 2.369 billion
dollars, or 14.7 percent of its total exports, becoming the second
major export sector after copper.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 11 (Xinhua) -- At least seven people were
killed and dozens injured in three separate bomb blasts that
rocked Punjab province in Pakistan on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The first bomb ripped through a passenger bus in Gujranwala, a
city about 130 kilometers north of the Punjab provincial capital
of Lahore, killing four passengers and injuring 35, 17 of whom
were in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
The blast is the third passenger-bus blast in the province
since April.
</P>
<P>
At least 52 people were killed in a bus blast on April 28 and
eight others died in another blast on May 8.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, two powerful bombs exploded almost
simultaneously in Kamoke, a town several kilometers south of
Gujranwala, killing three people and injuring about 20.
</P>
<P>
One bomb exploded at a busy shopping center and the other went
off at a restaurant 10 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
The confrontation between the government and the ethnic group
of Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM) (Altaf Group) led to violence in
the southern port city of Karachi last year, claiming about 1,800
lives.
</P>
<P>
The law and order situation improved considerably this year due
to the government's strict measures to check the outlaws.
</P>
<P>
But the relatively peaceful Punjab has been shocked by a series
of bomb blasts in the last few months, which claimed more than 70
lives.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India blame each other for the bomb blasts in
their own countries, yet neither has backed up the allegations
with any evidence.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Rubber Exchange to Be Set up in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A long-delayed rubber exchange is
expected to emerge soon in Thailand as the country is speeding up
clearances of major obstacles for the market.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has recently approved an amendment to
trading regulations to allow the establishment of the exchange to
facilitate the setting of market prices.
</P>
<P>
The Thai parliament, which has rejected several attempts to
amend the 1983 Rubber Control Act banning the market in the past
years, is likely to give green light to the amendment after the
cabinet approval.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is seeking cooperation from rubber exchanges of other
countries, including Japan, Malaysia and Singapore, for the
establishment of such a market.
</P>
<P>
Top executives of the Kobe Rubber Exchange, one of the largest
in Japan, recently visited Thailand and met officials of relevant
Thai departments, the Thai Rubber Research Institute and the
Rubber Traders' Association.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese side has shown interest in helping Thailand set up
the exchange and agreed to send experts to train Thai officials
and staff for the exchange.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's rubber output, which has topped the world's list
since 1992, reached 1.8 million tons in 1995, followed by
Indonesia with 1.47 million tons and Malaysia with 1.01 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
The country's rubber production will go further up, as the
government is encouraging farmers in the northeast to plant rubber
as a supplementary crop, in addition to the traditional rubber
production base in the south.
</P>
<P>
By 2001, the total area of rubber crop in Thailand is expected
to increase to 1.9 million hectares from the current 1.44 million
hectares, with about 85 percent in the south, 10 percent in the
east and five percent in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's rubber production is largely export-oriented. Last
year, 34 percent of its total export went to Japan, 14 percent to
the United States and nine percent to China.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Farmers Bank Research Center predicted that the
country's rubber export this year may grow 19.6 percent over last
year, reaching 948 million US dollars in terms of value.
</P>
<P>
The increasing rubber production and export have entailed the
facilitation of rubber trade through a rubber exchange in the
country. Analysts said that the exchange would place Thailand on
par with other major rubber producers in the capability to quote
prices.

BUENOS AIRES, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Argentine army chief said
today his country hoped to recover Malvinas Islands through
diplomatic approach.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the Day of Reaffirmation of Sovereignty over the

people. Since then, Malvinas Islands have been ruled by Britain.
</P>

The Day of Reaffirmation of the Sovereignty of the Malvinas

<HEADLINE> Over 5 Million Child Labor in Latin America: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Some 5.1 million children, aging
between 10-14, are working in Latin America, a report from the
International Labor Organization (ILO) said today.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 1.3 million were in Haiti where the percentage of
working children was 25.3 in 1995, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala ranked second with 16.22 percent, followed by Brazil
with 16.09 percent, the Dominican Republic 16.06 percent, Bolivia
14.36 percent and Nicaragua 14.05 percent.
</P>
<P>
The problem of child labor was less serious in such countries
as Paraguay, Mexico, Colombia, Costa Rica, Argentina, Peru and
Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela reportedly enjoyed the lowest percentage of working
children with only 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report put the child labor in the world at some 73 million.
</P>
<P>
The document was published as more than 2,000 representatives
including some 100 labor ministers from 173 member countries are
now in Geneva, the ILO's headquarters, for the organization's
annual meeting, which began on June 4.
</P>
<P>
During the three-week long meeting, the participants will
mainly discuss issues such as employment promotion, new measures
against child labor and family labor protection.

<HEADLINE> Almost 600,000 Women A Year Die Giving Birth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Approximately 585,000 women a year,
or 1,600 a day, die in pregnancy or childbirth, the U.N.
Children's Fund (UNICEF) said today in a report calling for global
attention and effort to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity.
</P>
<P>
In addition, at least 15 million women a year are permanently
injured from complications in pregnancy or childbirth, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
"For every woman who dies, approximately 30 more suffer
injuries, infections and disabilities which are usually untreated
and unspoken of, and are often humiliating and painful,
debilitating and lifelong," UNICEF noted.
</P>
<P>
The highest number of maternal deaths is reported in the Asia-
Pacific, at 291,000 per year, followed by Sub-Saharan Africa with
219,000.
</P>
<P>
More than 140,000 women a year die from haemorrhaging, the
report said. Another 100,000 women die of sepsis, the poisoning
of the bloodstream by infection from an unhealed uterus or pieces
of placenta that are not expelled and begin to fester.
</P>
<P>
The report said about 75,000 pregnant women die from brain and
kidney damage during convulsions known as eclampsia, while another
75,000 die from self-inflicted abortions.
</P>
<P>
Millions of women suffer from rupture or prolapse of the
uterus, lower genital tract injuries and other internal
damage. The most distressing of all is fistula, caused by
prolonged labor that damages tissues in the birth canal and leads
to incontinence.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF said that about 80,000 women develop fistula annually,
most of them going untreated, although the condition can be cured
with surgery. Currently between 500,000 and one million women are
living with the problem.
</P>
<P>
Anaemia, the most hidden of all maternal injuries, affects an
estimated 14 million women every year. Among them, over three
million women may experience hypopituitarism, or Sheehan's
syndrome, which causes premature aging. About 100,000 women a
year die of Sheehan's syndrome.
</P>
<P>
To reduce maternal mortality and morbidity, UNICEF said that it
is necessary to make high-quality family planning services
available to all who need them.
</P>
<P>
Meeting the existing demand for such services would reduce
pregnancies in the developing world by up to 20 percent, and hence
at least an equivalent drop in maternal deaths and injuries, it
added.
</P>
<P>
Family planning also means fewer abortions, better health and
nutrition of women and children.
</P>
<P>
At present, family planning accounts for less than 2 percent of
all government health spending in the developing world, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Chechen Rebels Sign Peace Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian and rebel Chechen
negotiators finally signed an agreement today to end the 18-month
fighting in the breakaway Chechen republic, the Itar-Tass news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was hammered out after the two sides unexpectedly
made concessions to each other on the fate of the Chechen
parliamentary elections, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to postpone the June 16 Chechen parliamentary
elections until after a complete withdrawal of Russian troops from
the breakaway republic by the end of August. Until the agreement,
Moscow had refused to discuss the Chechen polls by arguing that it
was an internal affair of the Chechen government while the
separatists had demanded the cancellation of the "illegal"
elections.
</P>
<P>
The agreement does not set an exact date for the delayed
elections, saying only they would be held under international
surveillance.
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides that the separatists should lay down
arms in return for the pull-out of the Russian troops, without
mentioning whether the two actions will proceed simultaneously as
proposed by Russia.
</P>
<P>
The document, signed in Nazron, capital of the Ingushetia
region bordering Chechnya, also calls on the Russian troops to end
their blockade on all rebels-held villages by tearing down posts
around them from June 11 to July 17.
</P>
<P>
However, the two sides reaffirmed their commitments to a
fragile truce which had already been in force in Chechnya since
June 1 in line with a broad peace deal signed earlier in
Moscow. The agreement bans all forms of military operations and
the use of all kinds of weapons.
</P>
<P>
A joint working team will be set up before June 11 on the
release of detainees held by both sides. The lists of detainees
will be exchanged on June 11 and their release will follow
immediately.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen conflict erupted in December 1994 when President
Boris Yeltsin ordered troops and tanks into the North Caucasian
region to quell its independence wave surging in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The war has claimed more than 30,000 lives, including those of
civilians and soldiers on both sides, and uprooted tens of
thousands of the Chechen people.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has admitted that the war is a handicap to his
re-election bid and is keen to make progress toward a settlement
before the June 16 Russian presidential election.

<HEADLINE> Engineer Suspended After Light Tower Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Board of Registration for
Professional Engineers of Georgia State had suspended the engineer
who who designed a light tower in Atlanta's Olympic stadium which
collapsed and killed a construction worker.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the organization said Brian Miraki would be
suspended for three years and then put on probation for three
years.
</P>
<P>
Metal worker Jack Falls was killed after falling from the
light tower in March last year. A probe established that the
accident was the result of a design fault.
</P>
<P>
The accident prompted a safety review, which revealed
extensive faults in the steel skeleton of the 230 million
U.S. dollar stadium which will host the athletics events and the
opening and closing ceremonies of next month's Centennial
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The faults have since been rectified but the stadium designers
and the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) are locked
in a legal battle over who is responsible for the six million
U.S. dollar bill.

<HEADLINE> WB likely to Finance 2nd Phase of Chinese Agricultural Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is likely to
invest in the second phase of an agricultural project it has
financed in east China's Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the Jiehu Project, which covers the Jietai
Basin and Boyanghu Plain in Jiangxi, was designed to promote the
development of the area's animal husbandry, fishing, forestry, and
the farm produce processing industry.
</P>
<P>
The phase, costing 450 million yuan (about 53.6 million US
dollars), was launched in May 1990 and completed last December.
</P>
<P>
A delegation from the World Bank recently evaluated the
project, and called it "very satisfactory."
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the agricultural project is expected to
cost 1.68 billion yuan in total investment, including 100 million
US dollars in planned World Bank loans. It will focus on the
processing of grain, pigs, fish, timber, fruit and farm produce.
</P>
<P>
Initial estimates show that the second phase could help raise
annual grain output by 100,000 tons, and fruit by 160,000 tons. In
another analysis, annual economic benefits from the second phase
could reach 2.081 billion yuan in output value, 354 million yuan
in profits and 104 million yuan in taxes.
</P>
<P>
The second phase could produce a "significant impact on the
provincial economy of Jiangxi and would help lift three million
people out of poverty," said Yuan Jinmu, an official with the
province's office that oversees foreign investment in the
agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
If all goes as planned, the Jiehu Project will be China's first
agricultural project with both phases financed by the World Bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Efforts are being made to help the
thousands of jobless workers in Xi'an city of northwest China's
Shaanxi province, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
A labor fair which closed over the weekend helped more than
1,500 former workers from State-owned or collective enterprises
find new jobs, according to the sponsors, the Xi'an Labor Service
Center.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the city government carried out a
re-employment project to help 150,000 unemployed people.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an, which has a large number of State-owned large
enterprises, has faced many problems since the market economy was
implemented. By the end of last year, more than 150,000 workers
had lost their jobs and were facing difficulties in everyday life.
</P>
<P>
The city government has adopted measures to ensure them a
living, including investing over 6 million yuan in helping those
worst off.
</P>
<P>
The city government also paid special attention to 40,000
unemployed women workers. In March, a special labor fair for women
helped 1,064 find jobs in 61 firms.

<HEADLINE> Russia Not to Soften Stance on NATO Expansion: Primakov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Evgeny
Primakov said that his country may consider agreeing on the
formation of a multinational force with NATO but it will not
soften its stance toward NATO eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
In an article to be carried by the Komsomolskaya Pravda Tuesday
and reported by the Itar-Tass News Agency today, Primakov said
Russia will not allow NATO military facilities to move closer
toward the Russian border.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia is taking this uncompromising stand not because
of the pending presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
"We know that NATO is a realistic force we have to deal with,"
the Russian foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his country does not have the veto right in the
domestic affairs of other countries nor does it plan to drive its
tanks into east European countries.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that when efforts fail to reach an agreement
about NATO enlargement, the fallout will be shown in Russia's
military buildup and its approach toward disarmament accords as
well as the geopolitical integration among countries of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, all being former Soviet
republics.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that more and more Westerners have
realized that expanding eastward without coordination with Russia
will turn out to be costly.

<HEADLINE> 25 Tons of Marijuana Destroyed in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian anti-drug
police announced today the confiscation and destruction of 25
tons of pressed marijuana in the southwestern department of Cauca
from where it was going to be shipped to Europe.
</P>
<P>
The drugs which were worth 125 million dollars were found last
Sunday during a raid on a warehouse, police chief Col. Leonardo
Gallego said.
</P>
<P>
A few days ago the police seized a 20-ton shipment of
marijuana hidden in a container in the port city of Buenaventura,
also in the department of Cauca.
</P>
<P>
Gallego said that, in face of the growing confiscations of
marijuana in the department of Cauca, the police have intensified
its operations in the zone and have begun a study to detect and
destroy the illegal crops.
</P>
<P>
The official revealed that the police also carried out a
special search and control operation last Friday in the Gulf of
Uraba to combat the trafficking of drugs on the Panamanian border.
</P>
<P>
"We destroyed four secret airstrips that were being used by
drug dealers to send drugs to Panama and we carried out several
intelligence tasks to control the trafficking of chemical inputs"
in the zone, he added.

<P>
TAIYUAN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Shanxi province, China's leading
coal producer, is striving to develop rural economy and catch up
with the national average in terms of output value, local official
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Sun Wensheng, Shanxi's governor, said that the province is
expected to become self-sufficient in grain by the end of this
century, with farmers' net income reaching 2,500 yuan per capita.
The annual income of 3.8 million people, still under the poverty
line at present, will be at least 1,000 yuan per capita by the
year 2,000.
</P>
<P>
To accomplish this, the province will encourage more use of
agro-techniques and focus on grain production, while supporting a
diversified economy.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi, which has limited water resources, will introduce
water-saving irrigation technology in the rural areas, cultivate
more dry land crops, diversify water from rivers to irrigate
farmland, and plant more trees.

The Ministry of Personnel also announced on Saturday civil
servants who are related may not work under the same boss in a
government office, the English language newspaper China Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
When two civil servants related to each other work in the same
office, the one with the least seniority will be transferred in
accordance with the regulations, it said.
</P>
<P>
If related employees are at the same level, their superior will
decide who should be moved, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for the Ministry of Personnel said all civil
servants must abide by these regulations, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
But, different regions and departments are authorized to lay
down workable implementation measures according to their
particular situations.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations also forbid civil servants from holding
supervisory, personnel or financial positions in any government
organization where a relative has a high-level position.
</P>
<P>
The forbidden activities include supervision, auditing, trials,
arbitration, taxation, project approval, foreign visit approval,
work evaluation, promotions and removals, rewards and punishments,
appointments and transfers, the paper explained.
</P>
<P>
When relatives suddenly find themselves working together, which
may happen as a result of a marriage or a job transfer, the
regulation also says the situation must be corrected in a timely
manner.
</P>
<P>
The personnel departments of governments at all levels are
responsible for the implementation of the regulations, which took
effect on Saturday, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Used PCs Find Market in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Trading in used personal
computers in the United States has kept on expanding and consumers
purchased 2.4 million used computers in 1995, about 50 percent
more than those in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Gartner Group, a computer industry research firm, predicted
that about 25 million obsolete PCs will be ready for disposal or
dismantlement this year.
</P>
<P>
The trading volume of used PCs is estimated to stand at more
than 2 billion U.S. dollars a year, which is on the up-going
trend.
</P>
<P>
Many parents said that they could not afford buying their
children a brand new PC with a Pentium central processing unit
(CPU), which could cost 2,000 U.S. dollars. But they can purchase
a used model with a 486 chip for less than 700 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Computer experts said that despite the enormous technical
advances that have been made in personal computers, older machines
continue in operation and need spare parts to keep functioning.
</P>
<P>
Managers from Micro Exchange, a thriving company in the used
computer business, said that there are a lot of people with old
computers to sell, but without anyone to sell to. Some people have
no idea of what the machines are actually worth.
</P>
<P>
Some manufacturers like Packard Bell get a sizable number of
their products returned, often from novice buyers who lack skill
to get them running, even though there is no mechanical fault.
</P>
<P>
Although hardly used, the machines cannot be sold as new, and
are auctioned to companies.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of older computers come from companies that are
upgrading their equipment. American Airlines, for example, sold
20,000 old PCs last year and has sold another 5,500 so far this
year, according to a report of the Wall Street Journal today.
</P>
<P>
For some old computer owners, they thought their computer is
more valuable than it is. This also makes it difficult for used
computers to get into the market. In fact, six months after a
manufacturer stops making a particular model, used computer
dealers will buy it for about only half its original price,
according to market analysts.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the country also sell some of the old
computers overseas. The Boston Computer Exchange said it sold
42,000 computers last year, 60 percent to foreign buyers.

<HEADLINE> Scotland Draws Netherlands 0-0 in Euro Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Scotland, which is commonly
regarded an outsider of the Euro '96, upset all the odds by
battling to a goalless draw against giant the Netherlands in a
group A match held at Villa Park Stadium in Birmingham earlier
today.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands, champion of the 1988 European Soccer
Chammpionship, started the match with a thrilling shot by Clarence
Seedorf at the opening minutes and dominated the first half of
the match.
</P>
<P>
However, Scotland also launched some effective counterattacks
and a free-kick from Scotland captain Gary McAllister made the
orange-shirts army shocked.
</P>
<P>
The second half started with waves of attacks from the the
Dutch side, but Scotland, encouraged by its great number of
supporters, held off firmly amid fierce pressure from their
opponents.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the match, Scotland coach Craig Brown paid
tribute to his team, "I think we fought very well. We realise that
we are not perhaps as gifted as the Dutch team but we matched them
with a fighting performance."
</P>
<P>
"We had a bit of luck but you have to give credit to our
defence and Andy Goram made a very good early save. I am sure
under different circumstances Holland would have scored goals and
I would keep them as second favourites," Brown said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Guus Hiddink, the Dutch head coach, complained that
his team should have had a seventh-minute penalty after John
Collins of Scotland handled.
</P>
<P>
"It was a handball but the referee was in a very bad position
to see it and it was a 0-0 draw but it was much better than the
opening match," Hiddink said.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch coach noted that "it was a pity in the end that we
didn't score. But playing like that, we are making a mark for the
level of football in the tournament."
</P>
<P>
In a group B match between France and Romania this evening, the
French team, also a hot candidate to win the Euro Soccer thorphy,
gained an upper hand and defeated the Romanians 1-0.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian team, led by well-known magic Gheorghe Hagi,
displayed excellent performances in the first half, but the good
situation was singlehandedly lost by Romanian goalkeeper Bogdan
Stelea at the 24th minute when Stelea carelessly rushed out to
save a goal, which is eventually headed into the net by Christophe
Dugarry.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchmend totally controlled nearly all the pitch at the
second half when the Romanian aged international star Hagi became
nearly exhausted and failed to produce any threatening attacks.
</P>
<P>
Romaninian coach Anghel Iordanescu blamed the goalkeeper Stelea
for the 0-1 defeat against France, saying "the goalkeeper must
carry a considerable amount of faulf for the goal. It is
difficult to get back after conceding such a soft goal and it was
a bad psychological blow for us.
</P>
<P>
French coach Aime Jacquet said, "I was really impressed with
Romania at the beginning but as the match wore on I got confidence
in our team."

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Entity Leaders Meet on Delimitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the two Bosnian
entities -- the Muslim-Croat federation and Republika Srpska --
met in the Serb stronghold of Pale today to discuss mutual
relations, delimitation and prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The talks also dealt with the upcoming elections in Bosnia,
slated for mid-September, the Tanjug news agency reported. The
exact date of the elections will possibly be set at the upcoming
European Union foreign ministers conference in Florence on June
13-14.
</P>
<P>
Republika Srpska was represented by Vice-President Nikola
Koljevic and parliament speaker Momcilo Krajisnik, while the other
side was represented by federation President Kresimir Zubak.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Krajisnik said important information had
been exchanged and the central topic had been delimitation between
the two entities, especially in areas populated by Serbs and
Croats.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement, Bosnia is preserved to be a single
state with two entities which have an almost equal division of
land in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the proposals had come from the field and had had
to be discussed. An answer would be known next week, he added but
did not specify what proposals had been made and for what
territories.
</P>
<P>
Zubak, for his part, confirmed the subjects of discussion and
stressed that the two sides had examined relations between
Republika Srpska and the federation, and the problem of prisoners
of war.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton agreement stipulates that the prisoners of war must
be released by January 19 this year. But neither side has abided
by the accord and released all detainees, posing a threat to the
full implementation of the peace deal.

<HEADLINE> UK Economists Urge Higher House Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The British housing market should
see a marked improvement this year and next, with a higher number
of transactions pushing up prices, according to a report published
today.
</P>
<P>
Cambridge Econometrics forecasted that this year should see a
rise in housing transactions of 4.8 percent, reversing last year's
10 percent fall. Combined with economic growth and rising
employment, this activity should boost prices by 2 percent on
average, it said.
</P>
<P>
The recovery is likely to continue into next year although
there will be wide regional variations, economists predicted in
their report, Regional Housing Market Prospects.
</P>
<P>
Prices will rise most sharply, at more than 5 percent, in
Greater London and Northern Ireland, while East Anglian prices
should increase by 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, regions such as the Northwest, the Southwest and
the West Midlands will see weaker increases in the wake of last
year's inflation. Prices in the North will be static.
</P>
<P>
The report said that over the long term, the strongest housing
markets are likely to be the Southwest, Wales and East Anglia,
where there will be net inward migration.

<HEADLINE> US Urges Hezbollah to Stop Attacking Israeli Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States today urged
Hezbollah guerrillas to immediately stop attacking Israeli troops
in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We have...been watching the situation in southern Lebanon
quite carefully," U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns
said at press briefing here.
</P>
<P>
Burns told reporters that the Israeli Defense Forces "have
confirmed that five Israeli soldiers were killed" in the violence
early this morning in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that this incident "occurs while Israel's
in the process of forming a new government" and the U.S.
administration "very much would call upon Hezbollah to cease and
desist on its attacks on Israeli soldiers."
</P>
<P>
"An upsurge in violence only serves the interest of those who
reject the peace negotiations," Burns added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that as Bejamin Netanyahu is forming the new
Israeli government and developing a policy program, all "have to
be patient" and give the Israeli prime minister-elect an
opportunity to look at peace negotiations in the region and "put
his own imprint on them."

<HEADLINE> US Warns Arab Leaders Not to Take Hasty Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher today urged Arab leaders not to take any hasty action
that would be harmful to the fragile peace process in the Middle
East before a new Israeli government is formed.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's particularly important that they not close any
doors at the present time, that they not take any action that
would derail the peace process," Christopher told reporters after
meeting with visiting Australian Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came after Arab leaders decided to hold a summit
meeting in Cairo on June 20-23 for consultations to respond to the
victory of hardliner Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli elections
late last month.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said that he would issue the warning message to
Arab leaders in contacts before the scheduled Arab summit, the
first full one the Arabs have managed to arrange since 1990.
</P>
<P>
"In my comments to my Arab colleagues over the next week or 10
days, I'm going to emphasize the point that this is no time to be
closing any doors or take any action that would preclude a
relationship between the new Israeli government and the Arab
countries," the U.S. Secretary of State said.

<HEADLINE> UK Welfare to Faces Cash Crisis by Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain's welfare state will face a
financial crisis early in the next century unless reforms are
adopted, according to a report by a think-tank today.
</P>
<P>
The report, What's Wrong with the Welfare State?, by the Adam
Smith Institute, many of whose ideas are embraced by the British
government, calls on the existing system of state benefit
contributions to be replaced by privately-run savings schemes.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the future cost of state benefits is
"quite mind-boggling" and unsustainable. The pension bill alone
for those who have already retired will be 566 billion pounds (850
billion U.S. dollars) and for those in work a further 1,000
billion pounds (1,500 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
"With another 800 billion pounds (1,200 billion dollars) for
the cost of future National Health Service benefits, the
government's liabilities on health and pensions alone are well
over 2 trillion pounds (3 trillion dollars)," said the report.
</P>
<P>
The institute said that apart from problems of funding such a
vast outlay, the system fails in its aims. Only one quarter of the
100 billion pound (150 billion dollar) welfare budget goes on
relieving poverty and most of that "is spent so ineptly that it
actually traps people on benefit."
</P>
<P>
Despite a 40 percent rise in average pay since 1979, the
numbers eligible for benefit have doubled. Half the country now
lives in households claiming the main means-tested benefits.

<HEADLINE> US Insists Bosnia Elections Date To Be Set Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States today urged
an international conference scheduled to be held in Florence this
week to set a date for free elections in the war-torn former
Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The conference, sponsored by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, is aimed at reviewing the implementation of
the Bosnian peace agreement. Under the U.S.-brokered accord, free
elections should be held by September 14 to produce administrative
and legislative bodies in the Balkan nation.
</P>
<P>
Washington has been calling for earlier elections so that the
18,000-strong American peace implementation forces could pull out
of Bosnia before the end of this year as President Bill Clinton
had pledged to the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
But European officials have been arguing that conditions in
Bosnia put free and fair polls at risk.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the situation in Bosnia at a press briefing,
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns acknowledged that
"there may be issues" on which Americans and Europeans "diverge"
on Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
But he insisted that Washington believes elections should be
held in Bosnia in accordance with the Dayton peace treaty that
ended nearly four years of bloody conflicts in the Balkan nation.

NEW YORK, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Boeing spent more than 12 billion
U.S. dollars last year purchasing a wide range of parts, equipment
and services from more than 34,000 U.S. companies located in all
50 states and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
"These companies represent a wide spectrum of American
industries, including aluminum and steel producers, manufacturers
of sophisticated electronic equipment, textile mills that make
carpeting for our airplanes, construction companies, insurance
companies, utilities and thousands of small businesses from coast

officer.
</P>
<P>
Small businesses account for the vast majority of companies
that provide Boeing with parts and services, according to the
company.
</P>
<P>
Boeing, the world's leading producer of commercial airplanes,
traditionally records two-thirds of its airplane sales to
customers outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
Boeing also is a major manufacturer of defense systems and the
